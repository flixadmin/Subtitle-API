1
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:50,008
The legend of the ten rings
has been told for thousands of years.

2
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,431
Every generation,
the story grows.

3
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,394
But at its center,
there is always one man.

4
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:16,951
Some say he found the rings in a crater
or stole them from a tomb.

5
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,540
They gave him the strength of a god,

6
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,211
and the gift of eternal life.

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,387
He could have used them for good.

8
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,977
But all he wanted...

9
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,854
was power.

10
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,483
He called his army The Ten Rings.

11
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,824
Over the centuries, they spread
into every corner of the world.

12
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,959
They moved in the shadows...

13
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,380
Toppled governments...

14
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,968
And changed the course of history.

15
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,488
He chased money and power
for a thousand years.

16
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,451
But he still wanted more.

17
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,541
Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?

18
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,839
A hidden village with mythical creatures
and ancient magic.

19
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,969
Where people practice
a martial arts style from the gods.

20
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,013
I want to find it.

21
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,642
Of course. I'll send a scout
to explore the area,

22
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,436
and come back
with more information.

23
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,774
I want to go now.

24
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,340
The forest...

25
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,928
is moving.

26
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,837
He had nothing left
on Earth to conquer.

27
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,470
That's when he came for my home.

28
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,815
Where's the entrance to Ta Lo?

29
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,861
You're not welcome
in our village.

30
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,573
You don't know who
you're talking to.

31
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,825
I don't care who you are.

32
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,371
Turn around now,
and I won't have to hurt you.

33
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,340
Is that all?

34
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,315
That was the first time
I met your father.

35
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,822
He was the last person
I thought I'd fall for.

36
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,577
But love had other plans.

37
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,541
Shang-Chi,

38
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,503
there's much more to know
about the legend of the rings,

39
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,465
but you'll learn about that
when you're older.

40
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:33,346
If Dad's rings were so powerful,
how did you beat him?

41
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:41,854
Where I'm from, we are empowered
by the magic of the Great Protector.

42
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,195
When you have the heart
of our dragon,

43
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,406
you can do some amazing things.

44
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,868
Can you still do those things?

45
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,958
I left those powers in Ta Lo
with our dragon,

46
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,586
but what I got in return
is so much better.

47
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,842
I want you to have this.

48
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,846
Whenever you feel lost,

49
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,016
this will help you
find your way home.

50
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,269
Can you remember that?

51
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,456
Okay.

52
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,603
Hello, sir,

53
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,064
welcome to the Fairmont...

54
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,565
I'm driving.

55
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,192
No, you're not... Katy.

56
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,235
Hey, hey, get back here.

57
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,362
Give me the key.

58
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,199
Please open the door.

59
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,826
-Oh, my God.

60
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,953
- Get out.
- You get in!

61
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,139
Look, if happens to this thing,

62
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,164
we're gonna be jobless

63
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,642
and in debt
for the rest of our lives.

64
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,751
Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna
happen to this car.

65
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,336
I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon.

66
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,671
I don't know who that is.

67
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,631
Most career wins
in all of NASCAR history?

68
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,299
Please get out of the car.

69
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,759
Shaun,

70
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,969
we've been friends
for 10 years, okay?

71
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,180
You know I'm not an idiot.

72
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,392
Please, get in. I'll go slow.

73
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,688
- Katy, watch the...

74
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,404
I knew Katy was trouble

75
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,887
the first day we met
in high school.

76
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,132
I was getting picked on a lot,

77
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,075
for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.

78
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,952
Plus, I had just moved
to the U.S.,

79
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,495
so I was struggling
with my English,

80
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,806
and I was on my way
to lunch one day

81
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,665
when this guy
who was like twice my size

82
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,809
yells at me from down the hall,

83
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,126
"What's up, Gangnam Style?"

84
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,753
So I yelled back,
"I'm not Korean, idiot."

85
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,838
And I turn the corner,

86
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,548
and I see this guy
drop his backpack,

87
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,035
he's getting
all up in his face...

88
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,069
And right before he was about
to throw the first punch,

89
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,928
Katy comes out of nowhere,

90
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,348
steps right between us
and starts screaming the lyrics

91
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,850
to Hotel California.

92
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,017
What?

93
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,384
It's the art of confusion.
Works great on stupid people.

94
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,479
And that's how we met.

95
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,207
Then I pulled him
into the parking lot...

96
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,357
At which point she revealed

97
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,735
that she had also swiped
the keys to the guy's Mustang.

98
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,987
Yeah, we went on a little
joyride around the block.

99
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,530
And your wife
was in the car, too.

100
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,323
- That's true. You were.
- What?

101
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,825
I was just in the back seat.

102
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
That's a part of the car.

103
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,137
That's still a part of the car.

104
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,787
How have you
never told me this story?

105
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,181
You know,
before she was a lawyer,

106
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,457
your girl was pretty wild.

107
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,292
Oh! What happened?

108
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,295
I grew up.

109
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,088
What's that supposed to mean?

110
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,232
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

111
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,924
That maybe there's a point

112
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,968
where you're supposed
to stop going on joyrides

113
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,554
and start thinking about
living up to your potential.

114
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,222
Please tell me
you're kidding, Soo.

115
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,390
Look,

116
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,679
we're now living in a world

117
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,726
where at any moment

118
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,561
half the population
can just disappear.

119
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,564
Life's too short
and too fragile.

120
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,316
Katy, you're a valet driver

121
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,859
with an honors degree
from Berkeley,

122
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,278
and Shaun can speak,
like, four languages.

123
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,445
You've always been the most
talented people I know.

124
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,616
I just don't get why
you're scared

125
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,576
to actually use it
for something serious.

126
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
Wow.

127
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,873
You sound like my mom.
You also...

128
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,374
dress like her
a little bit, too.

129
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,502
Where's this from, Talbots?

130
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,504
We're not running
from adulthood.

131
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,964
How is it running to have jobs
that you actually like?

132
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,651
Yeah, that doesn't
even make any sense.

133
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,093
Did you think
valet parking is easy?

134
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,179
It's like the most
challenging job ever.

135
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,515
You need people skills,
driving skills...

136
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,225
Soo can't even parallel park.

137
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,564
Well, it's almost midnight.
We got the early shift.

138
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,734
Should probably be
responsible, go to sleep.

139
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,621
Yeah, we can be responsible.
We can do that.

140
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,238
Or...

141
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,116
Over, sideways and under on a...

142
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,494
Take my horse
to the old town road

143
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,578
I'm gonna.

144
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,789
Close my eyes.

145
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,624
I don't wanna...

146
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,659
Morning, Mrs. Chen.

147
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,952
She's not ready yet.

148
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,787
Come have some joe
while you wait.

149
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,416
Katy, Shaun's here.

150
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,334
Yeah, Mom, be there in a minute.

151
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,419
Ruihua,

152
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,005
you're supposed to be helping
your dad stock the shop.

153
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,341
Mom, I can't work on an empty
stomach, my legs get crampy.

154
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,885
Maybe Shaun can help him

155
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,178
instead of just showing up
every day to eat our food.

156
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,555
I'm happy to help.

157
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,433
No, it's Ruihua's job,
let him do it.

158
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,143
Waipo.

159
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,937
That seat's for Waigong.

160
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,106
Oh, sorry.

161
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:04,612
He's getting all his favorite things
this year for the Day of the Dead.

162
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,423
Are you sure
that Waigong's allowed to take.

163
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,448
Funyuns and cigarettes

164
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,741
back to the afterlife?

165
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,576
He can take anything.

166
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,747
Last year I put a bottle of whiskey
on his grave...

167
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,832
And it was gone the next morning.

168
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,420
I know you kids think it's silly.

169
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,297
We don't think
it's silly, Waipo.

170
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,966
We just know Waigong would've
wanted you to move on

171
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,134
and enjoy your life.

172
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,428
"Moving on" is an American idea.

173
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,764
You're American, Mom!
Don't forget.

174
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,349
Shaun,

175
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,685
did my daughter apply
to any new jobs this week?

176
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,604
She really likes her job.

177
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,855
We both do.

178
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
Mm-hmm.

179
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,816
Waigong didn't move here
from Hunan

180
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,526
so you could park cars
for a living.

181
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,571
Well, on that note,

182
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,114
I think we're gonna
miss our bus.

183
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,240
Mm.

184
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,076
I'm sorry
for my unacceptable job.

185
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,595
And for staying out late
last night,

186
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,162
trying to enjoy my life.

187
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,498
But one day, I'll make you
proud, I promise.

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,041
I'm proud of you, sis.

189
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,669
Parking cars is super hard.

190
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,878
Thanks, bro.

191
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,272
Maybe one day you'll pass
your driver's test,

192
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,297
live the dream like me.

193
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,465
Come on, Shaun, let's go.

194
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,887
When are you two going
to get married?

195
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,263
Waipo, we're just friends.

196
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,101
All right. Go, go, go.

197
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,944
Look. Look at that.
Look at that girl.

198
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,029
She's writing a research paper
on a bus.

199
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,531
So?

200
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,032
That is exactly the daughter

201
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,867
my mom wishes
came out of her vagina.

202
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,579
I'm sorry about her.

203
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,165
How's it goin'?

204
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,505
Give me the pendant,

205
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,799
and no one gets hurt.

206
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,968
Do you know this guy?

207
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,188
I don't know what
you're talking about, dude.

208
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,808
- Hey! Get off of me!
- Whoa.

209
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
What is wrong with you, asshole?

210
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,229
I don't want any trouble.

211
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,148
Then give us the pendant!

212
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,983
You have the wrong guy!

213
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,401
Does he look like he can fight?

214
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,371
You okay?

215
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,930
Yo, what up, y'all?
It's your boy Klev,

216
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,766
comin' at you live on the bus.

217
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,225
I actually did take

218
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,144
a little bit of martial arts
as a youth,

219
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,105
so I'm gonna try and grade
this fight as we're goin'.

220
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,496
Holy shit.

221
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,123
Who are you?

222
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,014
You got this, bro!

223
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,977
My bad.

224
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,629
No, no, no!

225
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,215
Sorry.

226
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,093
What the hell's going on?

227
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,658
You really wanna talk
about this now?

228
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,019
Bus driver is down.

229
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,354
I'm not gonna handle this.

230
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,773
Every time I've tried to drive
a bus, I get yelled at.

231
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,044
Go, you freak!

232
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,681
Open the door, please!

233
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,103
The back is about to go.

234
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,314
On my signal, make a hard right.

235
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,482
What signal?

236
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,388
Everybody to the front now!

237
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,099
Go! Go, go, go.

238
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,055
What's up, y'all? What's up,
y'all? What's up, y'all?

239
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,615
You and your sister
deserve what's coming.

240
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,058
Hold on, everybody!

241
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,310
Oh, God.

242
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,445
Oh, my God!

243
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,959
Sorry. Heh.

244
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,086
We make a good team.

245
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,868
Shaun. Hey.

246
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,621
You need to tell me
what the hell's going on.

247
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,373
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

248
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,208
- Macau.
- Macau?

249
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,643
Those guys are going
after my sister next,

250
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,907
and I have to get to her first.

251
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,879
You have a sister?

252
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,106
Look, I know this is confusing.

253
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,441
I'll explain it
when I get back, I promise.

254
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,466
No, no.

255
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,634
Hell no, dude.

256
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,968
This is bullshit!

257
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,471
I have been by your side
for half your life.

258
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,699
I get there are things you
never wanted to talk about,

259
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,183
and I never wanted to push.

260
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,353
But a guy with a freaking
machete for an arm

261
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,438
just chopped
our bus in half, Shaun!

262
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,232
Who the hell are you?

263
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,992
My sister sent me this
a few months ago.

264
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,328
I think it's the address
of where she's staying.

265
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:39,084
Those guys back there
were sent by my dad.

266
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,252
What?

267
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,629
If they hurt her...

268
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,428
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

269
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,058
Fine.

270
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,643
You can explain on the plane.

271
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,145
What?
No, Katy, you can't just...

272
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,021
You can explain
on the plane, Shaun!

273
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,130
After my mom died...

274
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,091
my dad started my training.

275
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,027
From sunup to sundown,

276
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,613
I was taught every possible
way to kill a man.

277
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,747
By the time I was 14,

278
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,831
I could barely remember

279
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,375
what life was like
before she died.

280
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,003
That's how old I was

281
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,964
when he sent me
on my first assignment.

282
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,802
I was willing to do
anything he wanted.

283
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,905
If he asked me
to burn the world down,

284
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:56,930
I would've asked him...

285
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,098
Beef or vegetarian?

286
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,702
We're all out of the chicken,

287
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,979
so I can only offer you
beef or vegetarian?

288
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,647
Um...

289
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,149
- Vegetarian would be great.
- Yeah, same.

290
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,317
- Okay.
- Thank you.

291
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,528
So...

292
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,072
Oh, we're out
of the vegetarian too.

293
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,865
Now we only have beef.

294
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,952
Beef. 'Cause that's all
you have, right?

295
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,388
- Okay, you'll have the beef.
- Yes.

296
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,413
- And...
- Beef.

297
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,456
- And the beef.
- Two beefs.

298
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,922
Did you go through with it?

299
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,974
I knew that I couldn't
go back to him, so I just...

300
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,060
ran.

301
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,359
I know this is a lot
to dump on you.

302
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,949
I'm sorry about your mom.

303
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,832
I should also probably mention

304
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,793
that my name's
not technically Shaun.

305
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,171
What?

306
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,214
What is it?

307
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,092
It's Shang-Chi.

308
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,802
Shaun-Chi.

309
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,346
No. Shang-Chi.

310
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,889
Shaun-Chi.

311
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,515
Shang.

312
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,683
- Shaun.
- Shang.

313
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,226
Shan.

314
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,395
S-H-A-N-G. Shang.

315
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,356
Shang?

316
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,523
Yeah.

317
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,902
You changed your name
from Shang to Shaun?

318
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,945
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

319
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,614
I wonder how
your father found you.

320
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,199
Okay, I was 15 years old.
All right?

321
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,242
What is your name change logic?

322
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,452
You're going into hiding.

323
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,979
- Okay.
- And your name is Michael,

324
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,872
you go on
and change it to Mishael.

325
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,083
That's not what happened.

326
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,477
It's like, "Hi, my name's Gina."

327
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,461
"I'm gonna go into hiding.
My new name's Gina."

328
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,668
Can't hear you. I'm sorry.

329
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,297
Yeah, okay.
Oh, yeah, you can hear me.

330
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,925
Sign here to get in.

331
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,306
I'm looking for my sister,
Xu Xialing.

332
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,642
Have you heard of her?

333
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,604
This is the address she gave me.

334
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,193
Okay.

335
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,363
Seems like a nice fella.

336
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,365
And this elevator
is definitely up to code.

337
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,759
There's absolutely no chance
of it just falling off

338
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,863
the side of the building...

339
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,622
Bus Boy!

340
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,499
Uh...

341
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,044
Two million views
in three days, bro!

342
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,212
Damn, dude.

343
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,630
Oh, no.

344
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,717
And you're the driver!

345
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,345
Oh, my Chinese sucks.

346
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,680
Oh, all good.

347
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,390
- I speak A-B-C.
- Oh, great.

348
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,933
- I'm Jon Jon.
- Jon Jon.

349
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,103
Welcome
to the Golden Daggers Club.

350
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,773
Okay,
let's get you ready to fight.

351
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,024
Wait. What?

352
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,693
We're a multi-platform
global operation.

353
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,987
Every fight livestreamed
on the dark web.

354
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,656
Thousands of viewers
placing bets as we speak.

355
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,034
This is gonna take your brand
to a whole new level.

356
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,803
Think there's been
some sort of confusion.

357
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,078
I like your spike face.

358
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,163
Thanks!

359
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,974
Usually, you gotta
fight your way to center ring,

360
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,041
but a viral star like you?

361
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,209
Front of line, baby.

362
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,794
I'm not here
to fight anybody. Okay?

363
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,482
I'm looking
for my sister, Xu Xialing.

364
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,964
Never heard of her.

365
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,925
We just lost a fighter
at the last minute,

366
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,968
so you get the next slot.

367
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,101
Nice one, Helen.

368
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,729
Is he gonna be
fighting in one of these?

369
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,899
Oh, no, no, no. These are
like low-level fights.

370
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,320
You're gonna be
fighting up there.

371
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,627
That hurt, Emil.

372
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,754
You want me to show you
how it feels?

373
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,641
Wong! Wong! Wong!

374
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,477
Wong! Wong! Wong!

375
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,145
Go, Wong!

376
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,772
I always bet on Asian.

377
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,399
Oh, my God.

378
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,359
Yeah, look, I'm not
going up there, okay?

379
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,837
- I'm just trying to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

380
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,963
It's too late to back out now.

381
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,655
- You already committed, bro.
- What?

382
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,782
You signed
the contract, remember?

383
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,284
Your name's on the roster.

384
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,202
The bets are piling in.

385
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,413
- Really? What's our cut?
- Oh, it's huge.

386
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,581
It doesn't matter.

387
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,832
It matters.

388
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,710
Dude, I saw you
fight five assassins

389
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,753
and a giant Romanian
with a razor for an arm

390
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,213
on a moving bus.

391
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,590
This is just one guy.

392
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,217
Just do it.
Then we all get paid,

393
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,304
and then I'll help you find
whoever you're looking for.

394
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,972
Come on. You got this.

395
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,432
- You got this.
- Don't be nervous.

396
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,600
Thank you.

397
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,767
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

398
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,027
How's the jaw?

399
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,156
Maybe you'll start
controlling those punches

400
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,574
like we practiced?

401
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,414
Love that guy.

402
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,542
Now take your shirt off.

403
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,836
Ladies and gentlemen,

404
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,255
the fight we've all
been waiting for.

405
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,133
The incredible viral sensation,

406
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,262
all the way
from San Francisco, USA,

407
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,682
it's Bus Boy!

408
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,480
What happened to your shirt?

409
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,570
And his opponent for tonight,

410
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,157
it's Macau's
own fearsome killer...

411
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,455
Xu Xialing!

412
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,503
Sister.

413
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,589
Wait, wait!

414
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,801
What are you doing?

415
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,559
I know you're upset.

416
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,228
But can you hear me out?

417
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,984
We don't have time for this.

418
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,577
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

419
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,586
Can you please stop hitting me?

420
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,933
Stop it! I'm trying to help you!

421
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,728
Dad's coming for you.

422
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,650
I'm not fighting you.

423
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,903
You shouldn't have come back.

424
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,329
Sometimes when I'm doing my forms...

425
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,624
I close my eyes,

426
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,795
and it's like I can feel her.

427
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,882
Do you ever feel like that?

428
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,719
No.

429
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,892
I know
what you're going there to do.

430
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,853
I don't know what
he's telling you, but Mom...

431
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,646
Mom's dead.

432
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,536
Please don't leave me here.

433
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,630
I'll be back in three days.

434
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,863
Xu Xialing, you're amazing!

435
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,698
We love you, Xu Xialing! Whoo!

436
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,467
You run this place?

437
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,011
I own it.

438
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,766
Where'd you get all that money?

439
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,435
Did you bet against me?

440
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,187
No.

441
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,107
Hi, Xialing. I'm Katy.

442
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,525
You're, like, such a badass.

443
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,002
Everything that you do is,
like, so cool.

444
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,194
That was really cool.

445
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,821
I like your pants.

446
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,823
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

447
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,742
What do you want?

448
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,162
The Ten Rings ambushed us
in San Francisco.

449
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,496
I saw the video.

450
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,039
They took my pendant.

451
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,750
They're gonna come
for yours next.

452
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,985
I don't know
what he wants with them,

453
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,506
but we both know
it can't be good.

454
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,804
You know what he said to me
when he left?

455
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,266
"I'll be back in three days."

456
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,768
And after three days,

457
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,021
I went to our mom's shrine
and waited.

458
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,400
Three days turned into a week,

459
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,611
a week turned to a month,

460
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,946
and a month turned to six years.

461
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,870
That's how long
it took me to realize

462
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,663
I didn't need him anymore.

463
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,710
I built this place on my own.

464
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,839
I didn't need you then,
and I don't need you now.

465
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,551
Then why would you
send me the postcard?

466
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,386
What postcard?

467
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,063
I didn't send you this.

468
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,780
Is there a back exit?

469
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,365
Shaun.

470
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,993
Hey. Hey! Hey, open up!

471
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,874
She's gone, dude.

472
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,642
What do we do?

473
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,227
What do we do?

474
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,561
Uh...

475
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,111
Come on!

476
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,201
Oh, hell no. Screw you!
I'm not doing this.

477
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,428
If we make it to the elevator,

478
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,732
we can hop in on the next floor.

479
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,999
Katy, we're out of options.
We have to go now.

480
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,212
One, two, three.

481
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,465
Whoa.

482
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,408
Just head
straight for that elevator.

483
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,555
You got this.

484
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,027
I'll buy you some time.
Just keep going.

485
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,454
On a dark desert highway.

486
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,123
Cool wind in my hair.

487
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,258
Shaun!

488
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,514
Shaun! Shaun!

489
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,727
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

490
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,775
I'm coming!

491
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,281
Shaun!

492
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,617
Hang on.

493
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,122
Gotcha.

494
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,623
Shaun!

495
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,668
Katy!

496
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,569
You left us for dead!

497
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,614
Now you know how it feels.

498
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,324
What does
he want with the pendant...

499
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,726
Did America make you soft?

500
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,117
He has the pendant!

501
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,202
I told my men

502
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,622
they wouldn't be able
to kill you if they tried.

503
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,333
Glad I was right.

504
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,675
I've missed you, my son.

505
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,347
Let's go home.

506
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,532
My son is home.

507
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,580
Take the girls to their room.

508
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,885
I've seen some really
scary stuff this week,

509
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,055
but your dad's on,
like, a whole 'nother level.

510
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,475
Is he gonna kill us?

511
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,397
Just nod. Don't talk.
He'll forget you're there.

512
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,816
That's how I survived.

513
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,819
He always treat you like that?

514
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,906
Only after my mom died.

515
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:07,287
He said he couldn't look at me
because I reminded him of her.

516
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,083
I wasn't allowed to train
with the boys.

517
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,128
But I watched
everything they did

518
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,255
and taught myself
to do it better.

519
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,967
When did you leave?

520
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,386
I ran away when I was 16.

521
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,431
As soon as I knew
my brother wasn't coming back.

522
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,351
You started an underground
fight ring in Macau

523
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,729
when you were 16 years old?

524
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,150
If my dad won't let me
into his empire,

525
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,693
I'm gonna build my own.

526
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,320
Hell yeah.

527
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,681
Shang-Chi.

528
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,102
That's enough.

529
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,861
Have you been
practicing your English?

530
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,156
Yes.

531
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,828
You have to strengthen your
mind along with your body.

532
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,755
If you want them
to be yours one day,

533
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,842
you have to show me you're
strong enough to carry them.

534
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,945
How did you find me?

535
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,989
I always know
where my children are.

536
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,784
I gave you 10 years
to live your life,

537
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,160
and where did it get you?

538
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:17,251
Now it's time for you
to take your place by my side.

539
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,587
That's not gonna happen.

540
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,717
American girl.

541
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,010
Her name is Katy.

542
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,972
What is your Chinese name?

543
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,269
Ruiwen.

544
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,480
Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

545
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,649
They connect us
not only to ourselves,

546
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,526
but to everyone who came before.

547
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,654
A funny story.

548
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,282
Some years ago,
a terrorist from America

549
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,783
needed a boogeyman

550
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,578
to bring your country
to its knees.

551
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,414
So, he appropriated
The Ten Rings.

552
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,498
My Ten Rings.

553
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,084
But because
he didn't know my actual name,

554
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,544
he invented a new one.

555
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,130
Do you know the name he chose?

556
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,508
The Mandarin.

557
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,636
He gave his figurehead
the name of a chicken dish.

558
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,471
And it worked.

559
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,432
America was terrified.

560
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,893
Of an orange.

561
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,979
The truth is,

562
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,024
I've had many names
throughout my life.

563
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,152
The Warrior King, Master Khan,

564
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,362
the most dangerous man on Earth.

565
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:31,742
For years, I thought that was
all I was meant to be.

566
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,456
But when I met their mother,

567
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,000
everything changed.

568
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,851
She showed me a part of myself
I didn't know was there.

569
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,482
It was like I was seeing
the world for the first time.

570
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,204
She gave up everything
so we could be together.

571
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,125
And so did I.

572
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,850
You know who's in there?

573
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,852
Say, "Hello, little sister!"

574
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,777
After all those years,

575
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,445
I finally found something

576
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,781
worth growing old for.

577
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,622
My real name is Wenwu.

578
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,042
She was the only one
who called me that.

579
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,504
And when she died...

580
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,051
I was lost for many years.

581
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,764
But I'm not lost anymore.

582
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,603
When you children ran away,

583
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,314
I was so desperate
to connect with your mother,

584
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,693
I threw myself back into
the studies of her village.

585
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,070
The legendary Ta Lo.

586
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,448
I wasn't able

587
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,783
to find the secret path
to the village entrance,

588
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,495
but I did find
what they are hiding.

589
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,582
There's a gate
deep in their mountains.

590
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,918
Your mother
is waiting for us there.

591
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,506
I know this is a lot.

592
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,552
I might not have believed it
if she didn't tell me herself.

593
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,013
What are you talking about?

594
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,599
I was sitting right here
in this seat,

595
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,060
deep in my research...

596
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,146
and she spoke to me.

597
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,691
It was like
she was standing in this room.

598
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,694
I could feel her breath
on my cheek

599
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,738
and her hand on my back.

600
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,533
She told me she needs my help.

601
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,495
To do what?

602
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,664
To save her from her people.

603
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,669
After we fell in love,

604
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,464
your mother wanted us
to live in Ta Lo.

605
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,633
She asked permission
from the elders,

606
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,884
and they refused.

607
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,261
They said I wasn't worthy.

608
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,389
She would still be with us.

609
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,101
We would all be
living there together.

610
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,603
Ta Lo did this to us.

611
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,024
They locked her behind
that gate to punish her.

612
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,696
Don't you see?

613
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,741
She's leaving clues for us.

614
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,368
She wants us to find her

615
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,287
and bring her home,
so we can be a family again.

616
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,833
Dad, Mom's gone.

617
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,128
She's not talking to you
from behind a gate,

618
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,505
and she's not leaving
any clues for us.

619
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,012
Then what are these?

620
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,021
The passage to Ta Lo
is guarded by a moving maze.

621
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,192
But there's a direct path
through the forest

622
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,360
that only opens once a year

623
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,446
on Qingming Jie.

624
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,949
To get through,
you need to know the route

625
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,410
and the exact time it opens.

626
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,458
Now I know both.

627
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,263
Three days from now,

628
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,807
we will rescue
my wife from her prison

629
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,100
and bring her home.

630
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,442
This is why you're here.

631
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,945
To help me bring her back to us.

632
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,822
And what happens if they don't
let you open the gate?

633
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,869
We'll burn the village
to the ground.

634
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,914
What?

635
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,919
You can't just march
into our mom's village

636
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,420
with this bullshit.

637
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,477
I mean, do you have
any idea how insane...

638
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,637
Hey!

639
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,059
Where are you taking me?

640
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,729
When will you stop pretending?

641
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,608
Lock them up.

642
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,423
It's okay, my dear.

643
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:12,517
We're all going to be
together soon.

644
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:25,905
So, um,
pretty confused right now,

645
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,617
because, uh, initially
I thought your dad should

646
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,745
definitely see a therapist
for his delusions,

647
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:35,540
but then that dragon
vomited a magical water map,

648
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,668
and now I have no idea
what's real.

649
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,423
Is what he said
about your mom's village true?

650
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,612
She used to tell us stories
about Ta Lo

651
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,637
when we were kids.

652
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,893
A village in another dimension
full of magical creatures.

653
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,978
I thought
it was just a fairy tale.

654
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,774
What if Dad's right?

655
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,961
About Mom being locked
behind a gate

656
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,945
by her own people?

657
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,365
Crazier things
have turned out to be true.

658
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,743
Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on,

659
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,329
but if we don't find a way
to get to Ta Lo before him,

660
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,915
he's gonna destroy everything
that's left of our family.

661
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,087
This family was destroyed
a long time ago.

662
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,051
The hell was that?

663
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,303
-Oh.

664
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,639
You're going toward that noise?

665
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,453
"Wake Duncan with thy knocking."

666
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,581
"Oh, I would'st though could'st."

667
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,291
"My deed 'twere best not..."

668
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,255
Oh, hello, loves.

669
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,841
What year is it?

670
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,718
Who are you?

671
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,012
Trevor? Slattery?

672
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,598
The actor from Liverpool?

673
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,517
Wait.

674
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,227
Are you the governor's kids?

675
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,521
I've been preparing a monologue

676
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,273
for your homecoming dinner.

677
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,316
Oh. Where's she going?

678
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,651
Why are you down here?

679
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,778
Well, some time ago,

680
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,405
I was offered
the role of a terrorist.

681
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,866
I know, facile, trite,
I couldn't agree more.

682
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,951
But times were lean,
you know what I mean?

683
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,871
Anyway, the producer told me
he worked for the BBC.

684
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,497
But, ironic twist,

685
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,167
it turns out he, in fact,
was a terrorist,

686
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,893
and I wasn't playing
a character at all,

687
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,295
but what I now recognize to be

688
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,338
a rather unflattering portrait
of your father.

689
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,507
We all got our just deserts.

690
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,551
The producer
got blown up by Iron Man,

691
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,303
and I served time
in federal prison,

692
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,306
which turned out
to be the best thing for me.

693
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,808
I got clean,
I rediscovered my passion.

694
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,561
- Then my dad broke you out?
- Exactly.

695
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,813
- To kill you.
- Exactly.

696
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,900
But just as his men

697
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,611
were tying me up
for my execution,

698
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,654
I launched into a performance
of my Macbeth.

699
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,364
"Whence is that knocking?
Wake Duncan"

700
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,009
"with thy knocking.
I would'st though could'st..."

701
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,273
They couldn't get enough of it.

702
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,786
I've been doing weekly gigs
for the lads ever since.

703
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,830
So you're like his jester?

704
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,677
I can give you a quick preview
if you like.

705
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,000
"Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle..."

706
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,461
Uh, thank you, Trevor.
I think we're okay.

707
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,564
Right now, we really just
need to find a way to...

708
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,006
-What the hell?

709
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,216
What the... Oh!

710
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,342
- Whoa!
- What is that?

711
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,053
What's what?

712
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,013
- That! What is that?
- That! That! That!

713
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,683
You can see Morris?

714
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,851
Morris?

715
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,604
Oh, Morris!

716
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,106
They can see you! You're real!

717
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,318
All this time I thought
I was hallucinating him.

718
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,986
Oh, this is such fab news.

719
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,072
Where's his face?

720
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,367
He's a bit sensitive about that.

721
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,203
-Oh. Really?

722
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,456
Morris says he knows
who you are.

723
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,500
It talks... It talks to you?

724
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,126
If he didn't talk to me,

725
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,045
I'd have gone mad yonks ago.

726
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,798
How would he know me?

727
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,801
He says he grew up
with your mum. In Ta Lo.

728
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,763
Apparently, your father picked
him up in some magic forest

729
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,641
on one of his expeditions
to find the entrance.

730
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,896
He wants you to take him home.

731
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,526
Believe me, buddy,
I would if I knew how.

732
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,236
According to my dad,

733
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,071
the path there
only opens once a year.

734
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,539
Morris says he can guide you
there right now.

735
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:45,915
You can get through the maze

736
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,584
without waiting
for the path to open.

737
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,752
But, and it's a big "but,"

738
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,963
it's very dangerous.

739
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,131
How dangerous?

740
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,216
No one's ever made it out alive.

741
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,177
But Morris is 90% confident

742
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,096
he can guide us through safely.

743
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,723
-Oh.

744
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,308
19%.

745
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,313
Look, I've done dumber things
with worse odds.

746
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,189
But even if
that chicken-pig is right...

747
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,597
we're still locked in your...

748
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,699
Whew!

749
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,953
How did you...

750
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,539
Dad has a tunnel system
under the whole compound.

751
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,458
That's how I escaped last time.

752
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,626
Oh.

753
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,753
This will take us
straight to the garage.

754
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,308
Oh, my God.

755
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,976
I kinda like this guy.

756
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,103
Just head up that ramp
and through the front gate.

757
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,271
Should be a straight shot.

758
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,065
Figure we got about
30 seconds until he...

759
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,232
Do you mind?

760
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,360
I get sick in the back. Carsick.

761
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,739
That's my car!

762
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,329
God damn it.

763
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,622
Hold on.

764
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,166
Is there another exit?

765
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,501
The other end of the garage.

766
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,169
But we need a fingerprint
to open it.

767
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,302
Incoming!

768
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,805
Shit!

769
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,161
What's happening back there?

770
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,580
Doing my best.

771
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,499
Scan hand print for gate access.

772
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,876
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying!

773
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,356
Scan hand print for gate access.

774
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,381
Shaun!

775
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,134
Access approved.

776
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,280
They will come back
once I bring her home.

777
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,867
Prepare the men for war.

778
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:27,910
Yes, sir.

779
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:36,419
The first time
I witnessed pure artistry.

780
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:40,548
1968. Planet of the Apes.

781
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,717
I was sitting in the cinema
next to my mum,

782
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,260
watching mastery

783
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,304
unfold before my very eyes.

784
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,598
After the film, I asked her,

785
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,184
"How did they get those
monkeys to do those things?"

786
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,145
And she patted me on the head
and she said,

787
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,190
"It's not real, pet.
It's just acting."

788
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,066
That's when I knew.

789
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,569
If they can teach those monkeys

790
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,571
to act that brilliantly,

791
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,492
just imagine what I could
bring to the world.

792
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,202
So you became an actor

793
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,287
because you thought
the monkeys were actually...

794
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,123
Riding horses? I did. Yes.

795
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,875
When, in fact,

796
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,045
they were simply acting
as if they were riding horses.

797
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,422
I still can't get my head
round it, to be honest.

798
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,258
Good for you, dude.

799
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,262
You found your passion
and went for it,

800
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,514
and eventually used it

801
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,641
to cripple the US government,
but whatever.

802
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,768
Yeah. No, yeah, thanks.

803
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,853
Um, this is really cool and all,

804
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,396
but how long
do we have to sit here?

805
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,023
Morris is very clear.

806
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,484
The way through
is all about timing.

807
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,694
Okay, but how long
are we talking?

808
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,571
Like, hours? Days?

809
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,366
Friends,
I am but a transitory vessel

810
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,889
for the infinite wisdom
of a creature

811
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,286
far more advanced than
we'll ever truly understand.

812
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,539
What he sees, what he feels

813
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,332
of this vast, unknown universe

814
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,417
is beyond anything
our simple brains can...

815
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,919
-Oh. You can go.

816
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,379
What?

817
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,256
Go. You can go. He says "go."

818
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,947
You should speed up.

819
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,615
What? Why?

820
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:32,994
Katy, go, go, go!

821
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,082
-Morris says,

822
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,042
- "Hard right on three."
- What?

823
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,210
Two...

824
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,295
Hard right where?

825
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,754
Now.

826
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,305
-And left.

827
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,311
It's all about staying
in the pocket.

828
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,146
- What pocket?
- We're in it now.

829
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,033
What happens if
we don't stay in the pocket?

830
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,149
The forest eats us.

831
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,775
Eats us? What does that mean?

832
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,485
He says it eats us. Go left.

833
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,746
- Watch your back!
- Stay in the pocket.

834
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,497
- How close is it?
- Five meters.

835
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,424
- Stay in the pocket.
- What is that in feet?

836
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,584
Really fricking close.

837
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,752
Stay in the pocket.

838
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,799
Will you just stop saying,
"Stay in the pocket"?

839
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,179
One last right,
then straight on to the end.

840
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,563
You might wanna hurry up.

841
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,565
What do you think I'm doing?

842
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,234
We're not gonna make it.

843
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:51,989
I'm coming home, Mummy.

844
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,254
Morris says,
"Great job, everyone."

845
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,550
Now, all we have to do
is go through that waterfall,

846
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,511
and we're pretty much there.

847
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,895
Bloody hell.

848
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,814
I think those birds are on fire.

849
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:09,275
-Really? Oh.

850
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,777
Morris says it's normal.

851
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,280
They're old mates of his.

852
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,191
That's a weird horse.

853
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,360
What's it looking at me for?

854
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,009
Hi there!

855
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,178
I am Xu Shang-Chi.

856
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,598
This is my sister, Xu Xialing.

857
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,309
We're Ying Li's children.

858
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:12,690
This is my friend, Katy.

859
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:16,485
Get in your car and go home!

860
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,155
Please. You don't understand.

861
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,494
Whoa.

862
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,996
Guang Bo!

863
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,541
What are you doing?

864
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,335
Put down your weapons!

865
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,965
Shang-Chi.

866
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,550
Xialing.

867
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:42,970
I'm your auntie, Nan.

868
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,433
I've waited so long to meet you.

869
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,736
You look like your mother.

870
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:07,703
Hi, I'm Katy.

871
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,288
Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy.

872
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,956
Oh, thank you.

873
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,256
Look who has found his way home!

874
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,175
I'm not a threat.

875
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,469
Just an entertainer.

876
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,221
Morris can vouch for me.

877
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,557
We don't have much time.

878
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,351
Our father is coming.

879
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:41,403
Our people have been
here for over 4,000 years,

880
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,365
preparing for something
we hope will never happen.

881
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:47,076
We are the keepers
of the Dark Gate,

882
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,620
sworn to protect this realm
and yours

883
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:52,289
from the evil
that's locked behind it.

884
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:55,334
Our dad is coming
here to open that gate.

885
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,878
He thinks
you're holding our mom there.

886
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,673
Why would he think that?

887
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,049
She told him.

888
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,260
He says he can hear her
asking for help.

889
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,681
Is he wearing the rings?

890
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,975
He hasn't
taken them off since she died.

891
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,520
What do they have to do
with all this?

892
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,526
The realm of Ta Lo
stretches far beyond

893
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,486
the shores of our small village.

894
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:26,323
We have cities that surpass
any in your universe,

895
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,201
rich with culture and history.

896
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,370
Thousands of years ago,

897
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,790
all of our people
lived in peace and prosperity,

898
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:39,003
until the attack
of the Dweller-in-Darkness.

899
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,046
He came with his army,

900
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,174
devouring every soul
in their path,

901
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:48,012
and with each kill,
they grew stronger.

902
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,223
After decimating
our largest cities,

903
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,810
they were headed to
your universe to do the same.

904
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,355
The leaders of Ta Lo sent
their strongest warriors here

905
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:01,734
to stop them from reaching
the portal to your world.

906
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,446
But our ancestors
were no match for them.

907
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,575
Until The Great Protector

908
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,245
joined their fight
and turned the tide.

909
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:16,957
Together, they pushed
the Dweller and his army

910
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,250
into the Dark Gate

911
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,878
and locked it behind them.

912
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,258
Our people have guarded
that gate ever since,

913
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,887
empowered by the magic
of The Great Protector

914
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,348
and the gift that she gave us.

915
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:44,985
Dragon scales.

916
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,820
Makes very good armor.

917
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:50,991
Your father isn't the first
to come here

918
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,326
to open the Dark Gate.

919
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,162
Many have tried and failed
over the centuries,

920
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,664
and they all had one thing
in common.

921
01:12:57,831 --> 01:12:58,832
They were lured here

922
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,043
by the voice of something
on the other side.

923
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:04,713
A voice that promised them
their greatest desires.

924
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:11,345
So you think soul eaters
are talking to our dad?

925
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:15,474
They know The Ten Rings have
the power to break them free.

926
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:20,813
Oh.

927
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,025
Here you go.

928
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:26,276
Oh.

929
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,278
To the range.

930
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,490
What? Okay.

931
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,910
Um, looks like I'm gonna go
deliver some dragon arrows.

932
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,596
Oh, you're gonna deliver
some dragon arrows?

933
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,980
Yeah.
Make myself useful, you know.

934
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,081
Thank you.

935
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,835
Let's go see your mother.

936
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:00,102
I just love how you guys know
exactly what you wanna do,

937
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,105
and you spend your whole life
getting really good at it.

938
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,857
I wish I was more like that.

939
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,223
It's like every time I get
moderately good at something,

940
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,528
I just quit
and start something new.

941
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,613
But I just know my own limits,

942
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,408
and I'm not gonna waste
my time chasing something

943
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,371
that will ultimately be
a disappointment for me.

944
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,453
That's not me.

945
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,996
Guang Bo.

946
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,582
Let her shoot.

947
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,630
If you aim at nothing,
you hit nothing.

948
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,739
You were everything to her.

949
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,868
She knew that one day
you would find your way here

950
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,787
and asked me to prepare
something for your arrival.

951
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,270
After losing someone like her,

952
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,981
it's easy to feel alone
in this world.

953
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,317
But you're not.

954
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,736
You are children of this family,

955
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,656
and I welcome you home.

956
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,143
You're not in your
father's house anymore.

957
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:11,024
In Ta Lo, we train as equals.

958
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:16,655
You've been in the shadows
long enough, my child.

959
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,259
Guang Bo, you saw that?

960
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,344
That was tight!

961
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,651
My mother was the only one
who could beat him.

962
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:58,030
Show me how she did it.

963
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,788
No, sorry.

964
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,540
Sorry. Offside, offside.

965
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,478
Your mother knew who she was.

966
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,397
Do you?

967
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,466
You are a product
of all who came before you.

968
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:27,262
The legacy of your family,
the good and the bad,

969
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:30,390
it is all a part of who you are.

970
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,855
Stop hiding, nephew.

971
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,733
It only prolongs the pain.

972
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,726
We'll be together soon.

973
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,150
Sir.

974
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,321
The men are ready.

975
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,157
The passage will open at dawn.

976
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:31,743
I'll prepare the vehicles.

977
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:57,853
Lead with your breath.

978
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:01,273
Look into your heart,

979
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,776
the light and the dark.

980
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:09,030
To know yourself,

981
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:13,118
you must face them both.

982
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,135
Your husband tried to destroy us.

983
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,388
The Iron Gang is here
to repay that debt.

984
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,932
My husband is not the man
he used to be.

985
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,101
It doesn't matter.

986
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:42,606
Your business with him has nothing
to do with my children.

987
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,402
They can go,

988
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:51,364
but someone has to pay.

989
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,871
Xialing. Shang-Chi.

990
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,039
Go inside.

991
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,958
I'm going to talk to our guests.

992
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:10,800
But you don't have your powers.

993
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:15,555
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

994
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:39,014
Mama.

995
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:42,809
Mama.

996
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:02,537
Papa.

997
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,883
She told me I could change.

998
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,637
That I could leave my past behind.

999
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,559
But she was wrong.

1000
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:30,398
If I hadn't taken them off,

1001
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:35,278
those men wouldn't have
dared to do this.

1002
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,492
And now they will pay for it.

1003
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:35,964
Where's your boss?

1004
01:25:36,422 --> 01:25:37,423
I don't know!

1005
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,425
I swear I don't!

1006
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,595
Okay.

1007
01:25:55,942 --> 01:26:00,697
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

1008
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:03,324
Will you help me?

1009
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:34,480
We found the man

1010
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:36,649
responsible for killing
your mother.

1011
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,945
It is your right
to finish this for both of us.

1012
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:43,698
And when you return,

1013
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:47,368
we will rebuild The Ten Rings
to what it once was.

1014
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,516
Been looking everywhere for ya.

1015
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:19,651
You okay?

1016
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:27,408
I'm not who you think I am.

1017
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,410
You already apologized
for that. We're good...

1018
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,537
That's not what
I'm talking about.

1019
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:35,041
Okay.

1020
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,419
What... What is it?

1021
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:48,846
When my dad sent me to find
the man who killed my mom...

1022
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:53,768
I told you
I couldn't go through with it.

1023
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:00,316
I lied.

1024
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,864
I thought that
I could change my name,

1025
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:09,951
start a new life, pretend like
it never happened.

1026
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,327
But...

1027
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,503
She would hate
the person I've become.

1028
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:29,429
Your dad trained you
to be an assassin

1029
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:31,431
when you were seven.

1030
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:35,768
He sent you on a hit at 14.

1031
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:40,106
You realize how messed up
that is, right?

1032
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,237
My mom is dead because of him.

1033
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:51,951
And now he's coming
to destroy her home.

1034
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,589
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

1035
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,260
What are you saying?

1036
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:15,016
I'm gonna do
what he trained me to do.

1037
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,565
I'm gonna kill him.

1038
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:11,030
He's here.

1039
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,377
No!

1040
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,711
You're not ready.

1041
01:30:25,878 --> 01:30:27,922
She stays here.

1042
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,227
Are you here to help the people

1043
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,771
holding your own mother captive?

1044
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,773
She isn't back there.

1045
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,150
You're being lied to

1046
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,402
by a creature
who wants to destroy us all.

1047
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,947
Is that what they told you?

1048
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:38,159
I know my wife's voice.

1049
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,912
I miss my sister
as much as you do,

1050
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:43,664
but this is not the way
to honor her memory.

1051
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,625
Did you honor her
when you turned her away

1052
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:46,709
from your gate?

1053
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:49,337
You fool. We turned you away.

1054
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,048
The sins of your past would have
destroyed this place.

1055
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:56,677
Be careful how you speak to me,
young man.

1056
01:31:57,094 --> 01:32:00,890
I've lived ten of your lifetimes.

1057
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:04,060
Let me pass.

1058
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:06,437
We cannot do that.

1059
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:26,582
Burn it down.

1060
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,647
Stop him!

1061
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:10,269
Are you planning to stop me
all by yourself?

1062
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,025
I'm not afraid of you.

1063
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:24,533
Yes, you are.

1064
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:33,584
You've spent
your entire life afraid.

1065
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,795
Always running,

1066
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:37,254
always hiding.

1067
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,647
You were there
when they came for her,

1068
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:56,982
and you did nothing.

1069
01:34:57,566 --> 01:35:00,444
You stood at a window
and watched her die!

1070
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:36,981
She was gone and we needed you.

1071
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:41,402
But you chose those damn rings
over us.

1072
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:46,991
You trained your son
to be a killer.

1073
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,326
Is this what you wanted?

1074
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,387
Even if you could
bring her back,

1075
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,808
what makes you think she'd
want anything to do with you?

1076
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:40,127
Save me.

1077
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,464
Save me, my dear.

1078
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:05,152
Save me.

1079
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:08,030
I'm coming, my love.

1080
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:50,823
He breached the gate!

1081
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:56,555
Those things
are gonna kill us all

1082
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,163
if we don't work together.

1083
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:00,374
You think
I'm going to fall for that?

1084
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,710
Your weapons are useless
against them.

1085
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:04,795
We don't need your help.

1086
01:38:05,337 --> 01:38:07,590
We are the mighty Ten Rings,

1087
01:38:07,673 --> 01:38:09,091
and any...

1088
01:38:33,782 --> 01:38:36,368
We... We should work together.

1089
01:38:36,535 --> 01:38:38,579
Release them.

1090
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:40,497
Release them!

1091
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:47,546
What are they doing?

1092
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:50,174
Stealing souls to
feed the Dweller-in-Darkness.

1093
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,675
If it grows strong enough,

1094
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,199
it will break
right through the gate.

1095
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,304
That was just the beginning.

1096
01:38:58,223 --> 01:38:59,516
It's too dangerous.

1097
01:38:59,683 --> 01:39:00,935
I have to help my friends.

1098
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:07,232
Don't die.

1099
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:11,070
Everyone to the water now!

1100
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:12,363
To the lake! Let's go!

1101
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:13,656
Let's go!

1102
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,826
Hey, where's your brother?

1103
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:19,703
I was hoping you knew.

1104
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:28,587
Save me.

1105
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:56,073
Aim at the sky, to win or die!

1106
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:11,588
Deep breath.

1107
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,732
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

1108
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:33,068
You have the heart
of our dragon.

1109
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:37,197
I will always be a part of you.
And your dad will too.

1110
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:41,952
Take everything we've given you
and make it your own.

1111
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:01,472
I'm so proud of you.

1112
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:08,228
Our family needs you.

1113
01:41:09,646 --> 01:41:10,647
Go.

1114
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:06,537
Draw.

1115
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:11,834
Fire!

1116
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:41,155
You have to stop your father!

1117
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,396
She's not back there, Dad.

1118
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:19,693
Get out of my way, boy.

1119
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:21,945
No.

1120
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:27,010
Calm down, mate.

1121
01:44:27,177 --> 01:44:28,657
I'm not dead,
it's just a performance.

1122
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,430
Now get down here
and play along.

1123
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:15,554
I have to save her.

1124
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:19,141
She's calling to me.

1125
01:47:22,644 --> 01:47:24,229
I wish that were true.

1126
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:28,733
Dad, please.

1127
01:47:31,278 --> 01:47:32,988
Your family needs you.

1128
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:43,874
Let me out!

1129
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:15,572
Shit.

1130
01:49:58,174 --> 01:49:59,467
It's headed for the village!

1131
01:51:49,411 --> 01:51:53,748
If it gets our dragon's soul,
it will be unstoppable!

1132
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:58,294
Aim for the throat!

1133
01:52:46,634 --> 01:52:48,428
You have to let me go.

1134
01:52:55,685 --> 01:52:57,228
Let go!

1135
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:00,899
I'm not leaving you again.

1136
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:20,460
Holy shit.

1137
01:53:52,617 --> 01:53:54,494
Go.

1138
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:03,665
Tonight,

1139
01:56:03,748 --> 01:56:05,500
we honor those
who gave their lives

1140
01:56:05,583 --> 01:56:07,377
so we might see another day.

1141
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,588
They were more than warriors.

1142
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:15,134
They were our mothers
and fathers,

1143
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:18,012
our sisters and brothers.

1144
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:22,517
And though we will always
hold on to their memories,

1145
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:28,690
tonight we release them
to rest with our ancestors.

1146
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,323
Farewell, Dad.

1147
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:39,826
Mom, we'll be okay.

1148
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:43,997
A thousand years ago,

1149
01:56:44,455 --> 01:56:46,791
and a thousand years from now,

1150
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:50,378
we will always be together.

1151
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:34,422
I seriously thought
we were going to die.

1152
01:57:34,589 --> 01:57:36,025
And I'd only learned
how to shoot a bow,

1153
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:37,300
like, a day earlier,

1154
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:38,593
now I'm on a battlefield,

1155
01:57:38,676 --> 01:57:40,970
killing all these Soul Suckers
with Shaun's auntie,

1156
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:43,347
who's this awesome,
magical kung fu goddess.

1157
01:57:43,514 --> 01:57:44,992
And I'm hanging on
to The Great Protector

1158
01:57:45,016 --> 01:57:46,076
with my sister at this point,

1159
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,102
trying not to get eaten
by the Mega Soul Sucker.

1160
01:57:48,269 --> 01:57:50,563
Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker
was such a nasty bitch.

1161
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,291
Yeah. It was trying
to eat our dragon's soul.

1162
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,375
Which would have allowed it

1163
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:54,501
to destroy the entire universe.

1164
01:57:54,525 --> 01:57:55,526
Yeah.

1165
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:56,778
I only had one arrow left,

1166
01:57:56,861 --> 01:57:58,738
and all I could hear
in the back of my mind

1167
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:00,364
was my mom's voice saying,

1168
01:58:00,531 --> 01:58:02,742
"Just take the shot,
you little mooch!"

1169
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:05,411
And so, I aimed
right for the Sucker's throat

1170
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:07,413
- and I let her fly.
- She hit it dead on.

1171
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:09,082
And then Shaun used
the Ten Rings

1172
01:58:09,165 --> 01:58:11,834
to do this crazy
Kamehameha fireball

1173
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:13,461
that exploded the thing...

1174
01:58:13,544 --> 01:58:15,463
and he saved the world.

1175
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:19,634
Yeah, we, uh, lost
some good people that day...

1176
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:23,137
but we made it.

1177
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:25,014
We made it.

1178
01:58:26,724 --> 01:58:28,184
Are you done mocking me?

1179
01:58:28,392 --> 01:58:30,228
Oh, no. We're not mocking you.

1180
01:58:30,394 --> 01:58:31,771
So where is this sister
of yours?

1181
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:33,856
She's back at my dad's compound,

1182
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:35,108
shutting down his operations.

1183
01:58:35,274 --> 01:58:36,919
Yeah, his dad was the head
of The Ten Rings

1184
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:38,444
for the past thousand years.

1185
01:58:39,987 --> 01:58:42,031
Two weeks ago, you were
parking cars for tips,

1186
01:58:42,198 --> 01:58:44,492
and you want me to believe
you're now saving the world

1187
01:58:44,659 --> 01:58:46,452
from soul-sucking monsters?

1188
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,430
I know, you're trying
to get me back

1189
01:58:48,454 --> 01:58:50,694
for what I said last time,
but I'm not gonna apologize...

1190
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:52,768
for speaking the truth
as a friend.

1191
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:55,419
I really meant what I said,
and, in fact, I actually think

1192
01:58:55,586 --> 01:58:57,922
this whole bit you're doing
just further proves my point.

1193
01:58:58,089 --> 01:58:59,215
You guys are obviously...

1194
01:59:00,508 --> 01:59:02,135
- What?
- Shang-Chi.

1195
01:59:04,887 --> 01:59:06,180
Shang-Chi.

1196
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:08,808
Uh... Here.

1197
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:09,976
Present.

1198
01:59:13,688 --> 01:59:14,814
My name is Wong.

1199
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:18,234
Yeah, I know, sir.
I'm a huge fan...

1200
01:59:18,401 --> 01:59:19,861
Do you have the rings?

1201
01:59:21,362 --> 01:59:22,822
Uh... Yeah, yes.

1202
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:25,950
Good. Let's go,
we have a lot to talk about.

1203
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:27,535
You too.

1204
01:59:30,329 --> 01:59:31,330
Me too?

1205
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,502
- I think we should...
- Yeah.

1206
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:38,880
- Uh, we gotta go.
- Yeah.

1207
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:43,593
I know this is, like, crazy,
but I'm gonna text you,

1208
01:59:43,759 --> 01:59:46,637
and we'll do this again.
Nice to see you, John.

1209
01:59:46,804 --> 01:59:48,681
I'll Venmo you for the...

1210
02:02:00,062 --> 02:02:01,272
Hmm.

1211
02:02:02,648 --> 02:02:05,776
They don't match any artifacts
from our codex.

1212
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:08,571
What do you think?

1213
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:10,531
Mm, I'm not sure.

1214
02:02:12,825 --> 02:02:15,953
They're not vibranium. Chitauri?

1215
02:02:17,371 --> 02:02:19,790
Not like any alien tech
I've seen.

1216
02:02:20,791 --> 02:02:21,977
How long did your dad have them

1217
02:02:22,001 --> 02:02:23,502
before he gave them to you?

1218
02:02:24,712 --> 02:02:26,005
Um...

1219
02:02:26,088 --> 02:02:27,673
About a thousand years.

1220
02:02:27,965 --> 02:02:29,675
Their thermoluminescence
indicates

1221
02:02:29,759 --> 02:02:31,093
they're older than that.

1222
02:02:31,302 --> 02:02:32,887
By a lot.

1223
02:02:33,137 --> 02:02:35,389
The first time
you used the rings,

1224
02:02:35,765 --> 02:02:38,184
we felt it in Kamar-Taj.

1225
02:02:46,901 --> 02:02:48,361
What is it?

1226
02:02:48,486 --> 02:02:49,945
A beacon.

1227
02:02:50,112 --> 02:02:52,031
They're sending a message.

1228
02:02:53,741 --> 02:02:55,785
A message to where?

1229
02:02:58,329 --> 02:03:00,331
I'm so sorry.
I have to deal with this.

1230
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:01,683
You can get my number
from Bruce.

1231
02:03:01,707 --> 02:03:03,125
It was so nice to meet you.

1232
02:03:04,919 --> 02:03:07,338
Yeah, I...
I don't have her number.

1233
02:03:07,755 --> 02:03:09,924
She... She does this a lot.

1234
02:03:10,674 --> 02:03:12,885
Guys, stay safe.

1235
02:03:13,844 --> 02:03:16,097
Welcome to the circus.

1236
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:25,314
I know this is a lot to take in,

1237
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:27,942
but you're gonna have
to start getting used to that.

1238
02:03:28,442 --> 02:03:31,487
From now on,
the trajectory of your lives

1239
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:34,740
will be like nothing you've
ever experienced before.

1240
02:03:35,574 --> 02:03:37,576
And there's no going back.

1241
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:41,664
You both have a long journey
ahead of you.

1242
02:03:42,456 --> 02:03:45,084
Go home, get some rest.

1243
02:03:47,128 --> 02:03:48,504
Yeah. That's a good idea.

1244
02:03:48,587 --> 02:03:51,632
Yeah. Yeah,
we probably should do that.

1245
02:03:53,134 --> 02:03:54,510
Or...

1246
02:03:57,054 --> 02:04:00,099
Welcome to the Hotel California.

1247
02:04:01,934 --> 02:04:05,062
- Such a lovely place.
- Such a lovely place.

1248
02:04:05,229 --> 02:04:08,774
- Such a lovely face.
- Such a lovely face.

1249
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:12,820
Plenty of room at the Hotel California.

1250
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:18,492
- Any time of year.
- Any time of year.

1251
02:04:18,659 --> 02:04:20,035
You can find it here.

1252
02:04:22,121 --> 02:04:24,582
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted.

1253
02:04:25,332 --> 02:04:28,335
She got the Mercedes bends, uh.

1254
02:04:28,669 --> 02:04:34,383
She got a lot of pretty,
pretty boys she calls friends.

1255
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:40,806
How they dance in the courtyard,
sweet summer sweat.

1256
02:04:41,849 --> 02:04:47,855
Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget.

1257
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:54,069
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine".

1258
02:04:54,195 --> 02:05:00,784
He said, "We haven't had
that spirit here since 1969".

1259
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:07,416
And still those voices
are calling from far away.

1260
02:05:08,292 --> 02:05:10,628
Wake you up in the middle of the night.

1261
02:05:11,253 --> 02:05:13,964
Just to hear them say.

1262
02:05:14,757 --> 02:05:18,594
Welcome to the Hotel California.

1263
02:05:20,387 --> 02:05:23,516
- Such a lovely place.
- Such a lovely place.

1264
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:26,060
Such a lovely face.

1265
02:05:26,894 --> 02:05:31,398
They livin' it up
at the Hotel California.

1266
02:05:33,234 --> 02:05:36,403
- What a nice surprise.
- What a nice surprise.

1267
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:39,406
Bring your alibis.

1268
02:10:59,184 --> 02:11:00,477
They're waiting.

1269
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:29,047
Let's get started.

1270
02:11:29,214 --> 02:11:30,716
We have a lot of work to do.
