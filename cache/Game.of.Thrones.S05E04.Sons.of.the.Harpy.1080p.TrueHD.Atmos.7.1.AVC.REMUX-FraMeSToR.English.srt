Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

35

Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.

36
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,157
Because I don't want to start a war.

37
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,202
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

38
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,498
It has to be me.

if you ever see the wee fucker,
give him my regards.

48
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,251
He murdered my father.

49
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,923
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

50
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,134
And then I'll give him your regards.

51

The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

52
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,148
Given the expense
of rebuilding the royal fleet...

53
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,692
How much can the crown afford?

54

You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

57
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:11,162
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

58
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,291
or I'd have words with my daughter.

59
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,548
You've already given us too much.

60
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,844
No, we must arrange better terms
with the Iron Bank.

61
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,304
- Absolutely.
- In person.

62
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:30,974
Me?

63
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,976
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

64
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,646
someone of importance
to show these bankers our respect.

65
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,691

I can think of no one more qualified.

No.

77
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,877
The old High Septon
would have asked the vintage.

78
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,130
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven,

79
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,508
and should be kept pure.

80
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,719

Hmm.

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,224
How may I serve?

83
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,145
All over Westeros
we hear of septs being burned,

84
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,064
Silent Sisters raped,

85
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,401
the bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

86
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,571
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

87
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,907
Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.

88
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,618
In the days before the Targaryens,

89
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,038
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

90
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:21,668
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

91
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,171
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son, the king,

92
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:29,426
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

93
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:34,014
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

94
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,516
An army in service to the gods themselves.

95
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,643
And to you, of course,

96
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,312
as the chosen representative of the Seven.

97
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,065
An honor I never expected.

98
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,942
Or ever wished for.

99
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,569
Which is why you were chosen.

100

You and I both know how the world works.

101
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,202
Too often, the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

102
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,040
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

103
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,001
All sinners are equal before the gods.

104

What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,006
And your wife has every right to criticize.

166
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,593
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother,

167
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,512
no matter his perversions.

168
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,806
Then,

169
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,311
can I tell Margaery
you'll have Ser Loras released?

170
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,896
I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras.

171
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,982
You're the king.

172
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,028
I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,
he'll release the poor boy.

173
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,451
Halt!

174
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,810
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

175
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,148
Give the order, and we'll clear out this rabble.

176
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,527
You mean kill them?

177
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,030
Here, at the sept?

178
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,074
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods that they love.

179
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,163
MAN 1: Bastard!

180
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,332
MAN 2: You're an abomination!

181
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,547
MAN 3: Born of sin!

182
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,883
WOMAN: Filthy bastard!

183
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,556
We'll find another way.

184
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,644
MAN 4: Abomination!

185
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,984
My queen?

186
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,826
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

187
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,957
You're the King of the Andals,

188
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,669
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm,

189
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,880
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

190
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,092
I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.

191
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,927
Are you? When?

192
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,180
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

193
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,559
He was praying just now.

194
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,397
I have to send word to Grandmother.

195
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,233
Will you come back later?

196
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,029
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

197
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,116
Of course.

198
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:52,827
(GRUNTING)

199
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,871
SELYSE: You think highly of this boy?

200
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,414
Good.

201
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,874
STANNIS: Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

202
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,169
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

203
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,046
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

204
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,886
I should have given you a son.

205
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,347
Not your fault.

206
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,891
Whose, then?

207
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,977
I gave you nothing but weakness

208
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,148
and deformity.

209
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,319
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

210
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,862
My lady.

211
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,073
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

212
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,659
and her father's blood runs through her veins.

213
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,171
You march on Winterfell soon?

214
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,508
We must to beat the snows.

215
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,263
Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos
and left me behind.

216
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,851
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

217
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,102
I won't.

218
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,774
I need you.

219
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,235
You only need faith, my king.

220
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,616
And you. What do you need?

221
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,370
To serve my Lord.

222
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,830
(GRUNTING)

223
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,709
Lord Ashford.

224
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,592
Lady Caulfield.

225
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,930
Lord Smallwood.

226
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,057
I've never even heard of these people.

227
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,017
They haven't heard of you, either.

228
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,020
But we need men, and they have some.

229
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,401
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

230
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,861
More than Lord Wibberley.

231
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,502
- Not him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

232
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,254
But we need men and supplies,

233
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,423
and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.

234
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,632
He murdered my brother.

235
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,510
We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

236
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,013
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

237
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,602
And we can't get more men
without help from the Warden of the North.

238
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,710
Apologies, my lady.

239
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,720
(DOOR CLOSES)

240
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,390
Lord Commander.

241
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,185
How can I help you?

242
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,354
Come with us when we ride south.

243
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,398
None of us know the castle as well as you do.

244
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,069
Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people.

245
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,822
Winterfell was your home once.

246
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,785
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

247
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,040
Castle Black is my home now.

248
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,543
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

249
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,087
There's only one war.

250
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,673
Life against death.

251
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,011
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

252
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,097
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

253
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,434
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

254
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,105
No visions. No magic.

255
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,774
Just life.

256
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,422
Do you feel my heart beating?

257
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,009
There's power in you.

258
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,930
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

259
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,861
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

260
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,072
Two parts of a greater whole.

261
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,701
In our joining, there's power.

262
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,621
Power to make life,

263
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,249
power to make light,

264
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,334
and power to cast shadows.

265
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,046
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

266
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,507
Then we shouldn't tell him.

267
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,762
- I can't.
- Why?

268
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,680
I swore a vow.

269
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,393
I loved another.

270
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,146
The dead don't need lovers.

271
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
Only the living.

272
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,279
I know.

273
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,407
But I still love her.

274
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,591
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

275
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,731
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

276
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,463
Are you lonely?

277
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,508
Just bored.

278
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,011
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

279
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,763
Were you bored a lot, too?

280
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,892
I know Castle Black
is no place for a child, but...

281
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,603
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

282
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,439
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

283
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,733
Why do you say that?

284
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,737
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

285
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,283
She shouldn't have said that.

286
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,295
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

287
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,141
When you were an infant,

288
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,145
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

289
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,316
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

290
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,112
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

291
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:32,828
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

292
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,335
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

293
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,796
How you pressed it to your cheek.

294
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,640
By the time we burned the doll, it was too late.

295
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,645
I was told you would die.

296
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,813
Or worse,

297
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,816
the greyscale would go slow.

298
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:08,030
Let you grow just enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

299
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,699
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

300
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,952
to live out your short life with the stone men,

301
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,871
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

302
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,458
I told them all to go to hell.

303
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,421
I called in every maester
on this side of the world.

304
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,549
Every healer. Every apothecary.

305
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,762
They stopped the disease and saved your life.

306
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,350
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

307
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,396
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

308
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,025
And you are my daughter.

LITTLEFINGER:
I thought I might find you here.

311
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,260
Your Aunt Lyanna.

312
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,221
Father never talked about her,

313
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,601
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

314
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,854
They say she was beautiful.

315
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,190
I saw her once.

316
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,443
I was a boy living with your mother's family.

317
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,488
Lord Whent held a great tourney at Harrenhal.

318
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,324
Everyone was there.

319
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,535
The Mad King, your father,

320
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,204
Robert Baratheon,

321
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,331
and Lyanna.

322
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,625
She was already promised to Robert.

323
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,506
You can imagine what it was like for me,
a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

324
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,218
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

325
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:40,099
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

326
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,852
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

327
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,854
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

328
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,107
and they saw that silver hair.

329
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,358
How handsome he was.

330
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,278
Until he rode right past his wife,

331
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:57,116
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

332
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,702
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

333
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,914
He rode past his wife,

334
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,294
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

335
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,879
Blue as frost.

336
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,887
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

337
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,559
Yes, he chose her.

338
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,812
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

339
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,488
Come.

340
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,658
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

341
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,123
You're dressed for riding.

342
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,207
I am.

343
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,711
Where are you going?

344
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,838
King's Landing.

345
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,464
King's Landing?

346
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,633
Cersei sent for me.

347
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,094
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

348
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,971
You can't leave me here.

349
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,265
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

350
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,391
Believe me.

351
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,393
But it won't be for long.

352
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,312
How do you know?

353
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,358
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.

354
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,571
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

355
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,033
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

356
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,452
- You don't know that.
- I do.

357
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,538
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

358
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,124
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

359
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,712
With the North behind him,
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

360
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,714
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

361
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,175
He has a larger army.

362
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,886
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

363
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,723
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

364
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,226
I am a betting man.

365
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,187
And if you're right?

366
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,272
Stannis takes Winterfell,

367
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,484
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

368
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,528
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

369
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,031
he names you Wardeness of the North.

370
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,450
But I...

371
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,202
I wouldn't...

372
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,662
Wardeness of the North?

373
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,956
You are the last surviving Stark.

374
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,457
He needs you.

375
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,378
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

376
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,130
Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?

377
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,717
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
and make him yours.

378
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,928
I don't know how to do that.

379
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,763
Of course you do.

380
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,598
He's already fallen for you.

381
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,767
His father frightens me.

382
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,394
He should. He's a dangerous man.

383
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,524
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

384
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,485
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

385
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,448
I'll return before too long.

386
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,325
You be strong without me.

387
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,211
The North will be yours.

388
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,922
Do you believe me?

389
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,095
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

That would have been a shit way to die.

396
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,544
As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.

397
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,714
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

398
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,634
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

399
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,968
No?

400
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,057
Two knights off to rescue a princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

401
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,517
Sounds like all the rest.

402
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,314
What about you?

403
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,650
What shit way would you choose?

404
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:48,031
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

405
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,743
How disappointing.

406
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,788
I thought you'd have
something more exciting planned.

407
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,167
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

408
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,754
How do you want to go?

409
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,257
In the arms of the woman I love.

410
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,011
She want the same thing?

411
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,686
Let's go.

412
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,241
The captain of that ship,
what was he, Braavosi?

413
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,034
JAIME: Pentoshi.

414
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,661
BRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?

415
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,705
JAIME: As I said. Why?

416
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,458
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

417
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,169
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

418
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,712
A bag of gold.

I'm not sure you understand

420

how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

421
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,594
It was a heavy bag.

422
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,472
And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.

423
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,682
But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.

One, if he's slow.

00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,331
Over the hill.

Cooper. This is Darnell.

436
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,689
You're from King's Landing.

Why are you here?

440

Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

It was a near thing, really.

00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,413
Thought the sharks would get us.

443

There are no sharks in Dorne.

444
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,295
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

445

We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

we lose our only chance for revenge.

Oberyn came to take me to court.

490
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,264
I had never seen this man,
and yet he called himself my father.

491
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,977
My mother wept, said I was too young
and a girl.

492
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,608
Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said,

493
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,528
"Girl or boy, we fight our battles,

494
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,739
"but the gods let us choose our weapons."

495
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:49,410
My father pointed to the spear,
and then to my mother's tears.

496
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,414
(GRUNTS)

497
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,420
I made my choice long ago.

498
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,717
TYRION: (MUFFLED) Will you untie me?

499
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,929
Will you please untie me?

500
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:09,931
Will you please?

(MUFFLED SINGING)

502
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,581
Thank you.

503
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:43,882
Who are you?

504
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:45,967
Your captor.

505
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,221
Do you have wine?

506
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,556
No.

507
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,058
Can't sleep without wine.

508
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,643
Then stay awake.

509
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,818
You're going the wrong way.

510
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:10,158
My sister is in Westeros. Westeros is west.

511
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,951
We're heading east.

512
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,245
I'm not taking you to your sister.

513
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,082
You said you were taking me to the queen.

514
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:22,921
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
She's the queen I serve.

515
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,340
(LAUGHING)

516
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,513
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

517
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,016
It so happens I was heading there myself.

518
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,852
What business would you have
with the queen?

519
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,396
Gold and glory. Oh, and hate.

520
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,192
If you'd ever met my sister, you'd understand.

521
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,571
So now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

522
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:04,379
A highborn knight from the north of Westeros
down on his luck in Essos.

523
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,715
Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.

524
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,469
You're Jorah Mormont.

525
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,681
I have to ask.

526
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:19,268
How exactly were you serving your queen
in a whorehouse half a world away?

527
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,313
Is it possible that you were running?

528
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,110
Why would you be running?
And why would she have sent you away?

529
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,195
Oh, wait.

530
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,907
You were spying on her, weren't you?

531
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,660
It's all coming back to me.

532
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,704
I was drunk through
most of the Small Council meetings,

533
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,539
but it's all coming back.

534
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,750
You passed notes to Varys' little birds.

535
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,963
She found out, didn't she?

536
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,298
Found out and exiled you.

537
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,678
Now you hope to
win back her favor with a gift.

538
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,597
Risky scheme.

539
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,018
One might even say desperate.

540
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,856
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

541
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,776
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

542

- What?

545
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,723
I was thinking about all the times your brother

546
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,226
made me go with him down from the Red Keep
into the streets of King's Landing.

547
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,146
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

548
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,814
He liked to sing to them.

549
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,775
He sang to them?

550
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,526
- Yes.
- (LAUGHS)

551
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:56,532
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook,
or the Street of Seeds, and then he'd sing.

552
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,909
Just like all the other minstrels.

553
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,160
And what did you do?

554
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,995
I made sure no one killed him.

555
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,332
And I collected the money.

556
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,417
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

557
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,461
- He was good?
- He was very good.

558
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,796
Viserys never told you?

559
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,381
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

560
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,260
Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.

561
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,304
And what did you do with the money?

562
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,682
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

563
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,227
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

564
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,022
One time, we got horribly drunk.

I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

All men must die, but not all can die in glory.

576
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,935
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

577
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,730
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

578
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,316
So their names would live on.

579

Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

but their names will live on.

It's the best chance they'll ever have.

Is that what you used to tell men

583
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,786
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

584
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,664
Today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

I do not recognize this tradition.
