I'M WITH MY FATHER

AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

28
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,093
TELL ME WHAT
THESE LAST FEW MONTHS
HAVE MEANT TO YOU.

29
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,262
WELL, RICH,
WHEN I FIRST GOT THIS JOB,

30
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,557
I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD DO IT,

31
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,353
CONSIDERING...THE TRAUMA
THAT I HAD ENDURED.

32
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,105
BUT I WANTED TO HONOR
MY FATHER'S LEGACY.

33
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,148
AND I THINK
YOU HAVE.

34
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,775
WELL, I KNOW SHE HAS.

35
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,695
RICH: MR. QUEEN,
YOU'VE TALKED BEFORE
ABOUT HOW MUCH

36
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:13,073
YOUR OWN FATHER'S
SACRIFICE INSPIRED YOU.

37
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,366
YES.

38
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,869
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT'S HIS LEGACY?

39

[WIND BLOWING]

40
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,292
HELLO, EMIKO.

41
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,294
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

42
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,672
YOU'VE WASTED YOUR TIME
COMING HERE.

43
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,676
WHAT OUR FATHER DID TO
YOU, TO YOUR MOTHER

44
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,344
WAS UNFORGIVABLE.

45
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,265
I NEED TO TRY AND MAKE
THINGS RIGHT.

46
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,352
MY FATHER DID SACRIFICE
HIMSELF FOR ME, AND...

47
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,354
I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL.

48
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,691
STILL, THAT EXPERIENCE
ON THE RAFT...

49
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,568
JUST THE TWO OF YOU...

50
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,905
WATCHING YOUR FATHER
COMMIT SUICIDE
RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES,

51
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,741
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARROWING.

52
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,743
WHAT A TRUE HERO
YOUR FATHER WAS.

53
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,331
I CAN PROVE TO YOU THAT
I'M NOTHING LIKE HIM.

54
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,417
YOU'RE A QUEEN.

55
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,210
ALL YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO IS LEVERAGE
YOUR OWN PRIVILEGE

56
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,754
TO HELP YOURSELF.

57
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,131
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
WAS WRONG.

58
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,258
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN

59
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,802
A PART OF OUR LIVES.

60
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,262
YOU SHOULD BE A PART
OF MY LIFE NOW.

61
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,555
WHY DO YOU THINK
I WANT ANYTHING

62
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,432
TO DO WITH
THE QUEENS?

63
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,644
'CAUSE YOUR FAMILY
DESTROYS EVERYTHING
IT TOUCHES.

I JUST WANT A CHANCE.

65
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,190
JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE.

66
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,946
EMIKO...

67
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,405
YOU'RE MY SISTER.

68
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,409
I HAVE NO FAMILY.

69
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,835
MY GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN
TO SERVE THIS CITY.

70
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:52,006
I UNDERSTAND THAT
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO...

71
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,009
THEY DISAGREED WITH MY
METHODS BEFORE.

72
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,219
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE
THE PEOPLE OF STAR CITY

73
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,180
I WILL NO LONGER BE HIDING
IN THE SHADOWS,

74
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,685
AND I PROMISE TO ALWAYS
BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LAW.

75
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,022
I BELIEVE THAT TRUST
CAN BE BUILT

76
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,440
THROUGH TRANSPARENCY.

77
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,402
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT.

78
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,785
THANK YOU.

79
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,244
[WHISPERS]
YOU WERE AMAZING.

80
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,246
YOU WERE GENUINE AND
HEARTFELT AND AMAZING,

81
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,415
AND FOR A SECOND THERE,
I ALMOST BELIEVED THAT
YOU LIKED LAUREL.

82
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,168
I ALMOST DO.

83
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,170
IF DINAH'S GOAL IS
TO CONVINCE THE CITY

84
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,629
TO ACCEPT YOU
AS SCPD,

85
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,006
I WOULD SAY
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

86
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,632
WE'LL SEE.

87
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,467
EMIKO WILL COME
AROUND, TOO.

88
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,679
WELL, SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT
TO BE ANGRY.

89
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,224
MY FATHER ABANDONED HER.
I JUST...

90
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,434
I NEED HER TO SEE

91
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,436
THAT HE AND I ARE NOT
THE SAME PERSON.

92
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,981
WELL, SHE WILL, BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON.

93
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:54,526
LOOK, THAT WAS
AN EXCELLENT FIRST STEP.

94
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,486
IF YOU CAN PROVE
YOURSELF TO THE CITY,

95
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,613
YOU CAN CONVINCE
YOUR SISTER TO
GIVE YOU A CHANCE.

96
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,158
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,789
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE

OUR BEST SHOT AT DOING THAT.

FIND ALL THIS OUT?

WHY WAS I LEFT
IN THE DARK?

TO STAY THAT WAY.

THAT WE RESTARTED

IS OVER,

I PROMISE YOU WE WILL SHUT
THIS THING DOWN FOR GOOD.

A LOGICAL REASON TO
COMPROMISE,

BUT I'M NOT
DOING THAT ANYMORE.

792
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,625
WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION.

793
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,960
WALKING AWAY IS NOT
THE ANSWER.

794
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,753
OH, I'M NOT
WALKING AWAY.

795
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,546

OF COURSE.
WHY WOULDN'T THERE BE?

800
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,652
AH. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING

801
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,320
BECAUSE I HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS.

TOLD ME,

I'M GONNA MAKE SURE HE STAYS
THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

805
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,911
BUT HOW CAN YOU HOLD HIM

806

FOR PUBLIC INTOXICATION,

810
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,587
AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS
A HISTORY OF STALKING

811
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,173
AND ANTI-VIGILANTE VIOLENCE.

00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,257
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

813
