1
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:00,412
IT’S TIME FOR DUHR
(PRAYER)

2
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:34,539
JOIN THE THEMED-EVENING AT
THE MOSQUE THIS FRIDAY

3
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:38,121
IT’S ABOUT WOMEN’S ROLE IN ISLAM

4
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:42,153
IS JAMILLA COMING?

5
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:46,533
COME ON, SANA

6
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:50,492
I DON’T THINK SO

7
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,266
I’LL BE THERE

8
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:56,204
- We have to celebrate.
- I've bought sparkling wine.

9
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:57,335
Sparkling wine?

10
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,788
Don't people
celebrate with that?

11
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,789
I want beer.

12
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:04,508
So you are here now.

13
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:05,988
Am I late?

14
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,410
Yeah, we are done.

15
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:11,473
Oh, no! I am sorry. I took
the streetcar the wrong way.

16
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:14,395
Yeah! I have heard that one before.

17
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,974
- What?
- Taking the streetcar the wrong direction.

18
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:20,735
You?

19
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:22,179
Isn’t that what you usually do?

20
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,616
Yeah. I do that when I don’t
want to attend things.

21
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:29,538
Listen, then you can join Even and
me helping with the wrapping up?

22
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:36,029
That sounds like so much fun, but I am
super busy. Are the girls upstairs?

23
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:37,769
Sure.

24
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:41,363
Sana, can you tell Vilde that I miss her?

25
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:42,905
What?

26
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,041
You say that to a girl and
they go like “awwww”.

27
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,810
No, they don’t do that.

28
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,320
Awwww!

29
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,740
Does it work that way with girls?

30
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:50,872
You are cute together.

31
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,100
Yeah. We are cuter tan you two.

32
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,300
Ooh! You wish!

33
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:02,266
No, it’s just something about
the colour “ocean blue”.

34
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,807
Ocean blue?

35
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:05,122
Ocean.

36
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,601
Is it like royal blue?

37
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:09,211
No, royal blue is like your jacket.

38
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:10,663
It’s blue like a beach on Marbella.

39
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:13,293
A beach on Marbella?
Have you been there lately?

40
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,508
Hello.

41
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:16,557
Hi!

42
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:18,292
How are you?

43
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:20,358
Noora’s got her room back!

44
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,053
But what I was going to say was that...

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,479
Want some pizza?

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,097
Yesterday we tried a new position

47
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,587
we found online.

48
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,775
We also have cow meat.

49
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:36,384
I was over him, sitting.
Like a cowgirl but reversed.

50
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,772
So it was reversed cowgirl.
So he was sitting.

51
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:42,849
It’s a bit uncomfortable
in the beginning.

52
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:50,875
I felt like he was watching straight
up, because his head was like... on...

53
00:03:52,062 --> 00:04:00,062
If we did it the right way. It was so, so
good. It hit something, it hit the G-spot.

54
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,239
No. Isn’t G-spot on the upper side?

55
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,803
No, I have heard that the G-spot is anal.

56
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:10,273
Isn’t that only for boys?

57
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,619
It’s really common to have several G-spots.

58
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:23,543
Anyways, the thing is that I have never
had such a good time with anyone before.

59
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:27,309
I have never came as much as
I do when I am with Magnus.

60
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,533
It’s amazing!

61
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,939
I just come, and come, and come, and come.

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,650
Don’t you have any limits?
About what it’s okay to share?

63
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:38,803
Like what?

64
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,943
Do you have to share every detail
about you and Magnus’ sex life?

65
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:51,541
I get that it’s difficult for you
to listen since you can’t have sex...

66
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,911
I can have sex, Vilde.
I just choose not to.

67
00:04:56,131 --> 00:05:01,286
Yeah, I am just saying that it is totally
fine if you are sexually frustrated.

68
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:03,313
I am not sexually frustrated.

69
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:10,037
I don’t go around thinking about boys and
sex feeling like I am missing something.

70
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,377
I am just saying that...

71
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,360
sex should be something nice
between you and Magnus.

72
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,584
And not everybody else.

73
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,132
Anyone want some tea?

74
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,550
Yeah! That would be great...

75
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:53,749
Okay. I have to say something,
but I don’t know if it’s true.

76
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:57,277
I have heard that William has
a new girlfriend in London.

77
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,882
What?! Are you kidding?

78
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,969
Chris told me that.

79
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:05,715
Should I tell her?

80
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,167
Of course you have to tell her!

81
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,427
But, shouldn’t William
be the one to tell her?

82
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,549
Yeah, but obviously he hasn’t told her.

83
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:18,399
But I don’t know for sure if it’s true.

84
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:25,023
Also, I don’t understand the thing between
William and Noora. Are they together?

85
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,763
What’s up? What are you talking about?

86
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,142
Anal sex.

87
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:49,094
Magnus and I were thinking about trying.

88
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:53,105
Have you tried it?

89
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,002
No.

90
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:59,221
You and William, no...

91
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,446
Vilde. No.

92
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:03,392
At the subject of William. How is he?

93
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:07,345
Fine...

94
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:20,347
Yeah. We don't understand what’s the thing
between you two. Are you together or not?

95
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:29,501
It’s always going to be William and me.

96
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,500
TUESDAY
17:50

97
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:46,816
Hello?

98
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,792
- Try again! Throw it!
- Wrong! You are so bad!

99
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,991
Tell me when. Do it again!

100
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,316
Let Yousef try. Yousef will do it!

101
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,358
He is going to miss again. He's tried ten
times and he is still not able to do it.

102
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,573
When does it come?

103
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,597
Let me hear!

104
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:52,955
Throw it then!

105
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,097
Bad! I knew it!

106
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,115
I couldn’t hear, calm down.

107
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:00,883
What’s going on here?

108
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,723
Hey, let Sana try.

109
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:04,385
She will make it, bro!

110
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:10,454
She is good at basket, she can actually
throw, unlike some other people here.

111
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:11,947
She learned from me.

112
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:15,005
What do you mean “learned from me”? Even
mom is better than you at basketball.

113
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:15,256
Ohh!

114
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,880
That hurts.

115
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:22,723
Listen. If you make it, I’ll be your slave
for a whole week.

116
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,208
Man, don’t do that.

117
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,156
Chill. I am confident, man.

118
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,958
Drive me around? Clean my room?

119
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,657
Whatever you want, the whole package.

120
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,209
Swear on it.

121
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,461
Wallah! And these guys are my witnesses.

122
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,363
No, no. You won’t make it.

123
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:40,588
It will be fine. Chill. I’ll fix it.

124
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,338
What do I have to do?

125
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:46,535
Explain it to her.

126
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,836
You take this, throw it and
make it go into the lamp

127
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,650
exactly as Snoop Dog sings:
“Smoke weed every day!”

128
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:55,190
Just that?

129
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,214
Just that.

130
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,555
She is going to make it.

131
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:01,003
But if you miss, you will
be my slave for a week.

132
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,125
That wasn’t part of the deal.

133
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:07,192
Well, you said “just that”?
Are you scared or something?

134
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:08,546
She is going to make it!

135
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,810
You were so confident, come on!

136
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:11,355
Give me the ball.

137
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,351
You are going to regret this, Elias!

138
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:18,158
I am going to win this, relax.
I’ll be fine. Play the music.

139
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,346
Looking forward to see Elias crying.

140
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,043
She missed.

141
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:41,044
Aahhh! Nooo!

142
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,190
It’s just what I thought.

143
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,293
Way too early.

144
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:47,153
Now, can you please make some tea for us?

145
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,643
I am not your friends’ slave.

146
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,392
I know, but they are my guests.

147
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:57,981
Thank you, slave woman!

148
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:06,794
That came out wrong. I’m sorry. Calm down.
It was wrong of me to say that.

149
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,797
- Don’t talk to your sister like that!
- That’s your sister!

150
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,688
Everything is fine. Relax guys!

151
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:17,712
Stop it!

152
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,479
WEDNESDAY
14:06

153
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,196
Yours looks like shit.

154
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,439
But it's the truth!

155
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,963
Eva, how old are you?

156
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,676
- It looks like poop emoji.
- Can I try yours?

157
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,396
- Can’t you feed me?
- Oh my God! You want me to feed you?

158
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:38,527
Okay, all right.

159
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:44,417
Yours is good! What is it? Banana?

160
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,115
I don’t know. I think it’s mango.

161
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:46,963
No, it’s not!

162
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:48,000
Isn’t it lemon?

163
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:49,773
No, I would have known if it was lemon.

164
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:52,661
But that tasted like...

165
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:53,921
Does nobody want to taste mine?

166
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,001
Yeah, it really tasted...

167
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:57,133
Isn’t that vanilla?

168
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,159
You know what? I think Easter
holidays are boring as shit.

169
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,408
We should have gone to your cabin.

170
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:05,146
No. I am not going there, it
just makes me think of Kasper.

171
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:10,664
ARE YOU HOME? I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY KEY

172
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,714
It was amazing when
Kasper was in the window.

173
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:16,639
- You both got so scared!
- I thought somebody died!

174
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,640
CALL MOM

175
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:21,579
- You were the most scared.
- It was because of the mask!

176
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,073
- I’m crying!
- No, I didn’t do that.

177
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,895
Listen, girls. I’ve been
looking at travelling websites

178
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,926
and it’s not that expensive to rent
an apartment in a foreign country.

179
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,505
We should go to France, that would be cool.
Just us lying on the beach.

180
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:41,924
THEY ARE COMING LATE. I
NEED TO GET HOME NOW.

181
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:46,324
MEET ME. YOU ARE A SLAVE,
SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

182
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:49,779
WHERE ARE YOU?

183
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:51,895
You want to go to my place
and watch Paradise Hotel?

184
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,919
Yeah!

185
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:56,757
- Can I invite Magnus?
- Sure!

186
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,396
I think I’ll just go home then.

187
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,329
Why?

188
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,137
It’s nothing important, Eskild...

189
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:08,361
Linn sent me a message and told
me that he is furnishing my room.

190
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:11,985
Which I haven’t give him permission to do.

191
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,409
- I’ll text you later.
- All right.

192
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,048
Bye.

193
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,470
AT THE GYM. COME HERE.

194
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:25,853
Have you told her about
William’s new girlfriend?

195
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:28,341
No, I thought we agreed not to tell her.

196
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:32,153
Maybe he told her himself already,
she seemed a liittle down.

197
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,336
I have to give a key to my brother.

198
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,059
Where?

199
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:38,743
Not far away.

200
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,243
Should we go there before
we head to my place?

201
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:43,272
Yes.

202
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,241
I think the best solution
is to find Noora a new boy.

203
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,530
So that she falls in love and
can forget about William.

204
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,221
Well, she likes bad boys. Do we know any?
We should look for a bad boy.

205
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:58,685
Jonas and Mahdi! It would be so fun if any
of you got together with any of them.

206
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,724
Really? No, Vilde.

207
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:07,197
I just think it’s so boring that I
am the only one with a boyfriend,

208
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,133
because I have to be with Magnus
when you hang out together.

209
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:11,562
Can you wait here?

210
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:12,588
Why?

211
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,337
I don’t think Noora will fall in love with
any boys we already know.

212
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,361
We need someone new.

213
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:23,880
And where would we find
new, cool and hot boys?

214
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:26,206
¡Elias!

215
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,031
Hello, slave.

216
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:33,802
Here.

217
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:38,792
Who are your friends?

218
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:40,925
Vilde.

219
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:42,302
Elias.

220
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:54,886
Yeah, I think we have found them...

221
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,923
No, no, no.

222
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:18,663
FRIDAY
20:17

223
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:23,811
I need to pee.

224
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,988
Go pee then.

225
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,413
No, you can get fined for that.

226
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,061
What’s the sense of hanging
out with your brother now?

227
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,590
I don’t know. Ask Vilde.

228
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:39,963
No. I just think it would be nice
to meet some new cool and hot boys.

229
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:43,587
Have you meet Sana’s brother? He is so hot!

230
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:45,606
Don’t you have a boyfriend?

231
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:47,787
Fuck! It’s really cold.

232
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,108
They are on their way.
They know about a party.

233
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:53,283
They are not coming. They
are childish assholes.

234
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,084
No, they are not assholes.
They are 97 guys.

235
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,207
Just like William...

236
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,450
for example.

237
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:07,327
Hello, boys.

238
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:22,751
You hate hanging out with us, don’t you?

239
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,002
We are going to a party!

240
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:29,746
Where is the party we’re going to?

241
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,776
Hello?

242
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,177
Hello, where are you?

243
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,278
Shit! I forgot.

244
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,456
I had to help Noora.

245
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,226
Well, where are you right now?

246
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:51,485
On a streetcar.

247
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,230
We are on our way to a party.

248
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:01,409
I can hear what you are thinking.

249
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:06,644
I’m thinking it would be easier if you
had friends more similar to you...

250
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:10,306
I am able to have Norwegian friends
and still be myself.

251
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,393
Okay.

252
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,872
I trust you. See you later at home.

253
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,069
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

254
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:33,187
