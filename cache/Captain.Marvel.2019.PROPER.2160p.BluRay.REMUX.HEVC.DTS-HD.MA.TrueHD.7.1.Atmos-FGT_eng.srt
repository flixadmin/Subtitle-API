1
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,927
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,554
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,598
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,808
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,894
Dreams again?

6
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,733
Wanna fight?

7
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,279
I slipped.

8
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,530
Right, you slipped

9
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,294
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

10
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,367
I was already slipping

11
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,552
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

12
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,078
The two events
were not related.

13
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,788
Tell me about this dream.

14
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,834
- Anything new?
- No.

15
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,632
You have to let go
of the past.

16
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,966
I don't remember my past.

17
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,635
It's causing you doubt,

18
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,470
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

19
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,729
Control it.

20
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,483
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

21
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,984
with the Supreme Intelligence.

22
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,987
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

23
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,118
Humor is a distraction.

24
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,288
And anger?

25
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,915
Anger only serves the enemy.

26
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,636
One hundred twenty days

27
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,596
since the last Skrull attack.

28
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,098
Has anyone ever seen

29
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,951
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

30
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,602
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

31
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,020
in its true form.

32
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,314
You know that.

33
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,651
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

34
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,071
So it's sacred. It's personal.

35
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,073
No Kree divulges it, ever.

36
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,408
Who do you see?

37
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,452
- Your brother?
- No.

38
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,786
- Father?
- No.

39
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,997
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

40
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,415
It's me you see, isn't it?

41
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,251
I see
what you're trying to do.

42
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,836
- Is it working?
- Yes.

43
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,803
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

44
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,174
What is the point of
giving me these...

45
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,050
if you don't want me
to use them?

46
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,886
I want you to use them.

47
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,905
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

48
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,723
of showing you
how to use them.

49
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,891
I know how.

50
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,076
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,180
knock me down without them.

52
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,855
Control your impulses.

53
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,275
Stop using this,
start using this.

54
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,030
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

55
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,239
Vers.

56
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,825
Intelligence.

57
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,119
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

58
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,329
I am.

59
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,833
You struggle
with your emotions...

60
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,836
with your past,
which fuels them.

61
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,590
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

62
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,844
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

63
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,930
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

64
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,099
then take over our planets.

65
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,561
Horrors that you remember...

66
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,272
and so much that you do not.

67
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,612
It's all blank.
My life.

68
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,322
You're supposed
to take the form

69
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,074
of who I most admire...

70
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,620
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

71
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,789
Perhaps this is a mercy

72
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,208
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

73
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,670
Freeing you
to do what all Kree must...

74
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,007
put your people's needs
before your own.

75
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,551
We've given you a great gift.

76
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,262
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

77
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,848
I want to serve.

78
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,975
Then master yourself.

79
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,728
What was given
can be taken away.

80
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,150
I won't let you down.

81
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,360
We'll know soon enough.

82
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,446
You have a mission.

83
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,283
Serve well, and with honor.

84
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,639
This can't be good.

85
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,641
Must be another Skrull attack.

86
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,267
Whatever it is, it's big.

87
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,519
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

88
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,729
Once.

89
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,065
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

90
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,442
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...

91
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,486
and the face staring back
was my own.

92
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,130
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

93
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,530
then it would be
less disturbing.

94
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,658
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

95
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,951
You never laugh.

96
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,620
I laugh on the inside.

97
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,288
I'm not doing that now.

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,641
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

99
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,749
you're quite handsome.

100
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, thank you.

101
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,252
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

102
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,712
All right.

103
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,548
Prepare for...

104
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,260
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

105
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,639
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

106
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,599
This time, Torfa.

107
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,846
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

108
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,270
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

109
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,649
The Skrull general, Talos,

110
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,401
has sent kill units
to find him.

111
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,111
Should they reach him
before we do...

112
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,477
the intelligence he's acquired

113
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,239
over three years
is as good as theirs.

114
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,075
The Accusers will bomb

115
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,119
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

116
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,038
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

117
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,625
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

118
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,377
The Torfan populace.

119
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,448
We are not to interfere
with them,

120
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,547
nor them with us.

121
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,009
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

122
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,844
Proceed with caution.

123
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,388
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

124
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,558
This is a dangerous mission.

125
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,561
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

126
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,062
if that is our fate today.

127
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,230
For the good of all Kree.

128
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,398
For the good of all Kree!

129
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,137
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

130
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,932
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

131
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,285
Locals on the periphery.

132
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,371
Maybe a dozen.

133
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,956
Minn-Erva?

134
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,252
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

135
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,170
Repeat.

136
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,854
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

137
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,730
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

138
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,166
Only one way in,
only one way out.

139
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,692
We can get past the locals.

140
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,444
We don't know
if they are locals. Too risky.

141
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,839
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

142
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,864
No, you won't.

143
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,871
Right. We keep a close radius.

144
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,081
We lose comms,
we meet back at the Helion.

145
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,375
Come on.

146
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,972
Att-Lass, you getting this?

147
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,515
Copy. I see them.

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,735
Get back!

149
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,445
Commander?

150
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,288
Get back! Back!

151
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,666
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

152
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,336
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

153
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,713
Does anybody copy?

154
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,177
I don't wanna hurt you.

155
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,972
Keep back!

156
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,477
Stay back!

157
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,025
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

158
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,818
They're just starving.

159
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,887
HGX-78.

160
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,807
TRT79-VVX6.

161
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,311
Get back.

162
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
Skrulls!

163
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,298
Vers!

164
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,550
Vers? Skrulls.

165
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,552
It's an ambush.

166
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,572
Incoming!

167
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,203
Back to the Helion.

168
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,747
Vers. Do you copy?

169
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,333
Back to the Helion.

170
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,625
Come in. Vers.

171
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,461
How did you know the code?

172
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,505
How about
I tell you my secret...

173
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,551
when you've told me yours?

174
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,598
Let's open her up.

175
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,987
Where are we?

176
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,572
Stand by.

177
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,575
Where's your head at?

178
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,787
In the clouds. Where's yours?

179
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,538
On my shoulders.

180
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,248
About to show these boys
how we do it.

181
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,792
You ready?

182
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,935
Higher, further, faster, baby.

183
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
That's right.

184
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,347
This can't be right.

185
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,600
Go back even further.

186
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,273
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

187
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,331
Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?

188
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,600
What the hell
are you thinking?

189
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,664
You don't belong out here!

190
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,127
I think
we went back too far.

191
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,628
You let him drive.

192
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,171
Let me try something.

193
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,758
Give up already!

194
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,552
You don't belong out here!

195
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,056
You're not strong enough.

196
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,558
You'll kill yourself.

197
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,940
They'll never let you fly.

198
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,443
Am I the only one
that's confused here?

199
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,736
You're a decent pilot.

200
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,904
But you're too emotional.

201
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,782
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

202
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,501
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

203
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,629
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

204
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,839
And so,

205
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,682
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

206
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,552
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

207
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,097
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

208
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,433
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

209
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,726
Charming memory.

210
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,894
Hang on.

211
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,437
I think I've got it.

212
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,568
Goose likes you.

213
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,175
She doesn't typically
take to people.

214
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,613
Early start to your morning.

215
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,906
Uh, late night, actually.

216
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,991
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

217
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,159
Sound familiar?

218
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,926
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

219
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,788
Wonderful view, isn't it?

220
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,790
I prefer the view
from up there.

221
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,268
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

222
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,377
Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.

223
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,171
Stand by.

224
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,009
Sound familiar?

225
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,677
Wonderful view, isn't it?

226
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,556
I prefer the view
from up there.

227
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,992
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

228
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,059
What's that on her shirt?

229
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,393
I couldn't read it.

230
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,772
Wonderful view, isn't it?

231
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,109
I prefer the view
from up there.

232
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,029
- Focus.
- Excuse me?

233
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,864
Look down.

234
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,908
Focus.

235
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,744
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.

236
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,912
Do you hear that, too?

237
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,413
Do we have
her location?

238
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,542
Got it.

239
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,503
Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.

240
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,425
Interesting.

241
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,012
Huh. Hold on.

242
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,307
Go back right before this.
Go back.

243
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,602
That's no MiG, Lawson.

244
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,105
This is it. Now let me
see where you're headed.

245
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,774
That's right.
Look at the coordinates.

246
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,859
Focus.

247
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,029
Open, please.

248
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,698
That's it. That's it.

249
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,074
You're almost there.

250
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,784
You're almost there.
Don't fight it.

251
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,704
Focus!

252
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,082
Get her back!
Get her back now!

253
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,088
This doesn't make any sense.

254
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,648
Do we have any information
we can act on?

255
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
Just that Lawson was somewhere
on planet C-53.

256
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,194
We're on our way.

257
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,113
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

258
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,409
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

259
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,037
And everything we're after.

260
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,754
Oh!

261
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,922
That did something.

262
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,382
Try that again.

263
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,020
Not yet!

264
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,947
What did you do to me?

265
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,492
Now we're just after
a little information.

266
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,118
What did you put in my head?

267
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,162
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

268
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,123
But those aren't my memories.

269
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,793
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

270
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

271
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,422
They really did
a number on you.

272
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,632
Enough of your mind games.

273
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,300
What do you want?

274
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,846
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

275
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,556
and her light-speed engine.

276
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,392
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

277
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,104
Really?
Then why is she in your head?

278
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,195
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

279
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,619
how these things come off,
would ya?

280
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,847
No?

281
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,265
Fine.

282
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,122
Hmm.

283
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,066
Hey.

284
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,656
You do
know why they call it a...

285
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,967
You leaving so soon?

286
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,448
We're just getting to know
each other.

287
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,847
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

288
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,685
Hello? Do you copy?

289
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,050
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

290
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,385
Is this C-53?

291
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,515
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

292
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,684
Yeah. I understand you.

293
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,185
Oh, good.

294
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,232
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

295
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,733
Sort of. Uh, the movie theater
has its own guy.

296
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,070
Where can I find
communications equipment?

297
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,328
Thank you.

298
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,363
Track the pod. Find the girl.

299
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,908
She knows more than she knows.

300
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,328
Hey.

301
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,956
This one's taken.

302
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,760
Come on.

303
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,344
Vers?

304
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,596
Vers?

305
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,265
Verify. CTC-39.

306
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,600
GRXV-1600.

307
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,127
And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.

308
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,479
Is everyone okay?
What happened?

309
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,439
Skrull ambush.

310
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,149
I thought we'd lost you.

311
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,358
Did you find Soh-Larr?

312
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,735
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

313
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,820
Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.

314
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,114
That's impossible.

315
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,116
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

316
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,576
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

317
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,887
The machine that they used...

318
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,791
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

319
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,372
Vers, where are you?

320
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,999
I'm on planet C-53.

321
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,127
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

322
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,629
Who?

323
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,924
She's who I see.

324
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,717
She's what?

325
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,719
Vers?

326
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:37,805
Vers, what?

327
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,432
She's a scientist.

328
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,577
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

329
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,186
I have to get to her
before they do...

330
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,955
or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.

331
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,731
No. You've been
caught once already.

332
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,484
How far is C-53?

333
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,654
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

334
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,823
Vers, hold your
position until we get there.

335
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,908
Keep your comms online
SO we can contact you.

336
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,952
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

337
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,078
We're sorry.

338
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,263
A long-distance
company access code

339
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,348
is required for the number
you have dialed.

340
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,998
- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?

341
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,417
Vers?

342
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,020
Please dial your call
with the access code.

343
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,045
Vers?

344
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,799
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

345
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,968
She's stronger than you think.

346
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,762
Ever been to C-53?

347
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,514
Once.

348
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,392
It's a real shithole.

349
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,780
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

350
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,414
Did you call this in?

351
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,096
Beacon activated.

352
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,893
Excuse me, miss.

353
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,437
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

354
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,773
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

355
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,568
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

356
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,070
Oh.

357
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,406
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

358
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,118
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

359
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:27,289
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

360
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,458
Could I see
some identification, please?

361
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,376
Vers. Kree Starforce.

362
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,562
We don't carry
our identification

363
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,587
on little cards.

364
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,671
Vers?

365
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,299
Starforce?

366
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,093
How long you plan
to be in town?

367
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,446
Oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

368
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,780
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

369
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,514
that are infiltrating
your planet.

370
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,725
Skrulls?

371
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,310
Shapeshifters?

372
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,521
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

373
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,781
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

374
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,985
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

375
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:03,283
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

376
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,244
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

377
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,329
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

378
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,457
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

379
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,709
You're under arrest.

380
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,760
Rook!

381
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,887
Rook, let's roll!

382
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,731
Did you see her weapon?

383
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,942
I did not.

384
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,077
Watch it!

385
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,112
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

386
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,927
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

387
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,101
"Trust me, true believer."

388
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,232
Get off!

389
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,706
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

390
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,711
Let's greet them
at the station.

391
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,266
Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.

392
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,311
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

393
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,721
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

394
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,150
I finished
collecting evidence...

395
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,656
We need an ambulance!

396
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,991
Someone call 911!

397
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,659
Hey! You all right?

398
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,661
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

399
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,829
Anyone else see that?

400
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,915
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

401
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,299
Nice scuba suit.

402
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,640
Lighten up, honey, huh?

403
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,642
Got a smile for me?

404
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,064
Freak.

405
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,836
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

406
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,631
Whatever he runs on,

407
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,007
it's not
on the periodic table.

408
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,760
You're saying
he's not from around here?

409
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:20,845
Hey, how's your eye?

410
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,015
Well, I'd say fine...

411
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,601
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

412
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:34,275
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

413
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,277
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

414
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,155
And the woman said
that there were more?

415
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,241
The word she used
was "infiltration."

416
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,450
You believe her?

417
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,160
Not till I saw this.

418
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,455
What's your plan?

419
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,874
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

420
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,210
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

421
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,628
that fits her description.

422
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,506
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

423
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,259
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

424
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,427
Good.

425
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,222
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

426
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,350
Not even our own men.

427
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,768
Yes, sir.

428
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,994
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

429
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,956
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

430
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,255
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

431
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,093
I will finish what we started.

432
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,687
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

433
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,399
No one in or out.

434
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,228
Boom!

435
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,629
What can I get ya?

436
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,548
Where was
this photograph taken?

437
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,591
An airport.

438
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,009
Where's Pegasus?

439
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,761
That's classified.

440
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,473
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

441
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,686
But I see you've changed it up
a bit since then.

442
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,479
Grunge is a good look for you.

443
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,147
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

444
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,774
It was cool, you know?

445
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,735
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

446
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,364
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

447
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,408
Typical nine-to-five.

448
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,617
So you saw one?

449
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,495
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

450
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,415
but I can't unsee that.

451
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,209
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

452
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,670
You think I'm one of those
green things.

453
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,130
Can't be too careful.

454
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:47,051
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

455
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,511
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

456
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,638
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

457
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,515
No. The DNA would match.

458
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,766
Want my AOL password?

459
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,935
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

460
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,021
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

461
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,732
You wanna get personal.

462
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,909
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

463
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,545
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

464
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,130
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

465
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,506
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

466
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,531
Do I pass?

467
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,949
Not yet. First job?

468
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,868
Soldier.
Straight out of high school.

469
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,262
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

470
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,329
- Then?
- Spy.

471
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,639
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

472
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,789
We were everywhere.

473
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,626
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

474
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,294
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

475
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,587
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

476
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,671
for the past six years...

477
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,899
trying to figure out
where our

478
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,983
future enemies
are coming from.

479
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,175
Never occurred to me

480
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,510
they would be coming
from above.

481
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,012
Name a detail so bizarre

482
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,415
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

483
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,478
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

484
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,856
You didn't need that, did you?

485
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,691
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

486
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,944
Okay. Your turn.

487
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,779
Prove you're not a Skrull.

488
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,915
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

489
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,208
you're not a Skrull?

490
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,626
That's a photon blast.

491
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,086
And?

492
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,170
A Skrull can't do that.

493
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,422
So, a full bird colonel

494
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:07,816
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

495
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,301
must have pretty high
security clearance.

496
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,928
Where's Pegasus?

497
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,520
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

498
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,355
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

499
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:26,567
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

500
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,237
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

501
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,991
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

502
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,119
They believe
that she developed

503
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,037
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

504
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,747
Light-speed engine?

505
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,166
Gotta admit, that's not

506
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,650
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

507
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,294
Well, it's still early.

508
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,380
And you, what do you want?

509
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,841
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

510
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,925
And?

511
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,391
Look, war is
a universal language.

512
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:01,269
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

513
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,688
You got a personal stake
in this.

514
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,491
This is government property.

515
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,410
Turn your vehicle around.

516
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,621
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

517
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,957
Place your thumb on the pad.

518
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,293
One moment.

519
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,422
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

520
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,549
Everybody calls me Fury.

521
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,595
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

522
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,242
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

523
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,848
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

524
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,058
What about your kids?

525
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,976
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

526
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,352
You are cleared for access.

527
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,437
Thank you.

528
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,676
Oh, hold up.

529
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,888
You look like
somebody's disaffected niece.

530
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,891
Put that on.

531
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,311
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

532
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,147
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

533
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,732
help with
the covert part of your job?

534
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,151
Said the space soldier
who was wearing a rubber suit.

535
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,403
Lose the flannel.

536
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,833
How can I help you?

537
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,544
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

538
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,923
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

539
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,342
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

540
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,387
Do you know her?

541
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:04,934
Follow me.

542
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,602
Hmm.

543
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,567
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

544
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,569
No.

545
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,156
Well, this ain't it.

546
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,539
Is that a communicator?

547
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:30,001
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

548
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,252
Who are you paging?

549
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:35,089
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

550
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,712
After you.

551
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,505
Impressive.

552
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,383
Oh, you should see what I can
do with a paperclip.

553
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,355
Hey, there. How are you?

554
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,984
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

555
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:39,570
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

556
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,948
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

557
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,032
What's your name?

558
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,993
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

559
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,078
Fury?

560
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,412
Hmm?

561
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,874
I'll be back.

562
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,338
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

563
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,006
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

564
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,596
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

565
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,907
When all you had to do was...

566
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,432
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

567
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,618
Huh. Lawson.

568
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,798
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

569
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,733
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

570
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:48,723
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

571
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,476
Kree glyphs?

572
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,020
Hmm?

573
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,981
Lawson is not cuckoo.

574
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,943
She's Kree.

575
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,529
Well, she's dead.

576
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,156
What?

577
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,991
She crashed the Asis aircraft

578
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,951
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

579
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,120
Took a pilot down with her.

580
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,456
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

581
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,667
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

582
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,963
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

583
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,010
When did this crash happen?

584
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,847
Six years ago. 1989.

585
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,433
Who was the pilot?

586
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,437
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

587
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,733
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

588
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,985
Last person to see them alive.

589
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,492
You okay?

590
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,453
Mm-hmm.

591
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,331
Back in a minute.

592
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,279
This isn't about
fighting wars.

593
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,198
It's about ending them.

594
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,747
I know Lawson was Kree.

595
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:39,834
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

596
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,670
Do you know anything
about this?

597
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,422
I just discovered
a mission report

598
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,132
sent from C-53.

599
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,341
There's only so much

600
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,052
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

601
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,893
Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

602
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,647
She was working
on a unique energy core.

603
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,107
Experimenting with tech

604
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,026
that apparently could help us
win the war.

605
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,034
She still here?

606
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,662
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

607
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,789
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,833
I want to question her alone.

609
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,795
Excellent work, Nicholas.

610
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,342
Does it say anything about me?

611
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,178
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

612
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,345
Why would it?

613
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,640
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

614
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,434
On C-53?

615
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,229
Mar-Vell is who I see

616
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,793
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

617
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:47,026
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

618
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,445
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

619
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,405
No, it's not. Because I
remember. I was here.

620
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,324
Stop. Remember your training.

621
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,743
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

622
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,246
Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.

623
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,416
She's on sublevel six.

624
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,959
I'll get off on five...

625
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,253
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

626
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,299
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

627
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,469
Right. Like we did in Havana.

628
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,523
We're nearing
the jump point.

629
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,233
Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.

630
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,152
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

631
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,946
Together.

632
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,824
Okay.

633
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,010
Vers!

634
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,972
Vers!

635
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,448
Fury's colluding
with the target.

636
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,866
Then why would he call us in?

637
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,494
All I know is we take
him in, too. Dead or alive.

638
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:21,954
Dead or alive?

639
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,095
Go. Go, go!

640
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,693
Was it something I said?

641
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:11,754
Mmm-mmm.

642
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:35,235
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

643
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,865
but they do
kinda complete the look.

644
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,784
Don't you think?

645
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,344
You called them in?

646
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,929
My bad.

647
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,986
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

648
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,822
They're not down here.

649
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,282
Let's try up there.

650
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,793
- What?
- Your communicator.

651
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,712
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

652
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,244
Do you know
how to fly this thing?

653
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,412
Uh, we'll see.

654
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,080
That's a yes or no question.

655
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,127
Yes.

656
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,215
That's what I'm talking about!

657
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,786
We got a stowaway.

658
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:53,999
Hang on, Goose.

659
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,214
Goose.

660
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,426
No, Goose.

661
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,931
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

662
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,058
Yes, that's right.

663
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,060
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

664
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,728
You the good Kitty,
that's right.

665
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:15,979
See anyone you know?

666
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,233
Funny story.

667
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:23,070
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

668
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,030
That was six years ago.

669
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,366
So, you think you're the pilot

670
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,649
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

671
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,203
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

672
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,287
could probably tell us.

673
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,039
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,958
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

675
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,419
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

676
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,840
That agent...

677
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,925
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

678
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,010
Coulson. The new guy.

679
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,428
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

680
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,347
Yeah, well, give him time.

681
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,976
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

682
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,311
Went with his gut
against orders.

683
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,813
That's a really
hard thing to do.

684
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,898
But it's what keeps us human.

685
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,401
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

686
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,769
Oh, I can see that about you.

687
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,991
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

688
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,367
I'm guessing that's not

689
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,035
standard
Kree operating procedure.

690
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,371
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

691
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,630
Ronan.

692
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,674
The Accusers completed
their operation...

693
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,318
but the greater mission
was a failure,

694
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,427
thanks to your team.

695
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,095
It was a trap

696
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,806
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

697
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,224
Give us their location.

698
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,868
We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.

699
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,228
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

700
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,939
No, we'll handle this.

701
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,191
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

702
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,235
is a threat
to Kree everywhere.

703
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,445
Where are they?

704
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,238
- They are...
- Lost.

705
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,575
They are lost for now.

706
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,410
But we will find them.

707
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,122
Do so, or we will.

708
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,670
Maintain the course for C-53.

709
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,150
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

710
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,612
Auntie Carol?

711
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,697
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

712
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,409
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

713
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,662
But we knew they were lying.

714
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,916
I'm not really
who you think I am.

715
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,094
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

716
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,263
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

717
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,974
You are
absolutely right, young lady.

718
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,558
There is no such thing.

719
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,102
'Cause if there were,

720
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,646
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

721
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:03,897
You don't believe me?

722
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,115
No way!

723
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,450
That's so cool!

724
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,178
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

725
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,328
with those hands.

726
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,538
Like what? Show us.

727
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,998
Maybe later.

728
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,500
I kept all your stuff.

729
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,835
I'll go get it.

730
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,421
You want to give her
a hand with that?

731
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:28,797
Hmm?

732
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,731
You don't remember anything?

733
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,485
I see flashes.

734
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,030
Little moments.

735
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,532
But I can't tell what's real.

736
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:01,121
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

737
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,957
maybe it'll all make sense.

738
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:10,297
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

739
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,007
Your usual move.

740
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,177
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

741
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,180
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

742
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,891
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

743
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,254
at doing something
that mattered.

744
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,103
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

745
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,289
and I wasn't about to argue,

746
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,106
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

747
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,400
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

748
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,110
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

749
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,379
Since it violates
the predetermined

750
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,404
rules of engagement.

751
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,840
I definitely
don't remember those.

752
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,532
Hmm. Of course you don't.

753
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:47,709
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

754
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,921
She said
she had lives to save.

755
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,357
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

756
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,424
but you said that...

757
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:58,136
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

758
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:02,557
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

759
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,144
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

760
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,649
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

761
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:15,487
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

762
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,740
I know
this must be hard for you.

763
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,826
Oh, what?
This part right here?

764
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,995
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

765
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,794
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

766
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,629
in a mission so secret

767
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,798
they act
like it never even happened.

768
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,387
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

769
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,347
too damn stubborn to die.

770
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,434
And now you come up in here
after six years...

771
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,478
with your supercharged
fire hands...

772
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,021
and you expect me
to call you...

773
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,440
I don't even know what. Vers?

774
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,153
Is that really
who you are now?

775
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,198
I don't know.

776
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,830
Come look!

777
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,838
This is me
and you on Halloween.

778
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:18,300
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

779
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,968
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

780
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,928
You didn't get along
with your parents...

781
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,638
so Mom said
we became your real family.

782
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,348
This is us on Christmas.

783
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,795
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

784
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,578
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

785
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,745
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

786
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,913
And this is right after
you graduated.

787
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,582
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

788
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,417
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

789
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,609
And this is you with Mom

790
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,003
right after a good day
of training.

791
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,427
These were
your three favorite guys.

792
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,907
Oh, wait. I forgot.

793
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,491
Your jacket.

794
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,035
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

795
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,745
after I spilled ketchup on it.

796
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,385
That was all
that survived the crash.

797
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,347
Or so we thought.

798
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,728
Don't answer that.

799
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,521
It's just my neighbor.

800
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,357
They can change into anyone.

801
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,696
Hi there.

802
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,073
What do you want?

803
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,201
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

804
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,786
This is my friend, Carol.

805
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,246
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

806
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,624
Yowzers.

807
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,001
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

808
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,463
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

809
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,710
and I was just wondering...

810
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:40,983
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

811
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,092
to get a closer look-see?

812
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,511
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

813
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:47,806
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

814
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,140
Mmm.

815
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,684
You're really working overtime

816
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,228
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

817
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,815
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

818
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,400
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

819
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,610
- Uh...
- Okay.

820
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,157
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

821
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,052
You never know
when you're gonna need

822
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,703
to borrow some sugar.

823
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,582
Now, hang on a second.

824
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:18,211
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

825
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:21,339
making a mess
of your friend's house...

826
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,383
It's a lovely home, miss.

827
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,718
Oh, my God!

828
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,803
What the hell?

829
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,017
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

830
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,061
Just don't kill me.

831
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,022
That would really complicate
the situation.

832
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,858
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

833
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,234
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

834
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,944
I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

835
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:46,740
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

836
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,907
Without deception.

837
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,409
And who is that out there?

838
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,620
Okay, that's a fair point...

839
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,497
but I'm sure
that you understand

840
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,708
I had to take
some precautions.

841
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:00,045
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

842
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,171
with your hands bound.

843
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,464
I just wanna talk.

844
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,631
Last time we talked,

845
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,984
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

846
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,469
That was before I knew
who you were.

847
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,764
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

848
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,933
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

849
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,062
of your voice
from a plane crash

850
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,563
six years ago...

851
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,942
on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

852
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,071
They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.

853
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,238
How'd you get it?

854
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,406
She don't understand.

855
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,009
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

856
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,493
that kind of allows me

857
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,620
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

858
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:34,947
Call me "young lady" again...

859
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,289
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

860
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,791
it's not supposed to be.

861
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,212
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

862
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,963
Your ass.

863
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,591
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

864
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,635
But, look,
I just need your help

865
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:49,928
decoding some coordinates.

866
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,935
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

867
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:55,266
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

868
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,188
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

869
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,815
Deal.

870
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,901
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

871
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,403
How'd that get in here?

872
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,612
Hmm?

873
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:09,989
The cat?

874
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,675
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

875
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,867
That's not a cat.

876
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,037
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

877
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,747
Mom?

878
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,256
Monica.

879
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,966
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

880
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,203
What's happening?

881
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,955
It's loading.

882
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,085
Punch in the coordinates

883
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:08,548
5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.

884
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,675
Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?

885
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,218
My laboratory.

886
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,596
Your laboratory?
What do you mean?

887
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:15,889
Oh, no.

888
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,057
Is that...
Wait, what is that?

889
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,559
It's not showing up
on my radar.

890
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,269
Go, Carol. Fly!

891
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,855
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

892
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,024
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

893
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,108
Yes, ma'am.

894
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,325
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

895
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,035
I never should have
brought you along.

896
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,249
Here come some G's.

897
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,521
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

898
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,200
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

899
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,247
Stay with me, Lawson!

900
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:41,849
Carol, come in. Do you copy?

901
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,435
Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

902
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,145
Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?

903
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,481
Yeah! I copy.

904
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,235
Doc?

905
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,696
Your blood.

906
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,156
It's blue.

907
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,535
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

908
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,372
Help me out, will ya?

909
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,461
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

910
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,713
Lawson?

911
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,883
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

912
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,136
To end wars?

913
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,931
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

914
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,601
Damn it!

915
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,186
My name is not Lawson.

916
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,690
My real name is Mar-Vell,

917
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,568
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

918
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,946
I would say
that you're delusional...

919
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,740
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

920
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,325
and your blood is blue.

921
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,038
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

922
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,040
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

923
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,333
any more regrets.

924
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,585
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

925
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,754
You gotta save 'em without me.

926
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,963
Save who? How?

927
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,008
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

928
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,468
What are you doing?

929
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,490
We have no interest
in hurting you.

930
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,200
No?

931
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:25,036
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

932
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,039
The energy core.

933
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,124
Where is it?

934
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,001
Pararescue's on the way.

935
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,712
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

936
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:37,674
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

937
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,883
No, wait!

938
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,683
You mean that energy core?

939
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,355
No!

940
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:39,360
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

941
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,528
Hold your fire.

942
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,415
There's nothing left.

943
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,250
The core has been destroyed.

944
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,845
She absorbed its power.

945
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,891
She's coming with us.

946
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,121
He lied to me.

947
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,709
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

948
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,378
Now, you understand.

949
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,048
What?
What do I understand now?

950
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,091
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

951
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,384
He killed her...

952
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,054
'cause she found out
that she was

953
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,349
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

954
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,475
No.

955
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,186
Your people are terrorists.

956
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,854
They kill innocents.

957
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,773
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

958
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,193
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

959
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,863
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

960
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,617
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

961
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,786
and they destroyed our planet.

962
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:15,540
And the handful of us
that are left

963
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:17,667
will be slaughtered next...

964
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,838
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

965
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,549
The core that she found

966
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,192
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

967
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,135
capable of carrying us
to safety.

968
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:32,265
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

969
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,102
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

970
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,436
wasn't to fight wars...

971
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,604
but to end them.

972
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:44,777
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

973
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:46,896
Well, I already destroyed it.

974
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,531
No, you destroyed the engine.

975
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,701
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

976
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:56,163
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

977
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,874
we can find it.

978
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,294
You'll use it to destroy us.

979
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:06,549
We just want a home.

980
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:16,017
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

981
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,019
Can't you see it now?

982
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,562
You're not one of them.

983
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,108
You don't know me.

984
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,945
You have no idea who I am.

985
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,325
I don't even know who I am!

986
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,912
You are Carol Danvers.

987
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,290
You are the woman
on that black box

988
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,918
risking her life
to do the right thing.

989
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,463
My best friend...

990
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,549
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

991
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,092
when no one else did.

992
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:55,806
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

993
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,226
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

994
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:02,480
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

995
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,649
You hear me?

996
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,860
Do you hear me?

997
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,119
Come here. Come here, girl.

998
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,205
I got you.

999
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,462
I know
I don't deserve your trust...

1000
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,839
but you were our only lead.

1001
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,258
We discovered
that your energy signature

1002
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,095
matched Mar-Veil's core.

1003
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,764
Now we know why.

1004
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:42,561
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1005
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,398
I just need your help

1006
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:49,026
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Veil's lab.

1007
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,780
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1008
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,865
For orbital position
and velocity.

1009
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,742
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1010
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,077
'cause it's not on Earth.

1011
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,328
That was the location

1012
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:00,639
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1013
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,039
If we track its course,

1014
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,417
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1015
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,293
It's just basic physics.

1016
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:09,755
In orbit?

1017
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,259
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1018
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,636
I mean,
you're my science guy, right?

1019
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,848
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1020
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,600
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1021
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,477
Mmm. We're going to space?

1022
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:24,645
In what?

1023
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,439
A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1024
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,733
I can handle
the modifications.

1025
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,568
Mmm. Your science guy.

1026
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,035
Well, I could use a copilot.

1027
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,788
No. No, I can't.

1028
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,832
I can't leave Monica.

1029
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,793
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1030
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,421
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1031
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,506
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1032
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:53,716
and you used to do that.

1033
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:57,386
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1034
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,031
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1035
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,639
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1036
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:01,950
with
a technologically-superior

1037
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:02,975
foreign enemy.

1038
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:04,810
Correct?

1039
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:05,978
That's what I'm saying.

1040
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,313
- You have to go!
- Monica!

1041
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,623
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1042
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:09,807
in the history of missions...

1043
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,752
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1044
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,027
and watch Fresh Prince
with me?

1045
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:14,779
What?

1046
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,131
I just think
you should consider...

1047
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:19,450
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1048
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,375
What's going on around here?

1049
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,543
I know, I know.

1050
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,128
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1051
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,385
Your mom's lucky.

1052
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,845
When they were
handing out kids,

1053
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,597
they gave her
the toughest one.

1054
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,182
Lieutenant Trouble.

1055
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,726
You remembered.

1056
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,521
Is that mine?

1057
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:50,856
No, no.

1058
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,776
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1059
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:56,821
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1060
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,657
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1061
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,868
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1062
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,787
with any sense of style...

1063
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,164
Hmm?

1064
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,334
Whoa.

1065
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,088
No.

1066
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:17,424
Uh-uh.

1067
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,469
Definitely not.

1068
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,808
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1069
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,070
Hmm.

1070
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:41,031
How do I look?

1071
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,870
Fresh.

1072
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,016
What took you so long?

1073
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,102
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1074
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,147
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1075
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,065
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1076
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:17,818
Okay, then let's do this.

1077
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,697
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1078
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,575
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1079
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:25,982
But you would never
tell me who.

1080
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:30,581
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1081
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,249
The transfusion.

1082
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,501
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1083
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:35,669
Whose blood?

1084
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:39,465
Hmm.

1085
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:50,851
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1086
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,857
What have you done with her?

1087
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,984
You're too late.

1088
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,627
She knows?

1089
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,603
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1090
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,771
Come at once.

1091
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:38,023
For the good of all Kree,
Commander...

1092
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:41,026
the infestation
will be eradicated.

1093
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,030
Passing 500 and climbing.

1094
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:51,412
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1095
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,748
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1096
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,626
And as long as he continues to
freak you out...

1097
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:58,961
like that...

1098
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,547
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1099
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,466
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1100
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,218
Can I ask you something?

1101
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,470
Do you just
turn into anything you want?

1102
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,306
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1103
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,557
Can you all do it?

1104
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,767
Physiologically? Yeah.

1105
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:16,103
But, uh, it takes practice...

1106
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,982
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1107
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,651
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

1108
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:23,938
What about a filing cabinet?

1109
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:27,406
Why would I
turn into a filing cabinet?

1110
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:28,657
A Venus flytrap?

1111
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,884
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1112
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,177
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1113
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,870
Switching engines

1114
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:35,247
from Scram jet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1115
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,424
Hey.

1116
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:48,093
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1117
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,178
Pretty much.

1118
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,922
Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1119
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:26,715
Where is it?

1120
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,971
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1121
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:38,394
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1122
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,943
Decloaking activated.

1123
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,716
Is that it? The core?

1124
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,177
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1125
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,392
Whoa.

1126
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,188
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1127
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,161
We're not alone.

1128
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:43,644
Talos!

1129
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,448
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1130
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,222
It's okay.

1131
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,812
We didn't know what to do.

1132
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:30,274
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1133
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,733
or the Kree would find us.

1134
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,278
You did the right thing.

1135
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,122
It's okay, it's okay.

1136
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,749
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1137
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,420
I am not gonna hurt you.

1138
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,589
She led me to you.

1139
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:55,841
I'm so sorry.

1140
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:58,802
I didn't know.

1141
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,012
Carol.

1142
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,806
This is war.

1143
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,019
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1144
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:09,563
But we're here now.

1145
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:13,025
You found my family.

1146
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:17,237
This is just the beginning.

1147
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,907
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1148
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,745
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1149
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:44,723
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1150
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,808
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1151
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:51,730
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1152
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:52,939
Uh-uh.

1153
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,995
What did you do
to your uniform?

1154
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,164
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1155
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,142
The Supreme Intelligence will
set her straight.

1156
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,542
You can see
they're not soldiers.

1157
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,045
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1158
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,380
And the core?

1159
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,215
You lied to me.

1160
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:22,302
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1161
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,684
What's given
can be taken away.

1162
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,532
Back here! Move, move!

1163
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:46,118
Get over here. Get down!

1164
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:49,329
Let's go! Go, move!

1165
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:29,745
There she is.

1166
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,957
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1167
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,042
This jacket.

1168
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,670
It's killer, by the way.

1169
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:41,548
Oh.

1170
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,675
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1171
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,594
Let me out.

1172
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,137
No can do.

1173
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,391
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1174
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,310
With what exactly?

1175
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:54,811
Your power comes from us.

1176
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,730
You didn't give me
these powers.

1177
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:57,939
The blast did.

1178
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,417
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1179
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:00,567
to control them on your own.

1180
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,622
Flerken.

1181
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,290
High.

1182
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,506
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1183
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,636
Human male.

1184
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,055
Low to none.

1185
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,516
That thing's clearly busted.

1186
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,810
Load the Flerken
onto the Helion.

1187
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:37,562
Eject the others into space.

1188
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,484
You did good, Ace.

1189
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,111
Thanks to you...

1190
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,239
those insidious shapeshifters

1191
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,865
will threaten
our borders no more.

1192
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:51,284
I used to believe your lies...

1193
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:54,079
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1194
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:55,789
You're talking
about destroying them

1195
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:57,499
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1196
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:58,750
And neither will I.

1197
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,087
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1198
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:03,713
You stole me.

1199
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,591
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1200
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,560
It's cute how hard you try.

1201
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,355
But remember...

1202
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,899
without us...

1203
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,150
Give it up, Carol.

1204
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27,070
Stay down!

1205
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:28,321
...you're weak.

1206
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,574
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

1207
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,075
You're flawed.

1208
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,482
Are you trying
to kill yourself?

1209
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:35,412
Helpless.

1210
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:36,775
You're too emotional
and so weak.

1211
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,415
You don't belong out here!

1212
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,500
We saved you.

1213
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,210
- Control it.
- I told you,

1214
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:43,295
- Carol.
- They'll never

1215
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,418
- let you fly.
- This ain't

1216
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:45,606
- a game for little girls.
- You kiss like a horse.

1217
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,830
You won't last
a week, Danvers.

1218
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:52,929
Without us, you're only human.

1219
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:55,640
You're right.

1220
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,019
I'm only human.

1221
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:36,306
On Hala, you were reborn...

1222
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:37,849
Vers.

1223
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:45,774
My name is Carol.

1224
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:02,123
She's trying to break out.

1225
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:49,754
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1226
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:52,298
But what happens when...

1227
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:57,470
I'm finally set free?

1228
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:40,513
You know you're glowing,
right?

1229
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,681
I'll explain it later.

1230
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:45,560
Take the Tesseract.

1231
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:46,853
Leave the lunchbox.

1232
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,521
- Me?
- Yes.

1233
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,023
I'm not touching that thing.

1234
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,590
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1235
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,323
Whoa!

1236
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:07,457
Get the Skrulls
on the Quad jet and go.

1237
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:09,751
Take the Flerken with you.

1238
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,170
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

1239
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,924
I'm picking you up now.

1240
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:21,346
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1241
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:27,769
Oh, hey, guys.

1242
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,316
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1243
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,321
I used to find you amusing.

1244
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,031
Let's put an end to this.

1245
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,483
Okay.

1246
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,111
Good Kitty.

1247
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:06,367
You knew all along.

1248
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:08,693
Is that why we never hung out?

1249
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:09,913
No, I just never liked you.

1250
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:18,171
Incoming!

1251
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:27,680
Hey, in a hurry?

1252
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:31,684
Don't make me do this.

1253
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:32,936
Okay.

1254
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:49,786
Come on, do your thing!

1255
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,080
Come on!

1256
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,833
Come on!

1257
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:00,338
Damn it, Goose.

1258
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:01,547
Pick a side.

1259
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,637
Take them to the hangar, too.

1260
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:09,597
We'll blast them all
into space.

1261
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:12,684
Play it cool.

1262
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,520
Just like Havana.

1263
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:19,440
Do you have the thing?

1264
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:21,150
Flerken kitty ate it.

1265
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:35,915
Come on, move!

1266
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:37,250
Move!

1267
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,127
Follow my lead.

1268
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,132
Cover her eyes.

1269
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,142
Onto the ship!

1270
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,060
Let's go! Let's go!

1271
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,918
Nice diversion.

1272
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,046
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1273
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:22,146
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1274
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:23,398
On it.

1275
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:29,195
You all right, friend?

1276
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:32,198
Never better.

1277
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,788
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1278
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,306
Yes! Boom!

1279
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:37,532
Whoo!

1280
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,203
What the hell was that?

1281
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:07,728
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1282
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,407
That's impossible.

1283
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:03,951
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1284
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,662
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1285
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,625
That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1286
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,255
Take her down.

1287
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:37,234
Whoo!

1288
01:43:26,826 --> 01:43:28,744
Return to the jump point.

1289
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,914
We'll be back for the weapon.

1290
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:34,667
The core?

1291
01:43:36,502 --> 01:43:37,795
The woman.

1292
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:27,386
I'm so proud of you.

1293
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:30,765
You've come a long way

1294
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:32,808
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1295
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,478
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1296
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:37,772
long enough to take me on?

1297
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:40,608
Or will they get the better
of you as always?

1298
01:44:42,151 --> 01:44:43,819
I always told you...

1299
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:45,279
you'll be ready

1300
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,698
the day you can knock me down
as yourself.

1301
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:49,325
This is that moment.

1302
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:51,994
This is that moment, Vers!

1303
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:53,245
Turn off the light show...

1304
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:56,749
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1305
01:45:12,264 --> 01:45:14,266
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1306
01:45:30,115 --> 01:45:32,159
Hala.

1307
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:33,953
I can't go back empty-handed.

1308
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:35,871
You won't be empty-handed.

1309
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:38,332
I'm sending you
with a message.

1310
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:41,669
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1311
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:44,588
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1312
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:47,842
You can't do this.

1313
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:10,322
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1314
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:12,926
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1315
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,034
Ow!

1316
01:46:14,118 --> 01:46:15,369
Mother Flerken!

1317
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:16,620
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1318
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:18,622
It's just a scratch.

1319
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:20,291
No.

1320
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,675
I can't believe

1321
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:31,236
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1322
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,636
and I missed it.

1323
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,388
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1324
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:36,599
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1325
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:38,805
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1326
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:40,644
I'll consider it...

1327
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:43,814
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1328
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:45,149
How's your eye?

1329
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:47,359
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1330
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:48,736
Just so I'm clear...

1331
01:46:48,903 --> 01:46:50,279
you were Soh-Larr...

1332
01:46:50,446 --> 01:46:52,489
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

1333
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,326
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1334
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:58,329
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1335
01:46:58,495 --> 01:46:59,747
It is a little like stealing.

1336
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:01,206
Whose side are you on here?

1337
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:03,184
You're good to go here
until you recover...

1338
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:06,253
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1339
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,005
I could go back
to being your boss.

1340
01:47:08,172 --> 01:47:09,173
Uh, please don't.

1341
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:12,176
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1342
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:14,678
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1343
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:16,847
Don't ever change your eyes.

1344
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,450
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1345
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:20,142
I was trying
not to panic...

1346
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:21,769
I'll help you find a home.

1347
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,013
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1348
01:47:26,065 --> 01:47:28,233
They can stay here
with us.

1349
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:29,985
Can't they, Mom?

1350
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:32,071
They won't be safe here, baby.

1351
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:34,239
Auntie Carol's right.

1352
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:35,407
They need their own home.

1353
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:38,410
I'll be back
before you know it.

1354
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:42,164
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1355
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:45,125
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1356
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:46,669
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1357
01:47:46,752 --> 01:47:48,504
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

1358
01:47:58,263 --> 01:48:00,683
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1359
01:48:01,392 --> 01:48:02,393
Hidden.

1360
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:04,603
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1361
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:06,355
Mar-Vell.

1362
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:07,815
That's what I said.

1363
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:10,317
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1364
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:11,819
Mar-Vell.

1365
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:13,129
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1366
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:14,446
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1367
01:48:28,377 --> 01:48:29,420
Not ringing any bells?

1368
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:31,380
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1369
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:48,230
I upgraded it.

1370
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:51,316
Range should be
a couple galaxies, at least.

1371
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:56,155
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1372
01:48:56,321 --> 01:48:59,867
For emergencies only, okay?

1373
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:06,623
Well...

1374
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,585
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1375
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:11,795
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1376
01:49:14,006 --> 01:49:15,841
Oh!

1377
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:30,606
We got
the ketchup stain off.

1378
01:49:36,028 --> 01:49:37,821
Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1379
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,033
Hmm.

1380
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:49,708
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1381
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:04,556
Go on.

1382
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:14,376
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1383
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:20,507
So, is it true?

1384
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:22,986
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1385
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:25,387
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1386
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:30,017
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1387
01:51:30,267 --> 01:51:31,351
Understood.

1388
01:51:32,895 --> 01:51:33,896
I'm sorry to report

1389
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:35,123
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1390
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:37,357
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1391
01:51:38,984 --> 01:51:40,694
I'll let you know
when it does.

1392
01:51:40,861 --> 01:51:42,237
Then what?

1393
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:43,780
Sir?

1394
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:45,282
We have no idea

1395
01:51:45,365 --> 01:51:48,410
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1396
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:50,579
And our one-woman
security force

1397
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:51,914
had a prior commitment...

1398
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,832
on the other side
of the universe.

1399
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:58,712
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1400
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:02,007
We need to find more.

1401
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:03,300
More weapons?

1402
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:05,093
More heroes.

1403
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:06,887
You think you can find
others like her?

1404
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,973
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1405
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,351
Get some rest, sir.

1406
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:15,270
You got
a big decision to make.

1407
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:16,076
This is a nightmare.

1408
01:55:17,786 --> 01:55:19,996
I've had better nightmares.

1409
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:23,208
Hey.

1410
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:26,378
So, that thing just stopped

1411
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:28,171
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1412
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:31,883
What do we got?

1413
01:55:32,801 --> 01:55:35,095
Whatever signal it was sending
finally crapped out.

1414
01:55:35,303 --> 01:55:36,406
I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1415
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:37,431
We did.

1416
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:40,434
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1417
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:43,103
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1418
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:44,688
We don't even know
what this is.

1419
01:55:44,855 --> 01:55:47,232
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1420
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:50,026
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1421
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:52,696
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1422
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:57,033
Where's Fury?
