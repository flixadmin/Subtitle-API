1
00:00:17,398 --> 00:00:20,233
<i>Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary</i>

2
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,069
since Velez Sir Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,405
shortly after takeoff
from JFK airport.

4
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,573
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,410
None more so than
Mt. Abraham High School,

6
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:34,580
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:36,416
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,251
<i>that has turned
this tragic story</i>

9
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,386
<i>into something even
stranger.</i>

10
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:44,123
<i>The survivors who managed to get
off the plane before it crashed</i>

11
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,225
<i>died soon thereafter
in a series</i>

12
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:48,761
<i>of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.</i>

13
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:52,198
<i>Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,</i>

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,267
<i>but to others,
they're an indication</i>

15
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:56,902
<i>that there are more
sinister events taking place.</i>

16
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,938
<i>That's the contention
of tonight's guest.</i>

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,107
<i>Thank you for joining us
this evening.</i>

18
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,575
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

19
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:04,677
<i>And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.</i>

20
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:07,347
<i>Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking</i>

21
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,649
<i>about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.</i>

22
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:13,386
<i>Here's your chance
to set the record straight.</i>

23
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:15,888
<i>Great. Okay.</i>

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,558
<i>I believe that there's
a sort of force,</i>

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,562
<i>an unseen malevolent
presence...</i>

26
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:25,564
<i>That's all around us
every day.</i>

27
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:29,002
<i>And it determines
when we live and die.</i>

28
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,572
<i>And some people call
this force the devil,</i>

29
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:36,242
<i>but I think that
whole religious thing is--</i>

30
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:39,578
<i>so I prefer to call it
death itself.</i>

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,248
<i>So I'm surrounded by death?</i>

32
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,417
<i>Absolutely. Absolutely.</i>

33
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:47,920
<i>Every day, everywhere,
all the time.</i>

34
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,589
<i>And that's what I want people
to understand--</i>

35
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:52,591
<i>that death
has this grand design</i>

36
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,760
<i>that we all fit into.</i>

37
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:57,596
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

38
00:01:57,598 --> 00:01:59,765
and took the other
survivors with him,

39
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:02,368
he basically screwed up
death's plan.

40
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,204
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

41
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:08,374
<i>And the fact that all
of the survivors have died</i>

42
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,510
<i>is your evidence of this?</i>

43
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:15,214
<i>Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,</i>

44
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:17,316
<i>but it's the way
that they died.</i>

45
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:20,886
<i>I mean, there were
so many weird,</i>

46
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:23,756
<i>seemingly random things
about the way they died.</i>

47
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:27,560
<i>It just didn't
make sense.</i>

48
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,563
<i>And that's the proof
there's something out there--</i>

49
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:34,300
<i>Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation</i>

50
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:37,437
<i>of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.</i>

51
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,572
<i>Kimberly.</i>

52
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,907
<i>You should be more
open-minded about--</i>

53
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,777
<i>What happened after
that was just coincidence.</i>

54
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,712
<i>May I finish?</i>

55
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:49,915
<i>Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.</i>

56
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,251
<i>But not all of them
including their teachers.</i>

57
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,753
<i>Yes, but
people die all the time,</i>

58
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:57,290
<i>so why should this be
any different?</i>

59
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,758
It forced people
to question

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,361
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

61
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:04,363
What if they
were something more?

62
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,532
What if you could do
something about it?

63
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:09,402
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

64
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:12,771
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

65
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,541
<i>That's exactly
what I'm saying.</i>

66
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,876
Exactly it.

67
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:19,778
And in order to survive--

68
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,281
<i>the only way to survive</i>

69
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:24,617
<i>is to look beneath
the visible world.</i>

70
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:28,621
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

71
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:31,190
And today may be your day
to die.

72
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,571
Okay, I'll call you.

73
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,740
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

74
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:49,908
Credit card,
cell phone, triple-a card?

75
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,411
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

76
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:56,249
All right. Fix-a-flat, road
flares, sunblock, mace?

77
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:58,684
Condoms, whips, chains.

78
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,420
Just kidding, Mr. Corman.

79
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:03,356
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

80
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:05,958
That makes me feel
a lot better, thanks.

81
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,428
- Okay.
- All righty.

82
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,798
<i>Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.</i>

83
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,869
Go on.

84
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,004
Okay, I'll call you.

85
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,043
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

86
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,312
Whatever,
your dad's cool.

87
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:31,417
Buckle up!

88
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,112
Watch it!

89
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:04,783
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.

90
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:12,057
<i>- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.</i>

91
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,462
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mom?

92
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:18,331
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

93
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,561
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

94
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:23,302
Whatever.

95
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:25,871
<i>What are we going
to do in Daytona?</i>

96
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:28,040
<i>We're going to see
lots of honeys there.</i>

97
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:30,976
<i>We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna
smoke this big "El gagerero,"</i>

98
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,845
<i>we're gonna have this
awesome party...</i>

99
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:35,414
Pileup! Pileup!

100
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,728
<i>A candlelight vigil

101
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,897

00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,358
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's dad.</i>

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,107
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

106
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,695
<i>Listen, your car's leaking
transmission fluid.</i>

107
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:24,604
<i>So I want you to get
it checked right away.</i>

108
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,298
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>

109
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,699
<i>I'll do that.</i>

110
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:29,034
<i>I mean it. Take care of it.</i>

111
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,605
<i>- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.</i>

112
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,873
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.

113
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,876
<i>- I love you.
- Bye, honey.</i>

114
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:40,413
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!

115
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,982
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!

116
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,321
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

117
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,590
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

118
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:53,390
Fuck man, there's a
fucking cop behind us!

119
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,560
Pull in the right Lane now!

120
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:56,128
Shit.

121
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,339
Seriously, put it out.

122
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:08,507
- Put that thing out.
- All right.

123
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,075
Wait, wait, wait!

124
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:11,777
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.

125
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,915
Hey, it's Kat.

126
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,017

what the hell?!

127
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,786
<i>Just wait. Not you.</i>

128
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,705
I think we better pull over
and check the car, because--

129
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:42,207
Kimberly, the car
is going to be fine.

130
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:45,544
Your dad's going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

131
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:47,312
Okay?

132
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,743
<i>Look at that guy.</i>

133
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,947
<i>He's drinking a beer.</i>

134
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:26,452
Oh, yeah,
that's real responsible.

135
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:03,055
You ever hear

136

what? I'm wearing
my seatbelt.

137

Bitch.

141

Aaah!

153
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:42,741
There's going to be

- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?

157
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:53,752
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

158
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:56,755
<i>...Of flight 180 will
be held at 8:00 P.M. tonight</i>

159
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,124
<i>at the Mt. Abraham
High School auditorium.</i>

160
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:02,728
"Highway to hell."
"Highway to hell..."

161
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,362
"Highway to hell"?

162
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,433
okay, Kimberly,
you're scaring me.

163
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,971
<i>- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.</i>

164
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,400
Are you out of your mind?
What the hell are you doing?

165
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,807
What the fuck, Kimberly?

166
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,986
What's this?

167
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:36,061
Kimberly, you just got
to breathe.

168
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:37,796
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-o is coming.

169
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:39,898
- Let's fucking roll.
- What?

170
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,320
Oh my God.

171
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:42,000
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me?

172
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:43,902
- Huh?
- Dano, just shut up!

173
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,337
Just stay cool.

174
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:55,614
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

175
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:11,029
What's going on here?

176
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:13,431
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

177
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,533
I saw it.

178
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,535
There were bodies
everywhere.

179
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:19,537
There were logs--
I saw it.

180
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,206
It just happened.

181
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,509
All right, miss, I'd like you to
please step out of the vehicle.

182
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,589
Just pull over!

183
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,992
I know,
mommy's hungry, too.

184
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:45,730
Come on.

185
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:48,200
Come on!

186
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:50,235
Oh, fuck this.

187
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:53,505
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

188
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,252
Fuck.

189
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,621
What the hell
is going on up there?

190
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:11,156
<i>Excuse me!</i>

191
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:13,826
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

192
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:14,798
- I have a delivery--

193
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:16,829
- You need to get back
into your vehicles.

194
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,630
- Just move it--
- now!

195
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,637
That's it!

196
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,274
That's the truck that's
going to kill everybody.

197
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,076
<i>You need to stop
that truck!</i>

198
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:33,011
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

199
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,613
<i>Why won't you listen to me?!</i>

200
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:40,452
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

201
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:50,229
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

202
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,898
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

203
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
Kimberly, what's going on?

204
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:23,295
No!

205
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,715
Listen, sir, this girl
is really freaked out.

206
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:46,519
In fact, all of them are
scared as you can imagine.

207
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:47,219
Scared?!

208
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:50,555
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

209
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:52,057
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis--

210
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,892
yesterday the kid wins
the lotto.

211
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:55,894
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

212
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:57,896
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

213
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,731
I should be
so damn "unlucky."

214
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,233
Go babysit the rest
of them.

215
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:03,001
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

216
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:06,171
Hey, excuse me--

217
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:08,006
We're trying to do
the best we can.

218
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:10,675
We're going to get you out
of here as soon as possible.

219
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:13,278
<i>I just think it's
a bunch of bullshit.</i>

220
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:21,186
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

221
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:22,955
with detective Suby...

222
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,459
But would you mind
telling me what happened?

223
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,129
It was like
I was there.

224
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:37,302
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

225
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:41,506
I just felt wrong,
just like...

226
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:42,874
Just like what?

227
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,382
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

228
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,750
You guys all heard
about flight 180, right?

229
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,752
<i>The kid who got off
the plane?</i>

230
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:57,022
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

231
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,227
My premonition
was just like his.

232
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,234
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Come on.</i>

233
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,003
You must have read
about the kid

234
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,005
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

235
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:15,007
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

236
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:17,742
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

237
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,245
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

238
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,681
So a month goes by,
right?

239
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:25,717
Everything seems cool.

240
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,821
But then all the survivors
start to die one-by-one.

241
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:32,457
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

242
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:39,531
You know, some people even say that
death itself was stalking them,

243
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,866
hunting each one down

244
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:45,470
until they were all...
Dead.

245
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,009
Please.

246
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,812
<i>There was one survivor.</i>

247
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:58,716
Clear Rivers is in
a padded room

248
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:01,520
at the Stonybrook
Institution.

249
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,121
Well, that's encouraging.

250
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:08,660
<i>Okay, you want me
to believe this is true,</i>

251
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,496
<i>that this is happening
all over again?</i>

252
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,598
I don't know
why we're even here.

253
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:16,834
What do you want from me?

254
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:19,704
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

255
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:22,240
we all should have died
in that pileup.

256
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,509
Which means death
could be coming for us.

257
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,411
<i>Yeah, like...</i>

258
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:29,881
What if we're all getting that
"different strokes" curse or something?

259
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:32,684
I think you're all
are certifiable.

260
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:34,886
I can't believe I've been
listening to this crap.

261
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,689
<i>Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.</i>

262
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:40,459
Mrs. Carpenter,
please.

263
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,132
Kimberly!

264
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,402
Oh baby!

265
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:54,206
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

266
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,773
Shh, shh.

267
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,210
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

268
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,732
Could I ask you something?

269
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,235
Anything.

270
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:26,070
Did mom ever have any...

271
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:29,674
I don't know, weird
feelings about anything?

272
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:32,477
What do you mean?

273
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,683
Like visions
or premonitions.

274
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,254
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

275
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:45,089
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

276
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:47,425
but I'm really scared
for the others.

277
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:51,196
I don't know, I have
this really bad feeling.

278
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:54,032
What?

279
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,702
It's not over yet.

280
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,894
Jesus Christ!

281
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:24,829
Shit!

282
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:58,256
<i>Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.</i>

283
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:00,258
<i>Sorry I haven't called.</i>

284
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,027
<i>Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.</i>

285
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:05,730
<i>Let's hook up.
Call me.</i>

286
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,199
<i>Yeah.</i>

287
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,034
<i>Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.</i>

288
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:12,270
<i>We met at Tucker's party
last year?</i>

289
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:15,039
<i>I know it's been awhile, but
I've been thinking about you.</i>

290
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,709
<i>I just wanted to say congratulations.</i>

291
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:19,744
<i>So give me a call.</i>

292
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,979
<i>555-0123. Bye.</i>

293
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,617
You little bastard.

294
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,251
Shit.

295
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,992
Come on.
Come on.

296
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,369
Fuck. Fuck.

297
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:56,481
Come on!

298
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,249
Come on.

299
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,190
Fuck!

300
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:07,525
Jesus!

301
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:16,668
Oh!

302
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,610
<i>Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.</i>

303
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:28,212
<i>If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,</i>

304
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:31,048
<i>and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.</i>

305
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,986
<i>Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!</i>

306
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:05,784
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

307
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:07,485
Aah!

308
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,417
Jesus!

309
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:45,657
Come on.

310
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,366
Aah!

311
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,971
<i>Shit, I'm lucky.</i>

312
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:04,275
Aah!

313
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,313
Jesus Christ!

314
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,334
No, mother,

315
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:40,538
just turn on any station.

316
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,374
Well, I don't know how you
missed it, it's been on all day.

317
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:46,044
Yes, mother,
channel 4 is fine.

318
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:49,213
Okay-- here it is!
I got to go, okay?

319
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:51,082
I got to go!

320
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:54,052
To recap our top story,

321
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:57,722
route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

322
00:27:57,724 --> 00:28:00,892
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

323
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:03,995
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

324
00:28:03,997 --> 00:28:07,164
<i>hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.</i>

325
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,234
<i>So far police are refusing to
release the names of the victims</i>

326
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:12,003
<i>until the families
are notified.</i>

327
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:13,738
<i>The camera
of a highway patrol car</i>

328
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,707
<i>managed to catch
this shocking footage.</i>

329
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,842
<i>- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.</i>

330
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:20,011
<i>And smashes
into a red SUV.</i>

331
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:23,681
<i>- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...</i>

332
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:25,182
Leave it.

333
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:26,684
<i>...may have
saved her life.</i>

334
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,620
<i>He pulled her back
at the last second</i>

335
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:30,521
<i>just as the semi plowed
into the vehicle.</i>

336
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:32,356
<i>The passengers inside
the SUV...</i>

337
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:35,459
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

338
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:39,497
In other news, a freak accident
took the life of a lotto winner.

339
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,365
<i>- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.</i>

340
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:45,202
<i>Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.</i>

341
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:47,972
<i>But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today</i>

342
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:50,642
<i>while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.</i>

343
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:52,476
He managed to make it out
of the building,

344
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:54,712
<i>but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape</i>

345
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:56,714
<i>slipped and impaled him.</i>

346
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:59,216
<i>Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.</i>

347
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:09,426
<i>Come in.</i>

348
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:12,764
Hey, buddy.

349
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:17,101
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

350
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:22,273
And then tomorrow it's off to the
dentist, which I know you love.

351
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,777
Now, get some rest.

352
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:33,017
- Mom.
- Yeah?

353
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:35,119
You think those guys
were bsing us today?

354
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,988
Yeah.

355
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,356
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

356
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,293
Lights out.

357
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:42,913
<i>At the request
of the patient,</i>

358
00:31:42,915 --> 00:31:45,015
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

359
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,418
Nail files,
pencils, pens,

360
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,421
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

361
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:53,090
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

362
00:31:53,092 --> 00:31:56,260
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

363
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:59,397
paper clips, watches, money
clip, pocket knives,

364
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,099
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone--

365
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:04,368
you have a cell phone
on you?

366
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,371
--poisons, pills,
medications.

367
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:10,040
Great. And let me see
your nails.

368
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,710
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

369
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:14,712
Wait.

370
00:32:14,714 --> 00:32:16,714
Is she dangerous
or something?

371
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:18,649
No, honey,
she expects you are.

372
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:27,725
<i>Get him off me.
Get him off me!</i>

373
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:38,001
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

374
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,003
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

375
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,134
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

376
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,345
They told me
you had something to do

377
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:23,046
with the crash on route 23.

378
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:26,049
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

379
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:29,319
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

380
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:32,990
And I saved some people.

381
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:35,292
And now you think death
is after you.

382
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:39,263
Nice work.

383
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:42,466
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

384
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:45,836
Anything else?

385
00:33:45,838 --> 00:33:48,406
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

386
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:50,574
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

387
00:33:50,576 --> 00:33:53,010
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

388
00:33:53,012 --> 00:33:55,379
List? What list?

389
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,548
Death's list.

390
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:02,352
The survivors of flight 180

391
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:04,688
died in the exact order

392
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,458
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

393
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:10,628
That was death's
original design.

394
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,731
The list.

395
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:16,300
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

396
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,035
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

397
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,304
You said someone else died
last night.

398
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:22,406
That means someone must
have intervened.

399
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:26,744
Officer Burke pulled me away from
the crash that killed my friends.

400
00:34:26,746 --> 00:34:28,712
Congratulations.

401
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:31,381
You'll be the last to go.

402
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:34,051
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

403
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:35,653
it'll come back for you.

404
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:39,056
It always does.

405
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,059
This doesn't make sense.

406
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:46,497
You said that you die in the order
you're originally meant to.

407
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:50,434
<i>But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.</i>

408
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,369
Wait.

409
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:55,840
Dead last?

410
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:59,844
Backwards.

411
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:01,846
Are you sure?

412
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:05,683
<i>In my premonition</i>

413
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:07,685
<i>that Nora woman
and her kid died.</i>

414
00:35:07,687 --> 00:35:10,788
<i>Then Evan,
then me and my friends.</i>

415
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,960
Why is this even
happening to me?

416
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:22,800
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

417
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:26,871
So, what am I
supposed to do?

418
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:28,806
Clear.

419
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,376
Watch out for the signs.

420
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:34,044
What?

421
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:40,050
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

422
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:42,319
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

423
00:35:44,723 --> 00:35:47,224
The songs on the radio.

424
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:50,561
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

425
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:52,496
<i>Well, don't ignore it.</i>

426
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,264
Recognizing those signs
usually means

427
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,299
the difference between
life and death.

428
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:58,836
You got to help me.

429
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:00,571
I don't have
to do anything.

430
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:02,339
<i>But you beat it.</i>

431
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,174
Take a look around.

432
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:06,109
What did I beat, Kimberly?

433
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:10,380
If you were smart,
you'd save yourself

434
00:36:10,382 --> 00:36:11,815
and just forget
about the others.

435
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:14,484
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

436
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:16,687
My friends are dead.

437
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:18,622
That's how I can say that.

438
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:23,861
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

439
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,031
Get out.

440
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,966
Before you hurt me
or yourself.

441
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:36,273
- All right, you know what?
- What?

442
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:37,741
I think you're a coward.

443
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:39,443
<i>You hide out in here
because you're</i>

444
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:42,713
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

445
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:44,615
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

446
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:24,788
<i>I tried calling
you last night,</i>

447
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,857
but your father said
you were sleeping.

448
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,525
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

449
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:32,029
I've been getting calls all morning
from everyone who was on the on-ramp.

450
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:34,231
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

451
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:38,702
Wait, so... You believe
all this death stuff?

452
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:41,371
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

453
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:43,540
Until last year
when I was dispatched

454
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,909
to clean up one of the
flight 180 survivors.

455
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:47,645
Clean up, I don't--

456
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,818
- did you see that?
- See what?

457
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,387
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

458
00:37:57,389 --> 00:37:59,389
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

459
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:01,224
If Clear's right about
the order,

460
00:38:01,226 --> 00:38:04,461
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

461
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:06,063
I'm not following you.

462
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:07,831
They're next
on death's list.

463
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,267
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

464
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,084
<i>The doctor's ready
for you, now.</i>

465
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,985
If he gives me the gas

466
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:04,154
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

467
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:07,691
- We ain't paying.
- Tim.

468
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,167
There you are.

469
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:19,169
What happened
to you yesterday, Tim?

470
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:20,241
We missed you in here.

471
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,672
We got hung up by that
accident on route 23.

472
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:25,275
Good lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

473
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,213
Your mom says you've been
having some pain lately.

474
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:31,414
Not really.

475
00:39:56,707 --> 00:39:58,708
I'm a bit
disappointed, Tim.

476
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,993
Does your mom know
you've been smoking?

477
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:01,678
Uh-huh.

478
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,380
Ow.

479
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:05,615
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

480
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:08,418
Damn those pigeons.

481
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,189
How many times am I going to have
to replace those goddamn windows?

482
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:17,560
<i>We can't
do it, boss, we can't do it!</i>

483
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:20,264
This will only sting
for a moment.

484
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:22,565
Open big.

485
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,234
Little bit wider.

486
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,236
Wider.

487
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:28,672
Okay.

488
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:32,075
<i>Oh God.</i>

489
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:34,011
How do they
expect me to...

490
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,680
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

491
00:40:36,682 --> 00:40:39,016
- Yeah.
- Okay.

492
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:40,818
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

493
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,622
You're have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

494
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:50,760
<i>What?! I can't hear you!</i>

495
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,830
<i>Excuse me, what?!</i>

496
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:56,934
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

497
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:59,769
Jean! Let me
get this started.

498
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:03,673
<i>Tim, you'll be awake
and a little groggy,</i>

499
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,775
<i>but you're not going
to be able to move much.</i>

500
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:33,403
Okay, great, thanks.
All right, turn around.

501
00:41:33,405 --> 00:41:36,606
The cleaning lady said they're at the
Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

502
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:43,347
<i>Goddamn it anyway.</i>

503
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:52,923
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

504
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,659
Not again. Careful.

505
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:39,702
There we go.

506
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,014
<i>Jean, how is
Tim doing in there?</i>

507
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:57,921
What did he say
about your tooth?

508
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,324
- Did he say--
- I can't remember.

509
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:02,059
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

510
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:04,294
What? Pigeons?

511
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,098
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

512
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:12,002
- No-oo!
- Tim!

513
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:13,170
<i>Look out!</i>

514
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:17,341
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

515
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:38,061
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

516
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:41,999
- No, but she's next--
- Right now I don't think she cares.

517
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:03,286
This is really happening
again, isn't it?

518
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:07,690
I hoped we'd get there

519
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:09,692
and they'd be fine,

520
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:12,029
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

521
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:15,798
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

522
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:19,969
But we're all going
to die, aren't we?

523
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,309
I'm so scared.

524
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:30,247
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

525
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:34,017
But I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

526
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,394
A second one just died.

527
00:44:44,396 --> 00:44:46,129
A 15-year-old kid.

528
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,300
I hope you're ready
for this.

529
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:03,446
It's this way.

530
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:08,351
How is this guy
going to help us anyway?

531
00:45:08,353 --> 00:45:10,853
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

532
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:12,789
about death
than he ever told us.

533
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:19,029
Shouldn't we knock first?

534
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:21,298
He probably already knows
we're coming.

535
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:10,613
Hello, Clear.

536
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:18,455
I've been expecting you.

537
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:20,390
Oh my God.

538
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:24,827
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

539
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:27,964
Just a simple question and we'll leave
you alone with your new friend.

540
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,701
Dead...

541
00:46:31,703 --> 00:46:34,471
Yet still fresh.

542
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:38,041
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

543
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:40,143
so if you happen to know
how to stop death,

544
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:41,878
it would be really great
if you told us.

545
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:44,714
You can't cheat death.

546
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:47,550
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

547
00:46:47,552 --> 00:46:50,487
You told me death
has a distinct design.

548
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:51,988
<i>But Alex
and I cheated death,</i>

549
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,890
<i>not once but dozens
of times.</i>

550
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:56,426
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

551
00:46:56,428 --> 00:46:59,229
Such fire in you now.

552
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:01,898
People are always
most alive

553
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,666
<i>just before they die.</i>

554
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:05,402
Don't you think?

555
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,553
Look, please...

556
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:33,363
If you know of anything
that could help us,

557
00:47:33,365 --> 00:47:36,433
what harm could it do?

558
00:47:36,435 --> 00:47:39,969
Only new life
can defeat death.

559
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:42,072
What the hell
does that mean?

560
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:46,476
Some people say there's a
balance to everything.

561
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,546
For every life
there's a death,

562
00:47:49,548 --> 00:47:51,881
and for every death
there is a life.

563
00:47:51,883 --> 00:47:54,750
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

564
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:57,187
<i>that can
invalidate the list,</i>

565
00:47:57,189 --> 00:48:00,457
force death
to start anew.

566
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:11,000
You have to follow
the signs...

567
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:12,802
Kimberly.

568
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:17,107
How do you know my name?

569
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:33,456
<i>- Whoa!
- Wait a second.</i>

570
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:36,526
"New life defeats death"?
"Follow the signs"?

571
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:38,528
Where did you
find that guy?

572
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,363
I thought he was
supposed to help us,

573
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:41,764
not freak us out.

574
00:48:47,037 --> 00:48:48,704
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

575
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:54,043
I'm thinking suck
on my junk, bee-atch.

576
00:48:54,045 --> 00:48:55,811
Little punk.

577
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:09,792
What is it?

578
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:12,162
<i>What did you see?</i>

579
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:27,910
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

580
00:49:27,912 --> 00:49:30,180
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

581
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:32,282
What did you see?!

582
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:37,353
I was driving a white van.

583
00:49:37,355 --> 00:49:39,755
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

584
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:41,691
because I crashed
into a lake.

585
00:49:41,693 --> 00:49:43,893
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

586
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:46,762
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

587
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:51,867
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

588
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:54,604
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

589
00:49:54,606 --> 00:49:57,907
He said only new life
can defeat death.

590
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,077
If she gives birth
to a baby

591
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:03,112
<i>that would've died
in that car crash--</i>

592
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:05,815
a brand new soul that was never
part of death's design--

593
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:07,483
it throws the whole list
out of whack

594
00:50:07,485 --> 00:50:09,519
and we start over
with a clean slate.

595
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:11,636
It seems like a bit of a
reach, don't you think?

596
00:50:11,662 --> 00:50:12,888
What else could it mean?

597
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,024
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

598
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:17,193
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

599
00:50:17,195 --> 00:50:20,763
We have to find her and warn her about the
lake so she can stay alive to have the baby.

600
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:23,966
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

601
00:50:23,968 --> 00:50:26,836
- There could be thousands of
white vans in the state. - Hey!

602
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:29,739
I'm a cop, remember?

603
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:34,777
Wait, that's it.

604
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:39,582
Got it.

605
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:44,254
With the plate number
I can put out an apb.

606
00:50:44,256 --> 00:50:46,422
Here we go.

607
00:50:46,424 --> 00:50:48,424
The vehicle
is a delivery van

608
00:50:48,426 --> 00:50:50,793
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

609
00:50:52,095 --> 00:50:54,264
<i>We should pick them up
pretty quickly.</i>

610
00:50:54,266 --> 00:50:56,065
<i>Come on, let's get
to the meeting.</i>

611
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:12,649
Hey, hold the door!

612
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:16,085
<i>Hey, let go of my shoe!</i>

613
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:17,820
Give me my shoe!

614
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:26,862
I wrote to management two weeks
ago about these friggin' bumpers.

615
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:31,000
Is that dogshit, dude?

616
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:35,938
Eww.

617
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:43,346
Oh, you got something
on your...

618
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:49,686
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

619
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:52,722
No, it's all right.

620
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,859
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

621
00:52:00,365 --> 00:52:02,064
Just let-- I'll--
let me do it.

622
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:05,968
What?

623
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:09,104
Hey, man,
how you doing?

624
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,307
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

625
00:52:13,043 --> 00:52:14,977
Okay, keep checking.

626
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,056
Does anybody have a valium?

627
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:29,058
Oh, yeah.

628
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,893
Here.

629
00:52:30,895 --> 00:52:33,396
You're just going to want
to take half of that.

630
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:34,864
Keep 'em coming.

631
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,402
If what you're saying
is true,

632
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:41,070
that means I'm next.

633
00:52:41,072 --> 00:52:43,740
This is crazy, people,
come on.

634
00:52:43,742 --> 00:52:45,908
First death
is stalking us,

635
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,344
and now premonitions?
What?

636
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:50,112
You're not next, Nora.

637
00:52:50,114 --> 00:52:53,449
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

638
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:56,686
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

639
00:52:56,688 --> 00:52:58,421
This cannot be happening.

640
00:52:58,423 --> 00:53:00,256
See, because my career
is at a peak

641
00:53:00,258 --> 00:53:02,358
and I finally met
a quality guy.

642
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,026
I just bought a house.

643
00:53:04,028 --> 00:53:06,061
Maybe if you shut the
fuck up, you'll live.

644
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:09,599
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

645
00:53:09,601 --> 00:53:12,368
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

646
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,036
you have a fighting chance.

647
00:53:14,038 --> 00:53:17,540
If I call and say,
I don't know-- subway--

648
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:19,809
get to a high-rise fast.

649
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:25,047
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

650
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:26,982
Get it?

651
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,555
<i>Okay, you guys, listen--</i>

652
00:53:32,557 --> 00:53:34,724
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

653
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:36,559
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

654
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,394
of seeing signs
to some extent.

655
00:53:38,396 --> 00:53:40,195
<i>Okay, okay, look.</i>

656
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:41,731
I gotta call bullshit.

657
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:43,566
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

658
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:45,568
to all your theories
and all your stories,

659
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,703
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

660
00:53:47,705 --> 00:53:49,338
Call it what you want!

661
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,442
- It'll keep your ass alive.
- Darlin', my ass is alive!

662
00:53:52,444 --> 00:53:54,310
Has been all day.

663
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,914
There is nobody after us
but you,

664
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:00,115
trying to make us all crazy.

665
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:16,098
I should have seen
that coming.

666
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,733
Yeah.

667
00:54:17,735 --> 00:54:20,069
If death is out
to get you,

668
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,204
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

669
00:54:22,206 --> 00:54:24,406
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

670
00:54:24,408 --> 00:54:26,542
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

671
00:54:26,544 --> 00:54:28,177
<i>Sleep in shifts.</i>

672
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:30,513
We need to safe-proof
this deathtrap.

673
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:42,224
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

674
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:44,293
Are you kidding me?

675
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:47,396
<i>- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.</i>

676
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:51,734
Ohh!

677
00:54:51,736 --> 00:54:54,069
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

678
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:56,739
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

679
00:54:56,741 --> 00:54:59,408
So, Nora's got to bite it
before me anyhow, huh?

680
00:55:00,512 --> 00:55:02,378
Oh, you people have
no sense of humor.

681
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:11,453
Nora, you okay?

682
00:55:13,524 --> 00:55:15,791
Four years ago
my husband died.

683
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,028
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

684
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,030
Don't say that,
okay?

685
00:55:21,032 --> 00:55:23,699
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

686
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:26,368
With my family,
I can accept that.

687
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,205
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

688
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,207
If we just stick
together long enough

689
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:33,876
for her
to have her baby--

690
00:55:33,878 --> 00:55:36,311
if you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

691
00:55:37,548 --> 00:55:39,148
Nora.

692
00:55:42,052 --> 00:55:43,886
What do you think
you're doing?

693
00:55:43,888 --> 00:55:46,556
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

694
00:55:46,558 --> 00:55:48,558
Look, look.

695
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,660
I control my life,
all right?

696
00:55:50,662 --> 00:55:54,897
Not some crazy list
death has put together.

697
00:55:54,899 --> 00:55:57,099
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

698
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:59,769
<i>Whatever. You may be
able to scare these people,</i>

699
00:55:59,771 --> 00:56:02,171
<i>- but I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.</i>

700
00:56:02,173 --> 00:56:03,839
- Hey.
- What?

701
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:06,943
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

702
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:19,789
I'm just going
to put this in the...

703
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:22,658
Closet.

704
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:53,789
Sorry.

705
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:12,108
Whoa.

706
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:24,120
Man with hooks?

707
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:27,189
Man with hooks.

708
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:29,558
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

709
00:57:31,427 --> 00:57:32,962
Is that...

710
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:36,431
<i>- A sign?
- Oh my God.</i>

711
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:38,200
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

712
00:57:38,202 --> 00:57:39,568
- The phone.
- Shit.

713
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:14,804
- Hello?
- Nora!

714
00:58:14,806 --> 00:58:17,807
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

715
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:20,609
Officer Burke,
I can't--

716
00:58:20,611 --> 00:58:22,311
I can't hear you!
What?!

717
00:58:22,313 --> 00:58:23,545
What does he--
what?!

718
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:25,815
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

719
00:58:25,817 --> 00:58:27,349
<i>- What, what?
- Oh...</i>

720
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:29,018
What is it, Nora?

721
00:58:31,654 --> 00:58:33,155
No!

722
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:35,557
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

723
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:37,492
Wait, wait, Nora!

724
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:39,595
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

725
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:40,996
Let me help!

726
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:42,364
Let me go!

727
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:51,907
Let go of me!

728
00:58:58,882 --> 00:59:00,750
Kat!

729
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:13,963
Help me!

730
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:16,498
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

731
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:31,247
Aah!

732
00:59:33,483 --> 00:59:35,517
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

733
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,520
Isabella's being held at the
Greenwood Lake Sheriff's station.

734
00:59:38,522 --> 00:59:40,856
<i>I'm in control of my life!</i>

735
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:43,192
- Kiss my ass!
- Eugene, what is it?

736
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:45,227
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

737
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:48,030
<i>- You hear me, you reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.</i>

738
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:50,432
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

739
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:53,402
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

740
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:55,971
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

741
00:59:55,973 --> 00:59:58,073
<i>All right, give
me the gun, Eugene.</i>

742
00:59:58,075 --> 01:00:00,375
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

743
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:03,545
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

744
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:05,681
You just got
to calm down, man.

745
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:07,582
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

746
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:10,585
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

747
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:12,754
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

748
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,557
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

749
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:17,492
You hear me!

750
01:00:17,494 --> 01:00:20,429
<i>God!</i>

751
01:00:29,306 --> 01:00:31,307
Oh!

752
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:32,708
You don't keep it loaded?

753
01:00:34,211 --> 01:00:36,879
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

754
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:40,249
Never.
That's impossible.

755
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:42,517
It wasn't his turn to die.

756
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:46,688
Can we find the pregnant
woman, now, please?

757
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:55,998
<i>Is this safe, guys?</i>

758
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,567
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

759
01:00:58,569 --> 01:01:01,103
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

760
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:02,972
Or her?

761
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:05,941
Hopefully her.

762
01:01:07,277 --> 01:01:09,178
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

763
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:13,082
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

764
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:15,384
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

765
01:01:15,386 --> 01:01:18,187
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

766
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:27,496
Look at me.

767
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:29,598
<i>Come on.</i>

768
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,733
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

769
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:34,236
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

770
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:36,238
Look, hopefully
the district judge

771
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,108
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

772
01:01:45,748 --> 01:01:47,749
Marcus.

773
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:50,419
Marcus, Marcus.

774
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:52,754
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his--

775
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:57,692
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

776
01:01:57,694 --> 01:01:59,728
My water just broke.

777
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,763
<i>- What?
- My water, it just broke.</i>

778
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:04,533
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

779
01:02:04,535 --> 01:02:07,536
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

780
01:02:07,538 --> 01:02:10,705
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

781
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:14,043
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

782
01:02:14,045 --> 01:02:15,811
Get me to the hospital!

783
01:02:15,813 --> 01:02:17,779
Okay, okay!

784
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:20,816
Sheriff Perry, this is
Deputy Adams, come back.

785
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:24,820
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

786
01:02:24,822 --> 01:02:26,989
My van! My van!
Take my van!

787
01:02:29,392 --> 01:02:31,060
Okay. Okay.

788
01:02:31,062 --> 01:02:33,228
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

789
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,164
Yeah, we'll go.

790
01:02:38,901 --> 01:02:40,602
Come on,
come on!

791
01:02:45,408 --> 01:02:47,943
<i>Y'all want to
hear something crazy?</i>

792
01:02:47,945 --> 01:02:50,012
It's not the first time
I cheated death.

793
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:55,584
A kid came to school
with a knife--

794
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:57,353
killed his teacher.

795
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:01,423
Teacher would have
been me,

796
01:03:01,425 --> 01:03:05,194
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

797
01:03:05,196 --> 01:03:07,396
That's fucking weird, man.

798
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:08,797
You want weird?

799
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,966
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

800
01:03:10,968 --> 01:03:13,168
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

801
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,371
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

802
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,574
He died that night
in a shootout.

803
01:03:20,877 --> 01:03:24,046
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

804
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:25,814
I'd be dead, too.

805
01:03:25,816 --> 01:03:28,050
Oh my God.

806
01:03:28,052 --> 01:03:30,052
I'm sorry.

807
01:03:30,054 --> 01:03:31,753
It's just I got one, too.

808
01:03:31,755 --> 01:03:33,955
Okay, so last may
I'm supposed to go and stay

809
01:03:33,957 --> 01:03:36,725
at this cheesy little bed
and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

810
01:03:36,727 --> 01:03:39,728
Anyhow, there's this major
gas leak no one knows about,

811
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,231
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

812
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:44,566
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

813
01:03:44,568 --> 01:03:45,357
I never made it.

814
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:48,070
The bus I was on splattered
some girl over the road.

815
01:03:48,072 --> 01:03:49,571
Was that in Mt. Abraham?

816
01:03:49,573 --> 01:03:53,075
Yes. How did you know?

817
01:03:53,077 --> 01:03:55,677
That bus you were on killed
Terry chaney.

818
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,348
She was supposed to die
on flight 180.

819
01:04:02,452 --> 01:04:05,354
Hey, do you guys remember
that theater in Paris

820
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:08,123
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

821
01:04:10,026 --> 01:04:12,361
Well, I had tickets to go.

822
01:04:12,363 --> 01:04:14,863
But one night I'm in Paris

823
01:04:14,865 --> 01:04:18,200
and I'm just
tripping on acid

824
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:20,536
and sipping lattes
and such.

825
01:04:20,538 --> 01:04:22,471
And then all of a sudden

826
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:25,707
this dude out of nowhere

827
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:28,210
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

828
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:31,046
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

829
01:04:31,048 --> 01:04:33,715
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

830
01:04:33,717 --> 01:04:36,718
She was from Mt. Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

831
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,721
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

832
01:04:39,723 --> 01:04:41,390
that saved my life...

833
01:04:41,392 --> 01:04:43,892
That was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

834
01:04:43,894 --> 01:04:46,361
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

835
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:49,831
The people who got off
of flight 180.

836
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:53,668
<i>They were my friends.</i>

837
01:04:57,207 --> 01:04:59,441
<i>Kimberly, tell us
what happened.</i>

838
01:05:02,678 --> 01:05:05,847
About a year ago my mom and I
were at the mall.

839
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:07,849
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

840
01:05:07,851 --> 01:05:10,519
but I got caught up watching
this news report

841
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:12,387
about some kid
that committed suicide.

842
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,690
I kept thinking,

843
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:18,026
"how can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

844
01:05:18,028 --> 01:05:19,961
That's stupid."

845
01:05:22,698 --> 01:05:24,699
It felt wrong.

846
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,468
And yet...

847
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:32,774
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

848
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:37,546
Some kids were trying
to steal my mom's car.

849
01:05:37,548 --> 01:05:40,215
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

850
01:05:40,217 --> 01:05:42,284
and they killed her.

851
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:46,188
<i>After the funeral
I kept thinking</i>

852
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:47,523
<i>that it should
have been me.</i>

853
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:50,992
I guess everyone must
think that.

854
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,663
But I guess I was right.

855
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:05,106
Get there.

856
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:06,975
Could you drive
a little faster maybe?!

857
01:06:06,977 --> 01:06:08,710
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

858
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,148
<i>When we got
off flight 180,</i>

859
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,185
it didn't just change
our lives.

860
01:06:16,187 --> 01:06:18,687
It affected everyone
and everything

861
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:21,022
we've come
into contact with since.

862
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:22,991
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

863
01:06:22,993 --> 01:06:25,527
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

864
01:06:25,529 --> 01:06:27,663
<i>it caused an outward ripple.</i>

865
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:29,631
A rift in death's design.

866
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:32,634
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

867
01:06:34,204 --> 01:06:36,338
We wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

868
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,973
Yes, that's why death
is working backwards!

869
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,176
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

870
01:06:41,178 --> 01:06:43,445
sealing the rift once
and for all.

871
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:06,868
Oh, shit!

872
01:07:09,004 --> 01:07:10,572
Jesus Christ!

873
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:15,143
Hang on! Hang on!

874
01:07:35,365 --> 01:07:37,633
- Is everybody all right?
- Oh God.

875
01:07:40,035 --> 01:07:41,803
God, Eugene!

876
01:07:41,805 --> 01:07:44,906
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

877
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:49,544
No, please.

878
01:07:49,546 --> 01:07:52,447
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

879
01:07:52,449 --> 01:07:54,616
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

880
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:59,053
<i>Those people can help.
Let's go.</i>

881
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:03,158
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

882
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,327
off 9-a
at the 180 mile-marker.

883
01:08:05,329 --> 01:08:07,228
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

884
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:10,365
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

885
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,001
Just-- okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

886
01:08:14,837 --> 01:08:17,773
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

887
01:08:17,775 --> 01:08:20,074
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

888
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:22,611
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

889
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,118
<i>Stay with us.</i>

890
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,586
Hey, hey you!

891
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:35,691
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

892
01:08:35,693 --> 01:08:39,227
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

893
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:43,665
I think it's okay.

894
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:46,034
I don't smell any gas
and nothing's dripping.

895
01:08:46,036 --> 01:08:48,870
All right, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.

896
01:08:48,872 --> 01:08:50,972
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?

897
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:55,544
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

898
01:08:55,546 --> 01:08:57,879
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

899
01:08:57,881 --> 01:08:59,914
I'm so-- dad!

900
01:09:06,155 --> 01:09:07,823
Eugene, everything's
going to be okay.

901
01:09:07,825 --> 01:09:10,659
If he doesn't get a respirator,
he's not going to make it!

902
01:09:10,661 --> 01:09:13,662
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!

903
01:09:13,664 --> 01:09:15,430
Check the gauges
on the regulator,

904
01:09:15,432 --> 01:09:17,432
and watch out
for overdoses!

905
01:09:17,434 --> 01:09:20,268
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.

906
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:24,205
And watch out
for power lines!

907
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:27,609
Watch it!

908
01:09:33,182 --> 01:09:35,684
You trying to get yourself
killed, little boy?

909
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:37,952
You got to use
your head, man.

910
01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:41,423
Thanks.

911
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:50,832
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

912
01:10:07,182 --> 01:10:09,618
How is she doing?

913
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,653
I think she's going
to be okay.

914
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:17,158
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

915
01:10:19,228 --> 01:10:21,229
When I die...

916
01:10:21,231 --> 01:10:22,997
Is it going to hurt?

917
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:26,334
I don't know.

918
01:10:27,904 --> 01:10:29,671
You're going to die after me,
right?

919
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:32,674
Yeah, I guess so.

920
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:36,678
Would you take these?

921
01:10:42,585 --> 01:10:44,185
And if I die...

922
01:10:47,256 --> 01:10:49,090
Will you throw out
all my drugs

923
01:10:49,092 --> 01:10:53,027
and my paraphernalia
and my porno?

924
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:57,098
You know...

925
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,534
Anything that's going
to break my mom's heart.

926
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,471
Please?

927
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:07,476
Thank you.

928

information on Isabella--

932
01:11:20,223 --> 01:11:22,223
she did?

Okay. Thanks.
Great. Kimberly!

Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

01:11:29,165 --> 01:11:31,132
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?

936
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:32,501
I'll go talk to her.

Hi.

938
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:38,039
Just find Isabella and get
this thing over with, okay?

939
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:39,774
Go on, I'll be fine.

940

- I don't know.

Yeah, sure. I'll just
put it on quiet mode.

943
01:11:58,695 --> 01:12:00,028
That would be good.

944
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:29,424
Rory.

945
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:48,176
<i>Oh my God!</i>

946
01:12:48,178 --> 01:12:49,844
<i>Somebody get out there!</i>

947
01:12:49,846 --> 01:12:52,914
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!

948
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:54,348
The keys are in it.

949
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,521
Kimberly!

950
01:13:10,233 --> 01:13:13,167
<i>Kimberly!</i>

951
01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:15,369
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?

952
01:13:15,371 --> 01:13:17,806
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.

953
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:21,710
This one was different.

954
01:13:21,712 --> 01:13:24,779
It was like the van crashing
into the lake.

955
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,881
I was in a hospital,
there was screaming

956
01:13:26,883 --> 01:13:28,683
and a nurse was trying
to choke me.

957
01:13:28,685 --> 01:13:31,352
I couldn't see her, but I
could see her name tag.

958
01:13:31,354 --> 01:13:35,056
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.

959
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:38,226
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is
going to try and kill Isabella.

960
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:45,233
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!

961
01:13:45,235 --> 01:13:46,835
What's wrong?
Is my baby all right?

962
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:49,303
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

963
01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:52,240
<i>A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,</i>

964
01:13:52,242 --> 01:13:55,176
<i>one of them killed by a safety
device meant to protect us.</i>

965
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:57,746
<i>Ironically, the woman
was impaled through the head</i>

966
01:13:57,748 --> 01:14:00,148
<i>after her emergency
airbag deployed.</i>

967
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:03,785
She was trapped in her vehicle after it
crashed into a field near greenwood lake.

968
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:06,187
<i>Suddenly the airbag
went off...</i>

969
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:42,857
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

970
01:14:42,859 --> 01:14:45,026
We may need to do
a stat caesarean!

971
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:46,928
Get Dr. Kalarjian
up here now!

972
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:49,698
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

973
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,166
I'm just going
to wait outside,

974
01:14:51,168 --> 01:14:53,234
'cause I'm just really
in the way here.

975
01:14:53,236 --> 01:14:55,236
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.

976
01:14:55,238 --> 01:14:57,072
You guys, get to Isabella!

977
01:14:57,074 --> 01:14:58,940
I'm going to find Eugene!

978
01:14:58,942 --> 01:15:02,177
<i>Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.</i>

979
01:15:02,179 --> 01:15:05,113
<i>Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.</i>

980
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:23,131
Dr. Kalarjian,
in here, hurry!

981
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,434
That's her.

982
01:15:27,536 --> 01:15:29,070
<i>Wait, wait, wait!</i>

983
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,777
Contractions have stopped.

984
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:11,345
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

985
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:13,514
<i>Bad tracing,
it's losing oxygen.</i>

986
01:16:13,516 --> 01:16:15,683
The cord's compressed!

987
01:16:15,685 --> 01:16:19,053
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!

988
01:16:19,055 --> 01:16:20,855
<i>Where's Kalarjian?!</i>

989
01:16:20,857 --> 01:16:23,591
Dr. Kalarjian!

990
01:16:23,593 --> 01:16:25,860
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.

991
01:16:25,862 --> 01:16:29,063
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.

992
01:16:38,373 --> 01:16:41,009
Just push a little more.

993
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:43,411
Oh, no.

994
01:16:43,413 --> 01:16:45,146
<i>Isabella, is the baby okay?</i>

995
01:16:46,381 --> 01:16:48,049
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

996
01:16:48,051 --> 01:16:50,718
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know--

997
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,587
I need to know if the baby's all right!

998
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:56,991
It's a boy.

999
01:17:17,847 --> 01:17:19,848
Thank you.
Congratulations!

1000
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:21,883
Who the hell are they?

1001
01:17:21,885 --> 01:17:24,219
Oh my God!

1002
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,924
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.

1003
01:17:29,926 --> 01:17:32,693
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.

1004
01:17:32,695 --> 01:17:34,628
It's over.
It's okay.

1005
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:50,644
<i>- Kimberly.
- What did you see?</i>

1006
01:17:50,646 --> 01:17:54,048
I don't think Isabella was ever
supposed to die in that pileup.

1007
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:56,913
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to be?

1008
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,011
Try to remember.

1009
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,940
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.

1010
01:18:20,009 --> 01:18:21,376
Eugene.

1011
01:18:25,915 --> 01:18:29,017
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?

1012
01:18:29,019 --> 01:18:30,785
You saw an ecg machine
and what else?

1013
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:34,956
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

1014
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:37,458
Wait.

1015
01:18:39,494 --> 01:18:41,262
Eugene.

1016
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:03,318
Oh God, no!

1017
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:15,296
Bloody hands.

1018
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,334
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.

1019
01:19:19,336 --> 01:19:21,502
- What?
- Crash cart.

1020
01:19:21,504 --> 01:19:22,937
Let's go! Move it!

1021
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:27,275
<i>Dr. Kalarjian.</i>

1022
01:19:27,277 --> 01:19:29,043
ECG machine.

1023
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:35,350
<i>The lake.</i>

1024
01:19:35,352 --> 01:19:37,185
<i>The white van.</i>

1025
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:43,791
What are you talking about?

1026
01:19:46,528 --> 01:19:48,296
<i>New life.</i>

1027
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:52,700
What is it?

1028
01:19:52,702 --> 01:19:54,969
I know what I have
to do to save us.

1029
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:59,540
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.

1030
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:02,643
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

1031
01:20:07,383 --> 01:20:09,317
Get Kalarjian.

1032
01:22:34,896 --> 01:22:38,032
<i>Only new life can defeat death.</i>

1033
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:40,868
<i>If it is my time to
go and be in heaven...</i>

1034
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,271
<i>With my family.
I can accept that.</i>

1035
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,774
<i>Flight 180...</i>

1036
01:22:46,776 --> 01:22:48,909
<i>I know what I
have to do to save us.</i>

1037
01:22:48,911 --> 01:22:51,078
<i>There are no known survivors.</i>

1038
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,013
<i>I have to die.</i>

1039
01:23:02,358 --> 01:23:04,458
Ready and clear.

1040
01:23:06,027 --> 01:23:07,795
<i>Nothing.</i>

1041
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,699
<i>- Come on.
- Ready, clear.</i>

1042
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:14,802
<i>She's back!</i>

1043
01:23:14,804 --> 01:23:17,205
Epinephrine. Two milligrams,
IV push.

1044
01:23:17,207 --> 01:23:20,007
<i>I want her prepped
and stabilized for ICU.</i>

1045
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:25,779
Welcome back.

1046
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:29,049
They lost you
for a minute there.

1047
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:39,560
Hey. We did it.

1048
01:23:39,562 --> 01:23:41,495
Thanks to you,
we cheated death.

1049
01:24:14,631 --> 01:24:17,998
<i>- Would you like some wine?
- I think I'll stick to our beer, thanks.</i>

1050
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,433
All right.

1051
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:21,935
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.

1052
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:24,171
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

1053
01:24:24,173 --> 01:24:26,073
It's our pleasure.

1054
01:24:27,376 --> 01:24:31,345
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.

1055
01:24:31,347 --> 01:24:33,080
I had a fun summer.

1056
01:24:33,082 --> 01:24:36,384
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

1057
01:24:39,187 --> 01:24:42,290
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

1058
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:44,992
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.

1059
01:24:44,994 --> 01:24:47,295
Trust me. I think I've
been through closer calls.

1060
01:24:47,297 --> 01:24:47,917
Yeah, me too.

1061
01:24:47,943 --> 01:24:50,398
Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

1062
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,932
What's that?

1063
01:24:51,934 --> 01:24:55,569
Brian was almost hit by that
news van that day in the field.

1064
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:58,339
And your friend Rory, he pulled
him back at the last second.

1065
01:24:58,341 --> 01:24:59,164
<i>Saved his life.</i>

1066
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:01,909
<i>You never
told me that, Peter.</i>

1067
01:25:01,911 --> 01:25:03,444
<i>Boy, that was lucky.</i>

1068
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:10,618
Brian!
