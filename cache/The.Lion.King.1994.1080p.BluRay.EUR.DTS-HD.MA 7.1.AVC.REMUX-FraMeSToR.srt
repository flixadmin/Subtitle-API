From the day we arrive

23
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:37,389
On the planet

24
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:41,644
And, blinking, step into the sun

25
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:45,648
There's more to see

26
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:48,651
Than can ever be seen

27
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,653
More to do

28
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:53,739
Than can ever be done

29
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,534
There's far too much

30
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,411
To take in here

31
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:01,288
More to find

32
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:05,042
Than can ever be found

33
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:08,337
But the sun rolling high

34
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:11,048
Through the sapphire sky

35
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,758
Keeps great and small

36
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:16,095
On the endless round

37
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:21,517
It's the circle of life

38
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:27,523
And it moves us all

39
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:31,944
Through despair and hope

40
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:39,034
Through faith and love

41
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:44,039
Till we find our place

42
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:50,171
On the path unwinding

43
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:56,218
In the circle

44
00:02:56,344 --> 00:03:01,348
The circle of life

45
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:51,982
It's the circle of life

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,404
And it moves us all

47
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:03,786
Through despair and hope

48
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:10,376
Through faith and love

49
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,881
Till we find our place

50
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:22,471
On the path unwinding

51
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:27,559
In the circle

52
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:33,983
The circle of life

53
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:58,549
Life's not fair, is it?

54
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:03,012
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.

55
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:08,475
And you shall never see
the light of another day.

56
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,523
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?

57
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,442
What do you want?

58
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:19,903
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

59
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:23,574
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

60
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,284
Oh, look, Zazu.

61
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:26,618
You've made me lose my lunch.

62
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,621
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

63
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:32,374
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

64
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,919
I quiver with fear!

65
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,547
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

66
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:39,923
Help!

67
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,342
Scar?

68
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:43,552
Drop him.

69
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,889
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:54,021
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

71
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,148
to mingle with the commoners.

72
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,360
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

73
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,570
That was today?

74
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:03,989
I feel simply awful!

75
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,951
Must've slipped my mind.

76
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:11,246
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

77
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,249
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

78
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:19,296
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

79
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:24,385
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

80
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:27,137
I shall practise my curtsy!

81
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,807
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

82
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,225
Oh, no, Mufasa.

83
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,144
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

84
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,147
Is that a challenge?

85
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:38,732
Temper, temper.

86
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,985
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

87
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,987
Pity. Why not?

88
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:47,408
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

89
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:50,828
But when it comes to brute strength,

90
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:55,082
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

91
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:00,462
There's one in every family, sire.

92
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,089
Two in mine, actually,

93
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,300
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

94
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,344
What am I going to do with him?

95
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,179
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

96
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:10,347
Zazu!

97
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,850
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

98
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,018
you could take him out and beat him.

99
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,232
Simba.

100
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,080
Dad! Dad!

101
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,583
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

102
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,085
Sorry.

103
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,380
Dad! Dad!

104
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:28,342
Your son is awake.

105
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,470
Before sunrise, he's your son.

106
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,680
Dad! Come on, Dad.

107
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,103
You promised.

108
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,814
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.

109
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,024
Yeah!

110
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,375
Look, Simba.

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,546
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

112
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,339
Wow.

113
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:12,344
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

114
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,390
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

115
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:19,893
and will rise with you as the new king.

116
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:22,688
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.

117
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,649
Everything the light touches.

118
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,901
What about that shadowy place?

119
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,112
That's beyond our borders.

120
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,572
You must never go there, Simba.

121
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,740
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

122
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:37,160
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

123
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,580
- There's more?
- Simba...

124
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:47,754
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

125
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,757
As king, you need to
understand that balance

126
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:52,593
and respect all the creatures,

127
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:55,512
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

128
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,431
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

129
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,100
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

130
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,145
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

131
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:05,897
and the antelope eat the grass.

132
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:11,236
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

133
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,572
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.

134
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,574
Checking in with the morning report.

135
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,742
Fire away.

136
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,410
Well! The buzz from the bees

137
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,412
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

138
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:21,580
Really?

139
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,999
What are you doing, son?

140
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:25,667
Pouncing.

141
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,128
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

142
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:31,089
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

143
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:33,008
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.

144
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,176
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

145
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,927
Stay low to the ground.

146
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,262
Cheetahs never prosper...

147
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,431
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

148
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,682
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.

149
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,018
Very good. Pouncing.

150
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:46,521
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

151
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,274
This is so humiliating.

152
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,942
Try not to make a sound.

153
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,320
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

154
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,657
Mufasa? Simba?

155
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,703
That's very good.

156
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:03,622
- Zazu!
- Yes!

157
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,375
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...

158
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,711
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

159
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,296
Zazu, take Simba home.

160
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:12,547
Dad, can't I come?

161
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:13,715
No, son.

162
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,968
I never get to go anywhere.

163
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:21,139
Young master,
one day, you will be king.

164
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:25,143
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

165
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,229
from dawn until dusk.

166
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,655
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

167
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,825
I despise guessing games.

168
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,993
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

169
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:44,329
Oh, goody!

170
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,164
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

171
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:49,251
and I'm gonna rule it all!

172
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:52,838
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

173
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,257
Bad back, you know.

174
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:57,426
Hey, Uncle Scar.

175
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,845
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

176
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,180
A monkey's uncle.

177
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:06,101
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

178
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:09,354
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

179
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,522
Everything.

180
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:14,192
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

181
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,696
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

182
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,781
And he's absolutely right.

183
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,199
It's far too dangerous.

184
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,702
Only the bravest lions go there.

185
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,455
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

186
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,957
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

187
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,125
Why not?

188
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,629
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

189
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:37,549
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

190
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,135
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

191
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:44,473
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

192
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:47,142
An elephant what? Whoa!

193
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,395
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

194
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,315
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

195
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:56,401
you being so clever and all.

196
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,153
Just do me one favour.

197
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,824
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

198
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,326
No problem.

199
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,077
There's a good lad.

200
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,914
You run along now and have fun.

201
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,499
And remember,

202
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,084
it's our little secret.

203
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,177
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

204
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,429
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

205
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:27,015
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

206
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,184
And it's time for yours.

207
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,270
Mom!

208
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:35,273
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

209
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,110
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

210
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:40,529
So, where are we going?

211
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:42,113
It better not be anyplace dumb.

212
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,032
No, it's really cool.

213
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,701
So, where is this really cool place?

214
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:50,872
- Around the water hole.
- The water hole?

215
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,791
What's so great about the water hole?

216
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,043
I'll show you when we get there.

217
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,213
Mom, can I go with Simba?

218
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,549
What do you think, Sarabi?

219
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:01,716
Well...

220
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,134
- Please?
- Please?

221
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,386
It's all right with me.

222
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,554
- Yeah!
- All right!

223
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:07,556
As long as Zazu goes with you.

224
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,224
No, not Zazu.

225
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:10,809
Step lively.

226
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,896
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

227
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:16,857
So, where are we really going?

228
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,358
An elephant graveyard.

229
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,568
Wow!

230
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:20,986
Zazu.

231
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,822
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

232
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,741
Just look at you two.

233
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,911
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

234
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,247
Your parents will be thrilled,

235
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:34,708
what with your being betrothed and all.

236
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:35,917
Be-what?

237
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,669
Betrothed. Intended.

238
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,588
Affianced.

239
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:40,755
Meaning...

240
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,842
One day, you two are
going to be married.

241
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,010
Yuck!

242
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,220
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

243
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,514
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

244
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,558
Sorry to bust your bubble,

245
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,227
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

246
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:56,771
It's a tradition going back generations.

247
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:59,399
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

248
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,319
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

249
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,821
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

250
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,489
Well, he's the future king.

251
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:08,950
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

252
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:10,493
Not yet, I don't.

253
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,037
And with an attitude like that,

254
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:15,916
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,626
Not the way I see it.

256
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,754
I'm gonna be a mighty king

257
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,923
So enemies beware

258
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,592
Well, I've never seen
a king of beasts

259
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,844
With quite so little hair

260
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,555
I'm gonna be the main event

261
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,682
Like no king was before

262
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,393
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down

263
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:37,604
I'm workin' on my roar

264
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:41,316
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing

265
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:46,279
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

266
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:49,532
You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

267
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:51,952
- No one sayin', "Do this"
- Now, when I said that...

268
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,454
- No one saying, "Be there"
- What I meant was...

269
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,873
- No one sayin', "Stop that"
- You don't realise...

270
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,793
- No one sayin', "See here"
- Now, see here!

271
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:03,213
Free to run around all day

272
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,881
Well, that's definitely out.

273
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:09,010
Free to do it all my way

274
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,307
I think it's time that you and I

275
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,476
Arranged a heart-to-heart

276
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,311
Kings don't need advice

277
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:20,981
From little hornbills for a start

278
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,526
If this is where
the monarchy is headed

279
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,819
Count me out

280
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,321
Out of service, out of Africa

281
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:30,991
I wouldn't hang about

282
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:35,370
This child is getting
wildly out of wing

283
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:39,916
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

284
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,222
Everybody, look left

285
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,100
Everybody, look right

286
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,686
Everywhere you look, I'm

287
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,396
Standing in the spotlight

288
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,189
Not yet!

289
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:07,068
Let every creature
go for broke and sing

290
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,031
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

291
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:16,703
It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling

292
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:21,708
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

293
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:26,629
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

294
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:31,593
Oh, I just can't wait

295
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,929
To be king

296
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,897
I beg your pardon, madam, but

297
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,940
get off!

298
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,609
Simba?

299
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,944
Nala!

300
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:53,698
All right! It worked!

301
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,284
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.

302
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,411
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

303
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,663
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

304
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,749
- With me!
- Yeah?

305
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,005
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!

306
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,929
Pinned ya again.

307
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,652
This is it. We made it.

308
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,449
Whoa!

309
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,829
It's really creepy.

310
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:41,996
Yeah.

311
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,331
Isn't it great?

312
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,543
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!

313
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,754
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

314
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,714
There's only one way to know.

315
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,633
Come on, let's go check it out.

316
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,345
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

317
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,680
Oh, man!

318
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:01,224
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

319
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:02,934
Look, banana beak is scared.

320
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,812
It's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy,

321
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,315
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

322
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,817
Danger?

323
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,986
I walk on the wild side.

324
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,321
I laugh in the face of danger.

325
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,417
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

326
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,419
I don't know, Shenzi.

327
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,921
What do you think, Ed?

328
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,884
Just what I was thinking.

329
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:37,969
A trio of trespassers!

330
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,263
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

331
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,182
A simple navigational error.

332
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,225
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

333
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,313
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

334
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,690
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

335
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,358
And that would make you...

336
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:53,735
The future king.

337
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,447
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

338
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,241
You can't do anything to me.

339
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:02,577
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

340
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,873
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

341
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,499
Ix-nay on the upid-stay.

342
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:11,711
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Look at the sun!

343
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,963
- It's time to go!
- What's the hurry?

344
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,882
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

345
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,385
Yeah, we could have
whatever's lion around!

346
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,387
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!

347
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:24,599
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?

348
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,770
What, Ed? What is it?

349
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,688
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

350
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:31,856
No, why?

351
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:34,108
'Cause there it goes!

352
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,034
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.

353
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,535
Where's Zazu?

354
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:46,746
The little major-domo bird
hippety-hopped

355
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,873
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

356
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,001
No! Not the birdie-boiler!

357
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,633
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

358
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,135
- Like you?
- Oops.

359
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,306
Boo!

360
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:19,320
Simba!

361
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:40,842
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

362
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,681
That was it?

363
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,058
Do it again. Come on.

364
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,531
- Please, please! Uncle, uncle!
- Silence!

365
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,826
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.

366
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,038
If you ever come near my son again...

367
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,789
This is... This is your son?

368
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,375
- Your son.
- Did you know that?

369
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,878
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

370
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,880
- No, of course not.
- No.

371
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,048
Ed?

372
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,719
Toodles.

373
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,729
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

374
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:38,983
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.

375
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,614
I thought you were very brave.

376
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,840
Zazu.

377
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,094
Yes, sire?

378
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:10,473
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

379
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,604
Come, Nala.

380
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:20,108
Simba, good luck.

381
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,782
Simba!

382
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,311
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

383
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,814
- I know.
- You could've been killed.

384
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,858
You deliberately disobeyed me,

385
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,695
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

386
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,364
I was just trying to be brave, like you.

387
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,826
I'm only brave when I have to be.

388
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,538
Simba, being brave

389
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,957
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

390
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,084
But you're not scared of anything.

391
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,378
I was today.

392
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,630
- You were?
- Yes.

393
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,841
I thought I might lose you.

394
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,928
I guess even kings get scared, huh?

395
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:34,515
- But you know what?
- What?

396
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,143
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

397
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,898
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.

398
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,442
- Come here, you.
- No! No!

399
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,614
Come here!

400
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:51,699
Gotcha!

401
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,498
Dad?

402
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,334
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

403
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,170
And we'll always be together, right?

404
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:11,177
Simba, let me tell you something
that my father told me.

405
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,179
Look at the stars.

406
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:18,351
The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.

407
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,728
- Really?
- Yes.

408
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,105
So whenever you feel alone,

409
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,944
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

410
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,280
And so will I.

411
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,666
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.

412
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,504
It's not funny, Ed.

413
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,510
Hey, shut up!

414
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,973
Will you knock it off?

415
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,185
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.

416
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,854
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

417
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,439
Man, I hate dangling.

418
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:09,360
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin' the joint.

419
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,861
Man, I hate lions.

420
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,613
- So pushy.
- And hairy.

421
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:14,782
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...

422
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,867
Ugly!

423
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:22,039
Surely we lions are not all that bad.

424
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,959
Scar. It's just you.

425
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,128
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

426
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,629
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

427
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,256
- Yeah.
- I see.

428
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,633
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.

429
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,468
I just hear that name and I shudder.

430
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,138
- Mufasa!
- Do it again.

431
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,556
Mufasa!

432
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,225
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!

433
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,102
It tingles me.

434
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:46,063
I'm surrounded by idiots.

435
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:49,233
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're
one of us. I mean, you're our pal.

436
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,484
Charmed.

437
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,697
I like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

438
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,657
Yeah. Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,

439
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,826
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya?

440
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,245
I don't think you really deserve this.

441
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:04,415
I practically gift-wrapped
those cubs for you,

442
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,918
and you couldn't even dispose of them.

443
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:14,675
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly
like they was alone, Scar.

444
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,927
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?

445
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,929
Kill Mufasa?

446
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,600
Precisely.

447
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,947
I know that your powers of retention

448
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:40,785
Are as wet as a warthog's backside

449
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:45,039
But thick as you are, pay attention

450
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:48,876
My words are a matter of pride

451
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,630
It's clear from your vacant expressions

452
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,634
The lights are not all on upstairs

453
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,137
But we're talking kings
and successions

454
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,973
Even you can't be caught unawares

455
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:07,978
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime

456
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:12,441
Be prepared for sensational news

457
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,362
A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer

458
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,030
And where do we feature?

459
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,324
Just listen to teacher

460
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,284
I know it sounds sordid

461
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,245
But you'll be rewarded

462
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,873
When at last I am given my dues

463
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,502
And injustice deliciously squared

464
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:34,797
Be prepared

465
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:38,968
Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared. For what?

466
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,344
For the death of the king.

467
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,888
- Why, is he sick?
- No, fool, we're going to kill him.

468
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,308
- And Simba, too.
- Great idea. Who needs a king?

469
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,186
No king, no king

470
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,273
- Idiots! There will be a king!
- Hey, but you said...

471
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,358
I will be king!

472
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,152
Stick with me,

473
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:00,156
and you'll never go hungry again.

474
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,575
- Yeah! All right!
- Long live the king!

475
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:06,078
Long live the king! Long live the king!

476
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:11,250
It's great that we'll soon be connected

477
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:15,588
With a king who'll be all-time adored

478
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:19,175
Of course, quid pro quo
you're expected

479
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,262
To take certain duties on board

480
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:27,099
The future is littered with prizes

481
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:31,604
And though I'm the main addressee

482
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:35,024
The point that I must emphasise is

483
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:38,027
You won't get a sniff without me!

484
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:42,531
So prepare for the coup of the century

485
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:46,952
Be prepared for the murkiest scam

486
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,704
Meticulous planning

487
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,706
Tenacity spanning

488
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,875
Decades of deniaI

489
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,629
Is simply why I'll be king undisputed

490
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,631
Respected, saluted

491
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:02,134
And seen for the wonder I am

492
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,971
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared

493
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:09,308
Be prepared

494
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:13,813
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared

495
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:17,817
Be prepared

496
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:34,750
You wait here. Your father has
a marvellous surprise for you.

497
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,085
What is it?

498
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:39,380
If I told you, it wouldn't be
a surprise now, would it?

499
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,465
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.

500
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,427
You are such a naughty boy.

501
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,639
- Come on, Uncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

502
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,058
This is just for you and your daddy.

503
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:55,813
You know, a sort of father-son thing.

504
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,691
Well, I'd better go get him.

505
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,609
- I'll go with you.
- No.

506
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,823
No. Just stay on this rock.

507
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,908
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

508
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,702
like you did with the hyenas.

509
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,706
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.

510
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,375
- Really?
- Yes.

511
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:20,170
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

512
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,965
And just between us,

513
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,427
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours, hmm?

514
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:28,721
Okay.

515
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,727
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?

516
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:39,106
Simba, it's to die for.

517
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:01,795
Shut up.

518
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:05,299
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.

519
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,800
Stay put.

520
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,136
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

521
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:13,140
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

522
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:18,771
There he is. Let's go.

523
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,149
"Little roar. "

524
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,462
Look, sire, the herd is on the move.

525
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,881
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.

526
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,883
Stampede in the gorge.

527
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,636
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?

528
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,160
Zazu, help me!

529
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,245
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

530
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,538
Hurry!

531
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,669
There! There on that tree!

532
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,087
Hold on, Simba!

533
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,007
Dad!

534
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,096
Scar, this is awful!

535
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,348
What'll we do? What'll we do?

536
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:21,101
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.

537
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,097
Dad!

538
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,663
Scar!

539
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,333
- Brother.
- Brother, help me!

540
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:37,845
Long live the king.

541
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:46,019
No!

542
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,200
Dad!

543
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:13,589
Dad?

544
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,586
Dad?

545
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,298
Dad, come on.

546
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:59,259
You got to get up.

547
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,345
Dad?

548
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,388
We got to go home.

549
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:15,776
Help!

550
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:21,073
Somebody!

551
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:22,950
Anybody.

552
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:25,827
Help.

553
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:00,529
Simba. What have you done?

554
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,783
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

555
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,036
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

556
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:12,332
Of course. Of course you didn't.

557
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:17,879
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

558
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,048
But the king is dead.

559
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,678
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

560
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,853
What will your mother think?

561
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,563
What am I going to do?

562
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,023
Run away, Simba.

563
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:42,404
Run. Run away and never return.

564
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,537
Kill him.

565
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,701
Whoa!

566
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:45,592
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.

567
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,302
So go get him.

568
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,221
There ain't no way I'm going in there.

569
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:53,225
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?

570
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,602
But we got to finish the job.

571
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:58,730
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

572
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,108
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

573
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:03,276
Yeah! You hear that?

574
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,781
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!

575
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:19,793
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

576
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:24,256
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

577
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:30,053
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.

578
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:34,099
So it is with a heavy heart
that I assume the throne.

579
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:38,437
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

580
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:41,481
to greet the dawning of a new era

581
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:45,360
in which lion and hyena come together

582
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:49,781
in a great and glorious future.

583
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:39,206
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!

584
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,666
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

585
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,337
Gets 'em every time.

586
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:49,424
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

587
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,551
I think it's still alive.

588
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:56,389
All righty, what have we got here?

589
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:05,607
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!

590
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:09,027
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

591
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:13,740
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

592
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,243
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

593
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:19,579
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

594
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:22,082
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

595
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,334
Maybe he'll be on our side.

596
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:27,504
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

597
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,840
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

598
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:34,261
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

599
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:35,428
So we're keeping him?

600
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:37,764
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

601
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:39,432
My point exactly.

602
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,852
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

603
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,613
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.

604
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:54,948
You nearly died.

605
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:56,700
I saved you.

606
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,952
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

607
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,870
Thanks for your help.

608
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,290
Hey, where you going?

609
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,625
Nowhere.

610
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,043
Gee, he looks blue.

611
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:11,423
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

612
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:14,134
Kid, what's eating you?

613
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,304
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.

614
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:21,141
The food chain!

615
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:26,730
So, where you from?

616
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,815
Who cares? I can't go back.

617
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:32,319
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

618
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:34,821
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.

619
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,907
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.

620
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:40,160
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

621
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:42,912
Not unless you can change the past.

622
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:46,249
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,

623
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:48,835
"You got to put your
behind in your past. "

624
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,503
No, no, no.

625
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,921
- I mean...
- Amateur.

626
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:54,174
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

627
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:57,427
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you. "

628
00:43:57,511 --> 00:44:01,514
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

629
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:02,682
- Right.
- Wrong!

630
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,352
When the world turns its back on you,

631
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:08,104
you turn your back on the world.

632
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,106
Well, that's not what I was taught.

633
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:12,359
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

634
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:14,778
Repeat after me.

635
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,696
- Hakuna matata.
- What?

636
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:19,699
Hakuna matata.

637
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,034
It means "no worries".

638
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:24,037
Hakuna matata.

639
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:27,290
What a wonderful phrase.

640
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,709
Hakuna matata.

641
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:33,046
Ain't no passing craze

642
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,465
It means no worries

643
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:39,636
For the rest of your days

644
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,724
It's our problem-free philosophy

645
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,310
Hakuna matata

646
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:49,145
Hakuna matata?

647
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,815
- Yeah. It's our motto.
- What's a motto?

648
00:44:51,899 --> 00:44:54,234
Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?

649
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:59,155
You know, kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.

650
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,575
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example. Why...

651
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:05,412
When he was a young warthog

652
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:09,332
When I was a young warthog

653
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:11,251
- Very nice.
- Thanks.

654
00:45:11,711 --> 00:45:14,254
He found his aroma
lacked a certain appeal

655
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,589
He could clear the savanna
after every meal

656
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,758
I'm a sensitive souI

657
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:21,386
Though I seem thick-skinned

658
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:27,767
And it hurt that my friends
never stood downwind

659
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:31,438
- And, oh, the shame
- He was ashamed

660
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:33,940
- Thought of changing my name
- Oh, what's in a name?

661
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:35,608
And I got downhearted

662
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:37,610
- How did you feel?
- Every time that I...

663
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:40,447
- Hey, not in front of the kids.
- Oh, sorry.

664
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:43,450
Hakuna matata

665
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:46,786
What a wonderful phrase

666
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,705
Hakuna matata

667
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:51,958
Ain't no passing craze

668
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:54,294
It means no worries

669
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:56,212
For the rest of your days

670
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:57,964
Yeah, sing it, kid.

671
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,967
It's our problem-free

672
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,720
Philosophy

673
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:07,098
Hakuna matata

674
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,726
Welcome to our humble home.

675
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,395
- You live here?
- We live wherever we want.

676
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,939
Yep. Home is where your rump rests.

677
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,775
It's beautiful.

678
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:18,985
I'm starved.

679
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:21,321
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

680
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,157
We're fresh out of zebra.

681
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:25,909
Any antelope?

682
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:27,577
- Hippo?
- Nope.

683
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:30,830
Listen, kid, if you live with us,
you have to eat like us.

684
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,458
Hey, this looks like a good spot
to rustle up some grub.

685
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:36,002
What's that?

686
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:37,921
A grub. What's it look like?

687
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,964
Gross.

688
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,675
Tastes like chicken.

689
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:46,346
Slimy yet satisfying.

690
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,098
These are rare delicacies.

691
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:53,019
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.

692
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:54,771
You'll learn to love them.

693
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:57,190
I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life,

694
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:59,609
no rules, no responsibilities.

695
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:02,362
The little cream-filled kind.

696
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:05,114
And best of all, no worries.

697
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,116
Well, kid?

698
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:10,036
Oh, well. Hakuna matata.

699
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:17,460
Slimy, yet satisfying.

700
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:19,045
That's it.

701
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:32,559
Hakuna matata

702
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:33,977
Hakuna matata

703
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,645
Hakuna matata

704
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:38,398
- Hakuna...
- It means no worries

705
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:41,568
For the rest of your days

706
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:44,821
It's our problem-free

707
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:47,156
Philosophy

708
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:49,367
Hakuna matata

709
00:47:50,703 --> 00:47:52,078
Hakuna matata

710
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,540
Hakuna matata

711
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:58,585
Hakuna matata

712
00:47:58,711 --> 00:48:01,337
Hakuna matata

713
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:03,089
Hakuna matata

714
00:48:04,884 --> 00:48:08,928
Hakuna matata

715
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:12,765
Hakuna matata

716
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,434
Yeah

717
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:16,102
Ta-ta!

718
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:27,196
Nobody knows

719
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:30,700
The trouble I've seen

720
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:34,537
Nobody knows

721
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:36,539
My sorrow

722
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:38,791
Zazu, do lighten up.

723
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,128
Sing something with a little bounce in it.

724
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,965
It's a small world after all

725
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,260
No, no! Anything but that!

726
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:53,139
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts

727
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:54,557
Deedle dee dee

728
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:57,977
There they are a-standing in a row

729
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:01,230
Big ones, small ones,
some as big as your head

730
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:04,317
I would never have had
to do this with Mufasa.

731
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:06,402
What? What did you say?

732
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:08,738
- Nothing.
- You know the law.

733
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:13,242
Never, ever mention that name
in my presence. I am the king!

734
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:15,828
Yes, sire, you are the king.

735
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:18,915
I... I only mentioned it
to illustrate the differences

736
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,417
in your royal managerial approaches.

737
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:24,754
- Hey, boss.
- What is it this time?

738
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:27,090
- We got a bone to pick with you.
- I'll handle this.

739
00:49:27,174 --> 00:49:29,676
Scar, there's no food, no water.

740
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,680
Yeah. It's dinner time
and we ain't got no stinking entres.

741
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:38,184
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.

742
00:49:38,352 --> 00:49:40,436
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.

743
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:43,439
- Eat Zazu.
- You wouldn't want me.

744
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:46,275
I'd be so tough and gamey and...

745
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,779
Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.

746
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:51,948
I thought things
were bad under Mufasa.

747
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:54,534
- What did you say?
- I said Muf...

748
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,202
I said qu pasa?

749
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,705
Good. Now get out.

750
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,291
But we're still hungry.

751
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:03,501
Out!

752
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:14,303
- Whoa! Nice one, Simba.
- Thanks.

753
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:17,306
- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.

754
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,642
I ate like a pig.

755
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:21,811
Pumbaa, you are a pig.

756
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:23,896
Right.

757
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:37,660
- Timon?
- Yeah?

758
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:41,831
Ever wonder what those
sparkling dots are up there?

759
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,917
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.

760
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:48,004
What are they?

761
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,839
They're fireflies.

762
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:54,343
Fireflies that got stuck
up in that big bluish-black thing.

763
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:56,429
Gee.

764
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,682
I always thought they were balls of gas

765
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:03,269
burning billions of miles away.

766
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:07,023
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

767
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:09,108
Simba, what do you think?

768
00:51:09,526 --> 00:51:11,194
Well, I don't know.

769
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:13,279
Come on. Give, give, give, give.

770
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:16,365
Come on. We told you ours. Please?

771
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,909
Well...

772
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:20,620
Somebody once told me

773
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:25,208
that the great kings of the past
are up there watching over us.

774
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,375
Really?

775
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,837
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys
are watching us?

776
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:38,054
- Who told you something like that?
- Yeah, yeah.

777
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:42,809
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?

778
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:45,978
- You're killing me.
- Yeah.

779
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:58,533
Was it something I said?

780
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:52,545
Simba?

781
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:55,339
He's... He's alive? He's alive!

782
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:12,273
It is time.

783
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:18,988
A- wimoweh, a-wimoweh

784
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:20,990
A- wimoweh, a-wimoweh

785
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:25,203
In the jungle, the mighty jungle

786
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:29,248
The lion sleeps tonight

787
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:33,252
In the jungle, the mighty jungle

788
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:35,171
The lion sleeps to...

789
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,423
I can't hear you, buddy. Back me up.

790
00:53:41,178 --> 00:53:44,805
A- Pumbaa-bum-baa-weh

791
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:47,141
Pumbaa? Pumbaa?

792
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,242
Timon?

793
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,518
Pumbaa?

794
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,647
Pumbaa! Pumbaa!

795
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:38,150
Pumbaa, Pumbaa!
Hey, what's going on?

796
00:54:38,235 --> 00:54:40,695
She's going to eat me!

797
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:46,367
Whoa! Jeez, why do I always
have to save your...

798
00:54:52,207 --> 00:54:56,210
Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you.
Everything's going to be okay.

799
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:59,505
Get her! Bite her head!

800
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,425
Go for the jugular! The jugular!

801
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,719
See, I told you he'd come in handy.

802
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:10,599
Nala?

803
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:16,063
Is it really you?

804
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:20,276
- Who are you?
- It's me. Simba.

805
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:23,404
Simba?

806
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:28,200
Whoa! How did you...

807
00:55:29,578 --> 00:55:31,370
- Wow!
- Where did you come from?

808
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:33,456
This is gr... It's great to see you!

809
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:36,500
- Hey, what's goin' on here?
- What are you doing here?

810
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:38,711
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

811
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:42,089
Hey! What's goin' on here?

812
00:55:42,174 --> 00:55:45,176
Timon, this is Nala.
She's my best friend.

813
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,263
- Friend?
- Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.

814
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:52,808
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

815
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:55,561
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- The pleasure is all mine.

816
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:59,774
How do you... Whoa, whoa!
Time out! Let me get this straight.

817
00:56:00,108 --> 00:56:01,817
You know her, she knows you.

818
00:56:01,902 --> 00:56:06,489
But she wants to eat him,
and everybody's okay with this?

819
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:09,200
- Did I miss something?
- Relax, Timon.

820
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,286
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.

821
00:56:12,913 --> 00:56:15,831
And your mother, what will she think?

822
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:19,293
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

823
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:21,629
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

824
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:22,880
They do?

825
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:26,175
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

826
00:56:26,343 --> 00:56:29,804
He did? What else did he tell you?

827
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:35,226
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.

828
00:56:35,352 --> 00:56:40,606
King? Lady, have you got
your lions crossed!

829
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,857
King?

830
00:56:41,942 --> 00:56:46,028
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.

831
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:49,031
- Stop it.
- It's not gravel, it's grovel.

832
00:56:49,116 --> 00:56:52,660
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?

833
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,245
- No.
- Simba!

834
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,872
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,

835
00:56:56,957 --> 00:56:59,250
but that was a long time ago.

836
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:03,087
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?

837
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:05,923
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.

838
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:08,884
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

839
00:57:09,136 --> 00:57:10,845
Hey, whatever she has to say,

840
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:13,097
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?

841
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:16,892
Maybe you'd better go.

842
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:21,230
It starts. You think you know a guy.

843
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:28,070
Timon and Pumbaa,
you learn to love 'em.

844
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:31,824
What?

845
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:34,618
What is it?

846
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:38,080
It's like you're back from the dead.

847
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:42,126
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.

848
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:44,086
What it means to me.

849
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:47,965
- Hey, it's okay.
- I've really missed you.

850
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:50,551
I've missed you, too.

851
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:55,973
I tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks.

852
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:57,766
Sorry.

853
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:00,019
Not you! Them!

854
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:03,814
Him, her, alone.

855
00:58:03,899 --> 00:58:05,232
What's wrong with that?

856
00:58:05,317 --> 00:58:07,735
- I can see what's happening
- What?

857
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:10,404
- And they don't have a clue
- Who?

858
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:13,991
They'll fall in love
and here's the bottom line

859
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:16,994
Our trio's down to two

860
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:20,206
The sweet caress of twilight

861
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,250
There's magic everywhere

862
00:58:23,335 --> 00:58:28,839
And with all this
romantic atmosphere

863
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:33,177
Disaster's in the air

864
00:58:38,016 --> 00:58:44,438
Can you feeI the love tonight?

865
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:50,110
The peace the evening brings

866
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:53,280
The world for once

867
00:58:53,365 --> 00:58:56,534
In perfect harmony

868
00:58:56,618 --> 00:59:01,872
With all its living things

869
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:05,626
So many things to tell her

870
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:09,171
But how to make her see

871
00:59:09,256 --> 00:59:11,840
The truth about my past?

872
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:15,553
Impossible, she'd turn away from me

873
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,722
He's holding back, he's hiding

874
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:22,142
But what, I can't decide

875
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:25,521
Why won't he be
the king I know he is?

876
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:29,358
The king I see inside?

877
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:36,156
Can you feeI the love tonight?

878
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,620
The peace the evening brings

879
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:45,457
The world for once

880
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:48,752
In perfect harmony

881
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:53,799
With all its living things

882
00:59:55,802 --> 01:00:01,348
Can you feeI the love tonight?

883
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:07,313
You needn't look too far

884
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,025
Stealing through

885
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:14,361
The night's uncertainties

886
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:19,533
Love is where they are

887
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:26,498
And if he falls in love tonight

888
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:32,588
It can be assumed

889
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,425
His carefree days

890
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:39,887
With us are history

891
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:43,932
In short, our pal

892
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:48,812
Is doomed

893
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:00,240
Isn't this a great place?

894
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:02,326
It is beautiful.

895
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:05,287
But I don't understand something.

896
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:07,748
You've been alive all this time.

897
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,167
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

898
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:15,089
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

899
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:17,049
And I did, and it's great.

900
01:01:17,676 --> 01:01:19,218
We've really needed you at home.

901
01:01:19,678 --> 01:01:23,514
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.

902
01:01:23,598 --> 01:01:26,642
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.

903
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:30,562
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

904
01:01:30,647 --> 01:01:32,648
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

905
01:01:32,774 --> 01:01:34,400
There's no food, no water.

906
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:37,152
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

907
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:38,529
- I can't go back.
- Why?

908
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,823
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?

909
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:43,492
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
Hakuna matata.

910
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:45,285
- What?
- Hakuna matata.

911
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:49,039
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...

912
01:01:49,124 --> 01:01:50,207
Simba...

913
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,544
...and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

914
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:58,132
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

915
01:01:58,258 --> 01:02:01,093
I left to find help, and I found you.

916
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:05,597
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

917
01:02:05,682 --> 01:02:08,517
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?

918
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:12,563
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.

919
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:16,233
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.

920
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:19,111
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

921
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:21,155
Good. At least one of us does.

922
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:25,576
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

923
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,661
You don't even know
what I've been through.

924
01:02:27,746 --> 01:02:29,079
I would if you'd just tell me.

925
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:30,998
- Forget it!
- Fine!

926
01:02:34,836 --> 01:02:37,671
She's wrong. I can't go back.

927
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:41,842
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

928
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:43,927
You can't change the past.

929
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:50,142
You said you'd always be there for me!

930
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:52,561
But you're not.

931
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:56,940
And it's because of me.

932
01:02:57,484 --> 01:03:00,027
It's my fault.

933
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:02,529
It's my fault.

934
01:03:06,201 --> 01:03:08,202
Asante sana, squash banana

935
01:03:08,286 --> 01:03:09,620
We we nugu, imi mi apana

936
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:11,497
Asante sana, squash banana

937
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:13,290
We we nugu, imi mi apana

938
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:15,292
Asante sana, squash banana

939
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:17,461
We we nugu, imi mi apana

940
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:45,489
Asante sana, squash banana
We we nugu, imi mi apana

941
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:48,784
Come on, will you cut it out?

942
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:51,787
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!

943
01:03:51,913 --> 01:03:54,957
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?

944
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:58,919
- Who are you?
- The question is, who are you?

945
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:05,133
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.

946
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:09,012
Well, I know who you are.
Come here. It's a secret.

947
01:04:09,097 --> 01:04:12,516
Asante sana, squash banana

948
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,018
Enough!
What is that supposed to mean?

949
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,438
It means you are a baboon, and I'm not.

950
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:22,359
I think you're a little confused.

951
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:25,320
Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.

952
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:28,866
- You don't even know who you are.
- And I suppose you know.

953
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,952
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.

954
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:36,164
- Bye.
- Hey, wait!

955
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:46,258
You knew my father?

956
01:04:46,342 --> 01:04:49,553
Correction, I know your father.

957
01:04:51,723 --> 01:04:53,557
I hate to tell you this,

958
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:56,727
but he died a long time ago.

959
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:59,146
Nope. Wrong again!

960
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:03,233
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.

961
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:06,320
You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way. Come on!

962
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:18,415
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!

963
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:21,960
- Hey, whoa, wait, wait.
- Come on. Come on!

964
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:25,839
Would you slow down?

965
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:39,186
Stop!

966
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:45,525
Look down there.

967
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:13,679
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

968
01:06:13,763 --> 01:06:15,430
No.

969
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:19,393
Look harder.

970
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:26,942
You see?

971
01:06:28,236 --> 01:06:30,737
He lives in you.

972
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:37,577
Simba.

973
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:39,287
Father?

974
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:49,965
Simba, you have forgotten me.

975
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:52,175
No. How could I?

976
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:57,014
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

977
01:06:57,098 --> 01:06:59,349
Look inside yourself, Simba.

978
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,520
You are more than
what you have become.

979
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:06,940
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

980
01:07:07,025 --> 01:07:10,944
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.

981
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:14,948
Remember who you are.

982
01:07:15,033 --> 01:07:18,952
You are my son and the one true king.

983
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:24,458
Remember who you are.

984
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:27,377
No! Please, don't leave me!

985
01:07:27,462 --> 01:07:28,628
Remember.

986
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,297
- Father!
- Remember!

987
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:32,340
Don't leave me.

988
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:34,342
Remember.

989
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:44,978
What was that?

990
01:07:45,063 --> 01:07:46,772
The weather.

991
01:07:46,856 --> 01:07:50,525
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.

992
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:52,611
Looks like the winds are changing.

993
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:55,238
Change is good.

994
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,491
Yeah, but it's not easy.

995
01:07:57,575 --> 01:08:02,579
I know what I have to do, but going
back means I'll have to face my past.

996
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:05,749
I've been running from it
for so long.

997
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:09,002
Jeez! What was that for?

998
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,963
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

999
01:08:12,048 --> 01:08:14,049
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1000
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,426
Yes, the past can hurt.

1001
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:20,097
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

1002
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:23,016
or learn from it.

1003
01:08:23,101 --> 01:08:25,894
You see? So what are you going to do?

1004
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:28,563
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

1005
01:08:28,648 --> 01:08:30,899
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

1006
01:08:30,983 --> 01:08:34,569
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm going back!

1007
01:08:34,654 --> 01:08:37,572
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

1008
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:55,632
Grubs! Grubs!

1009
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,140
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1010
01:09:07,145 --> 01:09:10,564
It's okay! Whoa, whoa!
It's okay! It's me!

1011
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:14,109
Don't ever do that again.

1012
01:09:14,402 --> 01:09:16,111
Carnivores!

1013
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:18,822
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.

1014
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:21,575
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?

1015
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:23,994
You won't find him here!

1016
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:27,080
The king has returned.

1017
01:09:27,165 --> 01:09:30,333
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

1018
01:09:30,418 --> 01:09:32,252
Gone back? What do you mean?

1019
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:35,338
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1020
01:09:35,423 --> 01:09:37,841
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.

1021
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:39,009
- Who?
- Scar.

1022
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:40,844
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

1023
01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:42,679
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!

1024
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:46,349
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

1025
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:46,993
Simba, wait up!

1026
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:54,876
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.

1027
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:56,878
What made you come back?

1028
01:10:57,338 --> 01:10:59,839
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1029
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:02,217
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1030
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:05,011
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1031
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:08,139
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1032
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:11,226
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

1033
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:15,772
Danger? I laugh in the face of danger.

1034
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,607
I see nothing funny about this.

1035
01:11:17,692 --> 01:11:20,694
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1036
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,946
At your service, my liege.

1037
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,700
We're gonna fight your uncle for this?

1038
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:30,495
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1039
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:32,872
Talk about your fixer-upper!

1040
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:37,460
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1041
01:11:56,230 --> 01:12:00,108
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1042
01:12:00,192 --> 01:12:02,652
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1043
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:06,114
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

1044
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:08,992
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1045
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,703
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1046
01:12:12,872 --> 01:12:13,955
Luau!

1047
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,665
If you're hungry for a hunk
of fat and juicy meat

1048
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,500
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here
because he is a treat

1049
01:12:17,585 --> 01:12:19,544
Come on down and dine
on this tasty swine

1050
01:12:19,628 --> 01:12:21,629
All you have to do is get in line

1051
01:12:21,756 --> 01:12:23,548
- Are you achin'
- Yep, yep, yep.

1052
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:25,508
- For some bacon?
- Yep, yep, yep.

1053
01:12:25,593 --> 01:12:27,177
- He's a big pig
- Yep, yep.

1054
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:29,346
You could be a big pig, too!

1055
01:12:34,352 --> 01:12:37,687
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

1056
01:12:37,772 --> 01:12:40,690
I'll look for Scar.

1057
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,819
Sarabi!

1058
01:12:59,502 --> 01:13:00,710
Yes, Scar?

1059
01:13:00,795 --> 01:13:04,255
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1060
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,217
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1061
01:13:07,468 --> 01:13:09,969
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1062
01:13:10,054 --> 01:13:14,057
It's over. There is nothing left.

1063
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:18,019
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1064
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:21,564
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

1065
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:23,817
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1066
01:13:23,901 --> 01:13:26,194
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1067
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:28,696
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

1068
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:31,366
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1069
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,788
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1070
01:13:44,088 --> 01:13:45,713
Mufasa?

1071
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,134
No. It's me.

1072
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:54,889
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?

1073
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:58,768
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

1074
01:13:58,853 --> 01:14:00,186
Simba?

1075
01:14:00,271 --> 01:14:04,858
Simba! I'm a little surprised to see you

1076
01:14:04,942 --> 01:14:06,401
alive.

1077
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:11,573
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1078
01:14:11,657 --> 01:14:13,616
Simba, you must understand.

1079
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:16,077
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1080
01:14:16,162 --> 01:14:19,414
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1081
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,916
Well, I would, naturally.

1082
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:24,961
However, there is one little problem.

1083
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:26,838
You see them?

1084
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:30,842
They think I'm king.

1085
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:34,679
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1086
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:36,681
The choice is yours, Scar.

1087
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:39,267
Either step down or fight.

1088
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,769
Must this all end in violence?

1089
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:46,065
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1090
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,402
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1091
01:14:49,904 --> 01:14:51,029
I've put it behind me.

1092
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:52,947
But what about your faithful subjects?

1093
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:54,991
Have they put it behind them?

1094
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:57,160
Simba, what is he talking about?

1095
01:14:57,244 --> 01:15:01,498
So you haven't told them
your little secret.

1096
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:04,959
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1097
01:15:05,044 --> 01:15:09,214
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1098
01:15:12,259 --> 01:15:13,426
I am.

1099
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:20,350
It's not true.

1100
01:15:20,768 --> 01:15:23,102
Tell me it's not true.

1101
01:15:24,647 --> 01:15:27,815
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!

1102
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,902
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.

1103
01:15:30,986 --> 01:15:34,697
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

1104
01:15:34,782 --> 01:15:36,366
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1105
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:40,578
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!

1106
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,997
Simba, you're in trouble again,

1107
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:46,084
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1108
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:49,462
and now everyone knows why!

1109
01:15:50,548 --> 01:15:51,631
Simba!

1110
01:15:57,221 --> 01:16:00,056
Now, this looks familiar.

1111
01:16:01,892 --> 01:16:05,853
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.

1112
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:08,565
Yes. I remember.

1113
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:12,819
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1114
01:16:14,697 --> 01:16:18,408
And here's my little secret.

1115
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:21,995
I killed Mufasa.

1116
01:16:23,622 --> 01:16:26,708
No! Murderer!

1117
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:29,961
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1118
01:16:30,045 --> 01:16:33,756
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

1119
01:16:34,216 --> 01:16:35,258
All right.

1120
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,343
All right.

1121
01:16:38,596 --> 01:16:40,096
I did it.

1122
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,098
So they can hear you.

1123
01:16:43,142 --> 01:16:46,311
I killed Mufasa!

1124
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:01,409
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff.

1125
01:17:31,023 --> 01:17:33,524
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in! Let me in!

1126
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:37,236
Please, don't eat me.

1127
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:38,905
Drop 'em!

1128
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:41,324
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?

1129
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:43,368
- He called him a pig.
- To me?

1130
01:17:43,452 --> 01:17:45,286
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?

1131
01:17:45,371 --> 01:17:51,084
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me Mr Pig!

1132
01:17:54,338 --> 01:17:57,006
Take that, you stupid...

1133
01:17:57,091 --> 01:17:59,092
Take that and that!

1134
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,722
Run, you yellow-belly!

1135
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:27,620
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.

1136
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:31,624
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.

1137
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:37,130
But Simba, I am family.

1138
01:18:37,464 --> 01:18:40,675
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

1139
01:18:42,428 --> 01:18:43,386
It was their fault. It was their idea.

1140
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,513
Why should I believe you?

1141
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:48,683
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

1142
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,727
What are you going to do?

1143
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:54,397
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1144
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:56,941
No, Scar.

1145
01:18:57,276 --> 01:18:58,818
I'm not like you.

1146
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:02,155
Simba, thank you. You are truly noble.

1147
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:06,033
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?

1148
01:19:06,118 --> 01:19:07,744
Tell me. I mean, anything.

1149
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:09,328
Run.

1150
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,956
Run away, Scar,

1151
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:14,292
and never return.

1152
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,211
Yes.

1153
01:19:17,296 --> 01:19:19,422
Of course.

1154
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:22,175
As you wish,

1155
01:19:22,301 --> 01:19:24,343
your Majesty!

1156
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:21,067
My friends!

1157
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:24,987
Friends? I thought he said
we were the enemy.

1158
01:20:25,072 --> 01:20:27,824
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1159
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:29,408
Ed?

1160
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:38,000
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand!

1161
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:40,503
No, I didn't mean... No! No!

1162
01:21:46,904 --> 01:21:48,571
It is time.

1163
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:16,724
Remember.

1164
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:32,031

On the path unwinding

In the circle

1177
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:19,620
The circle of life

1178
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:21,414
Circle of

1179
01:23:21,498 --> 01:23:23,666
Life
