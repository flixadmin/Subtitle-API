Caitlin! Caitlin,
are you all right?

477
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,818
You all right?
- Yeah.

478
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,819
- Come on.
- I'm okay.

479
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,864
Okay, I'm okay.

483
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,542

484
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,501
the...hand me
the x-ray machine,

485
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,669
grab it for us,
would you, please?

486
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,796
- Yup.

00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,464

488
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,174
- Okay, good.
remove it.

489
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,175
- How bad is it?

490
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,219
- Uh, it's bad.

491
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,804
It's bad, there's quite a few
pieces of shrapnel inside you,

492
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,472
and they look deep enough
to pierce your kidney

493
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,306
if they're not
removed immediately.

494
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,474

495
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,725
- Guys, we have to get her
to a hospital.

496
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,351
- We can't, they're gonna
ID her as a meta.

497
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,770
- And not just any meta.

498
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,730
- Yeah, one that we have
a file on for attacking CCPD.

499
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,607
- Then what are we going to do?
None of us are doctors

500
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,651
and she can't operate
on herself.

501
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,069
- We do have
another option.

502
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,570
- What is it?

503
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,239
- When Caitlin goes meta,
her metabolic rate

504
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,824
offsets cold
tissue destruction.

505
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,408
- She can regenerate?

506
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,743
- No, we're not gonna
take off my necklace.

507
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,369
I don't need a hospital.

508
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,789
All I need is a mirror
and a steady set of hands.

509
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,833
You were a field medic
in the Royal Army, right?

510
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,376
- What? No, I-I-I've never
operated on anyone before.

511
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,004
- That's okay,
I'll walk you through it.

512
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,338
- Caitlin, you're talking
about staying awake

513
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,756
during your own surgery.

514
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,175
- I'm putting my life
in your hands.

515
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,135
I trust you, Julian.

516
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,479
- What the hell
were you thinking?

517
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,106
- Now is not the time,
Gypsy.

518
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,317
- You know, you got a really
messed up sense of justice

519
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,694
for a cop?

520
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,736
- Watch yourself.

521
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,363
I took two oaths
in my life.

522
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,492
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.

523
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,952
Guess which one
takes priority?

524
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,745
- That was my prisoner.

525
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,664
- He was my prisoner too,
and you're on my Earth.

526
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,583
He has information that could
save Iris's life,

527
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,336
so I don't give a damn!

528
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,962
It's because of you
he's on the loose.

529
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,422
- Because of me?
No, no, because of you.

530
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,717
You opened that door!
You let him out!

531
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,760
That is on you,
Detective!

532
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,352
How much of that
did you hear?

533
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,728
- I heard enough.

534
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,021
This is my friend.

535
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,148
It's the man's daughter.

536
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,025
I mean, wouldn't you do that
for someone you cared about?

537
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,651
- I am doing that,
you idiot!

538
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,486
- Okay, what does that mean?

539
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,446
For who?
Who are you talking about?

540
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,449
- I used to have
a partner.

541
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:34,247
- Like, a "partner"
or...like a partner?

542
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,165
- Both.

543
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,001
It was a long time ago,
Cisco.

544
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,669
It's not like I'm burning
a candle for the guy,

545
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,298
but he did mean
something to me.

546
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,967
It's been three years since
Abra Kadabra shot him dead.

547
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,388
- I'm sorry.

548
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,472
- I have been searching
for him ever since,

549
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,393
and he finally
showed back up.

550
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,353
Ten minutes ago,
I had him dead to rights,

551
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,605
and then your friend
messed it all up.

552
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,190
So yes, I do know
what it is like

553
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:04,151
to care about someone so much
that you break the rules.

554
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,154
That's why I have to find
this guy, no matter what,

555
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,283
and when I do,
he is gonna pay for what he did.

556
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,120
No more delays.

557
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,418
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

558
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,710
- Okay, let's start
with the shrapnel

559
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:22,878
on the surface.

560
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,671
- Okey-dokey.

561
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,756

Well done.

566
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,100
Okay.

567
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,686
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [inhales sharply]

568
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,272
- Is there supposed to be
this much blood?

569
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,357
- It's normal for the shrapnel
to cavitate

570
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,525
and displace tissue,
but if I lose too much blood,

571
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,693
I'll start hemorrhaging.

572
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,446
- Okay.

573
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,863

00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,998
of shrapnel
from the surface gone.

580
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,791

Now it's time for the hard one.

But you're doing great.

582
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,877
You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.

583
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,341
- It's wedged between my kidney
and my inferior vena cava,

584
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,218
and it's surrounded
by some major blood vessels.

585
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,845
If you hit them,
there's a good chance

586
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,930
I'll go into shock.
- Shock?

587
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,808
- But it's okay.
You've got this.

588
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,226

- Then turn it.

up there.

00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,737
- It might be
a tendon in the way.

these are the exact components
