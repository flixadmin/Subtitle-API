When we first met,
we made a deal,

338
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:16,856
and I have fulfilled
my end of the bargain.

339
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,597
I gave you time travel.

340
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,686
But you have not upheld
your side

my sacred mission.

to the burning inferno
of hell itself,

344
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,086
and, therefore, with
all due respect, Miss Lance,

345
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,915
I must remind you
of your obligations to me.

352

No problem. You got it.
We'll talk about it later.
