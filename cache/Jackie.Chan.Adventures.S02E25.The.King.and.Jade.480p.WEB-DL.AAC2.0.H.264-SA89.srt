1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,841
Aah!

2
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:12,244
Please! Be gentle!
That Mayan calendar wheel

3
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,980
is more than
1,000 years old!

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,952
Whoa!

5
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,554
Aah!

6
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,722
Stop!

7
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,691
Nice wheel!
Here, wheel!

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,359
Please!

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,695
Excuse me,
sorry!

10
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,797
That should
buff right out!

11
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,301
(Gasping)

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,647
(Gasps)
Whoa!

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,782
Aah!

14
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,385
Aah!

15
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,208
Aah!

16
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,444
(Grunts)

17
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,179
Captain black: Been
looking everywhere
for you, Jackie.

18
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,315
I have
a high priority
assignment

19
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,684
especially suited
to your talents.

20
00:01:58,686 --> 00:01:59,852
Baby-sitting?

21
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,187
Not baby-sitting,
body guarding,

22
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,589
and this isn't
just anybody.

23
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,225
You'll
be guarding leli,
the king of tangra.

24
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,893
Jade: A king?

25
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,429
Cool.
Count me in!

26
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,298
Sorry, Jade.
This is a diplomatic visit.

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,366
The king can't see anyone

28
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,202
who doesn't have
level "a" clearance.

29
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,138
Besides,
don't you have

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,906
a book report
to work on?

31
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,342
Jackie,
why bother reading
about some president

32
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,643
from
a gazillion years ago,

33
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,279
when I could
be meeting
a real, live king!

34
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,282
I'm sorry, Jade,
but you heard captain black.

35
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,389
So the king
can't see anyone
who isn't cleared, huh?

36
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,408
It is most important
to observe all formal customs

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,810
in the presence
of his majesty.

38
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,146
Eh,
I will do my best.

39
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,887
Nice digs.

40
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,662
Undercover security.

41
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,764
This king
must be all that.

42
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,040
Jade: Whoa,
the dude's <i> barely</i> that.

43
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:32,511
May I present leli,
the king of tangra.

44
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,280
And shaktar,
his royal tutor.

45
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,384
Tangra, where
a kid can be a king.

46
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,354
Whoa!

47
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,629
Mr. chan,
it is customary to perform
the song of welcome.

48
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,965
Oh, yes,
I would love to hear it.

49
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,369
It is <i> you</i> who is
to sing, Mr. chan.

50
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,570
Me?!

51
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,607
Later. What I would
truly like to do

52
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,041
is to explore
the city.

53
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,977
And so you shall,
my king,

54
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,980
but we are past due
for a ceremony at city hall.

55
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,648
Your car awaits.

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,284
Looking out the window
of a limousine

57
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,287
is not the sightseeing
I had in mind.

58
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,556
A limo ride
sounds good to me!

59
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,961
Whoa.

60
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,830
These suits and ties
aren't security,

61
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,899
not with those
- "have a rotten day" tattoos.

62
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,302
Leli: Look!
The golden gate bridge!

63
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,739
Did you realize, shaktar,
that it is so expansive,

64
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,174
that as soon as a crew
finishes painting it,

65
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,277
they must start over again?

66
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,379
I was not aware of that,
my king.

67
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,480
And there!

68
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,515
That is bayview stadium.

69
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,485
How I would love to witness
a baseball game.

70
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,255
Fancy hotels,
luxury cars...

71
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,391
Yeah, I could
get used to this.

72
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,492
(Crowd applauds)

73
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,394
Mayor: And so,
it is in the spirit

74
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:56,895
of friendship
and cooperation

75
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,132
that I present you
with this key
to our fair city.

76
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,338
Thank you,
San Francisco, thank you!

77
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,973
You are too kind.

78
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,310
You really know how
to make a Princess
feel welcome.

79
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,384
(Gasps)
Stop!

80
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,320
Jackie: Uhh!

81
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,560
Oh, photographer.
Heh, sorry.

82
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,096
Uh-oh.
Jackie!

83
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,597
Jade?

84
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,865
Ooh!
- Ow!

85
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,936
King leli!
Bad men!

86
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,280
Sorry,
I'll give it back!
Thank you!

87
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,283
Uhh!

88
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,653
Kidnapper: Oof!

89
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,624
That was amazing

90
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,327
the way
you defeated those
men single-handedly!

91
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,730
Hello, what am I?
Invisible?

92
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,064
Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,336
And you have never
seen those men before?

94
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,074
A trying day,
your highness.

95
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,910
But now it is time
for your meditation period.

96
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,747
Then we will turn
to your studies.

97
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,416
I have not yet
taken a ride
on a cable car.

98
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,251
I want to sightsee.

99
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,886
I'm sorry,
your majesty,

100
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,421
that is not possible.

101
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,790
Those bad men
are still at large.

102
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,259
You must remain indoors
and under close watch

103
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,361
for the rest of your stay.

104
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,699
Now, now, your highness.
All is not blue.

105
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,069
I have the royal chefs
working on a wonderful dinner.

106
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,271
Broccoli stew.

107
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,607
Broccoli <i> souffle,</i>
my king.

108
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,775
Yuck!

109
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,610
Double yuck.

110
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,713
Meditation,
studies, broccoli.

111
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,215
Why is there
never any time
for fun?

112
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,350
Uhh.

113
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,887
And why
is this couch
so lumpy?

114
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,057
I am not lumpy!

115
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,394
We will leave you
to your meditation,
your majesty.

116
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,830
(Sighs)
Yes, yes.

117
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,065
As always,
you will not
be disturbed

118
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,134
until I return
in 4 hours.

119
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,170
4 hours?!

120
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,704
I am so out of here.

121
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,839
Ohh!

122
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,143
Soon as
the coast is clear,

123
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,711
I burn rubber.

124
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,920
Huh?

125
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,588
Announcer: And it's
the bottom of the 8th.
Prospectors are up by 3.

126
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh, king,
I like your style.

127
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,458
Announcer:
...Swing and a miss!

128
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,126
Munson's having
a great day on the mound.

129
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,861
8 ks in the last 3 innings.

130
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:43,929
And the pitch...

131
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,730
Strike 2!

132
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,933
Full count, runners
on first and second.

133
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,401
There's the pitch.

134
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,102
It's a sizzler
down the left field line.

135
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,771
Aaron scoops it up
and sends it to third.

136
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,372
And he's overthrown...
Soy beans?

137
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,640
Thanks.

138
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,150
Both: Aah!

139
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,818
Who is there?!

140
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,487
Reveal yourself!

141
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,432
Wh-wh-who are you?

142
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,534
I'm, uh,
part of your
security team.

143
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,036
Jackie's partner.
Name's Jade.

144
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,105
And you can
become invisible?

145
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,107
Can all bodyguards
do that?

146
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,776
Only if they have
one of these babies.

147
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,613
Ahh, a talisman.

148
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,314
A <i> magic</i> talisman.

149
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,316
May I see?

150
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,823
How does it work?

151
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,725
You just squeeze it
in your hand.

152
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,693
Uh, but I don't think--

153
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,463
yep, heh,
you learn fast.

154
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,533
Ok, now open your hand
to become visible again.

155
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,703
Uh, king?
Your majesty?

156
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,771
Leli?

157
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,239
I can't believe it.

158
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,440
Leli...

159
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,009
Pulled a Jade!

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,856
With this tea, we drink
to the northern mountains

161
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,791
and the Southern seas.

162
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,598
(Floor creaks)

163
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,481
Oh, ok, king,
I know you're here...
Somewhere.

164
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,921
Heh, mosquito.

165
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,458
Got it.

166
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,896
Cable car!

167
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,707
You seen a kid
about 8 years old,
wearing...

168
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,943
(Sigh)
He'd stay invisible.

169
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,918
May I buy
one of your sodas,
please?

170
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,220
I'm so thirsty.

171
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,889
Ok, hon,
but they're warm.

172
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,191
Perfect!

173
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,935
Gotcha!

174
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,670
You are so busted!

175
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,240
Uhh! Ohh!
- Don't even
think about it,

176
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,510
and don't say a word
until we get
to the next stop.

177
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,986
(Gasps)

178
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,688
The king is gone!

179
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,625
Game over,
your highness.

180
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,293
I am sorry, Jade.

181
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,595
Let me explain.

182
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,497
No! Let me explain!

183
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,499
You may be
Mr. big shot king,

184
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,034
all I gotta do
is snap my fingers

185
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,902
and get whatever I want
in <i> your</i> country,

186
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,737
but here,
in the U.S. of a.,

187
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,773
what you did
is called stealing.

188
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,574
I only meant
to borrow it

189
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,309
so I could escape.

190
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,580
Well, even
borrowing something

191
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,216
that isn't yours
is wrong...

192
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,018
And I should know.

193
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,054
And what
- do you mean, escape?

194
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,488
You've got it
made in the shade.

195
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,458
You have no idea
what it's like being a king.

196
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,827
Everything
is pomp and ceremony.

197
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,731
There's never any time
for normal things.

198
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,599
No time for fun.

199
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,969
Oh, I guess that could
get kind of boring.

200
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,972
I suppose you will
be taking me back now.

201
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,209
King,
you're about to go
on the "j" line tour.

202
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,517
Oh, my king,
what cruel fate
has befallen you?

203
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,219
(Cell phone rings)

204
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,387
Hello?

205
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,355
Black: Jackie,
we have a security problem.

206
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,790
Yes, I know.

207
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,358
You <i> know</i>
the snake
is missing?

208
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,426
What snake?

209
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,962
The snake talisman.
You just said you knew.

210
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,164
Power of invisibility...
Jade.

211
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,900
I'm losing you,
Jackie.

212
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,502
Good news,
captain black.

213
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,637
I don't think the king
has been kidnapped.

214
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,905
Kidnapped?!

215
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,507
-What are you--
-ohh, uh,
I have to go!

216
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,709
I'll call you later!
Bye-bye!

217
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,780
Is it about
the boy?

218
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,650
I believe his majesty
is safe and out exploring
with my niece.

219
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,621
Oh, this
is wonderful news.

220
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:40,091
Not for my niece.
I will find them.

221
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,593
I will join you.

222
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,462
The boy has often
spoken of places
he wished to visit,

223
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,999
but first,
I must inform
the others.

224
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,404
Yes?
Understood.

225
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,173
The boy is out
in the open.

226
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,208
The next call
will tell us where.

227
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,811
Then
we make the grab.

228
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,313
Leli: Ha ha ha ha!
Come look!

229
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,349
Look over here!
Ha ha ha!

230
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,153
(Both laugh)

231
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,687
Whoa, yippee!

232
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,228
We ought
to be getting back.

233
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,198
Please,
there is one more
place I must visit.

234
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,970
And there's
the pitch!

235
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,643
It's gonna
be close!

236
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,378
The runner slides!

237
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,514
He's safe!

238
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,083
Jackie: Yes,
but <i> you</i> are in trouble.

239
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,287
Both: I can explain.

240
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,722
We have located the boy.

241
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,391
Bayview stadium.

242
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,995
The talisman.

243
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,565
Heh, found out
about that, too, huh?

244
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,301
(Crash)

245
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,973
(Gasps)

246
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,984
Stay where you are
if you want the boy
to remain unharmed.

247
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,653
Uhh! Help!

248
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,132
Jackie:
No, captain black,

249
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,401
no word yet
from the kidnappers.

250
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,270
Yes,
please send a chopper.

251
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,840
I want Jade
and the, uh,
our reptile friend

252
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,911
back at section 13,
where they won't
cause any more trouble.

253
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,246
(Beeping)

254
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,150
It's a ransom note.

255
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,586
Shaktar is to deliver
the crown jewels of tangra

256
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,989
to a warehouse downtown,
alone,

257
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:54,525
within one hour
or we will never
see the king again.

258
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,861
(Gasps)
The crown jewels?

259
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,831
They are tangra's
most valuable treasure!

260
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,799
How do you worry
of mere baubles?

261
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,635
The boy
is in danger!

262
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,573
I will come with you.

263
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,242
But they requested me,
uh, alone.

264
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,046
We...Must do nothing
to jeopardize leli's
safe return.

265
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,214
Exactly.

266
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,615
These are bad men.

267
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,918
We cannot be sure
they will honor
their word.

268
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
Jackie,
let me come,
please?

269
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,788
Leli's
my friend.

270
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,456
I know that, Jade,

271
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,525
but it is
too dangerous.

272
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,127
Captain black
is on his way.

273
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,763
He will
be picking you up
by helicopter.

274
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,665
But Jackie...

275
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,833
You will return
the talisman
to the vault,

276
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,436
do your homework,
and go to bed.

277
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,805
(Scoffs)

278
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,274
Please,
bring our king
safely home.

279
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,045
I will not fail
his majesty.

280
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,154
Shaktar's hooked up
with the kidnappers!

281
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,956
I will see you
in the morning, Jade.

282
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,490
Jackie, wait!

283
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,427
(Helicopter arrives)

284
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,767
Jade?

285
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,741
Time to head back
to the old...

286
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,846
Jade?

287
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,054
I have brought
what you asked.

288
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,228
Your highness!
Are you all right?

289
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,264
Bring
the crown jewels to us,

290
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,367
and then
we let the boy go!

291
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,969
Whoa! Oof!

292
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,708
What sorcery is this?!

293
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,578
Nice try, shaktar,
but your cover
is blown.

294
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,581
Both: Jade!

295
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,649
And no ice
for you boys

296
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,485
till leli
is down here with me!

297
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,687
Oh, shh, Jade! No!
The whole thing's
a set up, Jackie!

298
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,689
What is going on here,
shaktar?!

299
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,891
We told you
to come alone!

300
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,228
Come alone? Hello?
What's <i> that</i> tell ya?

301
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,164
Shaktar hands over
the jewels, let's 'em
keep leli,

302
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,832
then they fax in
another ransom.

303
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,001
What nonsense
does she speak?!

304
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,369
I don't know.

305
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,339
Jade, you have gone
too far this time.

306
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:24,275
Jackie,
shaktar's got a tattoo
on the back of his neck,

307
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,843
just like
the other bad guys.

308
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,578
Look for yourself.

309
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,350
I'm sorry, shaktar,
but may I see

310
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,619
the back of your neck,
please?

311
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,330
But I thought--
shaktar: You thought wrong.

312
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,070
A simple plan.
Pawn the crown jewels,

313
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,239
use the funds to train
an elite fighting team,

314
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,408
and then a palace takeover.

315
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,210
But why?

316
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:03,414
Why? Because serving a king
is beneath me,

317
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,383
and I detest children.

318
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,652
Yeah? Well, you're gonna
have to get past one

319
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,887
to get your mitts
on the crown jewels!

320
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,022
Jade, no!

321
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,590
With pleasure.

322
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,864
Whoa!

323
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,536
Jade!

324
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,371
Aah!

325
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,674
Oh!

326
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:30,908
But how?

327
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,277
It is my mental kung fu.

328
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,446
I practice it
while meditating.

329
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,148
Care to see more?

330
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,152
Now, <i> that</i> was good.

331
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,254
Guess now you're
an army of one.

332
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,456
As long as I have
the jewels.

333
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,694
Shaktar, no!

334
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,236
Perhaps we should use
the invisibility talisman
and assist.

335
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,037
Jackie doesn't need
any help.

336
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,707
Besides, if he gets
a serious workout,

337
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,309
he may forget all about
grounding me.

338
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,186
Uhh...

339
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,966
Jackie chan,
for heroism
in the service

340
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,501
of the royal family,

341
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,771
I present you
with the star
of tangra.

342
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,339
Thank you, your highness.

343
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,841
Oh--

344
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,543
please,
do not bother.

345
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,344
I always thought
it looked foolish.

346
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,513
I much prefer
the high-five.

347
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,183
Whoa--unh!

348
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,018
Thank you
for everything, Jade.

349
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,587
You gave me a day
I will never forget.

350
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,190
Hey, even a king needs
a little vacation.

351
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,292
Perhaps someday
you will come visit?

352
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,760
We could play some ball.

353
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,094
You're on.

354
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,941
Hey, Jackie, is it hard
to be a celebrity?

355
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,176
You get a lot of things,
you lost a lot of things.

356
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:15,513
One day I sit down
in a shopping mall
coffee shop,

357
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,982
my friend said,
"I saw somebody
wanted your autograph."

358
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:23,621
As soon as I sign, 2 hours.
I just keep signing,
keep signing.

359
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,190
I really don't have
a private life anymore.

360
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:29,860
The good things, really,
I can get a lot
of free gifts.

361
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,030
Somebody give me one shoes,
I say, "can I have another
hundred pair?"

362
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,132
Somebody give me
exercise equipment...

363
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,735
"Can I have another
couple sets?"

364
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,238
Then I select
which high school,

365
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,340
which charity--I just give.

366
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,309
That's the best things
becoming famous.
