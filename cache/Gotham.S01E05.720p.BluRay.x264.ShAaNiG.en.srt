1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,811
There's a war coming.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,566
A terrible war. There will be chaos.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,731
Rivers of blood in the streets.
I know it. I can see it coming.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,407
It's time. Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,846
I'm looking for a connection between the
Arkham plan and the murders of my parents.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,921
If Maroni gets even a piece of Arkham,
it'll prove Falcone is weak.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,082
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,447
Hello, James, old friend.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,604
- I told you never to come back!
- Nobody looks for a dead man.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,529
So you want the job or what?

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,807
Yes.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,089
I ain't looking for no girl.
I'm looking for a weapon.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,005
Falcone thinks he can hit me
in my place of business...

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,367
...and get away with it?
I wanna hit him back.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,445
Fancy a stroll?

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,849
It's a lovely day.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,205
- Stretch the legs, breath of fresh air.
- I'm busy.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,810
I got a question for you, Master Bruce.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,403
What if all of this...

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,848
...was a complete and utter
bloody waste of time?

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,091
What if you never discovered
who killed your mom and dad?

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,480
Hmm?

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,684
What if you never get to wreak revenge?

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,002
I don't want revenge.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,488
I wanna understand how it all works.

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,091
How Gotham works.

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,529
Well, you'd have more chance
digging to China with a teaspoon.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,848
Take the Arkham project, for instance.

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,090
How did the Falcone and Maroni crime
families get such big shares in the deal?

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,802
I mean, I know city hall is corrupt...

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,321
...but why didn't Wayne Enterprises
do something?

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,604
Can you pass me that blue folder?

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,445
Well, I suppose as hobbies go, this is...

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,890
...a damn sight better than grilling
yourself like a bloody pork chop.

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,960
Still, not particularly healthy, is it?

36
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,208
Thank you.

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,521
Are you listening to me?

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,682
Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'll take
a walk later. Thank you, Alfred.

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,563
I won a piece of Arkham.
I strong-armed the mayor...

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,687
...I made Falcone back down, and you're
telling me I can't rob a lousy casino?

41
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,364
Sal, the casino is Falcone's pride and joy.
I mean, what's the point?

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,961
For a few thousand bucks,
why mess with Falcone?

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,491
That's the point...

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,401
...messing with Falcone. I want him and
his people to know we're not backing off.

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,404
Arkham was only the beginning.

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,689
We're taking over, Frankie. Inch by inch.

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,201
- Yeah, okay, but--
- "But, but, but."

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,966
- Make it happen.
- Okay, boss.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,531
What are you looking at?
You got something to say?

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,610
No, sir. Nothing at all.

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,570
Hey. Hey, man!

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,450
Hey.

53
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,684
Hey, you gotta pay for that.

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,001
Do not vex me, mortal.

55
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,364
Yeah?

56
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,091
Suit yourself, Zeus.

57
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,086
Hey, it might look
like the heel of a hobo's shoe.

58
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,123
Best burgers in midtown. Huh, Efram?

59
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,926
- If you say so.
- All right, I want two cheeseburgers...

60
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,885
...hold the sauce, extra pickles,
two malted shakes.

61
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,084
- No pickles on mine, please.
- Oh, you gotta trust me on this one.

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,891
Yeah? All right, pickles. Bring them.

63
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,562
You wanna look good
in a swimsuit like me...

64
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,451
...come summertime,
you'll want a lot of this and this.

65
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,005
All right.

66
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,123
- You!
- Hey!

67
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,244
Jim.

68
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,689
Jim! Come on, it's lunchtime. Relax.

69
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,890
It's lunchtime.

70
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,326
No, Jim. We're on our-- It's lunch!

71
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,010
Oh, brother.

72
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,804
Jim, you can't just pop up and jump
every time you hear a bell.

73
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,408
G.C.P.D. Anybody here?

74
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,450
Unh. Over here.

75
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,004
Oh. You all right, sir? You okay?

76
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,567
- Thank God you're here.
- Anybody dead?

77
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,561
I don't think so. Some guy, he
was stealing milk. I tried to stop him...

78
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,529
...he hauls away my ATM machine.

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,925
All right, nobody dead.
We're Homicide, and it's lunch.

80
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,529
So have a good day, sir.
Call 911 and someone will take care of you.

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,603
Wait a minute. One guy did this?

82
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Stole your ATM over milk?

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,802
Little skinny-ass dude. Guitar case.
Drinking milk like there's no more cows.

84
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,247
"Don't vex me, mortal," he says.

85
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,847
- I'm sorry, what?
- Listen, if I had a dollar...

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,004
...for every hobo skeez that walks
through that door thinks they're God...

87
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,770
...I wouldn't be here.

88
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,009
But this son of a bitch,
he wasn't fooling around.

89
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,483
All right. You get a description
of the vehicle, license, something?

90
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,330
He didn't have a vehicle.

91
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,763
Then how'd he pull your ATM from the wall?
How'd he take it away?

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,244
That's what I'm telling you, man. He
pulled it out of here with his bare hands.

93
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,006
I'm bored.

94
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,165
Poor little baby girl.
Cooped up in here all the time.

95
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,207
- You want some excitement.
- Yes, I do. Can we just go somewhere?

96
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,489
- Ah!
- How's that? Excited now?

97
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,241
- What'd you do that for?
- Why are you here with me?

98
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,010
- I'm your secret weapon.
- Exactly.

99
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,285
But are you helping me help you?
No, you're not.

100
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,162
You won't even learn the damn tune.
I told you this is important.

101
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,842
- I'm sorry, Mama.
- I'm not your mama.

102
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,489
Now, you might be my baby girl,
but I'm not your mama.

103
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,041
Not yet.

104
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,010
You have to earn that.

105
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,682
How is that even possible?
Who is this guy?

106
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,487
No positive ID as of
yet. He's a street guy.

107
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,371
We think that this thing has something
to do with his excessive joie de vivre.

108
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,609
Yeah, we found it in the suspect's
guitar case. It's some drug.

109
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,483
A drug did that? Wow.

110
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,364
Nygma found traces of the drug.

111
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,770
He'll have a read on what this is by tomorrow.
Meantime, we'll try and ID the strong man.

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,490
Yeah.

113
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,486
I know your families are upset...

114
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,962
...but tell them everybody
got a piece of the Arkham project.

115
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,605
It was a business decision.

116
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,564
We didn't lose, Maroni didn't win.

117
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,489
Maroni thinks he won.

118
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,842
He thinks he won a great battle.

119
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,684
- We need to hurt him.
- No.

120
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,406
If we don't push back hard,
he's going to think--

121
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,531
Nikolai, that fool will think
what I want him to think.

122
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,409
No pushback, not yet.

123
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,766
In my country, we say,
"Even a fool may bite the king...

124
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,610
...if he has teeth."

125
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,050
Can the folklore, Niko.
We're not in your godforsaken country.

126
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,086
We are here in Gotham,
where we have plumbing, electricity...

127
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,129
...and Don Falcone is the boss.

128
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,120
He's playing that cluck Maroni
on a long line. Done.

129
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,362
Why so angry, Fish?

130
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,642
I speak my mind. ls no crime.

131
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,482
And I assure you in my country,
we have all modern conveniences.

132
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,048
Only difference, ladies.
Ladies are in kitchen or in bed...

133
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,129
...depending on their talents.

134
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,322
I bet your mother was a lousy cook.

135
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,330
- Don't speak of my mother.
- Or what?

136
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,045
You're gonna hit a lady?

137
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,289
That's enough.
There'll be no bad blood here.

138
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,768
My apologies, Don Falcone.

139
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,722
We need each other. We're family.

140
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,485
Hey.

141
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,604
- Excuse me. You seen this guy, by chance?
- No.

142
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,285
Mm-mm.

143
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,249
Seen this guy?

144
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,845
Excuse me.

145
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,287
Familiar to you?

146
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,608
Any chance you seen this guy?

147
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,883
Yeah, I know him. It's, uh, Benny.

148
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,807
He's a guitar player. Strung
out like a string. What'd he do?

149
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,885
Uh, nothing bad. He came into an
inheritance, actually, no one knew about.

150
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,086
That's right. A million dollars. Farm, horses,
real nice. You know where we can find him?

151
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,961
Twenty dollars.

152
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,649
Ten.

153
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,928
- Same as the bodega.
- Yeah, what's with all the dairy products?

154
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,242
Sir, G.C.P.D. Let me see those hands.

155
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,446
Oh. Help me. I need more.

156
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,600
More what? What'd you take? What is it?

157
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,604
It felt so good.

158
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,207
And now I don't feel so good.
Something's wrong.

159
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,401
I need more. Please. You have to find him.

160
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,411
- Find who? The guy that gave you the stuff?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,927
The man with a mangled ear.

162
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,884
With a mangled ear. Go ahead.

163
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,448
Stay calm, we got it.
We're gonna help. Just put your--

164
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,642
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey!

165
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,125
Sir, we need you to calm down.

166
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,170
- Calm down.
- Unh!

167
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,760
- I said no.
- Put it down!

168
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,009
What the hell?

169
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,568
God help us if that drug gets out.

170
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,570
Will you look at this shambles?

171
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,891
What would your mother say?

172
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,521
You know, I have half a mind to stick
all this lot straight into the bloody fire.

173
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,882
- No fire.
- We'll see about that.

174
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,282
Come on. Up you get.

175
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,168
Wayne Enterprises is hosting
a charitable luncheon tomorrow.

176
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,206
I took the liberty of accepting their kind
invitation on your behalf, Master Bruce.

177
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,370
Good. ls there breakfast?

178
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,766
Yeah, I'll make you an egg.
Does that mean you'll go?

179
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,446
Yes. I have some questions I need to ask
the members of the board.

180
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,766
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

181
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,648
It seems likely those gangsters were given
their shares in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

182
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,889
Well, that's how business is done,
isn't it?

183
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,525
Is it?

184
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,362
My parents didn't do business that way,
did they?

185
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,404
No. No, they didn't, Master Bruce.

186
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,841
The board might not know. There's
quite a bit of clever camouflage used.

187
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,204
Shell companies, offshore accounts
and so forth.

188
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,808
Right. So you learned all of that
from all of this, did you?

189
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,044
Fantastic detective work.

190
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,642
I still want to get the whole lot
and chuck it straight in the fire.

191
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,002
Don't put anything in the fire, Alfred.

192
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,609
- That's an order.
- Right, Master Bruce.

193
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,762
Nothing in the fire.

194
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,441
<i>We are live in downtown Gotham, where
a deadly new drug has hit the streets.</i>

195
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,685
<i>Nicknamed Viper, users of this
mystery drug acquire great strength...</i>

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,680
<i>...and a euphoric sense of power,
but only for a few brief hours.</i>

197
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,322
<i>Then without exception,
they die a horrible death.</i>

198
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,530
It's really quite remarkable.

199
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,883
Viper somehow activates unused DNA.

200
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,448
The body starts to burn calcium
from the skeletal system as fuel...

201
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,166
...hence the victims' cravings
for milk and cheese.

202
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,250
They're desperately trying
to replace the missing calcium...

203
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,283
...but they can't consume enough.

204
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,008
Essentially, their bones crumble,
then they suffocate and die.

205
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,488
- Have you seen anything like this before?
- Nobody has. Totally new.

206
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,444
I can't tell you how thrilled I am--

207
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,770
No new reports for a few hours now. Maybe
they're done. Maybe they ran out of the stuff.

208
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,964
- I doubt it.
- Who would put this on the street?

209
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,204
Why? They're not even selling it.
They're giving it away.

210
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,041
- That's how you create demand.
- For a drug that kills you that fast?

211
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,846
First it makes you king of the world.
There'll be takers.

212
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,964
There'll be mayhem for sure.
But it's skell-on-skell mayhem.

213
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,562
If we keep the decent citizens indoors,
let the scumbags have at it?

214
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,603
Voilà, the end of crime.

215
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,446
Yeah, that's a nice thought, but no.

216
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,404
This stuff seems hard to make, no?

217
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,841
Oh. It takes a high level
of technical sophistication.

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,764
A state-of-the-art lab made this stuff.

219
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,281
So who has the biggest
and best lab in the city?

220
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,488
The best is WellZyn.

221
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,125
But this is not them.

222
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,081
They're a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.
Multibillion-dollar corporation.

223
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,560
Why would they do this?

224
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,520
I don't know.
But we might as well start at the top.

225
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,441
Let go of me. Let go of me!

226
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,847
Fascinating. Fascinating.

227
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,362
Maybe I should hire that guy
to take the casino.

228
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,769
Maybe you should snort some Viper.
Either way, I want it taken.

229
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,169
Sure, we'll take it.
I mean, it's tight as a nut.

230
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,802
Ten armed guards,
blast-proof doors, cameras.

231
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,964
We're gonna lose a few guys,
but we'll take it.

232
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,204
Excuse me. I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation regarding the casino.

233
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,845
Go mind your business.

234
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,731
- I'm sorry, of course. I'm so sorry.
- No.

235
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,241
Tell me. What about the casino?

236
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,564
I know a janitor
who runs the boiler room of the casino.

237
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,284
He could get you inside quite easily.

238
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,482
There are access tunnels
nobody knows about.

239
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,406
- Access tunnels?
- Sit down. Come here.

240
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,087
Thank you, sir. A great honor indeed.

241
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,924
What's your name again?

242
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,804
Everyone here calls me Penguin, sir.

243
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,840
You don't like that name, huh?

244
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,120
Yeah, well, you're wrong. It's a good name.

245
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,964
It works for you.

246
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,410
So how do you know this man?
The janitor?

247
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,931
I have connections.

248
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,164
Reliable, is he?

249
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,967
- I think I can persuade him to be.
- Boss, this guy is a dishwasher in a suit.

250
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,730
Relax.

251
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,165
Is that right, Penguin?
Are you just a dishwasher?

252
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,845
Because I don't get that vibe.

253
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,250
You come off as all humble,
but you got a little player in you, huh?

254
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,890
That's very perceptive of you, sir. Heh,
heh. I guess that's why you're the don.

255
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,889
Well... Heh, heh.

256
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,210
I'm not a dishwasher...

257
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,927
...and this isn't my first rodeo,
so to speak.

258
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,404
- So you rode some bulls, huh? I knew it.
- Well...

259
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,011
Well, tell all, cowboy.

260
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,726
- Well, my real name is Oswald Cobblepot.
- Mm-hm.

261
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,891
I think that once you hear my story, you'll
agree that I could be a great asset for you, sir.

262
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,280
Mm.

263
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,162
It's a long, funny story, really, but the
headline, just so you're not surprised...

264
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,280
- I used to work for Fish Mooney.
- Fish Mooney? Hey.

265
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,967
Yes, sir. I was privy to many aspects
of the Falcone family business.

266
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,566
- Until they tried to kill me. Heh, heh.
- Well... Heh, heh.

267
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,684
- Hello. Heh. Suffice it to say--
- Heh-heh-heh.

268
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,131
- That is a funny story.
- Mm.

269
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,370
I'm Taylor Reece, general counsel,
public relations for WellZyn.

270
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,564
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Thank you for saving us a trip.

271
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,202
We were en route as soon as
we were apprised of your inquiries.

272
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,529
WellZyn is committed
to good community relations.

273
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,291
- What do you know about Viper?
- What we see on the news.

274
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,046
WellZyn has no connection to this tragedy.

275
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,720
We will vigorously pursue
legal action against...

276
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,565
...any individuals making assertions
to the contrary.

277
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,563
Do you think we push a button,
or does she just rewind automatically?

278
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,691
We're looking for an employee of WellZyn's.

279
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,281
Male, with a severely damaged ear.

280
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,089
Yes. Full disclosure,
that does raise a flag.

281
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,291
That's Stan Potolsky.

282
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,087
He worked for us for several years
as a biochemist.

283
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,330
Primarily personal-care products.
Shampoos, toothpastes.

284
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,005
So, what happened?

285
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,124
Stan was frustrated that he wasn't
doing more important work.

286
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,009
He grew disgruntled and unstable.
We tried to get him help, but he resisted.

287
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,562
Last April, there was an incident.

288
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,449
He tried to cut off his own ear
during a disagreement with his supervisor.

289
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,608
Guess it was harder than he thought.

290
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,165
We had to let him go.

291
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,523
- Last known address?
- After he was terminated...

292
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,484
...he didn't even clear off his desk.

293
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,762
Just disappeared off the grid.

294
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,170
You knew, didn't you?

295
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,922
You knew all along it was him.
That's why you came to see us so fast.

296
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,610
That's incorrect.

297
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,407
Viper can only be produced
in a state-of-the-art lab, like yours.

298
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,843
Stan Potolsky is a brilliant man...

299
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,004
...perfectly capable
of building his own lab.

300
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,210
But you are more than welcome
to examine our facilities...

301
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,767
...with full and proper clearances,
of course.

302
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,328
- Of course.
- We'll get the paperwork started.

303
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,801
Lawyers. Scumbags, the lot of them.

304
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,651
Eh, some of them.
Let's go find Stan Potolsky.

305
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,602
Drive around looking for him? No. I'll
call Dispatch, have them put out an APB.

306
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,640
All right. I'll check with the desk,
see if his name's come up.

307
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,123
- Gordon, right?
- Yeah, who the hell are you?

308
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,090
You gotta come with me now,
nice and quiet, like.

309
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,965
- What are you talking about?
- We got a mutual friend.

310
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,243
- Oh, yeah? Who's that?
- Oswald Cobblepot.

311
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,731
Yeah, him.
And if you don't come with me now...

312
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,441
...we're gonna put his head in a bag
and send it to Falcone...

313
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,247
...which would be embarrassing
for you, no?

314
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,850
Or maybe we've been misinformed.

315
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,170
If I'm not ringing any bells here,
you can go on your merry way.

316
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,969
No, I'll come.

317
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,763
All right, shove over.

318
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,724
Hey, hey!

319
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,484
Welcome. I'm Salvatore Maroni.

320
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,163
I know who you are. What do you want?

321
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,966
- Here's the thing.
- Jim, just tell the truth.

322
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,929
You want a drink, Jim? I'm having
a Negroni. So good with seafood.

323
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,126
Water.

324
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,765
So our friend here
told me a fascinating story.

325
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,804
Never heard a story so good.
It's hard to believe it's true.

326
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,526
- It is, it's true.
- Shut up! Shut up!

327
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,970
One more word,
and I'll jam this down your throat.

328
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,730
I try to be civil, Jim.

329
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,043
But I'm not the kind of man
that likes to ask twice.

330
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,726
- So here's how it's gonna go.
- Slow down, Mr. Maroni.

331
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,287
- I don't know you--
- No, no, no.

332
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,643
You let me finish.
You'll have your turn to speak.

333
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,963
Okay, then.

334
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,088
I want you to tell me the same
exact story that Penguin told me.

335
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,687
What story is that?

336
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,808
You'd better know what story, my friend.

337
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,691
Because if you tell me
the same story he told me...

338
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,689
...then I could believe it's true.

339
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,729
Then I'm happy.

340
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,730
But if you tell me another story--
Oh, Mama.

341
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,768
Then someone's lying to me. I don't know
which one, then the both of you will die.

342
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,328
- Understand?
- Yes, I do.

343
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,648
Good. So...

344
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,962
...tell me a story, Jim.

345
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,601
Somebody murdered
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

346
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,201
- I caught the case--
- We didn't know each other then.

347
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,483
What did I say? Go put him on the slicer.

348
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,848
No, no, no.

349
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,131
If I don't like what I hear,
slice his face, prosciutt.

350
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,530
Oh, I'm sorry, go on.

351
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,002
I was a pawn...

352
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,289
...in a conspiracy between Falcone,
the mayor and the G.C.P.D...

353
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,609
...to frame Mario Pepper
for the Wayne murders...

354
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,089
...with the help of Fish Mooney,
Mr. Cobblepot's employer at the time.

355
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,405
Mr. Cobblepot then told
the whole story to the MCU.

356
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,642
To prove
that I wouldn't betray the conspiracy...

357
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,525
...Falcone ordered me to kill Cobblepot.

358
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,889
I didn't do it.

359
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,241
I let him live.

360
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,444
And here we are.

361
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,410
Falcone, Mooney, the MCU cops...

362
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,090
...none of them know he's alive?

363
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,045
If they did, I'd be dead already.

364
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,368
It's delicious. Ha-ha-ha.

365
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,603
Frankie, bring the Penguin back out here.

366
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,808
The little punk is telling the truth.

367
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,241
Thank you, Jim. Good story.

368
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,161
Told well. A lot of guys
in your situation, they freak out.

369
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,763
There you are, you rat, you snitch...

370
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,328
...you gorgeous turncoat son of a bitch.
Come here, I love you. Mwah.

371
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,087
Be happy, Frankie. We just got
a brand-new weapon against the Falcones.

372
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,170
- It's Christmas.
- Happy holidays. Can I go now?

373
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,289
Oh, yeah. Jim, you can go.

374
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,691
Just so that we understand each other...

375
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,649
...we'll keep all this hush-hush
between us pals.

376
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,730
And if I need you again, I'll call you.

377
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,446
Thank you.

378
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,805
You do that.

379
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,770
Look at you, come on.
Let's get you cleaned up. Come on.

380
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,321
I love you, baby.

381
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,767
I love you, baby.

382
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,644
- I love you, baby.
- Okay, now...

383
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,808
...you're still putting
too much sex on it.

384
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,642
Keep it clean, like a mother.

385
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,164
I love you, baby.

386
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,564
I love you, baby.

387
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,328
Good. Better.

388
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,127
Now, act as if you've caught me in a lie.

389
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,768
Not angry. No. Disappointment.

390
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,204
Oh, honey.

391
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,083
Oh, honey.

392
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,763
There you go. Now, about your hair...

393
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,131
There you are.

394
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,209
Where the hell have you been?

395
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,366
Personal business.

396
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,803
You disappear in the middle of a case,
and you can't even tell me why?

397
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,570
That's what "personal" means.

398
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,330
You in some kind of trouble?

399
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,889
Forget it. I don't wanna know your problems.
WellZyn sent by Potolsky's stuff. Grab a box.

400
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,602
- Anything useful yet?
- No, classic geeky loner.

401
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,444
Lived for his work. No wife.
No family. No real friends.

402
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,642
Is it Barbara? She get into something?

403
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,810
Uh... Yeah. Kind of.

404
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,721
Figures. No offense. Need any help?

405
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,326
No, I'm all right. Thanks.

406
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,644
Hey, what do you think about this?

407
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,126
Looks like a friend, no?

408
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,648
Judging by the books, the mascot...

409
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,531
Philosophy professor. Gotham U.

410
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,925
- Worth a shot.
- Amen.

411
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,601
I was just on my way to an appointment.

412
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,411
But, yes, I know Stan Potolsky.

413
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,645
He was a student of mine,
a very brilliant student.

414
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,683
You've stayed in touch over the years.

415
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,920
We have. He may be a biochemist,
but philosophy is a passion of his.

416
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,407
What can you tell us
about WellZyn firing him?

417
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,929
Research for WellZyn
led him into some dark moral corners.

418
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,522
WellZyn said he made shampoo.
Where are the dark moral corners in that?

419
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,645
Shampoo? Heh, heh.
They say that, do they?

420
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,845
No, no. Stan designed
pharmaceutical weapons...

421
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,048
...to be used by combat troops.

422
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,481
Drugs that worked on an epigenetic level.

423
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,129
Imagine an army made up of soldiers
so strong that they can tear a man apart...

424
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,008
...with their bare hands. Of course,
at the beginning, there were side effects.

425
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,565
Yeah, death.

426
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,491
But Viper was the first batch.
They worked out the kinks...

427
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,847
...in the second version, called it Venom.

428
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,400
By then, Stan had acquired some clarity.

429
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,363
He appealed to his bosses
to end the program.

430
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,487
They refused. So he went over their heads,
to Thomas and Martha Wayne.

431
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,366
He convinced them to shut it down.

432
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,326
And when they died,
WellZyn immediately revived the program...

433
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,966
...with the blessings
of Wayne Enterprises.

434
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,762
In the end, there was nothing for Stan to
do but to resort to more radical measures.

435
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,931
Killing people. I'm not hearing
a sense of moral outrage, professor.

436
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,808
If you don't mind, I'll reserve my moral
outrage for the true villains of this piece.

437
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,048
You mean WellZyn.

438
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,687
You planned this with Potolsky.

439
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,090
- Yes.
- Where is he? Talk fast, bub.

440
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,721
What are you gonna do?
I'm an old man. I'm dying.

441
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,207
I'll help you die quicker, you terrorist.

442
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,840
Soon Stan will issue a statement
the world can't ignore.

443
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,164
Soon? Today?

444
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,647
- You're already too late.
- Now you tell us where--

445
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,451
You said you had an appointment?
Where are you going?

446
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,571
Bravo! You've asked the right question.

447
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,481
The first step to enlightenment.

448
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,970
God!

449
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,885
- Where is he? Where's Potolsky?
- Those hypocrites.

450
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,566
Empty altruism will not erase
what they've done.

451
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,927
- They must pay.
- Who? Who must pay?

452
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,771
WellZyn, Wayne Enterprises.

453
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,967
Everyone will finally see them
for what they are.

454
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,090
How? Where's Potolsky headed?

455
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,881
What's altruism?

456
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,805
Charity.

457
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,567
I know where he's going.

458
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,441
- Name, please?
- He's Bruce Wayne. Master Bruce Wayne.

459
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,967
- Just this way. Thank you.
- Thank you.

460
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,967
<i>Wayne Enterprises is...</i>

461
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,810
<i>...a helping hand.</i>

462
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,650
<i>A port in the storm.</i>

463
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,085
Ah. That's Ms. Mathis.
She worked closely with your father.

464
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,805
<i>A shelter for all.</i>

465
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,643
<i>And clean water...</i>

466
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,446
Please sit, Bruce.

467
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,287
It is so good to see you out and about.

468
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,760
Glad to be here.

469
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,170
All of us at Wayne Enterprises
are so sorry for your loss.

470
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,243
So are all you here on the board?

471
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,967
Oh, heavens.
No, we're middle management.

472
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,601
The board members
don't do this sort of thing.

473
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,566
No? Why not?

474
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,771
Well, they're very busy people, Bruce.

475
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,927
Your family created a company
worth billions and billions of dollars.

476
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,451
How awesome is that?

477
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,645
Awesome. I wanted to speak to them
because I found...

478
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,804
...what looks like serious irregularities
in the Arkham project.

479
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,244
Irregularities?

480
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,130
I can assure you, Bruce,
that Wayne Enterprises...

481
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,961
...would never countenance doing business
with criminals. Just wouldn't happen.

482
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,051
I hope so, but I'd like to speak
directly with the board myself.

483
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,163
Can you make that happen?

484
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,161
I can certainly try.

485
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,568
They prefer to communicate with minors
via the usual legal mediation, but--

486
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,684
<i>Good evening.
This is a public service announcement...</i>

487
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,047
<i>...on behalf of all living creatures.</i>

488
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,001
<i>You've heard of a drug called Viper?</i>

489
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,250
<i>That's me. I made it for WellZyn...</i>

490
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,165
<i>...a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

491
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,641
- Is this true?
- Of course not, Bruce.

492
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,002
I mean, this man is clearly insane.

493
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,651
The AC plant, where is it?

494
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,723
- On the roof?
- Straight ahead, staircase.

495
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,081
Clear the ballroom.

496
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,046
<i>I had hoped that a demonstration
using street people would suffice...</i>

497
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,128
<i>...but it seems bad things only truly happen
when they happen to important people...</i>

498
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,728
<i>...like you.</i>

499
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,724
G.C.P.D. Everybody out!

500
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,407
Turn it off!

501
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,050
I can't do that.

502
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,850
Turn it off or I'll shoot!

503
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,129
Go ahead. My work is done.

504
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,769
Turn around, put your hands
behind your head! Interlock your fingers!

505
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,760
That's all right.
You're angry and confused.

506
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,206
I understand.

507
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,846
There's no more need for violence.

508
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,408
Don't shoot!

509
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,329
That's considerate of you.

510
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,206
I'm leaving now.

511
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,486
Go look in Warehouse 39.

512
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,242
- You're not going anywhere!
- I can go anywhere I want!

513
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,724
Don't do it.

514
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,646
You really can have
too much of a good thing.

515
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,328
Nothing.

516
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,605
What'd you expect?

517
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,730
It's Gotham.

518
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,729
It's Mathis. I'm outside the site.
They're here.

519
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,968
No, I think we should leave them be.

520
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,727
There's nothing here for them.

521
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,961
We'll review that if they get close.

522
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,046
- It's been 10 minutes.
- I-- I assure you my friend is reliable. Ahem.

523
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,445
You scared, Penguin?

524
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,322
Your voice is doing that shaky thing.

525
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,121
Heh, heh. No, sir. I'm fine.

526
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,085
You don't have to act tough.
Nerves are a good thing.

527
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,363
Perhaps I am a bit jittery, sir.

528
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,211
Good. You should be.

529
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,288
Because if my boys don't make it,
neither do you.

530
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,524
Keep going!

531
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,687
Ah. Take that, Falcone, you son of a bitch.

532
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,969
Huh? I told you, Frankie,
the kid's a player.

533
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,889
He's got a future.

534
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,970
What are you waiting here
like an old lady? Go.

535
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,128
Untie me.

536
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,084
Say "pretty please."

537
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,009
Please.

538
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,010
Ah!

539
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,004
Sometimes I think you really don't like me.

540
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,842
Now, would I be backing your takeover
if I didn't like you?

541
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,169
That stuff with Falcone, well,
we have to look good for the old man.

542
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,607
If he figures out we're working together...

543
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,449
...we'd be cooked. Patience.

544
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,967
- I have no more patience.
- Mm.

545
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,330
The old man has to go.
We must strike soon.

546
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,721
Yes, mm...

547
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,327
...but softly.

548
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,084
Excuse me.

549
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,770
I couldn't help but overhear
that aria you were humming.

550
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,288
- Oh, yes. It's my favorite.
- Mine too.

551
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,964
Ah, well, there you go.

552
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,251
I'm sorry. I just--
I didn't mean to bother you.

553
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,966
My mother sang that to me
when I was young.

554
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,003
Her whole life, she sang that to me.

555
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,244
I hadn't heard it in a while,
and I had to smile because you look...

556
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,011
Anyhow, sorry. I'm rambling on.

557
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,081
No, that's okay. Do you wanna listen?

558
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,849
Well, yes. Sure. Thank you.

559
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,883
Let's sit down.
