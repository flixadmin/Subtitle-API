1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,750
- My name is Eobard Thawne.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,590
With the help of Damien Darhk,

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,720
Malcolm Merlyn,

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,160
Leonard Snart, and Mick Rory,

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,990
I've obtained
the spear of destiny...

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,630
An ancient artifact
with the power

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,330
to rewrite reality itself,
and we have.

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,770
It's a brave new world.

9
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,250
Aah!

10
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,600
- Whoops!

11
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,240
- The mayor would like a word,

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,210
miss Smoak.

13
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,040
- Then maybe he should've
come down here himself

14
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,150
instead of sending
the bimbo brigade.

15
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,050
- Rude!

16
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,850
Uhh!

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,820
- Well done, ladies.

18
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,790
Star city owes you
a debt of gratitude.

19
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,790
- Just doing our job,
Mr. mayor.

20
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,560
- Yes, but you do it so well,
and with such... style.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,070
And you've done a bang-up job
dealing with my... pest problem,

22
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,170
though that term may be
giving you vigilantes

23
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,740
a little too much credit.

24
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,640
Even a cockroach knows
when to pack up

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,180
and head out of dodge.

26
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,380
- Star city is my home.
I will never stop fighting.

27
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,210
- Sure you will.

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,420
Kill her.

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,550
Hmm.

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
Get rid of that.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,460
Oh, but I will take this mask...

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,560
So I can add it
to my collection.

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,640
- No, I will not take a seat

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,240
and wait for him
to have an opening.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,980
He can make time for me now.
Can't you, eobard?

36
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,610
I'm so sorry, Mr. thawne.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,420
- He insisted.

38
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,190
- I see your friend is
still putting up a fight.

39
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,490
- He'll give up.
All caged animals do eventually.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,430
- Now, tell me why you've flown
all the way out here again.

41
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,170
- You keep ignoring my requests
for a meeting.

42
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,870
- Because there's
no reason for one.

43
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,770
Our partnership has ended.

44
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,270
You got what you wanted.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,640
Your wife and your son are both
alive and in good spirits.

46
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,480
Your daughter thea adores you.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,020
Nyssa al ghul is trapped
in a miserable, closeted life

48
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,490
in the middle of Ohio, and hey,

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,620
you can even clap again.

50
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,090
What more could you
possibly want?

51
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,160
- How about
the spear of destiny?

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,890
There are still some things
in this world

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,330
that I would like to see change.

54
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,930
- How many times do i
have to tell you this, Malcolm?

55
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,230
The spear is safest in my hands.

56
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,100
Besides, I'm the only one
who knows how to use it.

57
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,340
- That's because you destroyed
the kalabros manuscript.

58
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,570
- Well, it's not my fault

59
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,570
you don't retain information
like I do.

60
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,780
Speedster brains
are handy that way.

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,250
- Mr. Jackson is here
to see you.

62
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,880
- Send him in.

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,150
- Good morning,
Mr. thawne.

64
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,890
- Jefferson.

65
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,860
How are things down at the lab?

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,020
- There was a minor setback,

67
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,060
but the situation
is under control.

68
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,030
- You promised me results.

69
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,260
- And you will have them.

70
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,300
I just need to motivate
my employee a little more.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,010
But another test will be
up and running this evening.

72
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,810
- I hope so, for his sake...

73
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,780
And yours.

74
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,780
- Yes.

75
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,180
I don't know why

76
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,490
you and Damien insist on toying
with the legends.

77
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,420
It's sloppy. They should be
wiped from existence.

78
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,390
- I prefer this arrangement.

79
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,390
I believe it's called
"poetic justice."

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,500
- And, uh, what is this project
you're working on?

81
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,370
- I'm a man of science, Malcolm.

82
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,270
I'm compelled to innovate,
invent, and inspire.

83
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,940
A genius brain needs
a genius challenge.

84
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,110
Now go. Enjoy your family,
spend your wealth.

85
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,750
The world is as it should be.

86
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,020
Be satisfied with your spoils.

87
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,890
The others are having
the time of their lives.

88
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,860
- Stop!
Hold it right there!

89
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,900
- Cool it, Mick.
We already got what we came for.

90
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,930
- Just heating things up.

91
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,300
- Don't move!
Both of you on the ground!

92
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,900
- Mr. Snart.
Sorry, sir.

93
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,070
We didn't realize it was you.

94
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,410
Carry on.

95
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,450
- What the hell's going on?
No roasting pigs?

96
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,650
- No need.
We're home free, buddy.

97
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,020
It's good to be the king.

98
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,150
- No getaway, no chase?

99
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,760
- You want a chase,
i can arrange a chase.

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,260
Even get us tossed
in iron heights,

101
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,760
and we can plan an escape
just like old times.

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,260
How does that sound?
- Boring!

103
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,200
- Well, we could hit up
the central city bank.

104
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,070
They've got a fancy new vault
I've been dying to crack.

105
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,600
- What's the point?

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,370
You own the bank
and half the city.

107
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,770
- You mean we own
half the city, Mick.

108
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,210
We're partners, remember?

109
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,240
Mm.

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,980
Seems our next score
will have to wait.

111
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,050
Thawne is...

112
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,050
Summoning us.

113
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,780
- Since when do we get summoned?

114
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,720
- Since the man agreed
not to erase

115
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,490
you and your friends
from existence.

116
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,670
- Gideon, I've finally perfected
my fondant bows.

117
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,970
What do you think?

118
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,470
- Your technique has
vastly improved

119
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,780
over the last year, captain.
These cakes are

120
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,850
so much more creative
than your biscuits.

121
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,550
- Now, credit where credit
is due, Gideon.

122
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,420
Your idea of adding more gelatin
to the mixture was pivotal.

123
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,420
- Well done. The best one yet,
in my humble opinion.

124
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,290
- It's a shame that you're

125
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,160
the only one here
to appreciate it.

126
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,130
- I'm sure your team would be
just as impressed.

127
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,130
- Assuming that they're all
still alive.

128
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,900
- Perhaps you should
resume your efforts

129
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
to send a message out.

130
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,800
- What's the point, Gideon?

131
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,740
The legion have
the spear of destiny!

132
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,240
They're like gods now!

133
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,910
There's no point in fighting.

134
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,340
Not anymore.

135
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,790
- Stein!

136
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,030
Yes, Mr. Jackson?

137
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,870
- What's this I hear about you
taking tomorrow off?

138
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,670
- It's Saturday, sir,
and it's my daughter's birthday.

139
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,810
- Oh. Well, of course.
Take the day off.

140
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,680
In fact, why don't you take
the whole week off?

141
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,010
- Really?

142
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,750
- Of course.

143
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,620
I mean, the project's ready
for Mr. thawne to use, correct?

144
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,990
- Well, in fact...
- In fact, old man,

145
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,390
you will not be leaving
this building

146
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,220
until Mr. thawne
sees results.

147
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,430
- I-i have been working nonstop
for the past month.

148
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,630
I haven't seen my wife
and daughter in weeks.

149
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,560
- You want to see your family?

150
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,630
Then you will get that reactor
working by tomorrow night.

151
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,670
- It's impossible.
There's too much data...

152
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,400
- Get it working!

153
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,310
Or you will never see that
precious family of yours again.

154
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,580
Somebody clean this place up!
It's a damn mess.

155
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,990
- I'm so sorry,
may I help you with that?

156
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,730
- Oh. No worries, man.
I got it.

157
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,330
- Yes, Mr. president,
you know I'll be there.

158
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,440
You know I love
receiving medals.

159
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,040
And then, uh, golf on Sunday.

160
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,140
And dinner at your hotel after?

161
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,350
All right, all right,
best to Mel.

162
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,410
Bye-bye.

163
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,050
I am so sorry.
I had to take that.

164
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,520
There's only so many times
you can tell

165
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,150
the president
of the United States

166
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,390
that you'll call him back.

167
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,260
- You want to get to the point?
- Yes.

168
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,160
I brought you here to discuss
a... sensitive matter,

169
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,930
and it goes by the name
of Malcolm merlyn.

170
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,270
- What about him?

171
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,830
- Want you to keep an eye
on him for me.

172
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,870
- We're not your watchdogs.

173
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,170
- Hmm. What was that?

174
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,740
- What he meant was,
we're not spies. We're thieves.

175
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,380
- Mr. thawne,
i need to speak with you!

176
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,650
I just need five minutes
of your time.

177
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,150
Please.

178
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,620
Reality's at stake.
The world isn't right.

179
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,360
- Okay, let him go.
Let him go.

180
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,630
Let's just... let's see
what he has to say.

181
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,790
It's okay.

182
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,230
- He intentionally hit me
in the ribs.

183
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,900
First of all, awesome office.

184
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,070
I guess it pays to be
the smartest man in the world,

185
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,270
which is why
I've come to you for help.

186
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,270
- You were saying that
the world isn't right.

187
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,040
- Yeah, this world we're in now
is wrong.

188
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,650
Reality has, uh,
has changed somehow.

189
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,680
- How do you know all this?

190
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,850
- Um, well,
there's signs everywhere

191
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,220
if you know where to look.
There's subtle inconsistencies

192
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,260
in the fabric...
Of reality.

193
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,760
Um, I call 'em scars.

194
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,230
You know, like,
after you've been operated on.

195
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,900
Well, um, reality has been
operated on.

196
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,770
Truly fascinating.

197
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,070
- I'm giddy with excitement.

198
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
What's that got to do with him?

199
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,850
- Well, um, Mr. thawne
could help me fix it.

200
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,850
Look, right, you're a genius.

201
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,050
You figured out cold fusion.
You saved the polar bears,

202
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,590
you fixed global warming.

203
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,350
I mean, you made desalination
sustainable.

204
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,460
I mean, you solve problems
like this, like, every day.

205
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,660
If anyone... anyone can figure out
why these scars exist

206
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,270
and how to put the world
back to the way it was...

207
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,900
It's you, dude.

208
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,440
- You know what?

209
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,540
I think you're on to something.

210
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,440
- Ah.

211
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,010
- Something is definitely

212
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,550
not right here.

213
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,280
Fix it.
Take mister...

214
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,550
- Heywood.
- Mr. Heywood.

215
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,150
Take Mr. Heywood out
for some fresh air.

216
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,890
And, uh, kill him.

217
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,660
- Me?

218
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,000
- Look, I don't understand.

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
If this is about my work,
nobody pays attention to it.

220
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
My mom's the only person
that reads my blog.

221
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
- Stop talking.

222
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,040
- Guys, I am not a threat
to anyone... unless I'm right.

223
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,880
Am I right?

224
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,080
- Sounds like fitting
final words to me.

225
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,720
- Whatever... science or magic
altered reality must have left

226
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,820
small scars on my memory that
my subconscious picked up on.

227
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,430
So if I'm not
a conspiracy theorist

228
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,730
no one listens to, then...

229
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,100
Who am I?

230
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,230
- Dead.
- Wait.

231
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,630
- What?
- He said, "wait."

232
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,600
- I heard him.
- He said, "wait."

233
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,440
- You promised me things were
gonna be like old times.

234
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,080
- It is like old times,
only better.

235
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,510
Central city is ours.
No more flash.

236
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,950
- Except another speedster's
calling the shots.

237
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,380
- You leave thawne to me.

238
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,420
I always have a plan.
You know this.

239
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,690
- Well, fill me in.

240
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,290
- When the time is right.

241
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,990
- Ah, yes, we're partners,

242
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,960
except when you refuse
to tell me what's going on.

243
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,460
- You son of a...

244
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,340
- Sorry, buddy.
I owed you that.

245
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,270
- You saved my life.
Why?

246
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,610
- Because I'm an idiot.

247
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,950
- This could be
one of my scars talking,

248
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,650
but I'm sensing you're
telling me the truth.

249
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,850
- Let's move.

250
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,190
- Okay.

251
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,760
- This is crazier than any
of my crazy theories.

252
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,270
You're trying to tell me a group
called "the legion of doom"

253
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,770
used something called
"the spear of destiny"

254
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,570
to rewrite reality?

255
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,270
Who even names something
"legion of doom"?

256
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,610
- You did.

257
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,710
- Me?

258
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,740
Now, do you only remember
the old reality

259
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,280
because you're
part of the legion?

260
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,150
- I'm not part of anything.

261
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,520
I just made a terrible mistake.

262
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,030
You filthy aliens.

263
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,600
- Come on, wait a minute.

264
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,370
This is the guy who's gonna
fix reality?

265
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,540
- Uh-huh.
- Uh...

266
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,540
Who are you guys, and, um,
what are you doing here?

267
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,980
- We need your help.

268
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,610
- What do you got, like,
a clogged toilet or something?

269
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,550
'Cause, you know,
I'm... I'm off duty now.

270
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,320
You're not a janitor.

271
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
- Yeah, I am, man.
It says so on my name...

272
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,790
On my name tag.

273
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,490
- You're a geek, a nerd,
a genius.

274
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,290
That's why we're here.

275
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,790
- Oh, is this
about the dipole magnets

276
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,330
that I borrowed
from s.T.A.R. Labs?

277
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,060
'Cause I'm totally gonna
return those.

278
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,600
Look, man,

279
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,070
he said you're the one
that could fix this reality.

280
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,140
- Fix this reality?

281
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,540
What do you mean?

282
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,110
You guys think there's
something wrong too?

283
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,410
- Whoa.
- Oh!

284
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,040
That's... that's private stuff,
man.

285
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
- What is it?

286
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,710
- Um, I don't know exactly.

287
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,580
I mean... I mean,
i think I know, but I don't...

288
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,580
- Spit it out, haircut.

289
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,790
- Well, um, I Ki...

290
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,720
I kinda built it on impulse.

291
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
You know, like, on instinct.

292
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,930
I call it, uh,
a transreality multiplexer.

293
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,900
No real reason.
Just thought it sounded cool.

294
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,400
- Don't you get it, man?

295
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,240
Your impulse was a reality scar
working on your subconscious.

296
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
- Reality scar.

297
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,210
- So, uh, what does
this fun gun do?

298
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,040
- Uh, theoretically,

299
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,980
it targets irregularities
in the hippocampus,

300
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,110
acting like a "control-z"
for memories.

301
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,520
- "Control-z"?

302
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,720
- Like an undo command
on a computer.

303
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,750
- Oh.

304
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,190
- Well, I was gonna try
the new version

305
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,490
on my latest test subject,

306
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,690
but then I was worried
it might melt his brain.

307
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,530
- Axel.

308
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,460
- No, it's Tesla, actually.

309
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,100
- He looks more like
an Indiana to me.

310
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,770
- No, he's Axel.

311
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,630
You gave me that little guy
for Christmas.

312
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,100
You haven't been running
any tests on him, have you?

313
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,510
- What? No.

314
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,380
- Whoa. Whoa!
No, no! No!

315
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,540
- All right, I think
actually for it to work

316
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,040
you have to shoot him
in the head.

317
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,950
- Why would you say that?

318
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,310
Hey, how many people

319
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,950
are gonna point guns
at me today?

320
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,050
- Oh, my god, you killed him!

321
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,960
- You son of a bitch.

322
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,070
- It works.

323
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,540
- So, Mr. Rory's having
second thoughts?

324
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,440
- Mick's just a little confused.
I can control him.

325
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
- Obviously you can't.

326
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
- Yes, I can.

327
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,680
I just need your help getting
him back on the reservation,

328
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,220
before thawne finds out.

329
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,820
- We have bigger problems.

330
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,990
What if Heywood's only the first
of his old teammates.

331
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,460
Mr. Rory's feeling
nostalgic for?

332
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,290
- I knew we should've
killed them all.

333
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,630
It was a dangerous oversight

334
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,300
to keep them alive
in any capacity.

335
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,860
- Does that include Mick?

336
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,370
- At the very least
we should've wiped his brain,

337
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,000
such as it is.

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
You trusted your buddy
a little too much.

339
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,040
- Calm yourself, Malcolm.

340
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,980
We'll have Mr. Rory back
before he does too much damage.

341
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,850
- Yes, boss?

342
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,220
- Mick Rory's got himself lost.

343
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,980
Find him, would you?

344
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,050
- Where do you suggest
we start our search?

345
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,460
- You can track him with this.
I put a GPS in Mick.

346
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,430
I don't trust anyone.

347
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,300
- Okay, on the count of three.

348
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,400
One...

349
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
Two...

350
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,370
Oh.

351
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,780
You!

352
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,810
I deserved that.

353
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,380
- Damn straight you did.

354
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,920
- Hey, if it wasn't for me,
you'd all be dead.

355
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,420
- Yeah, Mick, thanks a lot.

356
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,660
You trapped each of us
in our own personal hell.

357
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,830
- Do you have any idea
how many toilets I've cleaned?

358
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,730
So many.

359
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,500
- Amaya.

360
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,700
- Sara.

361
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,140
- Hey, dumbasses,

362
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,240
they have no clue who you are.

363
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,610
They work for Damien Darhk.

364
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,910
- Oh!

365
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,510
- Crap.

366
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,990
- I don't like the way
she's looking at us.

367
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,160
- I like the way
she's looking at us.

368
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,460
Love the suits.

369
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,810
- Get off my friend!

370
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,010
- All right guys, time out,
come on. Come on, look.

371
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,950
I know this may sound crazy,
but doesn't it seem

372
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,950
like there's something wrong
with this world?

373
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,680
- Yeah.
Rory sold out the boss.

374
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,390
- To throw in with you losers.

375
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,750
- Losers? I'll have you know
in my reality,

376
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,520
you and I had sex,
and we both liked it very much.

377
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,860
- Nate, not helping.

378
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,530
- Amaya, look at me.

379
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,270
Tell me you don't recognize me,
like, deep in your subconscious.

380
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,300
- Come... look, this isn't
how it's supposed to be.

381
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,840
Okay, you're supposed to be
heroes like us.

382
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,810
- Okay. Allow me...

383
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,310
To demonstrate my superpowers.
Okay?

384
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,080
- Knock it off, you idiot.

385
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,050
The spear took away your powers.

386
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,920
- But it's true.

387
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,420
Nate used to be able
to steel up,

388
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,890
and I had a robotic exoskeleton
that allowed me to shrink.

389
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,330
- Oh...

390
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,630
These guys are heroes.

391
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,130
- That is so great.

392
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,100
- We kill heroes.

393
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,470
- Aw.

394
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,690
- One more person hits me,
I'm gonna punch back.

395
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,860
- What the hell happened to me?

396
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,100
- It appears that
after the legion

397
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,930
got the spear
and changed reality,

398
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,330
they kept us around
as their pets.

399
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,000
- Yeah, except for you.

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,270
You helped the legion
steal the spear!

401
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,110
- Speaking of, the legion's
probably on their way here

402
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,180
to kill us.
We need to get out of here.

403
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,380
- Yeah.
Gotta find someplace to hide.

404
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,520
Your mom's basement?

405
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,120
Really?

406
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,320
- I pay rent, so legally
it's my basement, kinda.

407
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,660
- Mommy makes great sandwiches.

408
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,190
- The best.
It's the perfect amount

409
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,030
of mayo/meat/bread ratio
that really gives it...

410
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,800
- Focus!
We need to figure out

411
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,770
how we can rescue
the rest of the team,

412
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,640
and get the spear back
so we can undo

413
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,970
everything the legion has done.

414
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,070
- Except now they know
we're trying

415
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,910
to get the band back together.

416
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,180
- Except they don't know
that you've gotten to me,

417
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,210
which means...
- You can sneak into the legion

418
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,380
and pretend to be
Darhk's favorite chick.

419
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,850
- It's our best shot
at getting Amaya back.

420
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,190
- All right.
What about the rest of the team?

421
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,050
- Well, the professor and Jax
are working

422
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,290
on some secret project
for thawne.

423
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,890
I don't know where
the englishman is.

424
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,030
- Neither do I.

425
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,660
- Mmm. I can only imagine
how those psychopaths

426
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,870
are torturing rip.

427
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,800
- Gideon!
I've discovered

428
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,840
the missing ingredient
for my recipe.

429
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,840
Rum.

430
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,680
And speaking of which,
I'm gonna need you

431
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,520
to fabricate me
another bottle of it.

432
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,020
Ooh, and some nachos.

433
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,690
- I will do nothing of the sort.

434
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,290
- What?

435
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,190
You will do as I tell you,
Gideon, I'm your captain!

436
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,660
- Then it's time for you
to start acting like one.

437
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,770
Now, sit up straight and show
your backbone, captain hunter.

438
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,740
- Gideon,
for the thousandth time,

439
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,540
I've got no way of getting
the reserve power back online,

440
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,010
and I've got no way of...

441
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,940
Of sending out
any signal of any sort,

442
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,750
which means...

443
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,620
Which means that I am destined
to live out the rest of my days

444
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,460
right... here...

445
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,020
With you.

446
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,390
- While you were honing
your confectionary skills,

447
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,160
I've been working
on new algorithms

448
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,660
to redirect power from
the idle quadrants of the ship.

449
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,930
You need to focus on boosting
your distress signal

450
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,970
once power is fully back online.

451
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,970
Now, chin up, captain.

452
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,740
- I don't know if I can
do this, Gideon.

453
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,580
- I believe in you.

454
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Now, let's get to work.

455
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,420
- First...

456
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,290
I'm going to vomit.

457
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,460
And second...

458
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Let's do this.

459
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
- When your minions
bring Mick back,

460
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,000
I want to arrange
a meeting with thawne.

461
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,940
When I say "arrange
a meeting," I mean...

462
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,600
- One between thawne
and his maker?

463
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,070
- Cute. A little
mustache-twirly for my taste.

464
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,170
You're really gonna have to

465
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
step up your tactics, Leonard.

466
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,580
- Yeah, you didn't think
that thawne was

467
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,310
actually gonna fall
for that fake meeting trick?

468
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,850
- This is not
"the godfather."

469
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,550
- Although we do agree
with your sentiment.

470
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,920
Eobard has to go.

471
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,590
- So glad you both approve.

472
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,090
- Which brings us back
to our original conundrum.

473
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,320
- How to kill a speedster.

474
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,390
We found your partner,

475
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,100
and he's got himself
some friends.

476
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,230
- And where, pray tell,
is your partner, miss Lance?

477
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,300
- We got separated in the fight.

478
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,040
I haven't heard from her since,

479
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,070
so I'm guessing
she's dead by now.

480
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,710
- Ah, that's the thing
about Sara Lance,

481
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,610
she never stays dead
for very long.

482
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,710
- Sorry, we underestimated them.

483
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,810
Won't happen again.
We'll fix this.

484
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,480
Let's go.
- Oh...

485
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Not so fast.

486
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,620
- Yes?

487
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,130
I have a question for you.

488
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,260
Which one is
your favorite trophy?

489
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,470
- That's like asking a girl
to pick just one pair of shoes.

490
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,400
- Oh, please, everyone has
their favorite kill.

491
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,210
You want to hear mine?

492
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,980
Her name was black canary.

493
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,880
I will never forget her.
Hmm.

494
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,850
It was so... delicious,

495
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,790
killing her.

496
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,420
They told me that
I'd done it before,

497
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,060
but I can't imagine it
ever getting old.

498
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,530
- The very first thing I did
in this reality

499
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,100
was acquire my magic.

500
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,470
I'm gonna miss you,
Ms. Lance.

501
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,940
Having you around to attend
to my every whim

502
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,440
was too enticing to pass up.

503
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,280
Plus, it's so hard to find
good help these days.

504
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,680
- Really? Now's the time
for a bad guy monologue?

505
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,150
- You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

506
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,890
- No better time
than the present.

507
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,260
Amaya, the honor is yours.

508
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,360
- Good-bye.

509
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,170
What the hell?

510
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,540
- Shoot now.
Explain later.

511
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,540
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

512
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,380
- Damien, what did I tell you?

513
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,780
For what it's worth,

514
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,550
I thought it was
a very good bad guy monologue.

515
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,060
- Everything's on schedule,
Mr. thawne.

516
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,400
You have nothing to worry about.

517
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,900
- Hey.

518
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,230
What do you want?

519
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
There's just one thing
i don't understand.

520
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,170
If thawne made this world
to punish us,

521
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,080
how are your mom's sandwiches
so good, bro?

522
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,940
- Her condiment game's
on point, right?

523
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,150
- Mmm.
- She even had

524
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,550
gluten-free bread for me.

525
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,520
- Look, let's just get
back to the ship.

526
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,120
- We don't know where
the ship is,

527
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,890
or rip, which means
our next move

528
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,450
should be
to rescue the professor.

529
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,120
- Speaking of which, what did
thawne have you two working on?

530
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,560
- Grey did most of the work,
and...

531
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,830
I just made his life hell.

532
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,430
But from what I could tell,

533
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,300
he was building
some sort of reactor.

534
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,030
He said it would burn
a thousand times hotter

535
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,400
than the sun
once it's operational.

536
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,830
- I like the sound of that.

537
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,300
- Could be a power generator,
a particle accelerator.

538
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,740
- What if thawne is trying
to destroy the spear?

539
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,580
- Uh-uh, impossible.
You need the blood of Christ

540
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,910
to destroy it. That's why rip
broke it up into so many pieces.

541
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,780
- Unless he figured out there's
another way, by incinerating it.

542
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,020
- But why would thawne want
to destroy the spear?

543
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,350
- Oh, no.

544
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,560
If he destroys the spear,

545
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,630
that means this reality
cannot be rewritten.

546
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,370
- Okay, we better get that spear
before he can make that happen.

547
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,770
- But even if we find it,

548
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,600
we don't know how
to access its powers.

549
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,370
- Rory does. You were there,
right, when they used the spear?

550
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,340
- Mm-hmm.
They read out of some book

551
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,210
called the, uh, "calibrick."

552
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,380
"Cal"... "Caliber."

553
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,210
"Kalablow."
"Kalabalos."

554
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,980
Uh, something like that.

555
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,750
- Do you remember
what language it was in?

556
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,420
- Aramaic.

557
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,120
- Dude, how do you even know
what aramaic sounds like?

558
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,790
- "Passion of the Christ."
Good movie.

559
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,090
- Mick, would you be able
to recognize the incantation?

560
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,330
- Yeah.

561
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,630
- Hey. If they figure out
this incantation

562
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,040
and we get our hands
on the spear,

563
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,470
I want you to use it.

564
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,440
I should have listened to you
back in world war I.

565
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,540
If we had used the spear
when we had the chance...

566
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,740
- I might have been
tempted to use it

567
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,180
to change my own future.

568
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,850
Now... we've got
nothing to lose.

569
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,620
- Oh, Marty, Marty, Marty.

570
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,160
I know you've been working
so hard on this project,

571
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,960
and I wanted to come by
and say thank you,

572
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,030
but if it doesn't come online
in the next few minutes,

573
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,630
I'll have to kill you.

574
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,870
- One... one moment,
Mr. thawne, I...

575
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,730
I just need one more moment.

576
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,610
- There. There.

577
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,180
As you can see, the machine
appears to be fully functional,

578
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,580
though it may take some time

579
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,280
for the core to reach
peak temperature.

580
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,790
- Well, then you'll stay
until it does.

581
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,060
- I-i was hoping to see
my family tonight.

582
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,390
- Oh, no. No, no, no, you can't
leave in your moment of glory.

583
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,730
You keep monitoring the core

584
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,800
and make sure the reaction
remains stable.

585
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,370
- Think we got something.

586
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,040
We pieced together a passage
from the "kalabros."

587
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,570
- Aka the word of god.

588
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,310
- All right, Jax, it's on you

589
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,240
to restore Stein's mind
before we get to the lab.

590
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,080
We gotta destroy the reactor

591
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,020
before thawne can
destroy the spear.

592
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,380
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Now, remember,

593
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,790
you guys are going in there
without your powers.

594
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,020
- Don't worry. I know that place
like the back of my hand.

595
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,160
- What about Mick?

596
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,360
- Mick's staying here.

597
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,330
We can't trust him.

598
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,330
Not after what you've done.

599
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,830
- After what I've done?
If it wasn't for me,

600
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,430
you'd all be walking around
like sheep.

601
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,800
- If it wasn't for you,
we never would have been

602
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,770
turned into sheep
in the first place.

603
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,970
We trusted you, Mick.

604
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,580
We can't afford to make
that mistake again.

605
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,880
Let's go.

606
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,500
- League of losers
cut you loose?

607
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,540
- Nobody cuts me loose.

608
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,870
I'm done with those people.

609
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,080
What do you say we burn
this city to the ground?

610
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,720
- Knowing Sara, she's rallied
the team by now.

611
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,950
- Those idiots aren't
whom I'm worried about.

612
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,220
- Relax, boys.
Prodigal son has returned.

613
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,020
And he's got some news for us.

614
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,030
Isn't that right, Mick?

615
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,570
Our old friend eobard has built
a device to destroy the spear.

616
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,570
- No wonder eobard doesn't
want us using it

617
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,740
before he locks in
his own version of reality.

618
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,940
- Which I assume means
erasing all of us.

619
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,410
- And your pals.

620
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,780
- My pals.

621
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,780
They want to steal the spear
before the deed's done.

622
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,550
- I think you can see
what I'm getting at, gentlemen.

623
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,480
- The four of us are no match
for a speedster,

624
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,190
so while thawne is fighting
the legends...

625
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,790
- We'll grab the spear
from under both their noses.

626
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,960
- Exactly.
The enemy of my enemy...

627
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,460
- Is our opportunity.

628
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,710
- The status of the machine,
doctor?

629
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,950
- Please tell Mr. thawne
I'm working as fast as I can.

630
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,450
I've powered up the reactor.
I just need to make

631
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,090
a few adjustments to the core.

632
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,720
- Did you already turn it on?

633
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,290
- I-i had specific instructions
from Mr. thawne to do so.

634
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,260
- Grey, we need to talk.

635
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,760
- Grey?

636
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,170
Please, don't...

637
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,130
Don't kill me, I've done
everything Mr. thawne wanted.

638
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,640
- I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm just gonna make you better.

639
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,670
Grey, what have you done?

640
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,480
- If Mr. thawne wants
to kill me,

641
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,910
he'll have to do it himself.

642
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,750
Guys, we got a problem.
You gotta get here asap.

643
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,880
- We're at the building.
Just keep him there.

644
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,450
Ray, find us the quickest way
into the lab, now.

645
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,790
- Look,
you gotta believe me, okay?

646
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,960
This is not the way
it's supposed to be.

647
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,660
- Is this some sort of test
of my loyalty?

648
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,830
Does Mr. thawne even care?

649
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,430
- Look, this isn't about thawne.

650
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,900
It's about you and me.

651
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,670
- I assure you,
my... my dedication to Mr. thawne

652
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,300
has never been stronger.

653
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,440
- Did you just press
the silent alarm?

654
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,910
- What?
No, it's...

655
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:38,450
It's a secondary radiation
sensor for the nuclear core.

656
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,750
- Grey, you are a crappy liar
in any reality.

657
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,750
- Martin.

658
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,290
- I can't talk any sense
into him,

659
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,660
and he just triggered an alarm.

660
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,990
- Which means thawne'll
be here soon.

661
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,030
- Or now.

662
00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:00,440
- Well, looks like you losers
managed to remember who you are.

663
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,610
- I should've wiped you
from existence

664
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,970
when I had the chance.

665
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,850
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

666
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,050
to know that merlyn was right?

667
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,350
Lucky for you, I still believe
in some fates worse than death.

668
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,590
Like me destroying the spear

669
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,520
and cementing this reality
for all time.

670
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,800
Martin.

671
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,400
- The reactor is
fully operational, sir.

672
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,740
- This...

673
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,440
Is the only reality

674
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,110
any of you

675
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,510
will ever know.

676
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,680
- We'll never give up
trying to stop you.

677
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,950
- Well...

678
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,850
If it weren't
for your futile efforts,

679
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,650
this wouldn't be half so sweet.

680
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,120
- Not so fast, speedy.
You have something we want.

681
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,290
- You need a lesson in how
to share your toys, eobard.

682
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,990
- Yeah, time for us to get
a turn with the spear.

683
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,800
- And do what with it?

684
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,730
Don't you understand? I'm trying
to protect you from yourselves.

685
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,300
With the spear destroyed...

686
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,700
- Bored now.

687
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,510
- Get the spear!

688
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,330
- Ah!
- Let go of the spear,

689
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,200
and I won't use it to turn you
into a jockstrap.

690
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,010
Yeah!

691
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,540
Uh, perhaps not.

692
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Ahh.

693
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,120
- Give it up!

694
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,860
- Oh, Sara.

695
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,360
Why do we always find ourselves
in this situation?

696
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,600
- 'Cause you keep
finding yourself

697
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,760
on the wrong side of history.

698
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,890
Aah!

699
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,330
- Nice work, Mick.

700
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,900
Now hand it over.

701
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,570
- Mick, no.
You already gave it to him once.

702
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,640
You know what happened.

703
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,770
- That was thawne.

704
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,310
This time will be different,
big boy.

705
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,710
- Don't do this, Mick.

706
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,820
- Mick, I don't care
what anyone else thinks.

707
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,750
I still believe in you.

708
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,460
- Enough!
Mick...

709
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,060
Hand it over.

710
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,700
Like a good boy.

711
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,800
- You mean a good dog.

712
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,340
That's all I am to you.

713
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,300
An attack dog.

714
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,340
- Now, that's not true.

715
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,610
Sure, we both know you're not
the sharpest tool in the shed,

716
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:32,210
but that's why we're partners,
remember?

717
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,690
- You're right.

718
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,690
I'm not a genius.

719
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,360
But I'm not one's dog, Leonard.
Not anymore.

720
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,340
- Well.

721
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,340
I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

722
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,910
- Undo this mess.

723
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,980
- I am sorry about your friend,
Mick.

724
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,790
I know you loved her to pieces.

725
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,490
- No!

726
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,480
- Well, if you want something
done right...

727
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,980
- Well done, Leonard.

728
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,790
- You bastard.

729
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,820
I'll kill you all.

730
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,960
- Actually,
i believe that's my line.

731
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,900
Now, where were we before I was
so rudely interrupted?

732
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,330
Well...

733
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,830
I guess we're done here.

734
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,750
- You know
the really swell thing

735
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,520
about the spear being destroyed?

736
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,490
- Now you can't stop us
from killing you.

737
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,030
- Oh, please.
Don't insult my intelligence.

738
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,360
Even at your fastest,

739
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,160
you're moving
in slow motion to me.

740
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,500
- Except they're not alone.

741
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I say we go down fighting.

742
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,810
- You kill one of us,
we kill all of you.

743
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,440
- For Amaya.

744
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,110
- Don't.

745
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,210
Even if you survive my men,
you'll never survive me,

746
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,220
not without powers or weapons.

747
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,790
And the truth is, I don't want
to see any more of you dead.

748
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,060
Not out of sentiment, of course.
No, no, quite the opposite.

749
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:07,330
But because it is so...

750
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,100
Delicious,

751
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,470
knowing that you'll be forced
to live your lives

752
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,970
in a reality that I...
Well, that we created.

753
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,040
You will walk this world knowing

754
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,980
that something
isn't quite right,

755
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,080
that for all your trying
you only made things worse,

756
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,580
and no one will ever believe you
when you tell them

757
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,520
about all the sacrifices
you made

758
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,790
and how close you came
to being legends.

759
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,160
Now, that sounds
like a fitting punishment to me.

760
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,900
What do you think,
professor Stein?

761
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,370
- I don't care what you do
to them,

762
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,170
as long as I never have to see
Mr. Jackson again.

763
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,800
- Ah.

764
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,070
Fair enough.

765
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,540
You're free to go.

766
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,180
- You're just gonna
let them walk?

767
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,750
- Be glad I'm letting you

768
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,710
and your fellow traitors
do the same.

769
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,190
And the next time any of you get
what you think is a smart idea,

770
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,260
remember this grace.

771
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,890
And the fact that I could
kill any of you

772
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,560
in the blink of an eye.

773
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,170
- My mom's not gonna be
cool with that.

774
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,070
- Do I look like I give a damn?

775
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,310
- I can't believe that's it.

776
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,740
I refuse to believe
that this is it.

777
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,040
- Without the spear,
there's no way

778
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,650
we can undo any of this.

779
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,920
- There is one way.

780
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,750
Time travel.

781
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,290
- What do you mean?

782
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,290
- We go back in time to 1916,

783
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,990
and we stop the legion
from ever getting

784
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,530
the spear of destiny
in the first place.

785
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,700
- No, we are not
supposed to change

786
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,100
events we participated in.

787
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,470
- And if we do, we risk
time folding in on itself.

788
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,140
- Even if we weren't worried
about messing with time,

789
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,010
we can't go anywhere.
- Or any-when.

790
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,010
- We don't even know
where the Waverider is.

791
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,950
- If it even exists
in this reality.

792
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,210
- Well, if it does,
there's one person

793
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,950
who knows where it is.

794
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,520
We just have to find him.

795
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,350
- I've directed
all available power

796
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,560
to the main navigational
controls, captain.

797
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,090
- Thank you, Gideon.

798
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,690
Now, I've started
the communications protocol,

799
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,070
and if I just splice
these two wires together...

800
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,740
- Your distress signal
will be broadcast.

801
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,370
Surely the rest of the team

802
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,080
must be out there somewhere,
listening.

803
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,480
- Greg, move your head.
