00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,273
[yelps in pain]

177
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,119
[man] What just happened?
An earthquake?

178
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:51,692
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

179
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:55,058
[man groaning]

180
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:00,228
[exhales]

181
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:06,003
- [loud thud]
- [gasping]

182
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,845
[yelps]

183
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:14,979
[yells]

184
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,311
[shudders]

185
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:29,294
[pounding thud]

186
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,896
Come on. Get up.

187
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:32,833
[groans]

188
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,868
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on. Let's go!

189
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:37,364
Come on, get up.
Go, we gotta go! We gotta go!

190
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,500
Come on, we gotta move!
Come on!

191
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,148
[steady beeping]

192
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,789
[shrieks]

193
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:01,653
[screaming]

194
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:05,392
Please, please. No, no!
Help, please! Don't let go!

195
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,968
[screaming]

196
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,140
[scream echoes, fades]

197
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,828
[Dr. Shin panting]

198
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,128
What the hell happened to you?

199
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,560
[whispering]
There's something back there.

200
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:58,146
[Dr. Shin] Astounding.

201
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:00,283
My readings show
something's down here.

202
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,083
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

203
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:07,420
If it is, we might be able
to scavenge the tech you need
to fix your suit.

204
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:10,456
[David] How is this place
even possible?

205
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:11,963
[Dr. Shin]
This was all probably solid ice

206
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:15,199
until we started
heating the planet.

207
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:18,402
[David] Well, thank God
for global warming, am I right?

208
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:21,941
[Dr. Shin] Uh, yeah,
that's not exactly
a good thing.

209
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,356
[David]
The tracks lead down there.

210
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,558
Suit up.

211
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,699
Wait. The tracks lead
down there, which means...

212
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:50,871
the monster's down there.

213
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,072
[sighs]

214
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,472
Okay. I guess
we're going down there.

215
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:02,146
[heavy splash]

216
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,334
[laughs] I don't believe this.

217
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:29,776
It's a structure of some kind.

218
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,408
And there's more buried
in the ice.

219
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:35,612
Here I thought we were
just going to find a ship.

220
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:39,282
- [David] Everyone,
fan out and search.
- [man] Yes, sir.

221
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:42,483
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

222
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:48,427
This has to be
a few thousand years old.

223
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:50,161
Astounding.

224
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,401
[camera shutter clicks]

225
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:58,004
Whoa.

226
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,039
Uh...

227
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:14,614
[screaming]

228
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:18,321
[all yelling]

229
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,702
[grunting]

230
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,478
[panting]

231
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:41,608
Ow...

232
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,130
What is this place?

233
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:07,436
[ghostly voice]
<i>At last, you are here.</i>

234
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,523
[violent grunting]

235
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,265
[screaming]

236
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:39,004
Free me from my prison

237
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,142
and I will grant you
the strength

238
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:45,976
<i>to kill the man
who murdered your father.</i>

239
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,779
You can't leave him like this!

240
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:49,706
You ask the sea for mercy.

241
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,511
Get out of here!
You need to live

242
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,981
so you can kill
that son of a bitch!

243
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:58,489
[ghostly voice]
<i>You will take from him
what he stole from you.</i>

[yells]

245
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,362
[ghostly voice]
<i>His home will burn</i>

246
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:08,662
<i>and his kingdom will fall
before my legions.</i>

247
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,169
- [yells, groaning]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

248
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,709
David. No, David.

249
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:19,205
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

250
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:21,713
David. David, it's okay.

251
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:23,215
You're all right.

252
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:26,284
What the hell is that thing?

253
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:42,465
[news anchor]
<i>...Just unbelievable footage</i>

[gasps, panting]

268
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,340
The Council's called
for an emergency gathering.

269
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:27,743
There's been
another plague outbreak.

270
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:31,147
[news anchor] <i>...scientists are
at a loss to explain.</i>

271
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:33,182

00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:34,683
<i>how long will it continue?</i>

273
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:37,454

274
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,459
[Aquaman]
Where did it hit this time?

275
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:44,592
[councilwoman]
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

276
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,427
and there are now reports
of outbreaks

277
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,697
in the Fishermen Kingdom
as well.

278
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:51,734
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

279
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,563
Why now?

280
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:57,005
Increased ocean acidity,
decreased oxygen levels,
toxic algal blooms.

281
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,843
Take your pick.

282
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:04,373
The surface has been
poisoning our atmosphere
for over a century.

283
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,382
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

284
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:09,112
if they don't even know
we exist.

285
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,650
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

286
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:13,391
we have to take our seat
at the table.

287
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,296
It's time for Atlantis
to reveal itself
to the surface.

288
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:25,231
[council members grumbling]

289
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:28,472
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position
on this.

290
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,570
Listen, we can talk
to their scientists

291
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:34,741
and combine our technologies
to reverse the damage
that they've already done.

292
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:37,543
And I know this is
against our traditions,

293
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,077
but the world is shrinking,

294
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:41,650
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

295
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,323
Times have changed.

296
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:46,621
Atlantis wants this.

297
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,060
There's a whole generation
out there

298
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,591
that don't want
to hide anymore.

299
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:53,065
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

300
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,059
killed your own beloved mentor,

301
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,300
and you want to negotiate
with them?

302
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:04,369
We gave your brother war powers
and made him Ocean Master
for a reason.

303
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:08,678
If we ever decide
to make ourselves known
to the surface-dwellers,

304
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:12,945
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

305
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,755
[thunder rumbling]

306
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:24,528

[thunder rumbling]

308
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:43,448
[Tom] Hey, not bad.

309
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,782
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

310
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:49,652
[Aquaman] I don't know
how you did it, Pops.

311
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,788
Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us,

312
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:54,287
but that little baby boy
is still kicking our asses.

313
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:56,725
And you...

314
00:20:56,861 --> 00:21:00,366
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

315
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,563
[sighs]

316
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,669
You're the real superhero.

317
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:11,806
- To single parents.
- Mmm.

318
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:16,910
Well, my job was a little less
stressful than yours.

319
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:20,520
Yeah, well,
I just plain suck at my job.

320
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:24,020
Vulko told me to bring
the land and the sea together.

321
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:28,626
The problem is
half of Atlantis still
wants to destroy the surface.

322
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:31,129
They won't listen.
I can't bring shit together.

323
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,226
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

324
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:35,797
I know.

325
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:39,438
I miss him.

326
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:43,607
Hey.

327
00:21:45,411 --> 00:21:48,108
You can't save them all, son.

328
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:52,385
You really want to know how
I raised you here by myself?

329
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,389
I just kept going.

330
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,657
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

331
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:02,323
And you wake up the next day
and you do it again.

332
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,428
Sometimes not giving up

333
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:07,092
is the most heroic thing
you can do.

334
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:14,506

[groans]

336
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:08,659
Humans were not made
to live at these depths.

337
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:11,661
Yeah, don't worry about that.

338
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:14,534
You just remember
who built this ship.

339
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,133
I'm more worried about
how long ago they built it.

340
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:18,537
[sniffles]

341
00:23:18,672 --> 00:23:21,969
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

342

[engines humming]

345
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,054
[David] Hey, doc.

346
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:43,859
You stand ready
with that big gun of yours.

347
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:57,168
Expedition log, day 613.

348
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:59,876
Kane is off on our most
dangerous mission yet.

349
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:03,010

[trident ringing]

351
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:07,343
[Dr. Shin] <i>It's incredible
that these ancient machines
we found</i>

352
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:09,611
<i>still function
after all these years.</i>

353
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,651
<i>All I did was retrofit them
to our needs.</i>

354
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:16,195
<i>But they require
a very specialized fuel
to keep them running.</i>

355
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,223
<i>Kane calls it orichalcum.</i>

356
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,095
<i>I don't know how
he knows about this,</i>

357
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,869
<i>but it all started the day
he found that trident.</i>

358
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,870
<i>Suddenly, he knows secrets
that he couldn't possibly know,</i>

359
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:28,600
<i>including the only way
to obtain this orichalcum</i>

360
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:31,878
<i>is to steal it
from highly-protected
storage vaults.</i>

361
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,976
<i>And we're about to hit the most
dangerous one of them all.</i>

[engines whirring]

364
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:23,629
Okay, you have 15 minutes

366

Attention, unidentified vessel.

384
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:11,894
You are out

00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:14,332
Doctor, power up
the sonic battery.

386
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:17,664

Illegal border crossing

00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,600

We can't let them get away.

They're cutting
through the Night Market.

Exceeding maximum speed

Get away from my wife!

Your wife?

435
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:28,785
First you steal
your brother's throne,

436
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,721
then you steal his woman?

437
00:32:30,856 --> 00:32:34,182

The entire Atlantean army

[announcer]
<i>Lady Karshon has called</i>

456
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:13,485
<i>an emergency session
of the High Council</i>

457
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:17,021
<i>to discuss a motion
that would strip the throne
of its executive power.</i>

458
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:21,757
[Karshon] <i>The throne
is the heart of Atlantis.</i>

459
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:24,259
<i>Too often now it stands empty,</i>

460
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:27,805
<i>while our king spends half
his time on land.</i>

461
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,505
<i>And now his
surface world enemies
have followed him home.</i>

462
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:35,312
<i>This tragedy is merely
a taste</i>

463
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:37,612
<i>of the havoc
that will be wrought,</i>

464
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:41,419
<i>if Atlantis ever becomes known
to the surface.</i>

465
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:45,090
<i>Because if he cannot protect
his own family,</i>

466
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:48,523
<i>how is he supposed
to protect us?</i>

467
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:58,797
He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

468
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,833
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

469
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:03,303
And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

470
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,703
The technology seems ancient,

471
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,972
but we've never seen
anything like it.

472
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:11,181
That weapon he used fires
some kind of ultrasonic energy

473
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,016
that disrupts
the nervous system.

474
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:14,450
Do we know what was stolen?

475
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:18,850
He escaped with a large
stockpile of orichalcum.

476
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:21,954
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

477
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,429
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

478
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:28,166
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

479
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,829
that are highly destructive
to our planet.

480
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,731
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

481
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,506
before we realized
what we were doing.

482
00:35:35,642 --> 00:35:39,005
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

483
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,711
has been buried
in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

484
00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:44,610
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

485
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:47,417
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

486
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:49,381
We think he's been
launching secret raids

487
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:51,287
for at least five months.

488
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:52,750
This is just the time
he got caught.

489
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,422
Well, this spike
in global temperatures

490
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:56,254
that's causing disasters
on the surface

491
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,126
and making
the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

492
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:04,764
He's using
the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

493
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:08,339
Why would he do that?

494
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:10,337
[Aquaman] I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

495
00:36:10,473 --> 00:36:13,772
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet,
we don't have much time.

496
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:15,878
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

497
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:20,413
He must be stopped
or a global climate meltdown
is imminent.

498
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:21,847
[Nereus] We need to find him,

499
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:23,619
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

500
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:26,291
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

501
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:28,854
But you're not gonna like it.

502
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,093
Your brother?

503
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,397
Believe me,
he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

504
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,260
but he's dealt with Manta
in the past,

505
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,568
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

506
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:42,368
The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

507
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,507
He killed their king.

508
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:46,874
I wasn't exactly
gonna ask for permission.

509
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,443
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

510
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,945
It would be an act of war.

511
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:56,981
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

512
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,856
I'm gonna break him out myself.

513
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:03,551
Arthur, Karshon is looking
for a reason
to seize war powers.

514
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:06,364
You will be nothing more than
a figurehead if she does that.

515
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:07,759
[Aquaman] My place is out there
where I belong,

516
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,300
where I'm actually good
at what I do.

517
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,699
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

518
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:13,899
I've got to do this.

519
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:18,770
[Nereus] If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

520
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,346
it will tear
the kingdoms apart.

521
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,549

All I did was figure out
how it worked.

704
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:34,371
I didn't think we'd
ever actually have to use it
on anyone.

Yeah, well, what can I say?

Things don't always
go as planned.

707
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,513
But that's what I'm afraid of.

could reshape
the entire planet.

We are this close
to unlocking the greatest power
in human history.

Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

712

If I said yes,
would you let me?

Sure.

How have I never
heard of this place before?

731
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:21,212
It is not meant
to be common knowledge.

732
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:22,549
It's a pirate haven.

Listen, I don't know

Would you have
gone along with it?

He is the one who put me
in contact with David Kane.

isn't it?

I didn't realize
you'd been released
from prison.

I promise you that I won't
immediately come back here

782

Oh, shit...

[screeching]

879
01:00:31,994 --> 01:00:33,169
Run!

880
01:00:33,304 --> 01:00:34,936
[Orm exclaiming]

881
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:36,938
Come on.

882
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,308
[Orm panting]

883
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:40,678
[Aquaman] Faster!

884
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:48,882
What the hell are you doing?

885
01:00:49,018 --> 01:00:50,550
I don't know.
I'm not used to running.

886
01:00:50,685 --> 01:00:51,986
Just do what I do.

887
01:00:52,122 --> 01:00:53,757
Use your arms, use your legs.
Lift them up.

888
01:00:54,325 --> 01:00:55,286
Like this?

889
01:00:57,022 --> 01:00:58,525
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

890
01:00:58,661 --> 01:01:00,126
- Wait up.
- Yeah!

891
01:01:00,628 --> 01:01:01,930
[yelling]

892
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:06,132
- [chomps]
- [shrieking]

893
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,224
- [yelping]
- Whoa!

894
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,387
[both panting]

895
01:01:32,326 --> 01:01:34,025
[Orm] We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

896
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,758
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

897
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:38,934
What do you wanna do, stay here
and fight the hopping demons?

898
01:01:39,069 --> 01:01:41,739
[growls] What is that?
What does that say?

899
01:01:41,874 --> 01:01:43,396
[Orm] The writing
is ancient Atlantean.

900
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:46,744
"A true king builds bridges."

901
01:01:51,014 --> 01:01:52,545
- [Orm] What are you doing?
- [whoops]

902
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,215
[grunting]

903
01:01:54,351 --> 01:01:56,149
[groans]

904
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,349
Got any more
krill-brained ideas?

905
01:01:59,484 --> 01:02:02,826
- [groaning weakly]
- [stone crumbling]

906
01:02:26,578 --> 01:02:29,547
[grunts] See?
A true king builds bridges.

907
01:02:29,683 --> 01:02:30,881
[laughs]

908
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,619
[giant bugs chittering]

909
01:02:32,754 --> 01:02:34,350
That's a metaphor!

910
01:02:34,486 --> 01:02:36,689
[Aquaman] Hey!
I forgot to tell you.

911
01:02:36,825 --> 01:02:38,024
Mom says she loves you.

912
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,161
She thinks about you
all the time.

913
01:02:40,296 --> 01:02:42,322
[Orm] Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

914
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,932
[Aquaman] I don't know.
I'm just tired of waiting
for the right moment.

915
01:02:45,068 --> 01:02:47,464
- [screeching, chittering]
- [yelps]

916
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:51,998
[both yelling]

917
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:53,140
Come on.

918
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,540
[both grunting]

919
01:03:07,854 --> 01:03:10,487
[screeching]

920
01:03:13,828 --> 01:03:16,295
[distant rumbling]

921
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:20,904
- [deep thuds]
- [exhales]

922
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,368
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

923
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:33,112
[rhythmic thumping]

924
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:34,741
Uh, David?
I just ran more tests,

925
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:36,314
and this data
is really disturbing.

926
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,857
We have to stop
burning the... orichalcum.

927
01:03:41,953 --> 01:03:43,157
David?

928
01:03:48,499 --> 01:03:50,032
[softly] Oh.

929
01:04:25,899 --> 01:04:28,367
[screaming]

930
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:43,252
[shrieks and growls]

931
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:45,384
[yells]

932
01:04:46,722 --> 01:04:48,090
[gasping]

933
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:57,363
Okay, doc, you want to know
my plan so bad.

934
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:00,370
Here it is.

935
01:05:00,506 --> 01:05:05,307
I'm gonna kill Aquaman
and destroy everything
he holds dear.

936
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:10,948
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

937
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:16,142
I will avenge my father.

938
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:19,484
Even if I have to make a deal
with the devil to do it.

939
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:23,389
David, you can't trust
the trident.

940
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:28,164
- [knife rasping]
- [yelps]

941
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:33,832
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

942
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:35,533
[shudders]

943
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:39,471
Pray I never show it
to you again.

944
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:42,608
[breathing shakily]

945
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:44,740
[gasps]

946
01:05:48,576 --> 01:05:51,054
[door bangs open]

947
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,421
[door closes]

948
01:06:03,597 --> 01:06:06,292
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

949
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:08,600
[Orm] We should wait
for Atlantis
to receive your message.

950
01:06:08,735 --> 01:06:10,672
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

951
01:06:10,807 --> 01:06:13,340
[Aquaman] Yeah. Look, Loki,
I'm not asking
for your advice on this.

952
01:06:13,476 --> 01:06:15,310
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

953
01:06:15,445 --> 01:06:17,813
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

954
01:06:17,948 --> 01:06:19,548
[Orm] So, what's your plan?

955
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,451
[Aquaman]
I don't have one, yet.
But he came after my wife,

956
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:23,948
which means
I'm gonna pull his tongue
out of his butt.

957
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,721
Arthur, you are the king.
You cannot
let this get personal.

958
01:06:26,856 --> 01:06:29,682
This coming from the guy
who turned the entire
nation of Atlantis

959
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:31,426
into his own private ego trip?

960
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:32,688
My ego?

961
01:06:32,824 --> 01:06:34,260
You're the one who swam
through the front gate

962
01:06:34,396 --> 01:06:35,892
and challenged my claim
for the throne.

963
01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:37,761
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

964
01:06:37,896 --> 01:06:40,965
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

965
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:42,572
Unbelievable.

966
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,866
Wait, wait! Wait!

967
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:46,009
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

968
01:06:46,144 --> 01:06:48,568
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

969
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,542
Only reason I'm doing it
is to keep Atlantis
from destroying the surface.

970
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:53,312
And I might even be
screwing that up.

971
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:54,748
You really
had no ambition for it?

972
01:06:54,883 --> 01:06:56,319
Absolutely not.

973
01:06:56,454 --> 01:06:58,386
From the day
my father found out
you existed,

974
01:06:58,522 --> 01:07:00,186
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

975
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:01,624
and challenge me
for the throne.

976
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,150
Wow, that's really sad.

977
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:04,523
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

978
01:07:04,658 --> 01:07:07,059
with basically no prep time
whatsoever.

979
01:07:07,194 --> 01:07:09,227
[smacks lips] Roasted.

980
01:07:09,362 --> 01:07:10,795
That is not how it happened.

981
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:12,630
- That's exactly how
it happened.
- Mera saved you.

982
01:07:12,766 --> 01:07:14,604
[Aquaman] No, she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

983
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,568
[Orm] Nope. She made
the little water tornado.
I fell in it.

984
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:18,405
[Aquaman] Okay, shut up.
I think we're here.

985
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,278
- [Aquaman mimics bird call]
- [gasps]

986
01:07:23,912 --> 01:07:25,808
[grunting]

987
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,378
Sleep, <i>aloha.</i>

988
01:07:28,514 --> 01:07:29,876
[Orm] Come on, let's do this.

989
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:31,253
[Aquaman]
Once this is over with,

990
01:07:31,388 --> 01:07:32,650
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

991
01:07:32,785 --> 01:07:34,419
- [Orm] Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

992
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,423
[Orm] I don't even
know those words.

993
01:07:41,163 --> 01:07:43,095
[deep, rhythmic thudding]

994
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,834
[men shouting in distance]

995
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,736
[Aquaman mimics bird call]

996
01:07:47,872 --> 01:07:48,935
- Huh?
- Shh!

997
01:07:49,071 --> 01:07:51,471
[man grunts, groans]

998
01:08:03,522 --> 01:08:04,316
Hey!

999
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:06,684
- [helmet clangs]
- [groaning]

1000
01:08:28,241 --> 01:08:30,147
[heavy groan]

1001
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:35,284
- [grunting]
- [yells]

1002
01:08:38,724 --> 01:08:40,157
Whoa, brother.

1003
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,359
<i>Sasa!</i>

1004
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:52,301
It's an orichalcum furnace.

1005
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:54,904
All that stolen orichalcum.

1006
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:56,504
They're just burning it up.

1007
01:08:56,639 --> 01:08:58,941
[Aquaman] He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

1008
01:08:59,076 --> 01:09:00,542
[Orm] This is catastrophic.

1009
01:09:00,677 --> 01:09:03,069
This whole place must
be heat-shielded to protect it

1010
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,378
from the surface's
thermal satellites.

1011
01:09:05,514 --> 01:09:07,014
Question is,
how do we stop 'em?

1012
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:08,415
To take out this reactor,

1013
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:10,149
we would have to crater
the entire island.

1014
01:09:10,285 --> 01:09:13,822
Get away from there! Now!

1015
01:09:13,957 --> 01:09:18,525
This blaster may be ancient,
but it was built
for killing Atlanteans.

1016
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:26,736
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

1017
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,701
I just didn't want you
to break me in half
before I could surrender.

1018
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:32,572
Please take me with you.

1019
01:09:33,907 --> 01:09:36,472
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

1020
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:38,771
No, no. Wait, please.

1021
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:40,374
I didn't want any of this.

1022
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,485
All I wanted
was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

1023
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,621
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

1024
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:49,752
I'm a scientist,
and I just wanted
to be taken seriously.

1025
01:09:49,887 --> 01:09:51,323
David Kane said
he could help me,

1026
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:52,991
but now he won't let me leave.

1027
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:56,464
You expect us to believe you
have nothing to do with this?

1028
01:09:57,295 --> 01:09:58,662
I know.

1029
01:09:58,798 --> 01:10:00,797
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

1030
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:03,432
But he would've killed me
if I hadn't.

1031
01:10:03,568 --> 01:10:05,803
[scoffs] Knock him out.

1032
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:08,243
No.

1033
01:10:08,378 --> 01:10:10,379
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

1034
01:10:11,344 --> 01:10:12,979
- What?
- No.

1035
01:10:13,114 --> 01:10:15,681
[grunting] Fine!

1036
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:17,786
You can come with us.

1037
01:10:17,921 --> 01:10:19,548
Oh... thank you.

1038
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:22,692
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you
one <i>sasa!</i>

1039
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:23,991
Okay, okay.

1040
01:10:24,127 --> 01:10:25,361
It's the black trident.

1041
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:27,527
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

1042
01:10:27,663 --> 01:10:29,263
It gives Kane great powers
and in return--

1043
01:10:29,398 --> 01:10:33,732
- [yells]
- [glass tinkling]

1044
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:41,278

[coughing]

1046
01:10:47,085 --> 01:10:49,147
I hate when that happens.

1047
01:10:49,282 --> 01:10:52,854
[suit sizzling]

[Nereus] Atlantis does not
command the armies of Xebel.
I do.

1123

[Brine King]
And the Brine Kingdom

You may count on us always.

1126
01:19:43,511 --> 01:19:45,314
Something happened to me.

1127
01:19:45,449 --> 01:19:48,280
When I touched
that black trident.

1128
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,287
Why is he even here?

1129
01:19:50,423 --> 01:19:52,090
He should be
on his way back to prison.

1130
01:19:52,225 --> 01:19:53,891
We should hear
what he has to say.

1131
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:55,798
I made that mistake once.

1132
01:19:55,934 --> 01:19:58,026
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

1133
01:19:58,162 --> 01:20:01,299
And he cut off my claw.

1134
01:20:01,434 --> 01:20:03,972
This thing took a whole year
to grow back.

1135
01:20:04,107 --> 01:20:06,573
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

1136
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:08,176
And just for the record,

1137
01:20:08,312 --> 01:20:10,605
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

1138
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:14,345
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

1139
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:17,984
[waves crashing]

1140
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,720
Mom, I don't know enough
about this.

1141

Is that even possible?

1142
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:25,719
All anyone knows for sure
is there once
was a seventh kingdom

1143
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:28,593
and then one day,
just before the fall,

1144
01:20:28,728 --> 01:20:31,693
every record of it
was stricken
from the chronicles.

1145
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:34,465
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

1146
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,703
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

1147
01:20:37,839 --> 01:20:39,403
It's called Necrus.

1148
01:20:40,271 --> 01:20:42,109
And I didn't just see it.

1149
01:20:43,414 --> 01:20:44,408
I knew it.

1150
01:20:45,643 --> 01:20:49,347
It's almost like I was...
remembering it.

1151
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:54,220
Flashes
of someone else's memories.

1152
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:56,521
During King Atlan's time,

1153
01:20:56,656 --> 01:21:00,996
there were
seven united kingdoms
of Atlantis.

1154
01:21:01,132 --> 01:21:05,198
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

1155

<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

1156
01:21:13,607 --> 01:21:16,911

a superpower unlike any other.</i>

at a terrible price.

<i>thinking his own brother
was trying to steal his power.</i>

1166
01:21:42,102 --> 01:21:47,675
<i>So, he resorted to dark magic
and crafted
an instrument of evil.</i>

Kordax still can't be freed.

1189
01:23:05,454 --> 01:23:08,023
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

1190

Only Atlan himself
could release him.

1191

Atlan himself.

Blood magic isn't really magic,
it's DNA.

1194
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:22,260
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

01:24:43,183 --> 01:24:44,483
[Mera] Where's Junior?

1222
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:49,558
[Atlanna grunting] No!

1223
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:51,087
I'm sorry, son.

1224
01:24:51,222 --> 01:24:52,992
Where's Junior?

1225
01:24:53,127 --> 01:24:56,632
Manta... took Junior.

1226
01:24:56,767 --> 01:24:58,596
- No!
- No!

1227
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,170
No!

1228
01:25:01,771 --> 01:25:03,233
[screaming]

1229
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:05,570
[screams echoes and fades]

1230
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:08,342
[Arthur Jr. crying]

1231
01:25:18,448 --> 01:25:20,717
[crying continues]

1232
01:25:43,177 --> 01:25:45,907
[keyboard clacking]

1233
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:58,759
[man] The medics have
stabilized his condition.

1234
01:25:58,894 --> 01:26:00,294
He will be okay.

1235
01:26:00,429 --> 01:26:01,993
[Nereus]
We just picked up a signal.

1236
01:26:02,128 --> 01:26:03,731
It's faint,

1237
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:06,428
but it's broadcasting
on an old Atlantean
sonar frequency.

1238
01:26:06,563 --> 01:26:08,501
Headed to Antarctica.

1239
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:11,966
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

1240
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:15,839
I've dreamed of this.

1241
01:26:15,974 --> 01:26:18,775
The two of you
standing together
as brothers.

1242
01:26:20,014 --> 01:26:22,415
[shaky sigh]

1243
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:24,781
Promise me
you will protect each other.

1244
01:26:28,088 --> 01:26:29,951
Promise me, Orm.

1245
01:26:43,905 --> 01:26:44,933
Go.

1246
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:04,491
[kisses]

1247
01:27:11,225 --> 01:27:13,667
[Brine King]
Great waves, Nereus.

1248
01:27:13,803 --> 01:27:18,069
Your warship is powerful,
but it's slower than a sea cow.

1249
01:27:18,204 --> 01:27:22,974
I say we ditch
all this dead weight
and travel light. Hmm?

1250
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,574
And what are you gonna do when
he turns on that sonic cannon?

1251
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:27,516
Our only chance is to hit him

1252
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:30,251
with total overwhelming force
from every direction.

1253
01:27:30,386 --> 01:27:32,249
Not with Junior
in the crossfire.

1254
01:27:32,385 --> 01:27:33,585
What choice do we have?

1255
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:35,384
We have no defense
against that cannon.

1256
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,752
Well, wait a minute.

1257
01:27:36,888 --> 01:27:38,557
So this cannon
sends out soundwaves

1258
01:27:38,693 --> 01:27:40,657
that messes with
our nervous system, right?

1259
01:27:40,793 --> 01:27:43,660
That's right.
Ultrasonic echoes.

1260
01:27:43,796 --> 01:27:45,323
Well, what if
we disrupt those echoes

1261
01:27:45,459 --> 01:27:47,233
with another soundwave
on the same frequency,

1262
01:27:47,368 --> 01:27:49,370
but just much, much louder?

1263
01:27:49,505 --> 01:27:51,866
You wanna disrupt
their disruption?

1264
01:27:52,002 --> 01:27:53,705
Well, that's
gonna be the easy part.

1265
01:27:54,637 --> 01:27:56,807
Take your weapons.

1266
01:27:58,213 --> 01:27:59,711
And ready your steeds.

1267
01:28:08,849 --> 01:28:10,022
[Brine King] Hmm.

1268
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:11,888
[gun clanking]

1269
01:28:20,204 --> 01:28:22,131
Really doesn't like you,
does he?

1270
01:28:22,267 --> 01:28:23,636
[laughs]

1271
01:28:27,505 --> 01:28:29,675
[Storm whinnying]

1272
01:28:53,635 --> 01:28:55,670
[David]
We made a lot of progress, doc.

1273
01:28:55,806 --> 01:28:58,104
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

1274
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,606
but we were damn close.

1275
01:28:59,741 --> 01:29:02,411
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

1276
01:29:03,441 --> 01:29:05,012
[breath shaking]

1277
01:29:05,148 --> 01:29:07,383
My God, what did we do?

1278
01:29:07,518 --> 01:29:09,947
Nothing the world
wasn't already doing.

1279
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,750
All we did
was fast forward things
a few years.

1280
01:29:12,886 --> 01:29:14,388
[Stingray] The ice
hasn't fully melted yet,

1281
01:29:14,524 --> 01:29:16,656
but our scanning
reveals a weak spot.

1282
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:18,558
Here.

1283
01:29:18,694 --> 01:29:21,056
This will lead you
straight to Kordax.

1284
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,631
Power up the sonic cannon.

1285
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:27,634
Bag the child and suit up.

1286
01:29:40,478 --> 01:29:43,518
[whirring]

1287
01:29:49,126 --> 01:29:51,619

[Dr. Shin shushing]

- Yah!
- [Storm bellows]

1290
01:29:57,329 --> 01:29:59,831
[Stingray] Captain, we have
multiple incoming hostiles.

1291
01:30:01,534 --> 01:30:02,867
[David] You're too late.

1292
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:13,713
No.

1293
01:30:17,549 --> 01:30:19,752
[waves splashing]

1294
01:30:21,387 --> 01:30:23,459

[sonar pinging]

1296
01:30:39,438 --> 01:30:41,174
Commence charge.

1297

[machinery humming]

1298
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:48,345

[whale song pulsating]

1301
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:34,759
You've got to be kidding me.

1302
01:31:34,895 --> 01:31:37,192
[pulsating whale song

1303
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:41,603

[metal creaking]

1306
01:32:10,793 --> 01:32:12,260
Astounding.

1307
01:32:18,374 --> 01:32:21,610
[dark chorus singing]

1308
01:32:55,176 --> 01:32:57,406
[Nereus] This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

1309
01:32:57,542 --> 01:32:59,976
[Orm] The throne of Necrus
is in the heart of the city.

1310
01:33:00,112 --> 01:33:01,482
[Mera] I sense something
in the water.

1311
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:02,816
[Nereus] Everyone, light it up.

1312
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:12,456
Didn't you say that Kordax
turned his people
into an army of monsters?

1313
01:33:12,591 --> 01:33:14,329
Yes. I did.

1314
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:16,225
[Aquaman] Keep your eyes open.

1315
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,262
Well, that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

1316
01:33:19,398 --> 01:33:22,363
[Nereus] Everyone stand ready.
Something's coming.

1317
01:33:24,505 --> 01:33:27,273
[ghostly shrieks]

1318
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:29,638

[grunts]

1322
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,157
[Nereus] I think this goes
all the way through.

1323
01:33:47,292 --> 01:33:50,398
My men and I can deal
with these worms.

1324
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:53,334
Go now and save the prince.

1325
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:54,967
Thank you, Your Highness.

1326
01:33:57,068 --> 01:33:59,701
Come on, you spineless worms!

1327
01:33:59,836 --> 01:34:01,270
Bring it on!

Don't let him take it!
Hasn't he taken enough already?

Yield the throne.

It's time for me
to reclaim my destiny.

1433

It would be foolish
to think he could ever change.

1434

I knew you would do this.

1435
01:42:42,559 --> 01:42:44,329
You are the one true king.

1436

[Brine King grunts] Bah!

As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

1505
01:48:25,268 --> 01:48:27,542
Not everybody's gonna see it
that way though.

1506
01:48:32,048 --> 01:48:34,813
It's too bad you went
and had yourself killed
back there.

[Mera] Yes.

All this ice.

1509
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:42,887
It'd be impossible
to find the body.

[Aquaman] Just lay low
for a while.

for some advice.

You're not as bad at this
as you think.

The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

1520
01:49:26,733 --> 01:49:28,498
You are everything I was not.

1521
01:49:28,634 --> 01:49:31,804
You do the right thing
when doing the wrong
thing is much easier.

1522
01:49:32,905 --> 01:49:34,708
And you're willing
to ask for help

1523
01:49:35,642 --> 01:49:37,172
even from your worst enemy.

1524
01:49:39,041 --> 01:49:40,340
I know it may not feel like

1525
01:49:40,475 --> 01:49:42,316
you know what you're
doing sometimes, but...

1526
01:49:42,452 --> 01:49:44,749
keep trusting your instincts.

1527
01:49:44,885 --> 01:49:47,952
If you lead,
Atlantis will follow.

1528
01:49:51,091 --> 01:49:54,728
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

1529
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:57,225
I thought that was just
a metaphor.

1530
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:05,101

might have just saved
the world's ass.
