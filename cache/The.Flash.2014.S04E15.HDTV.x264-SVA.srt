1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:01,459
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,462 --> 00:00:03,960
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,172
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:07,070
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,546
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,125
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:12,076
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,311
like me.

9
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:15,205
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:16,940
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:18,975
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,312
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:23,880
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:26,649
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,934
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:29,905
The Quark Sphere,

17
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,657
filled with Barry's
unique genetic marker,

18
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,522
and programmed to
track his specific DNA,

19
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:35,590
using the electrical
current of the Speed Force.

20
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:37,528
Once we track Barry and we pull him out,

21
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,564
the Quark Sphere will
trick the Speed Force

22
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:40,965
into thinking he's still there.

23
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:42,532
What is happening?

24
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:44,934
We're moving so quickly
that everyone else is still.

25
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:47,170
- Flash.
- Flash.

26
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,706
I'm your father's doppelganger.

27
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,040
Jesse, you're a speedster.

28
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,875
Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

29
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:54,476
- Everything okay with Jesse?
- Yes.

30
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,279
I spent the summer assembling
a support staff for her,

31
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,415
but then Jesse goes and
kicks me off the team.

32
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:00,850
They took a vote. I'm out.

33
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,752
I don't even have a
home to return to now.

34
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,919
- Barry...
- Iris...

35
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,587
What... I'm...

36
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,222
- You're moving with me, okay?
- What?

37
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,723
You're moving as fast as I am,

38
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,551
- like in the courtroom.
- Why? Didn't you...

39
00:01:42,554 --> 00:01:44,827
I can't. I... I can't.

40
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,696
- What? What's wrong?
- I can't.

41
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:49,632
What...

42
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,501
I can't save us this time.

43
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:01,176

44
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,746
_

45
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:08,585
Ready when you are, Barry.

46
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,753
- I'm ready!
- Are you serious?

47
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,364
Come on, Cisco, just one more.

48
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,124
She said two hours ago.

49
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:17,827
Look, you know he's not gonna
stop until he makes it through.

50
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,029
Come on, you know how Barry gets.

51
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:22,165
- One more.
- Thank you.

52
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,600
All right, here we go.

53
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,373
Three...

54
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,009
two... one.

55
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:34,844
Now!

56
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,112
Damn it!

57
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,680
- One more.
- Iris?

58
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,649
Uh, Barry, look, why don't we take five?

59
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,380
No, not until I get
this, all right? Come on.

60
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:42,621
- Listen, Miyagi...
- What?

61
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,576
I've been here all day,
opening breaches, all right,

62
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,589
so unless you wanna
rub your hands together

63
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,112
and do some magic shoulder popping...

64
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:49,392
I'm not rubbing your shoulder.

65
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:50,660
That's what I thought. I'm taking five.

66
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,325
- Hey, come on!
- I'm taking five!

67
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,631
I...

68
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,173
I don't understand why I can't get this.

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,276
Well, probably because
you've been up all night.

70
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,638
But that shouldn't matter.

71
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:04,151
Look, Barry, a bridge
closes in three picoseconds.

72
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:06,676
DeVoe's could shut even faster.

73
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:08,778
Look, I'm just saying
that this might not even be

74
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,747
the best plan to catch him anyway.

75
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,835
It's a plan, you know.

76
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:12,860
It's the only one we have right now.

77
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:15,117
Well, and what if he uses
his force field against you?

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,397
You don't know how to get out of it yet.

79
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,802
I don't know, Iris, but,
I mean, we need something.

80
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:21,823
We have no leads on the
next three bus metas,

81
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,093
no way to track DeVoe,
no way to stop him.

82
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,349
I mean, he can't be this smart.

83
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:29,932
I'm sorry, but, I mean,
we've been at this for months,

84
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:32,068
and we have nothing.

85
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,971
I mean, maybe that's the problem.

86
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:37,173
You know, sometimes you have to...

87
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,088
take a breather and let
the answer come to you.

88
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:42,378
- Do something else for a bit.
- Like what?

89
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,447
Like...

90
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,717
date night, for starters.

91
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:51,948
You know, we haven't
had any quality time,

92
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:54,557
just you and me, since our honeymoon.

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,127
- Which was severely cut short.
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,563
I know we're the Flash, but we...

95
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,498
We're also Barry and Iris.

96
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:06,202
No, you're right, yeah.

97
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,072
All right, I'm gonna make
a reservation tonight,

98
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,573
someplace very romantic.

99
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:13,076
Oh...

100
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:16,279
Sounds perfect.

101
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:19,082
How is it we live
together, work together,

102
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,750
sleep in the same bed together,

103
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,994
but it stills feels like
we don't spend any real time

104
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,387
as husband and wife?

105
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,255
Allen, West Allen,

106
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,624
Cortex now!

107
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,793
- I have no idea.
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,465
Let's go.

109
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,773
What is this?

110
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:45,997
This is a signature field,

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,367
mapping every time DeVoe's
gone in and out of his layer

112
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,565
in the pocket dimension.

113
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:51,372
- All of these?
- All of them.

114
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,915
So, how did you do this?

115
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,764
I didn't do it, actually. Ramon did.

116
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,466
But all I did was just come up

117
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,698
with a really complex
and eloquent algorithm

118
00:04:58,701 --> 00:04:59,811
to track the warping signatures.

119
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,378
Don't do that, all right?
Don't do that. Don't be modest.

120
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,681
- All right? It's unbecoming.
- You're unbecoming.

121
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:03,883
You wish I was unbecoming, all right?

122
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,081
Do you know that these are DeVoe?

123
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:05,973
These are DeVoe, all right?

124
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,194
This is when Marlize grabbed him

125
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:08,309
from Izzy at Lawrence Hills.

126
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:09,979
This is when he showed
up at Iron Heights prison.

127
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:12,237
- This is DeVoe's house.
- And this is the alleyway

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,520
in the city center,
where he abducted you.

129
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,156
How long has this been going on?

130
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,325
- Oh, wait for it.
- The past three years.

131
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:20,289
- Three years?
- DeVoe orchestrated everything

132
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,359
to get the people he wanted on the bus.

133
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,036
He's been planning this a long time.

134
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,673
We got a planner, just like Thawne.

135
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,666
- Just like Thawne.
- So, how do we use this?

136
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:30,914
All we can do right now

137
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,263
is just wait for the
next marker to appear,

138
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,504
try to get the jump on him.

139
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:36,103
That and keep an eye on Ralph,
using the old buddy system.

140
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:37,472
Has anyone seen Ralph today?

141
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,274
No, he's downstairs, moving in.

142
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:40,559
He's very nervous.

143
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:42,134
- I don't know why.
- I don't know why either.

144
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,418
He's a superhero.

145
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,180
People with powers
are ready for anything.

146
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:46,649
Ah! Son of a breach!

147
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:48,118
- Sorry...
- Jesse.

148
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,586
I just came in through the breach room.

149
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:50,854
Hey, Jesse, welcome back.

150
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:52,288
What are you... What are you doing here?

151
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:01,464
Wally's not here.

152
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,938
Uh, you know, an apology
cube usually works better

153
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,174
when there's an actual apology on it.

154
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:13,443
You get the sentiment.

155
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:15,845
What's this?

156
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,775
That is a, uh, mental activity dampener.

157
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,213
It's for DA Cecile Horton.

158
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,550
It keeps her from hearing
other people's thoughts.

159
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,819
Kinda clunky.

160
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:25,408
That's what she said.

161
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:26,844
Literally, that's what she said.

162
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,791
The second version's more streamlined.

163
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:30,226
And what's all this?

164
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,328
Those are thoughts, musings.

165
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,898
How to stop DeVoe.

166
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Wow, he's really in your head, isn't he?

167
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:39,369
Yeah, a lot of people are nowadays,

168
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,822
thanks to you.

169
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,238
Look, I thought you
wanted me to come here

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,403
so we could talk about this.

171
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:46,141
No, I want you to stop
bringing up your mother.

172
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,511
I will, once you deal with her death.

173
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:49,646
- I have.
- No, you haven't.

174
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,347
Yes, I have. She died!

175
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:53,083
Years ago, she died.

176
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,617
There was nothing I
could do to save her.

177
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,994
End of story. Life goes on.

178
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:58,221
Yeah, for everyone but you.

179
00:06:58,223 --> 00:07:01,224
Look, Dad, when Mom died,
you didn't talk about it...

180
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:02,947
- There's nothing to...
- Ever.

181
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,561
And you've been upset ever since.

182
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:05,592
You've been miserable,

183
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:07,195
and you make everyone
around you miserable.

184
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,065
I mean, why do you think I
asked you to leave my team?

185
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,133
Your team's a bunch of idiots.

186
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:11,139
- Okay.
- No offense.

187
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:14,063
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
I came here to stop DeVoe.

188
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,799
No, you stayed because of DeVoe.

189
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,535
A distinction without a difference.

190
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,109
Dad, there is always going
to be some bad guy to stop,

191
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:21,644
- or algorithm to write...
- Yeah, that's it.

192
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:23,113
- Or problem to solve.
- Yeah, that's my point.

193
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,647
Exactly.

194
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,016
Look...

195
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:29,552
I didn't want to talk about her death,

196
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:32,122
but... I did,

197
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:33,576
and it helped a lot.

198
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,313
Trust me, you are never going to be able

199
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,426
to move on with your life
until you talk about this.

200
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:39,829
Jesse! I can't!

201
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,798
I...

202
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:51,307
Look, Jesse...

203
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,148
Your mother...

204
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,721
You'll never understand.

205
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,626
Yeah. I guess I won't.

206
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:25,904
What?

207
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,664
Get down!

208
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:07,383
- You all right, Jonesy?
- I'll live.

209
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:08,952
Here. Put pressure on it.

210
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,545
Help's on the way.

211
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:12,721
Who the hell are these guys?
They came out of nowhere.

212
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:15,458
I don't know, but they want
whatever is in that container.

213
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,240
Where is that?

214
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:20,482
One of the hangars out at Waid Airfield.

215
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:22,514
My dad said CCPD was
escorting ARGUS there

216
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:24,037
this morning for something.

217
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,906
- He's there, Barry.
- Yeah, we gotta go.

218
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:28,944
- We'll meet you there.
- Cool, I'll come too.

219
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,846
Could use the distraction.

220
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:35,878
Come on, Flash.

221
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:52,195
Guys, seven officers
and ARGUS agents down.

222
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,063
They just blew open the
ARGUS transport container.

223
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:56,366
West side of the hangar.
One armed assailant inside.

224
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,600
Got it!

225
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:06,843
Come on.

226
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:16,886
It's ready.

227
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,395
- Stay down!
- Hey! Hey!

228
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:31,901
Move! Move, move!

229
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:41,644
Just you and us now.

230
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,818
Nice work, everyone.

231
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,081
It's over.

232
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,621
For all of Central City.

233
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:06,002
No...

234
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,345
Barry...

235
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,449
We're too late.

236
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:27,549
- Oh, that's a nuclear bomb.
- I know.

237
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,263
And its core has already gone critical.

238
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,148
I know.

239
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,907
The second we slow down, it's over.

240
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,010
I know. That's not helping.

241
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:37,367
Well, how long do you think we have?

242
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:40,316
We just have to keep moving

243
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,885
till we figure out a way to stop it.

244
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:45,254
Oka... okay, we could
run it to the Badlands.

245
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:47,356
No, if we run that long,
it'll speed up the reaction.

246
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,492
We won't make it outside
the city before it explodes.

247
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:51,230
Well, we can't run
everyone outside the city.

248
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:51,920
I know.

249
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:53,423
We're talking hundreds
of thousands of people.

250
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:55,383
I mean, if there were more
than just the two of us,

251
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,190
there's not enough time.

252
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,668
Wait, that's it.

253
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,169
- Jay Garrick.
- What about him?

254
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:01,604
Uh, he might know what to do.

255
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:02,983
Go to Earth-3, get him,

256
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,808
bring him back here as
fast as you can, okay?

257
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:33,302
I need you right now, man.

258
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,744
Hey.

259
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:43,879
Whoa, what is going on?

260
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:45,681
You're moving with me at super-speed.

261
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:46,791
What?

262
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,464
Is this what it looks like when you run?

263
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,719
More or less.

264
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,301
I have to say, it's a little uneventful.

265
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,389
Hey... come with me.

266
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm guessing this is
our Ark of the Covenant.

267
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,266
Something like that, yeah.

268
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:05,067
Whoa...

269
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,487
Yeah, that will
definitely melt your face.

270
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:13,050
That... that looks like an
experimental fission engine,

271
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,510
deuterium isotopes.

272
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:17,019
That would make this an
inertial confinement cage

273
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,924
to stop the radiation.

274
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:20,158
But with enough pressure,

275
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,827
the isotopes inside, they split,

276
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:23,395
they produce heat, they produce light.

277
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:24,963
It starts out blue,

278
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:27,699
turns yellow, turns purple,

279
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:29,267
and then it's game over.

280
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:31,970
Just please tell me there's
a way we can undo it.

281
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:34,172
I think we're way past that point.

282
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:36,311
- We have to do something.
- I...

283
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:38,477
What if... what if I
breach it to a dead earth,

284
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,045
- like I did with Fallout?
- Of course, yeah.

285
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:42,047
That's a great idea. All right, do it.

286
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:51,323
What's wrong?

287
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:55,429
I think I might be all breached out.

288
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:56,865
I... I don't know,

289
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,521
I think I breached one
too many times today.

290
00:13:58,523 --> 00:13:59,547
No, that's not it.

291
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,534
A breach is a folding
of space-time, right,

292
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:03,109
so when we're moving this fast, we...

293
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:05,970
When we're moving this fast,
when we're moving in Flashtime,

294
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:07,973
then we don't have the time necessary

295
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:09,674
- for a breach to form.
- Exactly.

296
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,977
Then that means I can't...

297
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,713
That means I... I can't...

298
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:17,315
Hey... hey...

299
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:18,717
What's wrong?

300
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,420
I don't know.

301
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,571
You're not a speedster.

302
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:25,656
Your body can't handle
moving this fast very long.

303
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:26,825
I gotta let go, all right?

304
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:29,060
Come here.

305
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:30,459
All right.

306
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:33,298
Wait... ask Harry.

307
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,000
He'll know.

308
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,067
All right.

309
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:40,272
I hope so.

310
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,592
A-Allen...

311
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:02,761
- Wells, hey...
- Uh, why are you touching me?

312
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,362
- Th...
- Listen...

313
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:05,642
Am I in... am I in...

314
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:07,265
Yes, you're in Fla...
You're in Flashtime, yes.

315
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,242
Flashtime? What is Flashtime?

316
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,368
I didn't... Cisco just came up with it.

317
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,138
Wait, you did this with Ramon
before you did this with me?

318
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,163
- Hey, we don't have time!
- Hey, listen, the alarm...

319
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,932
Yes, the alarm that we left
for was an ARGUS transport.

320
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,875
- It had a fission engine in it.
- And it exploded?

321
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:19,511
That's why I'm in this Flashti...

322
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,580
Wait... Jesse. Where's Jesse?

323
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:23,615
She's... no, she's fine.
She left. She went to...

324
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:24,633
Okay, Allen, that's great,

325
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:26,175
because if this city's gonna explode,

326
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,012
you need to send her as far
away from here as possible...

327
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,596
No, listen... listen, she went
to Earth-3 to get Jay Garrick.

328
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:31,132
- She's coming back?
- Yes, we need his help.

329
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,634
Allen, no, no, no, no,
we cannot let her...

330
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:34,161
Hey! Right now, I need your help, okay?

331
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:36,603
- How do I stop the reaction?
- You can't stop this.

332
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:37,813
What do you mean? Then what do I do?

333
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,231
You can't... you have to
send it away from here.

334
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,066
- Well, I can't. We tried...
- Open... have Ramon open a...

335
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,335
Cisco can't... he can't.
Cisco can't open a breach.

336
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:43,371
- He can't.
- 'Cause there's no time.

337
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,402
- Exactly.
- But you can.

338
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:45,605
- What do you mean?
- Allen, you can.

339
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:46,863
- No, I can't.
- Listen to me...

340
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:47,948
- What are you talking about?
- Allen, listen to me,

341
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,817
space-time breaches and the
portal to the Speed Force

342
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,253
operate under different physics.

343
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:55,168
You open a portal to the Speed Force.

344
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,837
You send it there.

345
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,583
What will it do to the Speed Force?

346
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:00,352
- What is... why am I weak?
- Wells...

347
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:01,720
I know. Wells, hey...
hey... It's the speed-the...

348
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:03,188
Listen to me, will an explosion...

349
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,173
- The speed's affecting me.
- I know.

350
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:06,243
Will an explosion that
big affect the Speed Force?

351
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:08,560
I don't... think so.

352
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,095
What? What do you mean
you don't think so?

353
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:11,229
- I don't know.
- Wells, hey, look at me...

354
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,430
What the heck?

355
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:17,603
- Get her out of here.
- I'm gonna... I'll try...

356
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:18,895
- Allen... Allen...
- All right.

357
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:21,874
- How'd you do that?
- Um, I'm not sure.

358
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,061
I've... I've been able to do it

359
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,443
ever since I came out
of the Speed Force.

360
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,195
- That's a hell of a new trick.
- Look, right now...

361
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:29,131
I know. Jesse showed me the nuke.

362
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:30,881
- We're in trouble, kid.
- Well, I don't know.

363
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:32,549
Wells has an idea that
he thinks might work.

364
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:33,752
Yeah? What is it?

365
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:35,153
We send the bomb into the Speed Force,

366
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:36,496
let it detonate in there.

367
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:39,023
- Like hell you will.
- What do you mean? Why not?

368
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,059
Because, Flash, if you do that,

369
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:43,360
we may lose the Speed Force forever.

370
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,843
What do you mean we might
lose the Speed Force?

371
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:53,304
An explosion that size
could destroy it completely.

372
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:54,263
If that were to happen,

373
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,314
every speedster across space and time

374
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:59,184
would lose access to
their speed instantly.

375
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:01,621
Every speedster?

376
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:03,093
Even if it got rid of Thawne

377
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,429
and every other evil
speedster in the multiverse,

378
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:07,732
you cannot do this.

379
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,034
I won't let you.

380
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,989
Well, I'm sorry, Jay,

381
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,433
if this is the only way to
save everyone in the city,

382
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,903
I have to.

383
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:31,952
Barry, listen to me...

384
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,454
Harry didn't know anything
about the Speed Force, okay?

385
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:36,085
None of us really do.

386
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,888
And this isn't just about speed.

387
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,086
You're talking about destroying

388
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:41,093
an essential element of the multiverse.

389
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:43,830
Nobody knows what the
consequences will be.

390
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,750
You were trapped in
there longer than I was.

391
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:47,553
- If anyone can underst...
- Then what, Jay?

392
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:48,936
What's your idea?

393
00:17:54,944 --> 00:17:56,710
Uh, okay, look...

394
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:58,449
I mean, did my dad have any other ideas?

395
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,741
No... but we couldn't
talk for very long.

396
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,296
Jay, I'm sorry, I just...

397
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,353
No, it's all right, kid. I get it.

398
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,325
All right, back to basics.

399
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,812
In nuclear fission,

400
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:16,274
enormous energy is created
by a chain reaction of atoms

401
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:18,143
splitting and releasing neutrons.

402
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:21,600
It's nearly impossible
to reverse this process,

403
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:24,805
but, theoretically...

404
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,772
you could restore stability.

405
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,075
How?

406
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:30,230
One way is to offset the loss of mass

407
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,530
- by nuclear fusion.
- Great.

408
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,580
You have some sort of
machine lying around here

409
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,016
that could generate that kind of energy?

410
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:36,960
No, we don't.

411
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,679
But the other way,
considering our predicament,

412
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:41,101
seems more promising.

413
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,190
Which is what?

414
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,192
Cooling it down.

415
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,066
We need to hurry.

416
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:00,849
Hey.

417
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:03,586
I see all these frozen
people around me, Flash,

418
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:05,272
and this time, it's not my fault.

419
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:06,574
We need your help.

420
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,681
Three of you now. What's going on?

421
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,952
- The cargo in this container.
- It's a nuclear bomb.

422
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:12,855
Yeah, and it went kaboom.

423
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:15,812
- Dandy.
- Come here.

424
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,538
Whoo, it's toasty in here.

425
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,541
We need you to cool it down.

426
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:22,710
You want me to cool
down a nuclear reaction

427
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,346
that's already gone critical?

428
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,036
You're serious?

429
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,638
Quickly, please, Ms. Frost.

430
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,807
All right, let's give it a whirl.

431
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:45,152
Didn't go quite how I expected.

432
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,625
Tr... try again.

433
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,530
Oh, no...

434
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,936
Huh, so that's what heat feels like.

435
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:04,204
You're burning up.

436
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,773
Come on.

437
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:08,171
All right, it's okay.

438
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,343
All right.

439
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,512
I have to let you go, all right?

440
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,421
Barry?

441
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,591
Don't let Caity die.

442
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:22,289
Okay.

443
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,791
Now what?

444
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,094
Guess we have to find that
fusion machine after all.

445
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:33,444
- Wait a second...
- What?

446
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,280
What if we're the machine?

447
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,584
How so?

448
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:40,328
Well, you said that we could
offset the energy of the bomb

449
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:42,198
with the energy from nuclear fusion.

450
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,075
Theoretically.

451
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,878
Right, and the reaction in
that container's giving off,

452
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:48,348
I don't know, 3 million tons of energy?

453
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,858
- Give or take.
- So, 3 megatons of energy,

454
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,827
that's 3 billion joules.

455
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,798
Each lightning bolt gives off
roughly 1 billion joules, so...

456
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:57,267
So if we all throw a lightning bolt

457
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,370
- at the same time...
- It could be enough.

458
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:01,894
That's enough. That'll
work. Let's do it.

459
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,439
- Whoa.
- Jay!

460
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:14,174
Hey...

461
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:15,522
- Hey...
- I'm...

462
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,483
I'm not used to going this long.

463
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,089
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

464
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:20,391
- Damn legs...
- It's all right.

465
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:21,814
Don't work like they once did.

466
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:22,757
It's okay.

467
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,684
I'm not gonna be able to
finish this one, Flash.

468
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:26,753
- I'm sorry.
- Just rest.

469
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:29,456
I'm so... sorry.

470
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,825
It's okay.

471
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,955
Barry, the two of us can't
produce enough lightning power

472
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,691
to offset the energy from that bomb.

473
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:50,861
I mean, even if we had
full speed, which we don't,

474
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:52,262
at least I don't.

475
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:56,734
We have to send it into the Speed Force.

476
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:59,295
- You... you heard what Jay said.
- And Harry said it'd be fine.

477
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:01,772
No, he said he thinks it would be fine.

478
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:04,131
Barry, my dad never
thinks anything, he knows.

479
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:07,478
Jay was right, we can't do it.

480
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:11,782
Damn it!

481
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,453
Okay, what if...

482
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:18,555
I don't know, what
if we run back in time

483
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:20,424
and stop this bomb from ever going off?

484
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,040
No, Jesse, we can't do that.

485
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,343
Yeah, well, it's kind
of our only option.

486
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,218
It's not an option.

487
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,963
Even if it saves the
city and everyone in it?

488
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:27,164
It's not saving them, okay?

489
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,899
The second you alter the timeline,

490
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:31,135
everything changes,
especially the people you love.

491
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:33,461
Trust me. I learned that the hard way.

492
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:35,031
Yeah, well, maybe a
new version of my dad

493
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,107
isn't the worst thing in the world.

494
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:39,376
Look, Jesse, whatever
problems you two have,

495
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:40,651
they're not gonna get solved

496
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:42,783
by forcing him to do
something he doesn't want to.

497
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,448
He has to make that decision.

498
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:48,545
Oh, God.

499
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:57,747
The reaction's combustion's
reached its final phase.

500
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,717
I think we're slowing down.

501
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,732
So everything else is speeding up.

502
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:04,134
Barry, I don't have any more ideas.

503
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:06,036
Me either.

504
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:09,106
I don't know how much longer I can run.

505
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:10,707
All right, you have to get out of here.

506
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:12,752
Use the speed you have
left to get back to Earth-2.

507
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:15,186
- Your dad wanted you to leave.
- Yeah, I heard.

508
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:17,243
So you'd be safe, Jesse.

509
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:18,912
He loves you, all right?

510
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:20,784
More than anything.

511
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:22,664
- Go.
- No, I can't just...

512
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,733
Go.

513
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:18,275
I'm sorry.

514
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,220
Oh, God.

515
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:36,381
I wish I could tell you this
while you could still hear me,

516
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:38,962
but...

517
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,067
I know how happy Mom made you

518
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:47,671
and how sad you are now that she's gone.

519
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:50,641
But I just... I don't know
why you won't talk about it.

520
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:52,420
I know maybe I don't need to,

521
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:54,645
but...

522
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,981
I just want you to be happy again.

523
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,252
That's all I've ever wanted.

524
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,667
I've got to think of something.

525
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:52,869
Oh, come on.

526
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,850
- Barry...
- Iris...

527
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:32,542
What... I'm...

528
00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:34,182
You're moving as fast as I am...

529
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:35,784
- What?
- Like in the courtroom.

530
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:37,405
- Why? Why? Didn't you...
- I can't...

531
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:39,549
- Oh, my God, what?
- I can't.

532
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:46,657
Uh, what?

533
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:48,665
I can't save us this time.

534
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,531
What do you mean, you can't save us?

535
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,802
- There's a bomb...
- What?

536
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:00,183
A nuke, it's already gone off.

537
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,935
- I can't stop it.
- Wait-but there's a way.

538
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,337
There's gotta be something
that you can do, Barry.

539
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,939
No, listen, I tried.
We tried everything.

540
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:07,274
We tried lightning, we
tried cooling it down,

541
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:08,709
reaching into a dead earth,

542
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,111
but there's nothing that will work.

543
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:13,032
- I don't know what to do.
- Okay.

544
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:15,249
Hey, as soon as I stop, it's gonna...

545
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:18,452
I know. I know. Hey... hey, it's okay.

546
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,602
I don't know how much
longer I can hold out.

547
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,690
- I'm so tired.
- Okay.

548
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:24,291
It's okay, Barry.

549
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:25,727
Oh, my God, you're burning up.

550
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,055
I've been at this for a while...

551
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:28,495
- Okay.
- For me.

552
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:31,180
Hey... hey, look at me, look at me...

553
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,666
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

554
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:35,970
- Look at me. Be here with me.
- I'm sorry.

555
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:38,205
Okay.

556
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:40,274
I'm sorry.

557
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,508
This isn't exactly

558
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,337
the quality time I was imagining, but...

559
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:49,183
It's still nice.

560
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:51,952
Every moment with you,
Barry, has always been nice.

561
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:55,489
Every moment.

562
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:57,825
You're my lightning rod, Iris.

563
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:02,796
What?

564
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,299
What?

565
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:07,067
You said you tried
to use lightning. How?

566
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,902
We tried. It... it didn't work.

567
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,270
If it was powerful enough,

568
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,239
it could've fused the split atoms,

569
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,341
it could've negated
the effects of the bomb,

570
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:15,371
but I can't do it alone.

571
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:16,946
I can't generate that kind of energy.

572
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:18,812
No, you can't...

573
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:20,715
but the Speed Force can.

574
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:21,951
What?

575
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,221
When you went into the Speed Force,

576
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:25,340
the... the lightning from the storm...

577
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:27,465
One of those bullets
would be more than enough,

578
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:28,988
but I... I can't.

579
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,657
How... how could I
draw that out? I can't.

580
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,493
No, listen, when we freed you,

581
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:34,495
Cisco and Caitlin,
they used a Quark Sphere

582
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:35,929
programmed with your genetic marker

583
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,331
to trick the Speed Force into thinking

584
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,166
that you were still in there.

585
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:41,468
I just need to get that sphere,

586
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,868
and the storm will chase me.

587
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,638
It's like you said,

588
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,573
a lightning rod to
bring out the lightning.

589
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,014
- Come back to me.
- As fast as I can.

590
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:22,242
Here we go.

591
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:42,423
Ahh!

592
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,997
Ahh!

593
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:26,934
Jesse?

594
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:29,002
You're here.

595
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:30,804
I'm here.

596
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,616
Barry?

597
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:45,043
Barry!

598
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,453
Barry!

599
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:54,566
Flash!

600
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:56,330
Flash!

601
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:00,901
Flash?

602
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,079
Are we dead?

603
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,643
No.

604
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:11,545
That's good.

605
00:32:19,213 --> 00:32:22,501
Today, I showed you how
easy a city can fall.

606
00:32:22,504 --> 00:32:24,437
Mark my words,

607
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,832
nuclear power will bring only
destruction to the world.

608
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,501
You'll see it again,

609
00:32:29,503 --> 00:32:30,923
and when you do,

610
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:33,405
you'll all remember the
name, Veronica Dale,

611
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:36,508
and fully understand my actions.

612
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,978
Eden Corps! Eden Corps!

613
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,414
Eden Co...

614
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:44,482
I feel like she's saying, "Eden Corps."

615
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:46,556
As in blasting everybody

616
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,687
back to the days of the Garden of Eden.

617
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:50,855
This was to air after the city fell.

618
00:32:50,857 --> 00:32:52,857
Found her manifesto at her apartment.

619
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:55,060
Environmental activist
turned animal liberator

620
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:57,762
- turned domestic terrorist.
- Turned craycray.

621
00:32:57,764 --> 00:32:59,731
How did she find out about
the ARGUS drop anyway?

622
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,766
Somebody must have tipped her off.

623
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,102
- DeVoe.
- But why would he, or she...

624
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:06,040
Whoever... why blow up the whole city?

625
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:07,444
Why kill nearly everyone here?

626
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,306
Maybe there is no method to the madness.

627
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:12,477
Well, this was fun, as usual,

628
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,145
but it's time for the ol' Crimson Comet

629
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:15,431
to head back home.

630
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:16,834
Thanks for your help, Jay.

631
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:19,370
Yeah, if it wasn't
for you two and Jesse,

632
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,953
it'd be a completely different
story in the news right now.

633
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:24,622
You were a big part of that, Iris.

634
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:26,424
Credit where credit's due.

635
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:28,329
My sentiments exactly.

636
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:30,098
So, when you get home, you need to rest.

637
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,763
Your glucose levels are pretty low.

638
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:33,212
Thanks. When I get back,

639
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:35,949
I think I'll be doing
nothing but getting rest.

640
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:37,836
Meaning?

641
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:41,139
I've been at this hero game a long time,

642
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:43,540
a long, long time,

643
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:46,144
and after today,

644
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:48,313
I'm thinking about trying
my hand at something new.

645
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,277
Like what?

646
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,314
For starters, training
someone to take over.

647
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:54,219
There's another Flash on your earth?

648
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:56,221
There will be...

649
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:57,722
soon as I'm done training her.

650
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:00,658
Her?

651
00:34:02,114 --> 00:34:04,209
Well, do you think we're
good with the Speed Force?

652
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,779
Well, if not, we'll
find out soon enough.

653
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,579
Always a pleasure, Flash.

654
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,836
Always.

655
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:18,309
So, you need to rest as well, Mister.

656
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:20,211
No running, no Flash.

657
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:22,180
- Your system is taxed.
- I'm good.

658
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:24,149
You will be, but you not yet.

659
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:27,052
That's right. Anything
comes up, we got it.

660
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:30,955
Iris, make sure this man rests.

661
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:32,457
I'm on it.

662
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,221
- Long day.
- Yes, it was.

663
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:43,101
You know, I realized a couple of things

664
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:45,804
- when I was in Flashtime.
- Yeah, what's that?

665
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:49,502
Well... I'm more than
fast enough to catch DeVoe.

666
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,276
We just need to know
when he's coming out of

667
00:34:51,278 --> 00:34:52,544
the pocket dimension sooner.

668
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:57,015
Yeah. We'll figure that out.

669
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:00,151
What's the other thing?

670
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:04,689
You were right about taking a breather.

671
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:06,357
Mm.

672
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,894
Just... a moment with you,

673
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:12,697
being grounded again,

674
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:14,499
everything becomes more clear.

675
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,736
Scooch over.

676
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,844
I'm sorry about date night.

677
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:27,712
Don't be.

678
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:30,715
PowerBars and sweatpants, it's...

679
00:35:30,717 --> 00:35:32,283
all I really need.

680
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:50,435
Uh, this is my exit.

681
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:51,936
Your... oh...

682
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:55,135
Right.

683
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:57,271
Yeah.

684
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,679
Jesse...

685
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,515
the reason that I can't talk about...

686
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:05,884
You know what, it's... it's okay.

687
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:08,744
- You don't have to explain it.
- I don't-I don't?

688
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,188
I thought that's what you wanted.

689
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,822
Yeah.

690
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,656
Um...

691
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:16,394
I don't know, I thought
making you confront

692
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:19,230
all the emotions that
you have with losing Mom

693
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:21,466
would help you move on...

694
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:24,502
And be happy again.

695
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:27,338
But I can't decide when
you're ready to do that,

696
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,619
only you can, so I'm... I'm sorry if...

697
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,776
No, don't be sorry. It's okay.

698
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:34,746
I do want you to know, though,

699
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:37,148
if the time comes and...

700
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,117
you wanna talk about it,

701
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,119
I'm here.

702
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:49,460
Actually... if that's the case,

703
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:52,096
why don't you stick around
for a little bit longer?

704
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:53,478
What, you wanna talk now?

705
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:56,281
No... I'd like you to listen.

706
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:58,184
Have a seat.

707
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:00,038
I'm going to fix this to your forehead.

708
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,906
- What is that?
- It's the streamlined version

709
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:04,576
of DA Cecile Horton's
mental activity dampener.

710
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:08,112
- Nice upgrade.
- Thank you.

711
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:09,385
But I thought this was, uh,

712
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:11,616
supposed to block out people's thoughts?

713
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:12,750
Not anymore.

714
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:15,553
Now...

715
00:37:15,555 --> 00:37:17,055
it allows you to hear them.

716
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:28,066
Your mother...

717
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:34,372
I don't know... I don't
know how... I don't...

718
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:38,343
You see, when you have a love...

719
00:37:38,345 --> 00:37:40,078
Had a love...

720
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,783
Like your mother and I had,

721
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:48,119
and you lose that love...

722
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:56,694
Anyway, um...

723
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,229
Maybe this will help you understand

724
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:00,331
why it's been so hard for me.

725
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:12,844
Because in the vast night sky,

726
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:15,813
you are the only star I see.

727
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:18,816
Mom.

728
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:30,561
She's a miracle.

729
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:36,434
Jesse.

730
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,282
She's just like me.

731
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,809
Sweetie, come here.

732
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:51,135
Be with me.

733
00:38:58,224 --> 00:38:59,957
Thank you, Ally.

734
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,830
- So...
- So?

735
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,995
Jesse seemed better when she left.

736
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:06,650
So do you.

737
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,153
Did you guys have a nice talk?

738
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:09,966
Well, it was actually

739
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:11,669
more of a listening session than a talk,

740
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:13,438
but we're good, yeah, both of us.

741
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,906
That's good, Harry.

742
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:16,808
Yeah, and what about you?

743
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,943
- What?
- Come on.

744
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:21,101
I know you well enough to know
that something's on your mind.

745
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:22,650
What is it?

746
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,950
It's... Killer Frost.

747
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,719
What about Killer Frost?

748
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:31,255
I don't know anything
that she says or does.

749
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:33,624
It's scary and alarming

750
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:36,094
to have this person that
you know nothing about

751
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:37,562
living inside of you.

752
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:40,198
But for the first time,

753
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,401
I remember what she did.

754
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:45,303
What do you remember?

755
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:47,705
Barry taking her into Flashtime,

756
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:49,273
- trying to freeze the bomb...
- Mm-hmm.

757
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:50,942
And...

758
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:54,379
Killer Frost being... worried.

759
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:57,815
Worried about... what? About dying?

760
00:39:57,817 --> 00:39:59,635
About me.

761
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:01,071
Interesting.

762
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:03,760
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

763
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:04,929
I didn't mean to drop that.

764
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:06,948
- It just slipped out of my hands.
- That's okay.

765
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:08,860
Oh, gosh, my first...

766
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:10,928
Killer Frost, and I go and ruin it.

767
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,161
- Typical... typical me.
- That's not....

768
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:13,496
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

769
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,541
I just get so clumsy when I'm nervous.

770
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:16,873
What are you nervous about?

771
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:19,083
Um, I'm... I'm supposed to
be meeting some people here

772
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,877
for the first time, and
I've got the jitters,

773
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,181
which... Is what this place is called.

774
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:24,213
Hey! It is.

775
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,257
- Apt name, don't you think?
- I do.

776
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,944
It's funny, you know, you get nervous,

777
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,280
you get the jitters, you go for coffee,

778
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:30,596
and the caffeine acts as a stimulant,

779
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:32,650
which makes you shaky, which
could also be known as...

780
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:33,985
- The jitters.
- Exactly.

781
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:36,621
Okay, ri... I get it.

782
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:38,856
Okay.

783
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,258
We're gonna go.

784
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,166
- Okay.
- Yeah.

785
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:44,328
Um, I'm really very, very sorry.

786
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,157
Don't worry about it. Good
luck with your meeting.

787
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,865
- I hope it goes well.
- Thanks.

It did.
