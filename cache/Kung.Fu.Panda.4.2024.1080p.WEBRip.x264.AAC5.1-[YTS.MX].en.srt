[growling]

16
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,624
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

17
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,917
It can't be.

18

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,086
[miner] Tai Lung.

20
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,839
I have returned to take what is mine.

21
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,134
Which is everything that is yours.

[all gasping]

25
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:27,605
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

26
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,775
and no one will stand in his way.

27
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,779
Not even the great Dragon Warrior.

[children laughing]

29
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,748
Oh, where is Po?

30
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,501
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

31
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,504
Ping, will you please just relax?

32
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,464
I am relaxed!

33
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,175
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

34
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,761
But what if he's sick? What if he's hurt?

35
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,388
-What if he's hungry?
-[whimpers]

36
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,140
Don't get your noodles in a twist.

37
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:06,686
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

38
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,193
Kung fu!

39
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,488
Whoa! That's bad.

40
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,366
Whoa! Getting worse.

41
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,785

[screaming] Ha-ha!

00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,523
Okay, big guy.
We're really gonna have to wrap this up.

49
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,621
Whee!

50
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,123
-Oink.
-Oink.

-[cheering]
-Again, again!

52
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,126
-That was fun.
-Let's do that again.

53
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,965
[chuckles] And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

[pigs cheering]

[villagers cheering]

57
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,393
-[villager] The Dragon Warrior is back!
-It's the Dragon Warrior!

58
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,020
Was, is and always will be.

59
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,897
[fan 1] We love you, Dragon Warrior!

60
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,524
And I love you too, adoring fan.

61
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,109
-[fan 2] Sign my scroll.
-[fan 3] Sign my hat.

62
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,277
-Sign my shirt.
-[Po] Okay, okay.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,695
I'll sign whatever you want.

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,571
Po!

65
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,699
Master Shifu!

66
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,325
Here, let me just--

67
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,787
There, that's much… worse.

68
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,123
We have to talk.

69
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,001
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

70
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,086
-Let's go!
-Ceremony?

71
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,379
What ceremony?

72
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,840
-[Po] The Staff of Wisdom.
-[fans] Ooh.

73
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,634
-Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
-[fans] Aah.

74
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,803
It is said that
whoever possesses this staff

75
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,764
has the power
to travel between the realms.

76
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,684
The power to unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm.

77
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,103
And now, the power to open…

78
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,899
the all-new
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

79
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,651
[cheering]

80
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:23,031
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

81
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,532
[cheering]

82
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,201
-[grunts]
-[party whistle toots]

83
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,536
Dragon Warrior!

84
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,663
Will the Furious Five be here too?

85
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,040
Unfortunately, no.

86
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,709
They're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

87
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,170
Tigress is taking on
the free-range chicken gang.

88
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,380
Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.

89
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,215
Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.

90
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,592
-[crocodilians] Crane!
-[Po] Long story.

91
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,470
Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.

92
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,429
Or is it mongeese?

93
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,722
And Mantis?

94
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,767
Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.

95
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,395
Just 'cause they're not here in person

96
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,065
doesn't mean they're not here
as life-sized cut-outs.

97
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,151
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

98
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,944
-Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
-You.

99
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,614
[piglet] My turn! My turn!

100
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,698
And then you.

101
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,493
[villagers gasp]

102
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,787
[groans]

103
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,539
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

104
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,749
We need to talk.

105
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,418
-Now.
-[villagers gasp]

106
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,504
Hey, can I get one of those
in a wallet size?

107
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,838
-[Shifu] Po!
-Coming.

108
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,924
[Po panting]

109
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,302
Do you remember the first time you climbed
these steps to the Jade Palace?

110
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,098
How could I forget?
I thought I'd never make it to the top.

111
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,599
Yes, but you persevered.

112
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,853
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

113
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,772
The next step?
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,149
I've already taken all the steps.
Haven't I?

115
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,944
It is time for you
to choose your successor.

116
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,362
Successor for what?

117
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,782
A successor to be
the next Dragon Warrior.

118
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,742
Oh… [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

119
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,161
Funny, 'cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

120
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

121
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,627
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

122
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,587
-Exactly.
-Then what am I gonna be?

123
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,256
Once a successor is chosen,

124
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,384
you will advance
to the highest level in all of kung fu.

125
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,470
Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Peace.

126
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,848
Whoa.

127
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,308
I don't know what that means.

128
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,727
It's just like
Master Oogway before you.

129
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:21,357
You will oversee the Valley,
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope.

130
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,609
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

131
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,238
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

132
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,158
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

133
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,325
[muffled] A cookie.

134
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,618
Other hand.

135
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,328
The Staff of Wisdom.

136
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,330
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

137
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,666
Do you really think it was so you could
open a restaurant?

138
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,917
Or pose for pictures?

139
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
He wasn't super specific.

140
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:45,965
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

141
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,926
and become something better
than you already are.

142
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,178
[Po] You take it.

143
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,805
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

144
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,267
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,
which I have accepted

145
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,560
and am at peace with.

146
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,604
-Really. It's fine.
-You don't sound fine.

147
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,231
-You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
-Okay, you're fine.

148
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,399
This is an honor.

149
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,528
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

150
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,323
Master Shifu,
I finally found something I'm good at,

151
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,116
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,285
No one is taking anything away, Po.

153
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,829
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

154
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,582
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?
You know what I mean?

155
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,334
The "shasha-booie"?

156
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,835
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

157
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,505
but I don't know anything
about passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

158
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,548
All I know are two things.

159
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,885
Kicking butt and taking names.

160
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,971
And if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

161
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,140
Like, who was
that fire-breathing crocodile?

162
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,642
I wanna say Steve…

163
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,977
You were chosen
to bring peace to the Valley,

164
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:44,315
and there are other ways to bring peace
than simply kicking butt.

165
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,484
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

166
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,820
Please. Being the Dragon Warrior
is all I know.

167
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,989
-It's who I am.
-Not anymore.

168
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,158
The Valley of Peace needs
a Spiritual Leader,

169
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,035
and Master Oogway chose you.

170
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,996
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

171
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,499
Candidates? What candidates?

172
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,919
[villagers cheering]

173
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,719
Awesome!

174
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,144
No way!

175
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,816
Wow!

176
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,859
Skadoosh.

177
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,278
Fantastic pose.

178
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,489
[screaming]

179
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,663
[villagers applauding]

180
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,665
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,171
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

182
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,051
[villagers chanting]
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

183
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:58,055
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

184
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,182
So many great candidates.

185
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,185
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

186
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,355
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

187
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,232
What is happening?

188
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,569
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

189
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,238
[groans]

190
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,990
[screams]

191
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,119
[Shifu] Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

192
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,081
[chewing] Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

193
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,791
You will know when you know.

194
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,586
How do I know when I know?
You know?

195
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,629
[sighs]

196
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,049
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

197
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,301
Just as Oogway did before me.

198
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,346
I'm not conflicted.
I'm just not ready for a next step.

199
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,555
What is that you're holding?

200
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,015
The Staff of Wisdom?

201
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,099
[Shifu] Other hand.

202
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,684
A chewed-up peach pit?

203
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,144
Exactly.

204
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:49,523
Every pit holds the promise
of a mighty tree.

205
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,776
Uh, how is this gonna help me
find the answers?

206
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,945
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

207
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,615
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

208
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,952
[straining] There we go.

209
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,579
[grunts] All right, universe.

210
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,248
Give me some guidance.

211
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,460
[Po's inner voice] Inner peace.

212
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,712
Inner peace.

213
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,756
Inner peace.

214
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,591
Dinner, please.

215
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,635
Dinner with peas.

216
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,804
Snow peas?

217
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,056
In a sesame soy glaze.

218
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,182
[grunts]

219
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,475
Inner peace.

220
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,352
Inner peace.

221
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,687
[inhales deeply]

222
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,523
This is not working at all.

223
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,191
Maybe focus on your breathing?

224
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,944
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

225
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,780
Technically, you're talking to you,
if you think about it.

226
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,533
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

227
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,868
Wait, if I'm Po's inner voice,
then who are you?

228
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,912
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

229
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,497
How many voices do I have in there?

230
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,666
-You do not want to know.
-This dirt is itchy.

231
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,334
-I just love kung fu.
-What am I gonna be?

232
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,170
-Are we alone in the universe?
-You guys thought it was awesome, right?

233
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,840
-[voices overlapping]
-[screaming]

234
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,258
Anyone want a cookie?

235
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,928
[wind whistling]

236
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,723
Universe?

237
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,269
Is that you?

238
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,982
[inhales]

[coughing]

241
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,122
Attention, mysterious figure!

242
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,418
The Dragon Warrior's here
to perform justice.

243
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,254
[exclaims]

244
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,174
I know you're in here.

245
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,801
Just a matter of time before I find you.

246
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,429
Ooh.

247
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,265

[exclaims]

249
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,523
You can't hide from justice forever.

250
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,983
[gasps]

251
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,031
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

252
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,991
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

253
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,327
But I can't give you that.
Give it back.

254
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,078
If you insist.

255
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,217
-[exclaims]
-Oh, no!

256
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,512
He's got a walking stick.
What are you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

257
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,140
This stick is not for the strolling.
It's the Staff of Wisdom.

258
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,809
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

259
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,728
I am the Dragon Warrior.

260
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,191
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about you
says "dragon" or "warrior."

261
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,943
[grunts, screams]

Hi-yah!

264
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,126
How dare you desecrate the Hall of Heroes?

265
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,670
Who's desecrating what now?

266
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,463
Master Ostrich's Egg!

267
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,174
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

268
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,552
The Indestructible Chain Hammer
of Master Pangolin.

00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,803
Whoopsies.

[chuckles]

273
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,025
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

274
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,570
Which I've already broken! Twice!

275
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,740
Why would you keep an urn of souls?
Feels kinda creepy.

You're looking a little tired.

You're gonna pay for that.

You faker.

289
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,693
It's not faking. It's called Method.

290

Catch ya later, panda.

291

No.

That's Dragon Warrior-- [yelps]

Let go of me.

304
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,653
Just tell me one thing.

305
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,072
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

306
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,366
That's a mystery for you to solve
during your two-year stay

307
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,784
at the Valley of Peace prison.

308
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,745
Valley of Peace prison? [scoffs]
Sounds like a day care.

309
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,497
It is a day care on the weekends.

310
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,707
But it's also a prison.

311
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,917
[villager] There he is!

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,960
Dragon Warrior!

-[ram foreman] Tai Lung is back.
-Tai Lung has returned?

314
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,131
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

315
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,717
-He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
-Well, he's back.

316
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,595
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

317
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,931
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

318
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,100
-He's back.
-Please, you've got to do something.

319
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,145
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

Well, you know what they say…

every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

[Po] Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

323
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,600
Very clever, fox. You know something.

324
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,769
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

325
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,147
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

326
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,815
-Tell me.
-And why should I?

327
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,025
I mean, what's in it for me?

328
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,110
The peace of mind
knowing you did the right thing.

329
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,654
You're adorable.
Has anyone ever told you that?

330
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,448
And I don't mean just in, like,
the cuddly sense.

331
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,741
I don't have time for games.

332
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,909
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

333
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:20,080
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to think
it was Tai Lung.

334
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,331
Wait. She?

335
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,624
Mine!

336
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,670
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

337
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,963
mimicking any shape.

338
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,089
The master of deception.

339
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,467
The lizard of lies
with the glowing teal eyes.

340
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,676
I'm talking 'bout…

341
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,429
The Chameleon.

342
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,513
[guards gasp]

343
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,683
This is kind of a private conversation.

344
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,893
[honking]

345
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,436
Who's The Chameleon?

346
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,813
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

347
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,274
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

348
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,943
But what does she have against me
and the Valley of Peace?

349
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,112
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

350
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,033
You're right.
How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

351
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,701
She isn't someone who can be found.

352
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,496
At least not without someone in the know.

353
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,373
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

354
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,460
[sighs] Oh! It's me.
It's obviously-- It's me.

355
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,753
I'm in the know.

356
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,297
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

357
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,924
Good luck.

358
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,094
After all, how hard can it be
to find someone who can look like anyone,

359
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,386
blend in anywhere?

360
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,351
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

361
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,728
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

362
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,021
Deal.

363
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,232
-[Shifu] Po!
-[yelps]

364
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
What do you think you're doing?

365
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,986
[stammers] There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and--

366
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,072
That's a job for the Furious Five.

367
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,117
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

368
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,993
Look, I know that change is difficult

369
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,538
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

370
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,998
but your job is finding a successor.

371
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,460
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

372
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,170
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

373
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,421
I'm a red panda.

374
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,550
You know what? I love that for you.

375
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,176
Po, this is your decision.

376
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,639
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

377
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,396
-Thanks for the free stay.
-[Shifu] What are you doing?

378
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,814
-Little dank for a day care.
-Wait!

379
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,357
-Not bad for a jail.
-Where is she going?

380
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,441
You can't leave.

381
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,695
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

382
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,906
You are supposed to be
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

383
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,659
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

384
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,036
I'll be back soon.
Tell my dads I love 'em.

385
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,372
-I can't hear you anymore! Bye!
-[honks]

386
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,499
[groans]

387
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,420
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

388
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,088
That's a good back scratcher.

389
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,423
-Yoink!
-Hey!

390
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,675
So, does this really unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm?

391
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,302
It doesn't work like that.

392
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,096
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

393
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,057
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

394
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,809
No! What do you take me for?

395
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
An easy mark.

396
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,978
What's an easy mark?

397
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,646
Someone who's easy to steal from,

398
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,857
usually because they're generous
and too trusting.

399
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,026
-Like you.
-Aw, thank you.

400
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,741
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

401
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,868
and her favorite food is panda.

402
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,663
They say this Chameleon character
has magical powers.

403
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,417
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

404
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,960
[bunnies crying]

405
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,881
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

406
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,382
Or you.

407
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,971
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

408
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,766
[bunny] Po's going to
take down an evil sorceress?

409
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,726
The-- The Chameleon?

410
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,063
[chuckles] Well, a Dragon Warrior's work
is never done.

411
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,316
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming up
with a convicted felon

412
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,195
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

413
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:43,158
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

414
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,368
He's always come out on top.

415
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,578
You're right. You're right.

416
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,455
But what if you're wrong?

417
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,207
Calm down, Ping.

418
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,210
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

419
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,631
[bear crime boss] Who is she to summon us?

420
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,882
[crocodile crime boss] Classic power move.

421
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,261
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

422
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,889
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

423
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,599
You left out the evil sorceress part.

424
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,476
We used to run this city.

425
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,062
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

426
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,648
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

427
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,149
Yeah, but what could we do?

428
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,361
Together, we can take her down.

429
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,281
-[all gasp]
-Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

430
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,285
She could be at this very table,
and we'd have no idea.

431
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,163
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

432
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,082
Or you're The Chameleon.

433
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,834
-Or maybe…
-Oh, no.

434
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,210
-Maybe…
-Don't say it.

435
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,504
[as The Chameleon] …I'm The Chameleon.

436
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,714
I said don't say it.

437
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,140
We obviously spoke out of turn.

438
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,224
Sorry, Chameleon.

439
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,101
No, no. Don't apologize.

440
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,605
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

441
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,359
so it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

442
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,029
Especially when the one
doing the squeezing

443
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,532
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"…

444
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,117
What was the rest?

445
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,036
Reptilian runt.

446
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,206
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

447
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,250
You already have the city.

448
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,210
What else could you possibly want?

449
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:21,298
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

450
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,092
As close as the blood moon.

451
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,761
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

452
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,388
So little time, so many expenses.

453
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:33,810
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

454
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,936
No.

455
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,318
What was that now?

456
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,404
I mean no disrespect.

457
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,699
Don't worry.

458
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:53,663
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

459
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:59,086
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

460
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,963
But I never forget.

461
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,257
You might say I have the memory…

462
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,467
Oh, don't say it.

463
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,594
…of an elephant.

464
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,099
[groans]

465
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,774
[trumpets]

466
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,360
[all gasp]

467
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,613
You think
I've pushed you too far?

468
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,784
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

469
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,621
just how far I can push.

470
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,999
[grunting, groaning]

471
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,417
[whimpering]

472
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,713
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

473
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,678
Are we gonna stop for lunch soon?

474
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,763
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

475
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,641
But it does take the occasional time-out
for snackage.

476
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,434
Wanna split my almond cookie?

477
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,021
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

478
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,399
-Mm-hmm.
-What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

479
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,358
The "bam-what-le"?

480
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,402
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

481
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,987
Do you want the cookie or not?

-[grunting]
-[crunching]

483
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,450
I got my eye on you.

484
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,955
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

485
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,165
Just a little farther.

486
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,054
[both screaming]

487
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,600
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

488
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,270
Well, I-- I-- I… didn't wanna miss
the blood moon rising.

489
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,023
Oh, pooh.
You are just as worried as I am.

490
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,441
All right, all right.

491
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,277
I know pandas come across as
calm, gentle and chill,

492
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,613
but… [chuckles] …the truth is

493
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,198
I'm kinda freaking out!

494
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,240
So am I.

495
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,536
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

496
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,414
-What if he's captured?
-What if he's tortured? [gasps]

497
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,333
[both] Our baby!

498
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,919
Okay, okay.

499
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,171
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

500
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:10,133
but there is still something that he has
that The Chameleon does not.

501
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,260
-What's that?
-Us.

502
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,180
Now, let's go find our son.

503
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,389
I hope Po's okay.

504
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,434
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

505
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,479
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

506
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,981
-[Li] Who was that idiot?
-[Mr. Ping] Me, of course.

507
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,524
I was the wise goose.

508
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,276
[Li] Oh, yeah.

509
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,195
[Po] Whoa.

510
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,239
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

511
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,032
[fox] That's no village.

512
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,992
That's Juniper City.

513
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,827
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

514
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,371
Just a boat ride away.

515
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,957
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

516
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,917
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

517
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,795
For the right price, those cutthroats will
take us anywhere we want to go.

518
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,507
Of course, we could always opt for
the four-finger discount.

519
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,800
No stealing.

520
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,302
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

521
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,179
Well, that sounds inviting.

522
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,764
[screams, grunts]

523
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,103
Anybody lose a rabbit?

524
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,317
[grunts, groans]

525
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,610
Stir faster!

[whimpering]

527
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,116
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

528
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,952
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

529
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,912
And stay out of trouble.

530
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,541
Hey, what you guys playing?

531
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,293
Mah-jongg.

532
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,961
And the stakes are high.

533
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,045
Can I play?

534
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,465
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

535
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,134
[gamblers chuckle]

536
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,344
-Hey there.
-What can I get you?

537
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,221
A boat ride to Juniper City.

538
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,306
Ask this guy.

539
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,016
[exhales]

540
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,852
-Who's he?
-He's the captain.

541
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,395
-[coin clinks]
-Thanks.

542

[sighs]

544
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,318
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

545
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,194
Never played before, huh?

546
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,196
I'm sorry, are you accusing me
of cheating?

547
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,490
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

548
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,492
I am the manager.

549
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,205
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,
but I won't carry anything illegal.

550
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,582
I don't want any trouble.

551
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,542
[chuckles] Trouble runs from me.

552
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,002
[squawks] Then it'll cost you double.

553
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,546
I'm confused.
Should I have said that I like trouble?

554
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,381
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

555
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,051
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price?

556
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,472
You got a deal.

557
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,433
Great.
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

558
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,852
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

559
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,312
Yes. Everything, again.

560
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,356
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

561
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,940
-Keep stirring!
-[yelps]

562

Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

563
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,155
But how did you pay for this?

564
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,115
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

565
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,575

Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

571
00:27:55,673 --> 00:28:00,095
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

572
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,139
[gulps] There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

573
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,560
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

574
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,688
Please allow us to pay for our meal
and yours too.

I'm only hungry for…

-Dumplings?
-…vengeance!

577
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,111
Well, then, come and get it.

00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,113
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

to be back home again.

642
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,328
Does your family live there too?

643
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,663
They would. If I had a family.

644
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,833
It wasn't easy being a little fox
in a big city.

645
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,003
So I had to survive any way I could.

646
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,046
Hey!

647
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,174
[Zhen] Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.

648
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,801
Stop running! Stop running!

649
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,893
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

650
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,353
Well, I mean I was.

651
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,273
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later, my panda dad found me.

652
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,985
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

653
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,528
-Right, Mom?
-[squawks]

654
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,406
Then, one day, a local took me in.

655
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,868
Put a roof over my head,
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

656
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,245
After that, I was never alone again.

657
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,455
I guess we both got lucky.

658
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,498
I guess.

659
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,875
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese…

660
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,918
Peace.

661
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,419
…what did that angry little squirrel
mean…

662
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,337
Red panda.

663
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,381
…when he said you had to
find your successor?

664
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,548
[sighs]

665
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,968
Now that I'm supposed to become
Spiritual Leader,

666
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,054
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

667
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,223
Once you're on top,
that's where you wanna stay, right?

668
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,309
No, it's just that-- What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

669
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,853
I can't even come up with
one of those cool-sounding proverbs.

670
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,523
"Life's greatest enemy is"…

671
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,733
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

672
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,443
Okay.

673
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,821
Everyone knows
life's greatest enemy is time.

674
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,780
[squawks]

675
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,866
I guess it's just easier to hold on
to the life you know

676
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,368
than move on to the one you don't.

677
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,161
Hey, that was pretty good.

678
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,079
Yeah.

679
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,916
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Geese.

680
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,835
[gulping]

681
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,878
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

682
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,422
Should he be driving?

683
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,575
We've come to pay tribute,
as you requested.

684
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,452
Looks a little light.

685
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,328
Go back out and get me more!

686
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,246
More?

687
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,414
But-- But, Chameleon--

688
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:05,043
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

689
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,461
[crime bosses murmuring]

690
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,174
At last, my destiny approaches.

691
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:20,391
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

692
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,020
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond!

693
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,321
They will all know the name
of The Chameleon!

694
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,655
[Zhen] Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

695
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,868
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

696
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,913
She's gonna take over cities and towns
and the Valley of Peace.

697
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,623
A vision?

698
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,166
While you were asleep?

699
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,584
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

700
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,377
Not a dream, a vision.

701
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,463
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

702
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,298
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

703
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,300
We got to get to The Chameleon
and take her down.

704
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,260
Well, then you're in luck.

705
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,429
Welcome to Juniper City.

706
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,061
Whoa!

707
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,358
[Zhen] This is the place where you can be
whatever you wanna be,

708
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,652
do whatever you wanna do,

709
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,947
and steal whatever you wanna steal.

710
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,031
Uh, if that's your thing.

711
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,660
Land ho!

00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:21,911
[Po, Zhen grunt]

713
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,871
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,174

-Look out!

00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,388
Out of the way!

719
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,182
I've never seen so much traffic before.

720
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,268
[Zhen] You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

721
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,562
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

722
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,606
Come on!

723
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,155
Well, sure is good to be home again.

724
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,990
The sights. The sounds.

725
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,701
[sniffs] The smells.

This city is the most amazing place
I've ever seen!

until The Chameleon got her claws into it.

Oh, yeah.

740
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,783
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

741
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,828
Is she lurking in that villainous tower
dominating the city?

742
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,623
How'd you know?

743
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,625
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

Yeah, well, let's just say
a face like mine is hard to forget.

What? You're a wanted criminal?

751

You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

752

You never mentioned
you were wanted.

Don't worry.

than look for me.

I'm falling…

803
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,561
very slowly.

804
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,271
[yelps]

805
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,648
Ow! [screaming]

806
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,653
[screaming continues]

807
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,784
[grunting, yelping]

808
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,328
[grunts] Sorry.

00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,163
[sobs]

810
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,665
[bulls grunting]

811
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,423
[all panting, whimpering]

812
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,637
Whew.

813
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,104
There they are!

814
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,149
We don't have time for a drum solo!

815
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,236
We're trapped. [grunts]

816
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,823
[bulls grunt]

817
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,159
[Po screams]

818
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,622
[speaking indistinctly]

819
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,666
It isn't much farther now.

820
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,335
You always say that,
and it's always so much farther.

821
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,465
Whoa. What is this place?

822
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,925
Home sweet home.

823
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,512
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

824
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,059
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

825
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,772
[Po] Uh-oh.

826
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,024
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

827
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,444
[snarling]

828
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,654
[Po screams]

829
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:49,738
Ooh!

830
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,906
[bunnies snarling]

831
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,659
[Po exclaiming]

832
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,162
Ow!

833
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,461
Oh! [giggling]

834
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,713
So you're friends
with all these people?

835
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,006
They're practically family.

836
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,340
Zhen!

837
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,384
[pipes rattling]

838
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,681
Oh! Is that really you?

839
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,142
Han, my old mentor.

840
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,103
I always knew someday you'll find your way
home back to the den.

841
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,563
And when you did…

842
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,193
…I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

843
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,527
Family, huh?

844
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,862
More like distant cousins.

845
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,780
All right. How should we do this?

846
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,950
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

847
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,370
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

848
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,123
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

849
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,666
-Hooray!
-Yay!

850
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,251
You really don't wanna do this.

851
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,336
And why is that?

852
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,588
Because if you so much as
lay one claw on me,

853
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,256
you're gonna have to answer to…

854
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,967
the Dragon Warrior.

855
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,595
[whispering] Warrior, warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior.

856
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,889
Who?

857
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,641
[crowd murmuring]

858
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,603
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

859
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,021
Introduce them, Po,

860
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,107
to your fists.

861
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,692
[crowd muttering]

862
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:16,367
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

863
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,369
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

864
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,246
Yes, now.

865
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,582
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifus
have differing opinions?

866
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,959
We are in total agreement…

867
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,961
…with our mutual disappointment…

868
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,128
[both] …in you.

869
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:30,965
Wait.

870
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,636
He who resorts to violence now…

871
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:40,182
will only find more violence later.

872
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,141
[crowd] Huh?

873
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,689
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen a little now…

874
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,649
We can hurt her a lot later.

875
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,484
What? No, that's not what I said.

876
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,530
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

877
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,907
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of--

878
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,325
-More violence!
-Hooray!

879
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,911
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

880
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,038
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

881
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,667
-I like it.
-[bunnies] Violence, violence, violence.

882
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,876
No, no, no! Wait!

883
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,961
Come back!

884
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,921
I'll come up with better wisdom.

885
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,882
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

886
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,928
-[Po] Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
-Nope.

887
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,763
[Po] The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

888
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,682
Those are both very common names.

889
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,475
-Mentored by Oogway?
-Sorry.

890
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,144
Trained by Master Shifu?

891
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,354
-Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
-Aha!

892
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,815
Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

893
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:30,858
But not you.

894
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,320
Did someone say "legendary"?
Bring it in.

895
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,698
Look, Han.

896
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,701
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

897
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,411
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

898
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,246
-Thank you.
-Don't drink that.

899
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,206
[sizzles]

900
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,710
Oh! [giggling]

901
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,838
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

902
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,381
And why should I help you?

903
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,051
Because deep down
beneath that iron-scaled exterior

904
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,552
is a good-hearted soul

905
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,471
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

906
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,640
Fine.

907
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:06,185
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

908
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,853
Sleep tight.

909
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,022
[Han chuckling]

910
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,193
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

911
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,778
After you get your pants back.

912
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,364
Not cool! You guys--

913
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,990
Come on! Give them back.

914
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,408
Those are custom.

915
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,577
[apes shrieking]

916
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,126
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

917
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,338
Oh! Oh, my tail. [grunts]

918
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,508
I'm sure everything is fine.

919
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,967
This is a restaurant.

920
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,970
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

921
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,222
You wait here.

922
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,101
Salutations!

923
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,687
I'm so sorry to interrupt. [chuckles]

924
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,146
I know you're having a good time,

925
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,818
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

926
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,861
There was a panda here.

927
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,613
You know him?

928
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,408
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

929
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,410
[quacking]

930
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,703
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

931
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,916
You need to pay
for what your son did to my tavern.

932
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,211
[glass shatters]

933
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,215
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

934
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,175
Is it possible your broth was bland?

935
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,552
Try it.

936
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,304
[exclaims] No, no!

937
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,306
The broth smells excellent.

938
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,060
You should not add a single thing,
especially not me!

939
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,603
[Li] Hands off the goose.

[tavern patrons gasping]

941
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,608
The panda's back.

942
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,068
-He's back?
-He's back?

943
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,153
No.

944
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,906
But you're about to wish he was,

945
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,367
'cause if you think he made a mess
of this place,

946
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,328
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

947
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,290
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

948
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,502
Except one thing.

949
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,045
Mercy.

950
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,758
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

951
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,597
Now, this can go one of two ways.

952
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,976
The easy way,
in which you tell me where he is,

953
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,060
or the hard way,

954
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,813
in which you tell me where he is,

955
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,773
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

956
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,150
because you have no teeth.

Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

Huh?

1005
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,276
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

1006
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,029
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

you really are a fox of your word.

Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

1011

It's supposed to remind me that every pit
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

1012
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,092
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

Are you sure you wanna do this?

1014

Never trust anyone.

Such potential.

1084

get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,410
Why?

1089
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:13,291
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

1090
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,335
I wanted respect and power.

1091
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,088
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

1092
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,172
Say what?

1093
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:22,759
I was turned away
from every training hall I went to.

1094
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:26,846
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

1095
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,058
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

1096
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:33,311
And so, I chose a different path.

1097
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,063
Sorcery.

1098
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,314
I grew.

1099
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,608
I excelled.

1100
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,445
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

1101
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,407
-Everything except kung fu.
-[roars]

1102
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,619
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

1103
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:54,874
You see, Po, kung fu may be
performed by the body,

1104
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,961
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

1105
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,588
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm--

1106
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,799
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

1107
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:06,386
His and those of every master villain
that came before me.

1108
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:11,307
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriors
to get through them.

And make sure it's never you.

it's the most important:

1171
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,076
[Po] So you followed me.

No, you followed
because you didn't believe in me.

And because we love?

1177
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,049
Well, you're right.

1178
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,510
I screwed up big-time.

1179
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,221
I trusted the wrong person.

1180
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,806
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

1181

Oh…

1182
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:46,814
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

[sighs]

1184
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:53,196
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

1185
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:56,783
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

1186
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,744
I was just so determined
to keep things the way they were.

1187
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:02,914
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

1188
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,541
Even me.

1189
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,418
There was a time not so long ago

1190
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:12,340
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the valley.

1191
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,800
So what happened?

1192
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,886
I became the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

1193
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,012
It's true.

1194
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,056
But I also became a father.

1195
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,893
And nothing…
nothing's ever been the same since.

1196
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,355
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

1197
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,942
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

1198
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,113
Because if things stayed the same forever,

1199
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,991
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

1200

He's right, Po.

I've become a bit of a warrior.

When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

That's all that panda was,
something to use.

Is that why you took me in?
So I could help you get what you wanted?

[chuckles] Zhen.

1217
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:32,045
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

1218
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,129
like me.

1219

And the day you stop being those things

1220

is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

don't change.

You're probably right.

But I have to try.

Get as far away from this place
as you can.

We are such terrible fathers.

1321

At least you didn't lie and betray him.

Well, that's true.
You're worse.

Uh, l-let's just give up.
Surrender.

Because…

1349
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,407

it might be too late

it's never too late to do the right thing.

01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,036
It's true.

1446
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:56,372
We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

1447
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,500
It's a shame only one of us can
come out on top.

1448
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:02,127
It is a shame, for you.

1449
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:07,091
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

1450
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:11,553
And once I dispense with you,
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to--

from here to the Valley of Peace

Yeah, I know.

But how did you know?

1455
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:22,356
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the Dragon Warrior…

1456
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:25,859
for now at least.

1457
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,446
But I've realized
that it's probably time I made a change.

1458

And so should you.

1459

I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

Real change happens from within.

1462
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,875
And if we're really as alike as you say,

1463
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,919
then maybe we could both let go
of who we were

1464
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:46,338

He's right.
What about me says I'm ready for this?

1615
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:33,091
Well, as I learned
from working in my dad's kitchen,

1616
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:37,679
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

Money can't buy happiness,
but it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

Why does it always come back
to dumplings with you?

You can't have your mooncake
and eat it too.
