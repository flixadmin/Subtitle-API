and yet, if I'm not mistaken,

192

it's covered in plastic
explosive residue.

Perhaps it was intended
to fly to someone specific

202

and not destroy the whole room.

for the Narrows is to burn it
to the ground, start over.

Garbage collectors found
her about an hour ago.

She lived with her boyfriend,
who was at work all night.

502
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:44,542
He told us that him and
Pennyworth got into it earlier.

503
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:47,078
Says that he was trying to keep
him separate from his girlfriend.

Says that he made advances
towards the victim.

505

According to him, Pennyworth got rough.

Rough?

- Come on.

Alfred lose his temper.

It's an SAS signet ring.

- You hit this girl?
- No.

519

How can you even ask that?
It was the boyfriend.

520
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:44,032
I mean, he beat her before, now
he's gone and bloody killed her.

521
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:46,604
- He says you were fighting with him.
- Because he beat her!

She was a friend.

Just a friend.

- He has an alibi.
