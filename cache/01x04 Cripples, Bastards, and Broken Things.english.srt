1
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,410
The little lord's
been dreaming again.

2
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,460
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

3
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,130
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

4
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,260
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

5
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,850
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

6
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,890
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

7
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,810
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,

8
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,940
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

9
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,110
Hodor!

10
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,700
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

11
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Hodor.

12
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,370
I must say I received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

13
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,090
Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

14
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,800
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

15
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,170
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

16
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,380
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

17
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,760
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

18
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,730
So it's true.

19
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,850
Hello, Bran.

20
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,270
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

21
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,820
He has no memory of that day.

22
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,490
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

23
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,660
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

24
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,240
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

25
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,630
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

26
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,840
Well, I mean I did like to.

27
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,420
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

28
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,630
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

29
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,680
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

30
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,760
My father will rejoice to hear it.

31
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,140
I have a gift for you.

32
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,180
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

33
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,560
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

34
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,030
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

35
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,160
- Will I really be able to ride?
- You will.

36
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,410
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

37
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,830
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

38
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,460
I have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

39
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,670
You've done my brother a kindness.

40
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,750
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

41
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,970
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

42
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,930
There I'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

43
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,690
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

44
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,310
If you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

45
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,360
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

46
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,780
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

47
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,950
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

48
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,290
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

49
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,120
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

50
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,040
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

51
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,670
M'lady?

52
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,590
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

53
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,670
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

55
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,720
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

56
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,520
- I believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

57
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,810
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

58
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,440
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

59
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,820
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

60
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,330
I suppose your father realized that
when your brothers died in battle.

61
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,750
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

62
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,710
- Careful, Imp.
- I've offended you.

63
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,040
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

64
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,050
Anyway, don't despair.

65
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,340
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

66
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,720
and I've learned to live with it.

67
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,640
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

68
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,810
I'll try not to wear her out.

69
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,070
Shoulder, legs.

70
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,030
Leg, shoulder, leg.

71
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,030
Left foot forward. Good.

72
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

73
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,670
What in seven hells is that?

74
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,300
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.

75
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,340
Tell them your name.

76
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,380
Samwell Tarly,

77
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,430
of Horn Hill...
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

78
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,140
I've come to take the black.

79
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,890
Come to take the black pudding.

80
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,890
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

81
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,940
Rast...

82
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,070
see what he can do.

83
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,830
I yield.

84
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,450
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

85
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,750
Pick up your sword.

86
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,500
Hit him till he finds his feet.

87
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,550
It seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

88
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,390
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

89
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,810
Again, harder.

90
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,400
- I yield!
- Enough!

91
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,440
He yielded.

92
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,070
Looks like the bastard's in love.

93
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,910
All right then, Lord Snow,

94
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,200
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

95
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,290
You two. Three of you
ought to be sufficient

96
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,620
to make lady piggy squeal.

97
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,710
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

98
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,760
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

99
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,020
Yield, yield, yield!
I yield.

100
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,610
We're done for today.
Go clean the armory.

101
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,410
That's all you're good for.

102
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,950
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

103
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,750
- Did he hurt you?
- I've had worse.

104
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,840
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

105
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,970
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

106
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,680
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

107
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,060
I wanted to.

108
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,940
- I just couldn't.
- Why not?

109
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,650
I'm a coward.

110
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,780
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

111
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,910
You're right. I'm sorry.

112
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,830
I just... wanted to thank you.

113
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,760
A bloody coward.

114
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,970
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

115
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,840
You're too stupid to be a coward.

116
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,890
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

117
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,850
before summer's over.

118
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,020
Come here!

119
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,760
Hyah, hyah!

120
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.

121
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,690
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

122
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,320
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

123
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,740
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- I'll call them what I like,

124
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,610
because they're my people.
This is my army.

125
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,740
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

126
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,510
If my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

127
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,190
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

128
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,060
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

129
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,400
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

130
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,070
But if they did?

131
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,610
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

132
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,320
but the men
advising him are different.

133
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,790
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

134
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,830
long ago.

135
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,290
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

136
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,670
He drove me from my land.

137
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,380
You sold slaves.

138
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,130
Aye.

139
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,060
- Why?
- I had no money

140
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,270
and an expensive wife.

141
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,140
And where is she now?

142
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,520
In another place,

143
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,860
with another man.

144
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,240
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

145
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,950
They call you the last dragon...

146
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,660
They do.

147
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,040
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

148
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,170
It's entirely possible.

149
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,760
What happened to the dragons?

150
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,930
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

151
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,970
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

152
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,520
The brave men rode them.

153
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,020
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

154
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,610
this world has ever seen.

155
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,070
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

156
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,070
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

157
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
The swords of the vanquished,

158
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,410
a thousand of them...

159
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,880
melted together
like so many candles.

160
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,970
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

161
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,600
There's nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

162
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,260
Really. Why dragons?

163
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,850
They can fly.

164
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,940
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

165
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,520
and they're somewhere else...

166
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,690
far away.

167
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,570
And they can kill.

168
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,780
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

169
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,460
gets burned away to nothing...

170
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,330
...melted...

171
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,250
like so many candles.

172
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,960
Ow.

173
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,930
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

174
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,050
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

175
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,760
I imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

176
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,680
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

177
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,480
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

178
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,480
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

179
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,480
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

180
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,320
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

181
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,030
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

182
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,580
and whose ship had
sails of colored silk.

183
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
So...

184
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,500
have you seen one?

185
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,630
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

186
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,680
No.

187
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,300
No, the last one died
many years before I was born.

188
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,470
I'll tell you what I have seen -

189
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,770
their skulls.

190
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,860
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

191
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,400
When I was very young,
just three or four,

192
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,030
my father used
to walk me down the rows

193
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,400
and I'd recite
their names for him.

194
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,200
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

195
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,200
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

196
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,870
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

197
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,500
But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

198
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,880
they got bigger

199
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,010
and bigger and bigger.

200
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,310
There was Ghiscar

201
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,890
and Valryon,

202
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,730
Vermithrax,

203
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,060
Essovius...

204
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,610
...Archonei,

205
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,030
Meraxes,

206
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,070
Vhagar...

207
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,790
and Balerion the Dread...

208
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,000
...whose fire forged
the Seven Kingdoms

209
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,170
into one.

210
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,010
What happened to the skulls?

211
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,600
I don't know.

212
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,970
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

213
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,940
Scattered to the wind.

214
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,820
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

215
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,280
What did I buy you for?

216
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,580
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

217
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,950
To, uh, teach your sister.

218
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,080
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

219
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,380
You think I bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

220
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,800
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

221
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,930
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

222
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,990
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

223
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,620
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

224
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,370
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

225
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,580
- What if I have a girl?
- Gods be good,

226
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,630
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

227
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,840
What if I only have girls?

228
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,840
I wouldn't worry about that.

229
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,090
Jeyne Poole's mother
had five children - all of them girls.

230
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,180
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

231
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,640
But what if?

232
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,020
Well, if you only had girls,

233
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,730
I suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

234
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,480
And everyone would hate me.

235
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,690
Nobody could ever hate you.

236
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,570
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

237
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,030
Why would you say such a thing?

238
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,950
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

239
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,000
I've told you
a hundred times -

240
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,040
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

241
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,250
Do you remember your lessons?

242
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,050
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

243
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,720
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

244
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,640
And how many years
did it take to build...

245
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,100
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

246
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,480
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

247
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,820
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

248
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,660
Why were they killed?

249
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,240
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

250
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,500
I don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

251
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,750
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

252
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,500
- to forgive your father.
- No, I won't.

253
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,010
It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

254
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,340
The King's Tournament.
I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

255
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,470
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

256
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,720
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

257
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,690
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

258
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,770
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

259
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,570
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

260
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,690
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

261
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,450
- I need more men.
- You'll get 50.

262
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,410
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

263
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,990
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

264
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

265
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,500
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

266
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,340
They will be put to good use.

267
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,510
The sooner this is over, the better.

268
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,340
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

269
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,600
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

270
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,480
And every inn
in the city is full

271
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,480
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

272
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,980
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

273
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,570
- Hmm.
- Now...

274
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,110
if there's nothing else, my lords?

275
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,910
Oh, this heat.

276
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,830
On days like this,
I envy you northerners,

277
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,750
your summer snows.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

278
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,510
I've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

279
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,340
Lord Arryn?

280
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,010
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

281
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,190
I took personal charge of his care,
but I could not save him.

282
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:40,030
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

283
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,650
I saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

284
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,620
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

285
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,410
I have been grand maester
for many years.

286
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,580
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

287
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,590
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

288
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,130
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

289
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,510
A book? What book?

290
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,970
Oh, I fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

291
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,560
A... A ponderous tome.

292
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,190
No, I'd like to read it.

293
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,570
The Lineages and Histories

294
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,860
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

295
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,990
with descriptions
of many high lords

296
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
and noble ladies

297
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,290
and their children.

298
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,970
Harkon Umber,
first of his name,

299
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,690
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

300
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,400
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

301
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,690
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

302
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,240
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

303
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,530
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

304
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,330
As I said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

305
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,040
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

306
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,000
He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

307
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,290
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

308
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,800
...did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

309
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,800
Nothing of import, my lord.

310
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,590
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

311
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,010
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

312
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,350
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mmm.

313
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,730
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

314
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,480
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

315
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,650
For all the weight they're given,

316
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,490
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

317
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,610
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

318
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
What else could it be?

319
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,870
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

320
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,290
No, no, no, I don't think it likely.

321
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,840
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

322
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,670
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

323
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,140
Yes, women, cravens...

324
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,930
and eunuchs.

325
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,230
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

326
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,520
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

327
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,360
How that sort of person
found himself

328
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,490
- on the king's council, I will never know.
- I've taken enough of your time.

329
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,530
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honor.

330
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,200
Thank you.

331
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,330
I'll find my own way out.

332
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,190
Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.

333
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,150
It's a hard fall down these steps.

334
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,570
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

335
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,320
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

336
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,790
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

337
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,870
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

338
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,040
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.

339
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,260
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

340
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,720
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

341
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,930
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

342
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,180
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

343
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,400
But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast

344
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,440
or sit on the king's council.

345
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,280
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

346
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,700
Can I be lord of a holdfast?

347
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,750
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

348
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,960
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

349
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,050
- Hmm?
- No.

350
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
That's not me.

351
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,700
Hello.

352
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,790
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new watch partner.

353
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,090
I should warn you,

354
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,590
I don't see all that well.

355
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,590
Come stand by the fire.

356
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,850
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

357
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,640
You're not. You're freezing.

358
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,410
I don't like high places.

359
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,370
You can't fight. You can't see.

360
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,910
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

361
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,960
What are you doing here, Sam?

362
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,220
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

363
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,720
"You're almost a man now," he said.

364
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,060
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

365
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,690
"Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

366
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,190
"forsake all claim
to your inheritance and start north.

367
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,530
"If you do not," he said,

368
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,030
"then we'll have a hunt

369
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,240
"and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

370
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,160
"and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

371
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,370
"Or so I'll tell your mother.

372
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,880
"Nothing would please me more. "

373
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,590
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

374
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,600
Yes, he is.

375
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,270
I'm not going to get
any better, you know.

376
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,600
Well...

377
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,440
you can't get any worse.

378
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,370
I hear you're reading a boring book.

379
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,200
Hmph.

380
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,000
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

381
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,460
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

382
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,050
Not surprising.

383
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,670
Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

384
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,010
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

385
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Knighted for what?

386
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,730
- Why are you telling me this?
- I promised Cat that I'd help you.

387
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,100
Where is Ser Hugh?

388
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,900
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

389
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,490
Do you see that boy there?

390
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,150
One of Varys's little birds.

391
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,820
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

392
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,870
Now look there.

393
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,830
That one belongs to the queen.

394
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,170
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

395
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,380
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

396
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,220
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

397
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,810
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

398
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:56,190
Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.

399
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,820
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

400
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,940
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.

401
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,910
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

402
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,450
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

403
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,870
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

404
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,080
visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.

405
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,540
Lord Baelish, perhaps
I was wrong to distrust you.

406
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,050
Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed off your horse.

407
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,720
...22, 23,

408
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,650
24, 5, 6, 27,

409
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,480
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

410
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,610
30, 31, 32...

411
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,900
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

412
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.

413
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,830
- I'm the captain of his guard.
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...

414
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,040
- No "ser". I'm not a knight.
- I see.

415
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,830
Well, it just so happens that I am.

416
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,920
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

417
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,220
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

418
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,810
They strut around
like roosters down here.

419
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,810
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

420
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,640
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

421
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,150
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

422
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,450
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

423
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,530
I regret to say he did not honor me
with his patronage.

424
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,040
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

425
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,330
- I'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

426
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,330
Gendry!

427
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,420
Here he is.

428
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,510
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

429
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,470
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

430
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,030
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

431
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,070
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

432
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,580
- If his lordship wants the helmet...
- I made it for me.

433
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,370
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

434
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,000
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

435
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,000
He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.

436
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,130
What kind of questions?

437
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,220
About my work at first,

438
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,430
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

439
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,390
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

440
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,980
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

441
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,400
What did you tell him?

442
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,610
She died when I was little.

443
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,570
She had yellow hair.

444
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,820
She'd sing to me sometimes.

445
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,830
Look at me.

446
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,510
Get back to work, lad.

447
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,640
If the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

448
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,140
you send him to me.

449
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,610
Find anything?

450
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,860
King Robert's bastard son.

451
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,570
He likes that.

452
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,040
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

453
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,200
Should I leave it with...

454
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,920
Shhh. Listen.

455
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,590
Do you hear them?

456
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,380
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

457
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,970
- Guess.
- Three.

458
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,140
Four.

459
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,430
He likes to do this when I'm on duty.

460
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,600
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

461
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,530
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do I have to forgive you?

462
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,070
Have you wronged me?

463
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:21,370
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

464
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,120
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

465
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,960
Ah.

466
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,000
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

467
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,300
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

468
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,220
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

469
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,590
They stopped liking it at the end.

470
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,930
That was a proper battle.

471
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,270
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

472
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,400
With his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.

473
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,650
I saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

474
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,440
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

475
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,910
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- I doubt it.

476
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,330
I'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

477
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,290
Let me smell it. Come here.

478
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,800
Can I leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

479
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,130
I don't serve Lord Stark.

480
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,740
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

481
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,160
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

482
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,120
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

483
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,000
Impossible!

484
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,170
That's enough.

485
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,300
Sam's no different from the rest of us.

486
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,890
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

487
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,470
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

488
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,310
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

489
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,850
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

490
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,520
You are in love, Lord Snow.

491
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,860
You girls can do as you please.

492
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,740
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

493
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,870
I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

494
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,720
No one touches Sam.

495
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,200
What are you waiting for?

496
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,130
Attack him!

497
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,680
You get in there.

498
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,100
Hit me.

499
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,440
Go on, hit me!

500
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,990
I yield!

501
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,990
Yield. Yield.

502
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,200
I yield.

503
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,580
You think this is funny, do you?

504
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:01,010
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

505
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,840
do you want a man at your back?

506
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,300
Or a sniveling boy?

507
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,360
You send this whore
to give me commands?

508
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,070
I should have sent you back her head!

509
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,450
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

510
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,580
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

511
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,870
Yes, Khaleesi.

512
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,080
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

513
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,960
- You do not command me.
- I wasn't commanding you.

514
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,670
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

515
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,930
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

516
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,680
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

517
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,600
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

518
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,140
This stinks of manure. All of it.

519
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,140
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

520
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,730
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

521
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,480
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

522
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:05,320
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

523
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,120
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

524
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,380
I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

525
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,550
I am the wife of the great khal
and I carry his son inside me.

526
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,390
The next time you raise a hand to me

527
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,600
will be the last time you have hands.

528
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,770
I know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

529
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,280
I wouldn't doubt it.

530
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,570
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

531
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,780
Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?

532
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,290
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

533
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,750
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

534
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,460
- It's absurd.
- I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

535
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,300
Why not?

536
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,220
Because I'm fat?

537
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,720
- No.
- But I like girls just as much as you do.

538
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,430
They might not like me as much.

539
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,600
I've never... been with one.

540
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,520
You've probably had hundreds.

541
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,650
No.

542
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,700
As a matter of fact,

543
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,370
I'm the same as you.

544
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,490
Yeah. Yeah, I...

545
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,330
I find that hard to believe.

546
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,960
I came very close once.

547
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,170
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

548
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,550
- Didn't know where to put it?
- I know where to put it.

549
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,510
Was she...

550
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,720
old and ugly?

551
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,470
Young and gorgeous.

552
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,970
A whore named Ros.

553
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,100
What color hair?

554
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,900
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

555
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,900
And her, um...

556
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,690
Her...

557
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,360
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

558
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,200
- Better.
- Oh, no.

559
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:21,410
So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

560
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,880
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

561
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,960
And why is my surname Snow?

562
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,970
Because...

563
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,470
you're a bastard from the North.

564
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,810
I never met my mother.

565
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,600
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

566
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,900
I don't know if she's living or dead.

567
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,360
I don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

568
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
or a whore.

569
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,740
So I sat there

570
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:03,080
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

571
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,710
But I couldn't do it.

572
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,210
Because all I could think was
what if I got her pregnant

573
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,340
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

574
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,730
It's not a good life for a child.

575
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,940
Ah, mmm.

576
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,230
So...

577
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,990
you didn't know where to put it?

578
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,830
Enjoying yourselves?

579
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,790
You look cold, boys.

580
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,790
It is a bit nippy.

581
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,750
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

582
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,800
indoors.

583
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,630
It's still summer.

584
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,510
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

585
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,470
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

586
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,060
I remember.

587
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,650
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

588
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,730
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

589
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,150
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

590
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,110
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

591
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,280
I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

592
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,160
during the last winter.

593
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,120
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

594
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,500
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

595
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,420
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

596
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,130
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

597
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,800
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

598
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,010
Harder than you'll ever be.

599
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,640
They know their country
better than we do.

600
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,230
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

601
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,810
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

602
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,400
And we got caught in the open.

603
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,320
Wind so strong

604
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,490
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

605
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,330
If you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,

606
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,500
you lost a finger to the frost.

607
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,420
And all in darkness.

608
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,090
You don't know cold.

609
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,130
Neither of you do.

610
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,970
The horses died first.

611
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,680
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

612
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,980
Eating the horses was easy.

613
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,030
But later when we started to fall...

614
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
That wasn't easy.

615
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,870
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

616
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,080
Soft, fat boys like you.

617
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,130
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

618
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,760
Soon we'll have new recruits

619
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,140
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

620
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,180
for assignment,

621
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:14,810
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

622
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,570
but you'd be fools to believe it.

623
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,110
You're boys still.

624
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,860
And come the winter you will die...

625
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,330
like flies.

626
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,960
I hit him.

627
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,420
I hit the dragon.

628
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,840
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

629
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,510
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

630
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,760
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

631
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,850
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

632
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,390
No.

633
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,520
But the common people
are waiting for him.

634
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,940
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

635
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,740
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

636
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,160
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

637
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,910
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

638
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,290
Home.

639
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,670
I pray for home too.

640
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,130
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

641
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,640
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

642
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,900
He'll never take us home.

643
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,000
Lovers' quarrel?

644
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,540
I'm sorry. Do I...?

645
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,090
Sansa dear,
this is Lord Baelish.

646
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,340
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

647
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,390
I've known your mother a long, long time.

648
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,640
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

649
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,560
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

650
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,810
When I was a child, I was very small,

651
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,020
and I come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

652
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,280
so you see,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

653
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,070
I've been sitting here for days!

654
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,700
Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!

655
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,080
Gods, who's that?

656
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,550
Ser Gregor Clegane.

657
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,550
They call him the Mountain.

658
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,840
The Hound's older brother.

659
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,140
- And his opponent?
- Ser Hugh of the Vale.

660
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,100
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

661
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,770
Look how far he's come.

662
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:02,150
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!

663
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,150
Not what you were expecting?

664
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,280
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

665
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,030
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

666
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,700
The Hound was just a pup,

667
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,960
six years old maybe.

668
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,080
Gregor a few years older,

669
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,960
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

670
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:53,970
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

671
00:48:54,090 --> 00:49:00,220
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

672
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,640
Gregor's toy,

673
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,400
a wooden knight.

674
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,400
Gregor never said a word,

675
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,480
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

676
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,900
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

677
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,660
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

678
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,910
while his face melted.

679
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,040
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

680
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,760
- I won't tell anyone. I promise.
- No, please don't.

681
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,090
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

682
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,550
I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

683
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,400
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

684
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,160
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

685
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,500
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

686
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,420
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us -

687
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,130
the ugliness with the wolves.

688
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,970
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

689
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,760
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

690
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,770
How is Sansa?

691
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,770
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

692
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,820
Favors her mother,
not much of the North in her.

693
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,610
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

694
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,820
What is it you hope to accomplish?

695
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,780
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

696
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,240
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

697
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:46,040
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

698
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,790
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

699
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,670
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

700
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,380
If that's my job, then so be it.

701
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,340
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

702
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:02,100
You take your orders
and you carry on.

703
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,140
I suppose it makes sense.

704
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,270
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

705
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,480
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

706
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,230
As was I.

707
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,170
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

708
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,090
And to you.

709
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,340
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

710
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,890
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
I'm starving.

711
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,560
- A song while we wait or?
- I'd rather throw myself down a well.

712
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,270
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

713
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,400
The only music the northerners know
is the howling of wolves!

714
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,070
Gods.

715
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,740
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

716
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,650
- Every room.
- My men can sleep in the stable.

717
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,910
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

718
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:10,000
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing I can do...

719
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,460
...to remedy this?

720
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,880
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

721
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,220
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

722
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,260
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!

723
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,930
Might I entertain you while you eat?

724
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,810
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

725
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,520
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

726
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,770
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.

727
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,280
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

728
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,190
Lady Stark!

729
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,790
I was still Catelyn Tully
the last time I stayed here.

730
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,420
You, ser.

731
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:03,590
Is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

732
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,220
It is, my lady.

733
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,010
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

734
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,140
to my father,
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

735
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,770
She is.

736
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,360
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

737
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,740
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

738
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,450
Our lord is honored by his trust.

739
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,490
I envy your father
all his fine friends, Lady Stark,

740
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,120
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

741
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,580
I know your sigil as well -

742
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,500
the twin towers of Frey.

743
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,760
How fares your lord, ser?

744
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,300
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

745
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,010
He has asked your father for the honor
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

746
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,310
- He plans to take another wife.
- Ha!

747
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,860
This man...

748
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,940
came into my house as a guest

749
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:07,950
and there conspired
to murder my son.

750
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,330
A boy of 10.

751
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,250
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

752
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,170
I call upon you to seize him

753
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,670
and help me return him to Winterfell

754
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,090
to await the king's justice.
