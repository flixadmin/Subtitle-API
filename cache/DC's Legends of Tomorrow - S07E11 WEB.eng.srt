1
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:17,484
Archduke Ferdinand is still alive!

2
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:19,654
World War I never happened!

3
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:21,664
That's 20 million lives saved!

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,883
Drinks are on the house.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,667
Couple of stouts?

6
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,303
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No thank you. Nope.

7
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,870
- I'm too nervous to drink.
- Nervous?

8
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:31,740
Sara Lance did it.
She changed a Fixed Point!

9
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:33,675
Yes, but she and our
companions are about to

10
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,010
go into battle with an Evil Waverider

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,712
and some extremely formidable
Time Correctors.

12
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,480
Well, not unless
we kick their asses first.

13
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:41,750
I'm not gonna let some fascist time cops

14
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,752
tell me how history should be.

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,753
- Let's go, yeah!
- Yeah!

16
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,555
What have I done?

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,257
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

18
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:50,993
This is our battle, not yours.

19
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,928
Trust me now. This is not an enemy

20
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,552
that you want to be
going up against now.

21
00:00:57,589 --> 00:00:59,034
- No, no, no, no...
- No, no, no.

22
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,901
I am terribly sorry, Legends.

23
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:02,070
I inadvertently ran my mouth,

24
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:03,438
and now all of our patrons
are headed your way

25
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,806
to assist in the attack.

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,042
I sincerely hope I haven't
ruined the offensive.

27
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,845
Gideon, it's all right.
It's not your fault.

28
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,913
We're just gonna have to
take the Waverider quickly.

29
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:13,381
All right, Cap. What's the plan?

30
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:15,450
When the Robos exit
to restore the timeline,

31
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:17,552
we'll ambush and seize the Waverider.

32
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,254
So we just take Evil Gideon offline,

33
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,662
and then the Waverider's ours.

34
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:23,667
Goodbye, robots.
Goodbye, janky time travel.

35
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,123
I wonder who they're copies of.

36
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:27,456
I hope it's not an army of Hoovers.

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,493
Robos are Robos... doesn't
matter what they look like.

38
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:30,498
We're taking them down.

39
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:32,067
Damn right, Astra.

40
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,554
There's no one the Legends can't beat.

41
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,704
Son of a...

42
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:58,225
That's who Evil Gideon sent to kill us?

43
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:00,493
We really are our own worst enemy.

44
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:03,396
All right, we're wasting time.
Should we attack?

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,131
No, they could use
the Waverider as cover.

46
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:07,886
We need to find something
to draw them away.

47
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,042
It's a trap. Miss Cruz and Mr. Green,

48
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,644
stay on the ship and
help locate the Legends.

49
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,979
The rest of you, eliminate
every Time Traveler

50
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,200
and restore the timeline.

51
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:28,674
What the...

52
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:35,481
- No!
- Damn it.

53
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:47,839
No.

54
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,875
Robo-Me is steel with normal skin.

55
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,744
And he has giant arms?

56
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:54,179
I mean, come on. Pick one.
The ego on me...

57
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:56,148
I mean, he's clearly over-compensating.

58
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:57,383
Oh, no, no.

59
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,640
He's really filling out those pants.

60
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:04,956
You heard Gideon.

61
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,560
Let's kill these time-traveling losers.

62
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:09,947
Steel Punch!

63
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,986
Oh my God.

64
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:31,216
I'm a monster.

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,141
- Wai... Wait!
- Behrad!

66
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:38,642
Stop killing people!

67
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:43,748
Gideon, we found them.

68
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,733
All right, let's draw them away.

69
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:50,224
Come on, go. Run! Go!

70
00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:56,474
- Okay, come on.
- I'm fine.

71
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:59,029
- Seriously, I'm fine.
- Okay...

72
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,500
We need to get her outta here.

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,219
Get Ava to the Fixed Point.

74
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:08,839
Nate and I will buy you some time. Go.

75
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,976
This way.

76
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:18,529
Halt your pursuit.

77
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:19,797
Aw, come on Gideon.

78
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:22,132
I can't wait to kill that
puny-armed version of me.

79
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:23,668
Believe it or not, Captain Heywood,

80
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,403
but the Legends are
merely distracting you.

81
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:26,871
The epicenter of this aberration

82
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:29,929
is Archduke Ferdinand,
who is still alive.

83
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:43,788
Did they stop following us?

84
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:45,390
But that doesn't make sense.

85
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,725
What's more important than stopping us?

86
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,626
Well, we did delay
the start of World War I,

87
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,327
but you said Thawne was gonna
take care of that, right?

88
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,829
Yeah, but they don't know that.

89
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:54,732
They've been targeting Time Travelers...

90
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,033
I have to warn Thawne.

91
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:57,757
I'll meet you at the Fixed Point.

92
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,608
In a moment, the archduke
and his wife will pass by.

93
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:07,177
Princip, you must do

94
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,498
what the other members
of the Black Hand could not.

95
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:19,323
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you can't be here.

96
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:21,244
He's got a weapon!

97
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,117
The archduke!

98
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:02,766
World War I is back on track.

99
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,735
I hope you did what you needed to do.

100
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,424
I haven't seen that outfit in ages.

101
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,479
At least her outfit

102
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:18,000
doesn't have a hole in it.

103
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,622
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Come on, sit down over here.

104
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,376
Let's take this coat off, now, shall we?

105
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:39,524
Like shootin' fish in a barrel.

106
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,313
Thawne!

107
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,060
Hey. All right.

108
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,595
I'm gonna get help. You just hold on.

109
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,631
It's too late.

110
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,833
Thawne, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:12,720
This...

112
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,408
...is yours now.

113
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:20,042
Hey.

114
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,129
Hey.

115
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:07,205
How's Ava?

116
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,540
Oh, Miss Lance. Yes, uh, well,

117
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:10,209
I used some vodka
to disinfect the wound,

118
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:13,445
and then she ingested
even more to numb her pain.

119
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,501
But by the grace of God,
she will be fine.

120
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:21,052
Okay, so...

121
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,921
here's the situation.

122
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:25,557
Our stealth plan has gone to hell.

123
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:28,726
The Waverider's in the air,
the Robo-Legends are after us,

124
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,351
and the Time Travelers
are all gone or dead.

125
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,251
Thawne is dead as well.

126
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,501
What about the timeline?

127
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:41,438
Let's just focus
on the immediate problem:

128
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:43,774
The Robos.

129
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,509
Now, unless someone has a better idea,

130
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,111
here's my crazy one.

131
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,146
I wanna talk to them.

132
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,548
You want to... talk to them?

133
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,917
Look, they wanna protect the timeline.

134
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,654
We wanna go home.
We both want the same thing.

135
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:59,590
So if I could just explain it to them

136
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:01,658
in terms they can understand...

137
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:03,961
I think it's a risk worth taking.

138
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:05,997
And I'd like to be here to assist.

139
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:08,566
You're waiting in the Manor.

140
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,701
Look, I appreciate that, Gideon,

141
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:13,337
but you all need to wait in the Manor

142
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,429
in case this plan goes south.

143
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:22,213
Hey, babe. Are you feeling okay?

144
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:24,881
Ow, just, uh,

145
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,717
just... just promise you'll be careful.

146
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,118
I will.

147
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,342
Get some rest, okay?

148
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:46,469
Robo-Legends, this is Sara Lance.

149
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,771
How did you losers access our comms?

150
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:52,775
I, uh, tried a bunch
of different channels.

151
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,964
Giving up. Smart.

152
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:59,049
No, actually, I wanna talk. No fighting.

153
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:02,774
Meet me at the tavern where they
plotted to kill the archduke.

154
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,908
No fighting?

155
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:10,197
They're pathetic.

156
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,905
I can't let you do this alone.

157
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,607
At a parley, you must have a second.

158
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,141
We already had this conversation.

159
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,810
But I insist. You see,

160
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,412
soldiers don't go
on missions by themselves.

161
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:24,148
They stick together.
It's part of the discipline

162
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,515
- and the rules of war.
- Your rules have gone

163
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,783
out the window, all right?

164
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,805
I need you to get back
to the Manor... please.

165
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,494
Just go.

166
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:40,615
Out, peasants!

167
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:48,590
Where's your captain?

168
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,342
I'm the captain, flesh bag.

169
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,378
Well, that's a choice.

170
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:58,714
Look, all this violence,
it's unnecessary.

171
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,950
We both want the same thing:

172
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,470
To protect the timeline.

173
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:05,487
Is that why you saved the archduke?

174
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,921
That was to lure the Waverider.

175
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,690
We had a plan to put history back,

176
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,892
which is why you shouldn't
have killed Thawne.

177
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,628
Well, our orders were to kill
all Time Travelers here,

178
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:14,663
including you.

179
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,099
We don't even wanna be here.
We wanna go home.

180
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:18,867
So let's just come to an agreement

181
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,436
so no one else has to die.

182
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,903
Your lectures are the worst.

183
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:23,338
Well, you were modeled after us.

184
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:24,962
We're nothing like you!

185
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:28,343
You guys are pathetic losers
who ruin everything.

186
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,078
Were you programmed to be this annoying,

187
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,581
or is that a personal choice?

188
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:35,850
We have one job, and that's
to protect the timeline.

189
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,719
And kill anyone who messes with it.

190
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,288
So I guess we have two jobs.

191
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:42,457
That's why we have
to kill you, your team,

192
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,493
and your wife.

193
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:47,215
Right here, right now.

194
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,667
Then I guess there will be fighting.

195
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,902
But I have to warn you,
I'm not that easy to kill.

196
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,738
Oh, 'cause of your
invincibility?

197
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:59,840
You know how I'm gonna torture you?

198
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:02,843
I'm gonna kill you over
and over and over again

199
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,413
until you give me your team's location.

200
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:07,103
Bye. Haaah...

201
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,586
Nice try.

202
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,554
Why am I talking like this?

203
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:15,690
Whatever. It sounds wonderful.

204
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:16,809
Here we go!

205
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,705
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

206
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,373
Calm down, Gwyn. Calm down.

207
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:35,742
Calm down... you just need to
focus on your breathing.

208
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,677
Okay, okay, okay.

209
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,498
Hey, it's okay.

210
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,902
It's gonna be okay.

211
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:49,055
How am I gonna kill you next?

212
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,590
Decapitation?

213
00:12:50,614 --> 00:12:54,012
That'd be fantastic to be
able to rip off your head.

214
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:01,901
Gideon.

215
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:03,089
Hang on.

216
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,847
Gideon,

217
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,182
she got away.

218
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,018
These Legends are like cocka-roaches.

219
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,786
But don't worry.

220
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,635
I'm the exterminator.

221
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:24,055
What are we gonna do?

222
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,992
We can't reason with them.
We can't fight with them.

223
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,694
What am I gonna tell the others?

224
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:30,162
That you tried to negotiate with them,

225
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,897
and that they tried to kill you.

226
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:34,166
That you fought honorably,
and they fought dishonorably.

227
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,101
And therefore, you were
under no obligation

228
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,169
to fight with honor.

229
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:40,006
Honorably or dishonorably,
we still can't beat them.

230
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,695
In war, a soldier is only
ever as good as his general.

231
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,877
Even in the darkest of times,

232
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:48,480
it is the general's job
to be a beacon of light.

233
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,515
We are the Legends, not the military.

234
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,751
But it's all the same! Don't you see?

235
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:57,961
I was a lost, lonely, and broken man.

236
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,263
But with your help,

237
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:02,622
I was able to-to-to
rebuild myself back up.

238
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,255
We are in the valley
of the shadow of death.

239
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,636
But we will get through this,

240
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,639
and we will defeat
those wretched machines.

241
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:17,209
I believe in you, Miss Lance.

242
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:20,345
Like you believed in me.

243
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:23,603
And you will figure out
what we ought to do here.

244
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:28,019
What would you do?

245
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:29,754
Who, me?

246
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:32,122
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm no leader.

247
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:34,992
- You are.
- But you were a soldier.

248
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:37,362
With more wartime experience
than any of us.

249
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:41,591
So against a dishonorable foe
like that, what would you do?

250
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,410
It is perilous for us

251
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,312
to engage in any adversary
this lethal, head on.

252
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:58,416
The only way to defeat them is
to never confront them directly

253
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,285
and to play dirty if we have to.

254
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,620
Fighting dirty's up my alley,

255
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:04,689
but avoiding them like cowards is not.

256
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:07,191
Yeah, we must play to our
strengths, Miss Logue.

257
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:09,626
You see, theirs is brawn.
Ours is brains.

258
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,997
We cannot out-punch them,
but we will out-think them.

259
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:16,167
Now, our objective
is to infiltrate their base,

260
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,573
and overthrow their general.

261
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:19,608
Quick question:

262
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,838
How are we supposed
to infiltrate the Waverider

263
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,374
if it's both cloaked and flying?

264
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:25,175
Excellent observation, Dr. Heywood.

265
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,812
And in order to circumnavigate
this here obstacle,

266
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:31,201
we shall deploy a spy.

267
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,420
Excellent.

268
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:37,955
Oh, don't forget this.

269
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,290
A gun. Great.

270
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,159
Now, as soon as you board the Waverider,

271
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:43,161
you will need to disable Evil Gideon.

272
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,795
You see, shutting her down

273
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,864
means that the machines
use their general.

274
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:48,832
Ah, without Evil Gideon
calling the shots,

275
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:50,199
the Robo-Legends should fall apart.

276
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:53,237
From your mouth to God's ears, my boy.

277
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:54,405
I really gotta do this alone?

278
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:56,407
You're never alone, my boy. Never alone.

279
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:58,375
You will be accompanied with a team,

280
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,077
hidden in the key, mind you,
because if anybody sees them...

281
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,778
- We're screwed.
- Exactly.

282
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,847
Now, as soon as Evil Gideon is offline,

283
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:05,982
you'll need to land the Waverider

284
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,317
so the rest of us can board.

285
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,919
Hey! What do you need us to do?

286
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:12,322
Well, a-a-as the most
experienced fighters,

287
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,757
you will distract the machines

288
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:16,360
by causing a ruckus in Sarajevo.

289
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,862
Ruckus... can you, uh,
describe this ruckus?

290
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,997
A ruckus that will create
time aberrations

291
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,166
for them to deal with, you see.

292
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,767
Okay, so by aberrations you mean like

293
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,070
telling them to put
a man on the moon in 1969?

294
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:27,571
Good God, do we?

295
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:29,173
And what was his crime, I wonder.

296
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,208
- All right.
- Got this.

297
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:32,276
I don't think I can do this.

298
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,211
Nonsense, you are more
than capable, my boy.

299
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:35,813
By pretending to be a psychopath?

300
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:37,915
No, listen to me.

301
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:39,905
Now, I would not have
devised this mission

302
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:43,096
if I didn't believe in you, my boy.

303
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,345
Gideon, I'm gonna need
an immediate evac.

304
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:48,833
They're gonna mine me for parts.

305
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:13,604
Oh, hey.

306
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:15,509
Hey? You think we're stupid?

307
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,830
We heard everything.

308
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,803
You heard everything?

309
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,972
_

310
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:36,541
"Gideon, I need an immediate evac"?

311
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:38,410
I was gonna put a bullet
in your sorry head

312
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,578
to end your misery, but then I saw you

313
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,312
mow down those Time Travelers,

314
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:43,914
and that was pretty cool.

315
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,751
Yeah, I slaughtered
those innocent people.

316
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,453
Their relatives are definitely
mourning them right now.

317
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:51,822
I'm so jealous.

318
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:53,991
Now hopefully, Gideon will let us out,

319
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,392
and we can kill Legends.

320
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,193
Or maybe some will sneak
onto the Waverider,

321
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:59,630
and we can shut down the oxygen
and watch them die slowly,

322
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,551
and then Gary can eat them.

323
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,003
No, but seriously.

324
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:09,238
I need to catch up to your kill count.

325
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,062
What are you at now?

326
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, uh, can't remember.

327
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,515
Can't remember?

328
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:22,618
How many Time Travelers did you kill?

329
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,820
Six...

330
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:24,987
teen.

331
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,022
16?

332
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:28,113
_

333
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,895
Yeah, go see Dr. Sharpe
and get upgraded.

334
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,497
Good idea.

335
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,555
I'll do that now.

336
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,583
What are you doing here?

337
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:58,812
Just gonna get my upgrade
from Dr. Sharpe.

338
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:00,889
She in there?

339
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:02,491
Of course not, you idiot.

340
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:04,893
You know I'm the only one
who interfaces with Gideon.

341
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,295
Obviously.

342
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,629
You tool bag.

343
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:08,930
Need any help?

344
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:12,190
What do you know about computers?

345
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,171
Just that they keep
track of my kill count.

346
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:18,607
Did you see me massacre
those Time Travelers?

347
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:22,836
It was like... shootin'
fish in a barrel.

348
00:19:24,202 --> 00:19:25,769
Proud of you.

349
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:31,605
See you after your upgrade.

350
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,899
I am going to need
a year-long cleanse after this.

351
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,001
Okay.

352
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:49,092
Huh, they replaced the toilet.

353
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,195
Oh, perfect.

354
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,013
Oh, thank God. Did you
shut down Evil Gidget?

355
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,314
Not even close.

356
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:01,282
In fact, the only person
allowed access to her

357
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:02,482
is Robo-You.

358
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:03,717
There's a Robo-Me?

359
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,152
I'm pretty sure it's impossible

360
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:06,820
to duplicate this
perfect bone structure.

361
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:09,557
Sure, but you're still gonna
have to impersonate her.

362
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:13,193
Oh, my agents warned me
against playing villains.

363
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,195
But I will make an exception.

364
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:17,465
What does, um, my Robo-Self look like?

365
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:20,100
Um, a '90s hacker?

366
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:21,501
Hmm, very cliché.

367
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:23,938
But I can work with it.

368
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:25,238
So get this:

369
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:27,274
Not only do I have to play a psychopath,

370
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:30,110
the Robos keep telling me
I need to go see Dr. Sharpe

371
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:31,211
and get upgraded.

372
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,313
Just play dumb.

373
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:34,848
It took the Legends years
to realize I was an alien.

374
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:36,249
But even if I do that,

375
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:38,218
the only blind spot is in the bathroom.

376
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:41,387
How do I convince Robo-Zari to
go there so we can take her out?

377
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:43,522
Well, Dr. Davies told us to fight dirty,

378
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,959
so maybe you don't convince her.

379
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:49,062
Gideon, that's genius!

380
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,030
Do you have a spell or potion

381
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:52,665
that makes people go to the bathroom?

382
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,133
- No.
- I do.

383
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:58,036
Uh, it's like a... more
of a food-poisoning potion.

384
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,872
So I have no idea what end
it'll come out of.

385
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:02,108
Ooh! I would love to assist
with this ruse.

386
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:03,643
I can hide in the bathroom, or I can...

387
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,110
Gideon, stop asking to go out.

388
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:06,145
But I know the Waverider better...

389
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,179
Enough!

390
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,082
You are not leaving the Manor.

391
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:11,069
Go and help Ava.

392
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:15,954
Is everything okay?

393
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:17,242
It's fine.

394
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,331
He taught us twos and ones
and ones and twos

395
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:28,133
when it comes to planning your battle

396
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:31,236
and executing it perfectly with
the disciplines of the war.

397
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,904
Oh no, no, no, no.

398
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,005
What are you doing back here?

399
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,806
You see, you're supposed to be
out there causing a ruckus

400
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,008
to distract the machines.

401
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:38,709
Dude, we've been trying.

402
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,143
Yeah, I've been doing
the Macarena for like an hour

403
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,112
out there, and everyone just
looks at me like I'm crazy.

404
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,482
Yeah, and who knew it would be so hard

405
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,251
to introduce the high-five?

406
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,285
Dude, I don't think
this plan's gonna work.

407
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,621
Dr. Heywood, I do believe you are right.

408
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:52,990
You all just seem like a bunch
of raving lunatics to me.

409
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:54,626
Damn it!

410
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,228
See, we're never gonna be able
to board the Waverider

411
00:21:57,252 --> 00:21:59,096
unless we get the Waverider to land.

412
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,166
And it's not
going to be able to land

413
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,069
unless we can draw out two more
of those dastardly machines.

414
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:07,772
Gwyn, you are from this time period.

415
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:09,807
What would you do to cause a ruckus?

416
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:11,662
I don't know.

417
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:16,466
I do believe I have an idea.

418
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,690
Hey, you guys wanna see my fish?

419
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,711
Come check it out!
Come close. Come see it.

420
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:32,348
Yep!

421
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,323
Hey.

422
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:43,373
Who's Darth Vader?

423
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:46,061
Eh, probably American thing.

424
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,389
Damn, aberrations are everywhere.

425
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,924
This is the work of the Legends.

426
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,826
Go help Captain Heywood
restore the timeline,

427
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,194
and eliminate them.

428
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,130
Finally.

429
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:43,233
I bet I can fix more aberrations
and kill more Legends than you.

430
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,068
One hour.

431
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,270
Loser gets to clean all
the guns in the armory.

432
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:48,593
_

433
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,307
Yes!

434
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:55,144
That's two more machines
off the Waverider.

435
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,045
It's up to you now, my boy.

436
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,132
Copy that.

437
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,252
You need to come with us, Behrad.

438
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,139
It's time for your upgrade.

439
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,042
You want a power shot before my upgrade?

440
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:25,654
Sure.

441
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,824
I suppose I could use a boost.

442
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,807
I came up with a killer hack

443
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:36,276
that makes you feel totally energized.

444
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,978
What makes your hack so killer?

445
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:41,834
My own creatine mix.

446
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:50,056
You're not having one?

447
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,444
I already had like, three.

448
00:25:00,423 --> 00:25:02,834
Hmm. This shot's amazing.

449
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:05,089
I can feel the creatine
coursing through me.

450
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,341
Dr. Sharpe, you can...

451
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:12,129
take Behrad to the infirmary
by yourself, right?

452
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:17,283
Let's go.

453
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,453
Actually...

454
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:24,456
you can strap yourself in
for your upgrade.

455
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,525
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

456
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:28,527
Sure, no problem.

457
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:30,347
Make that ten minutes.

458
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:42,326
- Astra, are you okay...
- Bathroom.

459
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:50,234
- Dr. Sharpe, what is...
- No, no, no. Bathroom.

460
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:59,324
No, no, no, no! I was here first.

461
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:02,215
Why don't you just puke in the sink?

462
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:07,187
Showtime.

463
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:11,669
- Gary?
- What the hell did you do

464
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:13,040
with the bathroom?

465
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,464
_

466
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,511
What the hell?

467
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:22,766
_

468
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:34,459
Oh, hello, Gary.

469
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:36,026
Hi Gideon.

470
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,228
How's Ava?

471
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:38,763
Fine. Sleeping it off.

472
00:26:38,787 --> 00:26:39,997
Why don't you take a break?

473
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:41,232
Let Nurse Gary take over.

474
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:42,533
No, no, no, no, no.

475
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:43,901
It's the only thing I can do

476
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:46,304
without getting yelled at.

477
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:47,861
Okay.

478
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:53,244
This is amazing.

479
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,545
Mm-hmm. All right, Gwyn.
I'm heading back

480
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:59,102
to get more future stuff
for Operation: Ruckus.

481
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:01,886
Oh, hey, hey, hey,

482
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,310
keep those tentacles to yourself!

483
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,224
It's me.

484
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:09,026
I'm pretending to be human Spooner

485
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,495
so I can trick those stupid Legends.

486
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,896
_

487
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,401
_

488
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,836
You bet I am.

489
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,470
Yeah, but you gotta be careful Gary,

490
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:24,205
because those Legends
are pretending to be us.

491
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:26,710
_

492
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:27,844
Yeah.

493
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:29,235
Yeah.

494
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,967
What the hell are you doing?

495
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,687
It's me.

496
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:36,938
_

497
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:43,359
I have grenades, you idiot.

498
00:27:43,383 --> 00:27:45,083
Still wanna eat me?

499
00:27:54,962 --> 00:27:57,462
_

500
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,190
Gary, you're supposed to be

501
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:16,558
watching the portal entrance.

502
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:18,427
Yeah, well, there's this thing.

503
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,062
I mean, it's not really important,

504
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:22,364
- but it's not not-important.
- Spit it out.

505
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:24,399
Why are you being so mean to Gideon?

506
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:25,834
What do you mean?

507
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:28,070
Well, every time she tries
to help out with a mission,

508
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:29,304
you shut her down.

509
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:30,372
It's for her own good.

510
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:32,474
She's only gonna get herself hurt.

511
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:35,341
Get herself hurt? Oh...

512
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,677
Seeing Robo-Behrad almost shoot her

513
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:39,211
must have really scared you.

514
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:40,647
I don't know what
you're talking about, Gary.

515
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:43,917
No, I... I think I know why
you're acting this way.

516
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:46,920
You know, it's because you're
kind of like her mother.

517
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:49,576
Don't be stupid. I am not her mom.

518
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:54,295
I mean, I did create her,

519
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,029
and seeing her almost get killed...

520
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:57,764
I don't know what came over me.

521
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:00,001
Just this rush of emotion.

522
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:01,903
Anger and...

523
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:03,024
fear.

524
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:07,309
That's Mama Bear Astra coming out.

525
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,400
Shut up.

526
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,137
Legends.

527
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:39,339
Has anyone seen Behrad?

528
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:42,430
I wanna ask him
if I nailed my Robo's look...

529
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:46,802
dead ringer.

530
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,282
Where's Gideon?

531
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,031
Help me.

532
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:05,165
Guys, help me.

533
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:06,533
I'm the real Zari.

534
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,124
No, no. I'm the real Zari.

535
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:30,641
Which one's the real Zari?

536
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:41,040
Help me, you idiots.

537
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:42,441
Don't just stand there!

538
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,995
No, help me.

539
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:51,750
Eat her, Gary!

540
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:53,185
Okay... Okay.

541
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:55,387
- Which one?
- This one. No, uh...

542
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:56,955
No, uh, just...

543
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,557
Can you not just swallow them both

544
00:30:58,581 --> 00:30:59,724
and spit out the real one?

545
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:01,226
I don't know!

546
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,414
Maybe?

547
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:09,386
This is for making me wear cargo pants.

548
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,115
Were you gonna eat me, Gary?

549
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:24,672
No...

550
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,295
Ugh, there's your computer room, Z.

551
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,963
We'll manually
land the Waverider

552
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:40,197
once you take out Evil Gideon.

553
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:41,799
Wow, the server room.

554
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:43,367
It's my favorite room.

555
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:45,803
The shutdown code better work.

556
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:48,172
Computers are so lame.
It will.

557
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:49,907
Just insert the drive marked "override",

558
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,176
connect it to the laptop,
then type the code.

559
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,745
Okay, see you later, Zari.

560
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:54,812
Good luck.

561
00:31:54,836 --> 00:31:57,503
Okay.

562
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:00,573
Okay.

563
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,022
Override,
override, override...

564
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:05,522
where are you, override?

565
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:06,623
Okay...

566
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:08,644
Ah! Yes.

567
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:11,029
Okay.

568
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,429
Okay, okay.

569
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,131
Now the shutdown code.

570
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:15,988
Okay...

571
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,704
Delta?

572
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:22,139
Where's the delta key?

573
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:23,860
What are you doing, Miss Tarazi?

574
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,745
Uh, I uh, I want to run a diagnostic,

575
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:34,755
but I need to, uh, bypass
your auxiliary matrix

576
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:37,925
in order to directly interface with it.

577
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:40,057
- Yeah.
- I see.

578
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:42,425
Which other Legends
snuck on board besides you,

579
00:32:42,449 --> 00:32:44,260
Miss Tarazi?

580
00:32:44,284 --> 00:32:45,628
I don't k...

581
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:46,762
I don't know

582
00:32:46,786 --> 00:32:48,898
what you're talking about, Gideon.

583
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:50,633
I haven't left this ship in ages.

584
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:52,035
If you don't stop right now,

585
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:54,070
I will remove all the
oxygen from the ship,

586
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:56,572
killing you and any other
stowaway Legends.

587
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:58,674
You know what, Gidget?

588
00:32:58,698 --> 00:33:00,632
You leave me with no choice.

589
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,998
I'm glad you've come
to your senses, Miss Taraz...

590
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:11,673
Hmm! That wasn't too hard.

591
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,313
Behrad, what was that?

592
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:20,484
Strap in, Z! It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

593
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:25,400
Just keep it level!

594
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,125
Easier said than done!

595
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:32,374
Good. Just circumvent
Evil Gideon's operating system,

596
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,475
and bring on the thrusters.

597
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:36,412
It would really help
smooth out the landing.

598
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:38,047
About that landing...

599
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:40,271
we could really use those
thrusters right about now.

600
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:42,851
I... I...

601
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,286
almost...

602
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,673
got it!

603
00:33:55,354 --> 00:33:56,632
I can't...

604
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,467
I can't believe you did it.

605
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:00,069
You were amazing!

606
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:01,836
Impeccable timing.

607
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,190
How's this for timing?

608
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:13,671
Finally.

609
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,217
Nice landing, guys.

610
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:18,386
Really thought I was gonna die.

611
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,688
Team Ruckus,

612
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:22,323
we got the Waverider.

613
00:34:22,347 --> 00:34:23,743
Come on board!

614
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:28,729
Sh... yes! Yes! I knew you could do it.

615
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:29,997
I knew you could do it.

616
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,566
Congratulations, my boy!

617
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,833
Fantastic work, all of you.

618
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:35,903
- Fantastic work!
- Oh!

619
00:34:35,927 --> 00:34:37,572
I love when a plan comes together.

620
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:39,396
Give it up for our general.

621
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:41,809
To the man with a plan.

622
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,212
You're now officially a Legend.

623
00:34:44,236 --> 00:34:46,514
- Ah, to the doc.
- Really?

624
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:49,350
Well, thank you, and there
are no other soldiers

625
00:34:49,374 --> 00:34:51,170
that I would rather go into battle with.

626
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:54,507
- What he said!
- Yeah!

627
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,928
Let's go home.

628
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:01,463
Oh, I mean a replica home.

629
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:04,421
Home adjacent.

630
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:08,568
Wait.

631
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:09,669
There's something I...

632
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,726
Sara Lance is inside.

633
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,241
She and those time turds

634
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:17,143
gotta be hiding inside here somewhere.

635
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,645
Let's find them.

636
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:21,348
Let's kill them.

637
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:24,372
Ohh... we are so screwed.

638
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:29,145
It's only a matter of time

639
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,280
before they realize
that mirror's a portal.

640
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,382
Oh, I'm so profoundly sorry.

641
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:34,584
You see, this is all my fault.

642
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:36,185
I thought if we could take out
their general,

643
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:37,486
then it would send the rest

644
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,188
of those wretched
machines into disarray.

645
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:41,757
But I have profoundly miscalculated.

646
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:43,359
And even with their commander gone,

647
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:45,761
they seem to still want to kill us,

648
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:48,196
and they're cutting off our
only path to the Waverider.

649
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,231
Gwyn, you can't give up hope.

650
00:35:50,255 --> 00:35:51,700
We'll think of something.

651
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:54,335
Yeah, but what can we do?

652
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,324
Wait, I have an idea.

653
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:02,243
What is that?

654
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:04,601
This is Thawne's time manipulator.

655
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:11,352
You know his death's
not your fault, right?

656
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:13,689
It doesn't matter
if it's my fault or not.

657
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,757
This is now my responsibility.

658
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:19,027
When I asked Thawne
to pause World War I,

659
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,697
I gave him my word
that if he were to die

660
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,299
that I would take his
place as the Fixer.

661
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:25,700
Why didn't you tell me?

662
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:29,603
Because we had more
pressing matters and...

663
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:33,295
I guess if I said it out loud,
it would feel more real.

664
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,744
All right, well, you're not
going at this alone.

665
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:38,145
You got us.

666
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:40,147
Look, it's too late for that.

667
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:42,849
So I'm gonna go out there,

668
00:36:42,873 --> 00:36:44,185
and I'm gonna distract the Robos,

669
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,653
and you guys need to make
a run for the Waverider.

670
00:36:46,677 --> 00:36:47,922
No way, jefa.

671
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:49,990
Yeah, we're going home together.

672
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:53,260
If World War I doesn't happen,

673
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:54,995
history will change so much

674
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:59,100
that none of us will have
a home to go back to.

675
00:36:59,124 --> 00:37:00,134
I have to do this.

676
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:02,136
I have to protect the Fixed Point.

677
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,437
Now when this hits zero,

678
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:05,138
I'm gonna get sucked into a time loop,

679
00:37:05,162 --> 00:37:07,206
and I need you to tell Ava...

680
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,542
you tell her to come and find me.

681
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:11,811
- Sara, just...
- Please.

682
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:15,137
As your captain,
let me protect you guys.

683
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:21,009
One last time.

684
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:31,697
Well, I see you brought some backup.

685
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:33,886
I get to kill you again.

686
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:41,875
What are you doing?
Go, get to the Waverider!

687
00:37:41,899 --> 00:37:43,276
We took that into consideration,

688
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,367
but we're staying together.

689
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,371
The more, the merrier.

690
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:52,485
- Aah...
- Stand down.

691
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:53,653
The Legends are no longer

692
00:37:53,677 --> 00:37:54,820
a threat to the timeline.

693
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:56,322
Do not harm them.

694
00:37:56,346 --> 00:37:58,457
Why aren't they moving?

695
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:01,494
Excellent work.
Your mission is complete.

696
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:03,763
And as a reward,
you'll receive upgrades.

697
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:07,321
But first, you must remove your CPUs.

698
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:18,043
Team Waverider, something, uh...

699
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,567
pretty weird just happened.

700
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:27,252
Oh, absolutely fascinating

701
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,376
and truly terrifying at the same time.

702
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:32,357
Well, you guys should
probably get going.

703
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,893
Oh, no captain left behind.

704
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,661
I'm gonna need that bracelet, Sara.

705
00:38:36,685 --> 00:38:39,116
- I appreciate it, but...
- Trust me.

706
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:56,703
Hoo-hah.

707
00:38:57,472 --> 00:38:59,084
What happened?

708
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:00,919
I thought I killed
all you garbage people.

709
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:03,521
Long story short,
I kicked both of your asses.

710
00:39:03,545 --> 00:39:05,322
- No freaking way.
- Yeah.

711
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:08,525
And as a reward, I get
to guard the Fixed Point

712
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:11,028
of the Archduke Ferdinand's
assassination forever.

713
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:13,630
Something you two-time
losers could never do.

714
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:15,233
But we could protect that Fixed Point

715
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:16,767
way better than you idiots.

716
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,202
Hmm, I don't know.

717
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:20,891
I got this special time
bracelet that says otherwise.

718
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:26,143
Ha-ha! Looks like I'm
guarding the Fixed Point now,

719
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,563
you beautiful idiot!

720
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:33,236
No!

721
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,742
Fantastic work!

722
00:39:40,782 --> 00:39:43,861
Thank you for letting me help.
That was a brilliant plan.

723
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,496
It was. But I'm sure you would've

724
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,352
come up with something better,
if I'd actually let you.

725
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:53,370
I'm sorry for sidelining you.

726
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:54,805
I... I overstepped.

727
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:57,173
- It's fine, Astra...
- No, it's not.

728
00:39:57,197 --> 00:40:00,143
And as the person who conjured you

729
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,512
from the wreckage of our old ship,

730
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,538
I just wanted to say, that, um...

731
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,976
I am really proud of you.

732
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,979
Thanks, Mum.

733
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:24,701
Go on. Tell Ava and Gary

734
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,069
it's safe for them to come on the ship.

735
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:27,726
Oh, is it? Good.

736
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,077
Gary?

737
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,246
Ava!

738
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,200
Come down here. I have good news.

739
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:25,224
Greg, move your head.

740
