1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,080
BARTON: Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,920
-You see where you're going?
-Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
Okay.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,160
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,440
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,360
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,280
Your hips here.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,800
Okay?

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,080
-Can you see?
-Yeah.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,240
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,640
How about now?
Can you see now?

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,080
No.
-How about now?

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,320
All right.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
Ready? Three fingers.

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,800
COOPER: Nice!

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,960
LAURA: Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,200
COOPER: Here you go.

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,720
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,240
Or both?

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,520
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,720
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,880
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
LAURA: Got it!

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,960
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,880
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,280
LAURA: Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,640
BARTON: Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,680
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
LAURA: Hey, guys!

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,080
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,280
BARTON: All right.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,760
We're coming. We're hungry.

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,360
Lila, let's go.

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
Lila?

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Honey?

36
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,560
Hey, babe?

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,440
-Babe?

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
Babe?

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,600
Boys!

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Boys!

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,800
Laura!

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,720
-

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,880
You don't need to do that.

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,080
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
-Oh, yeah.
-

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,440
-That was close.
-

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,200
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,760
I would like to try again.

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
It's fun.

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
And you've won.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
Congratulations.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
Fair game.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,840
Good sport.

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,240
You have fun?

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,000
It was fun.

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,760
-

59
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,120
This thing on?

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,320
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
If you find this recording...

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,280
don't post it on social media.

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,080
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

64
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,160
I don't know if
you're ever gonna see these.

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,360
I don't even know
if you're still...

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
Oh, God, I hope so.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,880
Today's day 21.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,280
No, uh, 22.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,480
You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror...

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,840
of staring into
the literal void of space,

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,120
I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.

72
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
Infection's run its course,

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,320
thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,520
Oh, you'd love her.

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
Very practical.

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,640
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,800
So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,080
and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...

79
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,760
Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,600
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...

83
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
and that'll be it.

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,160
Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...

85
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,040
but I gotta say
I was really hoping

86
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,920
to pull off one last one.

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,040
But it looks like...

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, you know
what it looks like.

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,280
Don't feel bad about this.

90
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,240
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

91
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,120
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,280
Go rest my eyes.

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,840
Please know...

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,600
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm fine. Totally fine.

97
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,760
I dream about you.

98
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
Because it's always you.

99
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Couldn't stop him.

100
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Neither could I.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,160
Hang on.

102
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,160
I lost the kid.

103
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Tony, we lost.

104
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Is, uh...?

105
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,240
-Oh, good.
-Oh, my God!

106
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,400
It's okay.

107
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,120
RHODES: It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

108
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,920
NATASHA: World governments
are in pieces.

109
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
The parts
that are still working...

110
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,880
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

111
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,200
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

112
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,480
Thanos wiped out...

113
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,040
...50% of
all living creatures.

114
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,320
Where is he now? Where?

115
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,200
We don't know.

116
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,440
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

117
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,120
What's wrong with him?

118
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,160
ROCKET: Oh, he's pissed.

119
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
He thinks he failed.

120
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,200
Which, of course, he did...

121
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,400
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

122
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
Honestly,
until this exact second

123
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,200
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

124
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
Maybe I am.

125
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

126
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,440
Deep space scans...

127
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,640
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

128
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Tony, you fought him.

129
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Who told you that?

130
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
I didn't fight him.

131
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,040
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

132
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,320
while the Bleecker Street
magician

133
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,640
gave away the store.

134
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
That's what happened.

135
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,160
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

136
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,920
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

137
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,440
I saw this coming
a few years back.

138
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,240
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

139
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,200
Thought I was dreaming.

140
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Tony, I'm gonna need you
to focus.

141
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,280
And I needed you.

142
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,480
As in, past tense.

143
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

144
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,200
Sorry.

145
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

146
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,960
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

147
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,160
Tony, Tony!

148
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,640
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

149
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,600
was a suit of armor
around the world.

150
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Remember that?

151
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,440
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

152
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,720
That's what we needed.

153
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,960
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

154
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,560
I said we'd lose.

155
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
You said,
"We'll do that together, too."

156
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,520
And guess what, Cap?

157
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,000
We lost.

158
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
And you weren't there.

159
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,200
But that's what we do, right?

160
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,200
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

161
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,320
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

162
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
-Okay.
-Right?

163
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,760
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

164
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

165
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
-She's great by the way.
-Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

166
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
TONY: We need you.
You're new blood.

167
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,320
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

168
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
I got no coordinates...

169
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,640
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

170
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,520
Zero. Zip. Nada.

171
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,440
No trust, liar.

172
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,240
Here, take this.

173
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,520
You find him,
you put that on...

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,520
you hide.

175
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,520
-STEVE: Tony!
-I'm fine.

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,400
Let me...

177
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,200
RHODES: Bruce gave him
a sedative.

178
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,080
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

179
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,640
CAROL: You guys
take care of him...

180
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

181
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
Where are you going?

182
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,760
To kill Thanos.

183
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,000
NATASHA: Hey.

184
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,200
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

185
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,040
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

186
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,640
We realize up there
is more your territory,

187
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,800
but this is our fight, too.

188
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,120
You even know where he is?

189
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,480
I know people who might.

190
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
NEBULA: Don't bother.

191
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,680
I can tell you
where Thanos is.

192
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,200
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

193
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,880
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

194
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,120
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

195
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
I'd ask...

196
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,920
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

197
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
And his answer
was always the same.

198
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
"To the Garden."

199
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,000
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

200
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,720
So, where is he?

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,120
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

202
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

203
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,200
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

204
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,560
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

205
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,080
Until two days ago...

206
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,480
on this planet.

207
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,680
Thanos is there.

208
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,120
He used the stones again.

209
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
BANNER: Hey, hey, hey.

210
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,160
We'd be going in shorthanded,
you know?

211
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,800
RHODES: Look, he's still
got the stones, so...

212
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,400
So, let's get 'em.

213
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,040
Use them
to bring everyone back.

214
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,280
BANNER: Just like that?

215
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,960
Yeah. Just like that.

216
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,280
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

217
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,160
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

218
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,960
If we do this, how do we know

219
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,320
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

220
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,080
Because before
you didn't have me.

221
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,120
Hey, new girl?

222
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,000
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

223
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
And if you don't mind
my asking,

224
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,040
where the hell have you been
all this time?

225
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,400
There are a lot of
other planets in the universe.

226
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,440
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

227
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,160
I like this one.

228
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,200
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

229
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Okay.

230
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,760
Who here hasn't been to space?

231
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,320
-Why?
-

232
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,080
You better not throw up
on my ship.

233
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,560
Approaching jump in three...

234
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,800
two, one.

235
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,080
I'll head down for recon.

236
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,800
This is gonna work, Steve.

237
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
I know it will.

238
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,880
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

239
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,960
No satellites.
No ships. No armies.

240
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,640
No ground defenses
of any kind.

241
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,400
It's just him.

242
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,760
And that's enough.

243
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,040
Oh, no.

244
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,240
Where are they?

245
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,240
-Answer the question.

246
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,120
The universe
required correction.

247
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,080
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

248
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,880
beyond temptation.

249
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,000
You murdered trillions!

250
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,280
-You should be grateful.
-

251
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,680
Where are the stones?

252
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,240
Gone.

253
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,480
Reduced to atoms.

254
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,640
You used them two days ago!

255
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,040
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

256
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,400
It nearly killed me.

257
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,560
But the work is done.

258
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,680
It always will be.

259
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,640
I am inevitable.

260
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,280
We have to tear this place
apart. He has to be lying!

261
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,680
NEBULA: My father
is many things.

262
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,640
A liar is not one of them.

263
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,840
Ah.

264
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,960
Thank you, daughter.

265
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

266
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
BANNER: What?

267
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,680
What did you do?

268
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,040
I went for the head.

269
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,120
MAN: So...

270
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,920
...I, uh, went on a date
the other day.

271
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,720
It's the first time
in five years.

272
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,240
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

273
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

274
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,000
What did you talk about?

275
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,840
Eh, same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

276
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,080
My job, his job.

277
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,960
How much we miss the Mets.

278
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,920
And then things got quiet...

279
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,640
then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

280
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,320
What about you?

281
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,640
I cried just before dessert.

282
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,520
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

283
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,440
That's great.

284
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,280
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

285
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,480
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

286
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,000
And that's it.
That's those little

287
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,400
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

288
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,280
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

289
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,680
I went in the ice in '45,

290
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,120
right after I met
the love of my life.

291
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
Woke up 70 years later.

292
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,920
You gotta move on.

293
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,280
Gotta move on.

294
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,520
The world is in our hands.

295
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,760
It's left to us, guys.

296
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,160
And we gotta do
something with it.

297
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
Otherwise...

298
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,920
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

299
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
What the hell?

300
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,800
Hope?

301
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Kid!

302
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,240
Hey, kid!

303
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,760
What the hell happened here?

304
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,240
Oh, my God!

305
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
Oh, please!

306
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,240
Please, please!

307
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
No, no, no. No.

308
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
No.

309
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Excuse me. Sorry.

310
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
Oh, Cassie, no.

311
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,640
No, no, no.

312
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,760
No, no.

313
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,600
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

314
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,960
What?

315
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,360
Cassie?

316
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,920
Dad?

317
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,360
-You're so big!
-

318
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,960
Yeah. We boarded

319
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,160
that highly-suspect warship
Danvers pinged.

320
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,040
It was an infectious
garbage scow.

321
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,680
So, thanks for the hot tip.

322
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,160
Well, you were closer.

323
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,720
ROCKET: Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.

324
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
You get a reading
on those tremors?

325
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.

326
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,120
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

327
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,440
OKOYE: Nat.

328
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,840
It's an earthquake
under the ocean.

329
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,840
We handle it
by not handling it.

330
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,720
Carol, are we seeing you here
next month?

331
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,280
Not likely.

332
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,920
What? You gonna get
another haircut?

333
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,400
Listen, fur face.

334
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm covering
a lot of territory.

335
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,320
The things
that are happening on Earth

336
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,680
are happening everywhere.

337
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,840
On thousands of planets.

338
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,480
All right, all right.
That's a good point.

339
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,680
That's a good point.

340
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,920
So, you might not see me
for a long time.

341
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,440
All right. Uh, well...

342
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,440
This channel's always active.

343
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,680
So, if anything
goes sideways...

344
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,280
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

345
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,600
comes through me.

346
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,320
-Okay.

347
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,840
All right.

348
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,680
Good luck.

349
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
Where are you?

350
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
RHODES: Mexico.

351
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,240
The Federales found a room
full of bodies.

352
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,040
Looks like
a bunch of cartel guys...

353
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,160
never even had a chance
to get their guns off.

354
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,040
It's probably a rival gang.

355
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,400
Except it isn't.

356
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,760
It's definitely Barton.

357
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,920
What he's done here...

358
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,240
what he's been doing
for the last few years...

359
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,880
I mean,
the scene that he left...

360
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
I gotta tell you,

361
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,440
there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.

362
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,280
Will you find out
where he's going next?

363
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,320
Nat?

364
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,840
Please?

365
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
Okay.

366
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,360
STEVE: You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

367
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,280
but you seem
pretty miserable already.

368
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,800
NATASHA: You here
to do your laundry?

369
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,560
And to see a friend.

370
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,320
Clearly, your friend is fine.

371
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,360
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

372
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,560
when I was coming over
the bridge.

373
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,560
-In the Hudson?
-There's fewer ships...

374
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,000
cleaner water.

375
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,040
You know,
if you're about to tell me

376
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,080
to look on the bright side...

377
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,480
Um...

378
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,840
I'm about to hit you
in the head

379
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,040
with a peanut butter sandwich.

380
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Hmm.

381
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,160
Sorry.

382
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,480
Force of habit.

383
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,160
You know,
I keep telling everybody

384
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,880
they should move on...

385
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,720
and grow.

386
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,240
Some do.

387
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,200
But not us.

388
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,000
If I move on, who does this?

389
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,480
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

390
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,960
I used to have nothing.

391
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,040
And then I got this.

392
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,040
This job.

393
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,160
This family.

394
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,840
And I was better
because of it.

395
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,640
And even though
they're gone...

396
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,040
I'm still trying to be better.

397
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,480
I think we both need
to get a life.

398
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,320
You first.

399
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,040
Oh, hi, hi!

400
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,320
Uh, is anyone home?

401
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,200
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

402
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,200
We met a few years ago
at the airport...

403
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,040
in Germany?

404
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,520
I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.

405
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,280
-You wouldn't recognize me.
-Is this an old message?

406
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,320
SCOTT: Ant-Man?
I know you know that.

407
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,560
It's the front gate.

408
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,080
SCOTT: I really need
to talk to you guys.

409
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,400
STEVE: Scott.

410
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Are you okay?

411
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Yeah.

412
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,720
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

413
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,640
Only to make conversation.

414
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,320
All right, so...

415
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,400
five years ago,
right before...

416
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,120
Thanos...

417
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,600
I was in a place
called the quantum realm.

418
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,280
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

419
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,560
To get in there, you have
to be incredibly small.

420
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Hope. She's my, um...

421
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,040
She was my...

422
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,960
She was supposed to
pull me out.

423
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,720
And then Thanos happened...

424
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,560
and I got stuck in there.

425
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

426
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,480
Yeah, but that's just it.

427
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,800
It wasn't.

428
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
For me, it was five hours.

429
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,680
See, the rules of
the quantum realm

430
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,880
aren't like they are up here.

431
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
Everything is unpredictable.

432
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,880
Is that anybody's sandwich?

433
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,280
I'm starving.

434
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,760
Scott.

435
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,200
What are you talking about?

436
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,480
So...

437
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,000
what I'm saying is...

438
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,280
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

439
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
The only problem is right now

440
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,840
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

441
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
But what if we did?

442
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,880
I can't stop thinking
about it.

443
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
What if we could
somehow control the chaos...

444
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,280
and we could navigate it?

445
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,920
What if there was a way...

446
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,640
that we could enter
the quantum realm

447
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,800
at a certain point in time...

448
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,440
but then exit
the quantum realm

449
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,680
at another point in time?

450
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,200
Like...

451
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,040
-Like before Thanos.
-STEVE: Wait.

452
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,760
Are you talking
about a time machine?

453
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,720
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

454
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,920
This is more like a...

455
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,880
Yeah. Like a time machine.

456
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,840
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

457
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,040
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

458
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,360
There's gotta be...

459
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
-It's crazy.
-NATASHA: Scott.

460
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,840
I get emails from a raccoon...

461
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

462
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
So, who do we talk to
about this?

463
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,200
Chow time!

464
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,720
Maguna.

465
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,360
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

466
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Define "lunch"

467
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,760
-or be disintegrated.
-Okay.

468
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,640
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

469
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,120
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

470
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm making for Mom.

471
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,640
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

472
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,720
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

473
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,600
-No.
-That's what you want.

474
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,880
How did you find this?

475
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,880
-Garage.
-Really?

476
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
-Were you looking for it?
-No.

477
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,800
-I found it, though.
-Hmm.

478
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,720
You like
going in the garage, huh?

479
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,760
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

480
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,720
So, I'm gonna...

481
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,760
No.
We know what it sounds like.

482
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,880
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

483
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
is anything really impossible?

484
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,280
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

485
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,120
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

486
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,240
Can we agree on that?

487
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,480
Thank you.

488
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,760
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

489
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,360
-I did.
-No.

490
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,400
You accidentally survived.

491
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,640
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

492
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,920
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

493
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,280
A time heist?

494
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,600
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

495
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,880
Why didn't we think
of this before?

496
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,520
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

497
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,760
The stones are in the past.

498
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,160
We could go back,
we could get them.

499
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,640
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

500
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,720
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

501
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
I don't believe we would.

502
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,000
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

503
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,600
However, high hopes
won't help...

504
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,720
if there's no logical,
tangible way

505
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,280
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

506
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,320
I believe
the most likely outcome

507
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
will be our collective demise.

508
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,320
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

509
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,160
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

510
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,800
no betting on sporting events.

511
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

512
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,000
Are you seriously telling me

513
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,880
that your plan
to save the universe...

514
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,720
is based on
Back to the Future?

515
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,600
-Is it?
-No.

516
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
Good. You had me
worried there.

517
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,920
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

518
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,400
That's not how
quantum physics works.

519
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,720
Tony.

520
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,120
We have to take a stand.

521
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,680
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

522
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,320
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

523
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,360
You got a wife, a daughter.

524
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,040
But I lost someone
very important to me.

525
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
A lotta people did.

526
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,960
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

527
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,280
to bring everyone back,

528
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

529
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,760
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

530
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,800
-I can't.
-

531
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,280
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

532
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,800
Good job. I'm saved.

533
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,600
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

534
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,800
Anything else.

535
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,680
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

536
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,120
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

537
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,720
Tony. I get it.

538
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,200
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

539
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,480
But this is a second chance.

540
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,600
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

541
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,320
Can't roll the dice on it.

542
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,320
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

543
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Well, he's scared.

544
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,560
STEVE: He's not wrong.

545
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,760
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

546
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,120
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

547
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
No, I wanna do it right.

548
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,920
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

549
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
Bigger than his?

550
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,480
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

551
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,600
Try some of that.

552
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
Have some eggs.

553
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,520
I'm so confused.

554
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,360
These are confusing times.

555
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,360
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

556
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

557
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
I know, it's crazy.

558
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,760
I'm wearing shirts now.

559
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,760
Yeah. What? How? Why?

560
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,560
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

561
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,840
Except it was worse for me...

562
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
'cause I lost twice.

563
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,160
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

564
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,360
and then, we all lost.

565
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
No one blamed you, Bruce.

566
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,240
I did.

567
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,240
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

568
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,480
like he's
some kind of disease...

569
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,000
something to get rid of.

570
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,440
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

571
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,120
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

572
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,880
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

573
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
and now, look at me.

574
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,680
Best of both worlds.

575
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,760
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

576
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,280
Can we get a photo?

577
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
100%, little person.

578
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,880
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

579
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,360
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-SMART HULK: Thanks.

580
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,040
Say "green."

581
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,440
-FANS: Green.
-Green.

582
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Did you get that?

583
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,960
That's a good one.

584
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,000
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

585
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,600
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

586
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,840
-Nobody does.
-No, he wants you to take

587
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,640
-a picture with him.
-I don't want a picture.

588
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,800
BOY 1: Stranger danger.

589
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,400
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

590
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

591
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,720
But come on. The kid...

592
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,200
I don't want a picture
with them.

593
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
-He's gonna feel bad.
-Sorry.

594
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,800
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

595
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,440
SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
BOY 2: We can do it.

596
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,560
-SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
-Take the goddamn phone.

597
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,840
SMART HULK: Okay.

598
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

599
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,680
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

600
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,520
ALL: Hulk out!

601
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,720
STEVE: Bruce.

602
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Dab.

603
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,120
-Bruce.
-Listen to your mom.

604
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
She knows better.

605
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,320
About what we were saying.

606
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
Right.

607
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,320
The whole time travel do-over?

608
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,360
Eh, guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

609
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,080
Well, you pulled this off.

610
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,920
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

611
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,760
I've got a mild inspiration.

612
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,120
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

613
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,280
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

614
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,960
before we pack it in
for the night.

615
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,120
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

616
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,600
inverted, please.

617
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,760
FRIDAY: Processing.

618
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,720
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

619
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
factoring in spectral decomp.

620
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,000
-That'll take a second.
-FRIDAY: Just a moment.

621
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,920
And don't worry if it doesn't
pan out. I'm just kinda...

622
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,960
Model rendered.

623
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Shit!

624
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,360
MORGAN STARK: Shit!

625
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,120
What are you
doing up, little miss?

626
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,000
-Shit.
-Nope. We don't say that.

627
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,400
Only Mommy says that word.

628
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,960
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

629
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
Why are you up?

630
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

631
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,960
Why do you think?

632
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,680
No, I got something
on my mind.

633
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,120
I got something on my mind.

634
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,800
Was it juice pops?

635
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,560
Sure was.

636
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,720
That's extortion.
That's a word.

637
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,080
What kind you want?

638
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Great minds think alike.

639
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,240
Juice pops exactly...

640
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,520
was on my mind.

641
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,080
You done? Yeah?

642
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,840
Now you are.

643
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,560
Here. Wipe.

644
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,960
Good. That face goes there.

645
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,360
Tell me a story.

646
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,120
A story.

647
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,440
Once upon a time,
Maguna went to bed. The end.

648
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,160
That is a horrible story.

649
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,080
Come on,
that's your favorite story.

650
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,960
Love you tons.

651
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,800
I love you 3,000.

652
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,040
Wow.

653
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,280
3,000.
That's crazy.

654
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,280
Go to bed
or I'll sell all your toys.

655
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,840
-Night night.
-

656
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,200
Not that it's a competition...

657
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,640
but she loves me 3,000.

658
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,880
Does she, now?

659
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,080
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

660
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,640
Whatcha reading?

661
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,720
Just a book on composting.

662
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,960
What's new with composting?

663
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,480
-Interesting science...
-I figured it out.

664
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
By the way.

665
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,600
And, you know,

666
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,800
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

667
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,440
Time travel.

668
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
What?

669
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Wow.

670
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,800
That's amazing...

671
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,880
and terrifying.

672
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,480
That's right.

673
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,520
We got really lucky.

674
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Yeah.

675
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,960
I know.

676
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,280
A lot of people didn't.

677
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

678
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,160
Sorta seems like you can.

679
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,920
Not if I stop.

680
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,000
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

681
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Tony...

682
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,040
trying to get you to stop...

683
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,800
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

684
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,800
Something tells me...

685
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,160
I should put it in a lockbox

686
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,760
and drop it
to the bottom of the lake...

687
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,160
and go to bed.

688
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,600
But would you be able to rest?

689
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,640
SMART HULK: Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

690
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,960
Scott, fire up...

691
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,080
the, uh, van thing.

692
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,400
STEVE: Breakers are set.

693
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,400
Emergency generators
are on standby.

694
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,280
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

695
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,560
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

696
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,600
-Excuse me?
-He's kidding.

697
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,680
You can't say things
like that.

698
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,400
It was a bad joke.

699
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
You were kidding, right?

700
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,680
I have no idea. We're talking
about time travel here.

701
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,080
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

702
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,920
We're good!

703
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,440
Get your helmet on.

704
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,920
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

705
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,640
let you walk around
for an hour,

706
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,240
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

707
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Make sense?

708
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
Perfectly not confusing.

709
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,440
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

710
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,040
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

711
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,520
On a count of three...

712
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,560
Three, two, one.

713
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,480
Uh... Guys?

714
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,520
This doesn't feel right.

715
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,640
STEVE: What is this?

716
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
-What's going on?
-NATASHA: Who is that?

717
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
-Hold on.
-Is that Scott?

718
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Yes, it's Scott.

719
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,400
-What's going on, Bruce?
-Oh, my back!

720
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
-What is this?
-Hold on a second.

721
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
Could I get
a little space here?

722
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

723
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,880
I'm working on it.

724
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
It's a baby.

725
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,640
-It's Scott.
-STEVE: As a baby.

726
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,280
-SMART HULK: He'll grow.
-Bring Scott back.

727
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,800
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

728
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,160
Oh, my God.

729
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,240
And... kill it!

730
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,440
Somebody peed my pants.

731
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,560
Oh, thank God.

732
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,960
But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

733
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,240
Or just me me.

734
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,880
Time travel!

735
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
What?

736
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,560
I see this as an absolute win.

737
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,200
-

738
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,520
Why the long face?

739
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,440
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

740
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

741
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,280
It's the EPR Paradox.

742
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,080
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

743
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
you might've wound up...

744
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,680
pushing time through Lang.

745
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,000
It's tricky, dangerous.

746
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,520
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

747
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,720
You did.

748
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,040
Oh, did I?

749
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,880
Well, thank God I'm here.

750
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,280
Regardless, I fixed it.

751
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,680
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

752
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,000
I just want peace.

753
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,360
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

754
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,600
Me, too.

755
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,320
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

756
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,320
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

757
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,800
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

758
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,800
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

759
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,640
And maybe not die trying.

760
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,880
Would be nice.

761
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,400
Sounds like a deal.

762
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Tony, I don't know.

763
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,800
Why?

764
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,760
He made it for you.

765
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,680
Plus, honestly, I have to
get it out of the garage

766
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,520
before Morgan
takes it sledding.

767
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,200
Thank you, Tony.

768
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,720
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

769
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,840
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

770
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,880
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

771
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,800
We're working on that
right now.

772
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,920
ROCKET: Hey, Humie.

773
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,280
Where's Big Green?

774
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,640
The kitchen, I think.

775
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,120
That's awesome.

776
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,400
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

777
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,280
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

778
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,560
Oh, God.

779
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,200
WAR MACHINE: What's up,
Regular-Sized Man?

780
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,520
ROCKET: Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

781
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,320
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

782
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,840
Hey, have
a little compassion, pal.

783
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,960
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

784
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,680
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

785
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,560
You shouldn't have come.

786
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,200
Ah!

787
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,640
Valkyrie!

788
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,520
Great to see you, angry girl!

789
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,880
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

790
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,960
-This is Rocket.
-How ya doing?

791
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
He won't see you.

792
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,720
It's that bad, huh?

793
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,320
We only see him once a month

794
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,520
when he comes
in for "supplies."

795
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,760
It's that bad.

796
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Yeah.

797
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,480
What the...?

798
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,120
-

799
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,560
Whew! Something died in here!

800
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,920
-SMART HULK: Hello? Thor!

801
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,160
THOR: Are you here
about the cable?

802
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,960
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

803
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,320
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

804
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,080
SMART HULK: Thor?

805
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,560
Boys! Oh, my God!

806
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,960
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!

807
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,720
Come here,
cuddly little rascal.

808
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,360
-Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.
-

809
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,600
That's not necessary.

810
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,720
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

811
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,000
-Hey, boys!
-SMART HULK: Hey, guys.

812
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,440
Long time no see.

813
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Beer's in the bucket.

814
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,840
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

815
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,720
No password, obviously.

816
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,320
Thor, he's back.

817
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,160
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

818
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,720
Noobmaster.

819
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,360
KORG: Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

820
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,680
I am sick of this.

821
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,280
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

822
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,520
You know, the God of Thunder.

823
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,880
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

824
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,520
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

825
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,160
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

826
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,960
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

827
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,400
Oh, that's right, yes!

828
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,360
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

829
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,080
Thank you, Thor.

830
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,600
Let me know if
he bothers you again, okay?

831
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,960
Thank you very much. I will.

832
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,320
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

833
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,840
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

834
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,120
SMART HULK: Buddy.

835
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,760
-You all right?
-Yes, I'm fine. Why?

836
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,960
Why, don't I look all right?

837
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,800
You look
like melted ice cream.

838
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,880
So, what's up? You just here
for a hang, or what?

839
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,200
-We need your help.
-Mm.

840
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,560
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

841
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,080
What, like the cable?

842
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,440
'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

843
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Like Thanos.

844
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,640
Don't say that name.

845
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,480
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

846
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,200
SMART HULK: Please take
your hand off me.

847
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,640
Now, I know that guy...

848
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,680
might scare you.

849
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,560
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

850
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,560
I'm the one
who killed that guy, remember?

851
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,840
Hmm.

852
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,800
Anyone else here
kill that guy?

853
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,280
Nope.

854
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
Didn't think so.

855
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,760
Korg, why don't you, uh,
tell everybody

856
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,200
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

857
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,760
Um, Stormbreaker?

858
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,560
THOR: Who was swinging
Stormbreaker?

859
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,840
I get it.
You're in a rough spot, okay?

860
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,040
I've been there myself.

861
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,480
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

862
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,000
Was it Natasha?

863
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,320
It was you.

864
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,440
You helped me.

865
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,120
So, why don't you ask...

866
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,520
the Asgardians down there...

867
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,400
how much my help is worth?

868
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,560
The ones
that are left, anyway.

869
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,680
I think we could
bring them back.

870
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,600
Stop.

871
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,760
I know you think I'm down here

872
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,480
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

873
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,200
waiting to be rescued
and saved...

874
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,440
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

875
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,080
Oh, we're good here, mate.

876
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,200
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

877
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,880
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

878
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,120
Goodbye.

879
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,200
SMART HULK: We need you, pal.

880
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,640
There's beer on the ship.

881
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,320
What kind?

882
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,800
-

883
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,600
What I want you can't give me.

884
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,680
You shouldn't be here.

885
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,160
Neither should you.

886
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,600
I've got a job to do.

887
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,840
NATASHA: Is that what
you're calling this?

888
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,320
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

889
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,240
We found something.

890
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,080
A chance, maybe.

891
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,640
Don't.

892
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,000
Don't what?

893
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,520
Don't give me hope.

894
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,320
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

895
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,160
You're drifting left.

896
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,480
One side there, Lebowski.

897
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,960
Ratchet, how's it going?

898
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
It's Rocket.

899
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,840
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

900
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,360
RHODES: Time travel suit,
not bad.

901
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,320
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

902
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
I'm being very careful.

903
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,000
No, you're being very Hulky.

904
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
I'm being careful.

905
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,600
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

906
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,040
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

907
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,360
out of existence, this is it.

908
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,200
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

909
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,280
-Scott, calm down.
-SCOTT: Sorry.

910
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,600
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

911
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,800
No do-overs.

912
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,160
Plus two test runs.

913
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,680
-

914
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
One test run.

915
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,080
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

916
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,560
BARTON: I'm game.

917
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,520
I'll do it.

918
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,320
SMART HULK:
Clint, now you're gonna feel

919
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,880
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

920
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Don't worry about that.

921
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,200
RHODES: Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

922
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,000
If we can do this, you know...

923
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,480
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

924
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,800
You know, and...

925
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,920
First of all, that's horrible.

926
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It's Thanos.

927
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,160
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

928
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,480
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

929
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,040
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

930
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,360
before Thanos gets them...

931
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,280
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

932
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,280
-Bingo.
-That's not how it works.

933
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,360
Well, that's what I heard.

934
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,600
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

935
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,560
Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...

936
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,320
-Time After Time.
-Quantum Leap.

937
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,520
Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.

938
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Hot Tub Time Machine.

939
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,720
Hot Tub Time Machine.

940
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,040
Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.

941
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,320
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

942
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,320
Die Hard.
No, that's not one.

943
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,520
This is known.

944
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,880
I don't know
why everyone believes that,

945
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,040
but that isn't true.

946
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,120
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

947
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,600
that past becomes
your future...

948
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,720
and your former present
becomes the past...

949
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,520
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

950
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,920
Exactly.

951
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,360
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

952
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,240
-All right, Clint.
-

953
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,440
We're going in three, two...

954
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
one.

955
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,280
LILA: Cooper?

956
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,000
Where are my headphones?

957
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,080
Lila?

958
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,280
-COOPER: I never had them.
-Lila?

959
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,080
LILA: Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

960
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,960
Lila! Lila!

961
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,480
Yeah, Dad?

962
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,400
Dad?

963
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,160
Lila!

964
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,440
Hey. Hey, look at me.

965
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,720
You okay?

966
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,560
It worked.

967
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,720
It worked.

968
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,680
STEVE: Okay, so the how works.

969
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,400
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

970
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,000
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

971
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,840
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

972
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,520
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

973
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,760
for "damn near been killed"

974
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,280
by one of
the six Infinity Stones.

975
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,600
Well, I haven't...

976
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,680
but I don't even know

977
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,120
what the hell
you're all talking about.

978
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,160
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

979
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,040
for one round-trip each.

980
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,400
And these stones have been

981
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,400
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

982
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,880
Our history.

983
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,040
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

984
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,000
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

985
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,720
Correct.

986
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,680
So, let's start
with the Aether.

987
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,040
Thor, what do you know?

988
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,840
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

989
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,560
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

990
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,320
Uh, where to start? Um...

991
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,520
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

992
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,800
Someone called it
a stone before.

993
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,200
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

994
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,000
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

995
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,240
and stop saying that.

996
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,240
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

997
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,280
My grandfather,
many years ago...

998
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,960
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

999
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,840
Scary beings.

1000
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,720
So, Jane, actually...

1001
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,840
Oh, there she is.

1002
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,680
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1003
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,880
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1004
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,880
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1005
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,080
and she became
very, very sick.

1006
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,160
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1007
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,400
which is where I'm from...

1008
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,520
and we had to try and fix her.

1009
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,320
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1010
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,880
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1011
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,240
who's dead and, um...

1012
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,160
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1013
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,160
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1014
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,480
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1015
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,960
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1016
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,880
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

1017
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,600
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1018
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,120
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1019
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,360
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1020
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,640
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1021
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,440
-SMART HULK: Is that a person?
-No, Morag's a planet.

1022
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,520
Quill was a person.

1023
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,600
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1024
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,200
Oh, look.

1025
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,960
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1026
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,320
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1027
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,600
I'll take you to space.

1028
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,920
NEBULA: Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1029
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,040
What is Vormir?

1030
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,360
NEBULA: A dominion of death...

1031
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,960
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1032
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,880
It's where
Thanos murdered my sister.

1033
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,320
Not it.

1034
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,720
NATASHA: That Time Stone guy.
SMART HULK: Doctor Strange.

1035
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,680
NATASHA: Yeah,
what kind of doctor was he?

1036
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,800
TONY: Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1037
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,360
SMART HULK: Nice place
in the Village, though.

1038
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,040
TONY: Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1039
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,240
SMART HULK:
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1040
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,440
Wait, he lived in New York?

1041
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,080
TONY: No, he lived in Toronto.

1042
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,200
Uh, yeah,
on Bleecker and Sullivan.

1043
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,280
Have you been listening
to anything?

1044
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,360
Guys.

1045
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,120
If you pick the right year,

1046
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,840
there are three stones
in New York.

1047
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,000
Shut the front door.

1048
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,880
STEVE: All right.
We have a plan.

1049
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,640
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1050
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,200
STEVE: Five years ago,
we lost.

1051
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,840
All of us.

1052
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,160
We lost friends.

1053
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,520
We lost family.

1054
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,320
We lost a part of ourselves.

1055
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,120
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

1056
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,360
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

1057
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,120
Get the stones. Get them back.

1058
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,120
One round-trip each.

1059
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,360
No mistakes...

1060
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,600
no do-overs.

1061
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,640
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1062
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,640
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1063
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
Be careful.

1064
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,720
Look out for each other.

1065
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,960
This is the fight
of our lives...

1066
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,440
and we're gonna win.

1067
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,600
Whatever it takes.

1068
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,320
Good luck.

1069
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,560
He's pretty good at that.

1070
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,920
-Right?
-TONY: All right.

1071
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,080
You heard the man.

1072
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,400
Stroke those keys,
Jolly Green.

1073
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,920
SMART HULK: Trackers engaged.

1074
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,520
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

1075
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,080
Okay, I'll do my best.

1077
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,040
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1078
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,240
-See ya in a minute.

1079
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,960
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1080
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,360
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1081
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,440
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

1082
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,720
Maybe smash
a few things along the way.

1083
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1084
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,040
ANCIENT ONE:
I'd be careful going that way.

1085
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,720
We just had the floors waxed.

1086
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,680
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

1087
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,160
You're about
five years too early.

1088
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,080
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1089
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,680
about 20 blocks that way.

1090
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,480
What do you want from him?

1091
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,360
That, actually.

1092
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,440
Ah!

1093
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,600
I'm afraid not.

1094
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,400
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1095
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,320
You don't want to do this.

1096
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,120
Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1097
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,720
and I don't have time
to debate it.

1098
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,320
Let's start over, shall we?

1099
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,480
ASGARDIAN MAIDEN:
For you, Lady Jane.

1100
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,920
JANE: Um, so you have anything
with pants?

1101
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,200
ASGARDIAN MAIDEN: Pants?

1102
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,400
JANE: Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1103
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,160
ASGARDIAN MAIDEN: Yes, milady.
THOR: Oh, there's Jane.

1104
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,800
All right.

1105
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,640
Here's the deal, tubby.

1106
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,840
You're gonna charm her,

1107
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,200
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1108
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,800
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1109
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,680
I'll be right back, okay?

1110
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,520
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1111
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,560
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1112
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,120
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

1113
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,040
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1114
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,400
If you could send Loki
some soup.

1115
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,480
Yes, milady.

1116
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,600
And ask our librarians

1117
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,520
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1118
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,200
Who's the fancy broad?

1119
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,040
That's my mother.

1120
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,280
She dies today.

1121
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,720
Oh, that is today?

1122
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,800
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1123
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,960
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1124
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,240
It's a bad idea!

1125
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,560
-Come here.
-No, no, no.

1126
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,160
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1127
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,240
Come here. Right here.

1128
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,320
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1129
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,840
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1130
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,760
What do you think
we're doing here?

1131
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,080
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1132
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,680
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1133
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,240
all gone.

1134
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,320
I get you miss your mom...

1135
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,800
but she's gone.

1136
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,960
Really gone.

1137
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,400
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1138
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,680
and you can help them.

1139
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,320
So, is it too much to ask

1140
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,000
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1141
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,480
make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...

1142
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,800
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1143
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,560
and help me
get my family back?

1144
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,240
Okay.

1145
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,520
Are you crying?

1146
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,440
No.

1147
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,440
Yes.

1148
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,840
I feel like I'm losing it.

1149
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Get it together!

1150
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,000
-You can do this.
-

1151
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,680
You can do this.

1152
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,840
All right?

1153
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yes, I can.

1154
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,160
Good.

1155
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,720
I can do this. I can do this.

1156
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,000
I can't do this.

1157
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,040
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1158
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,600
This is our shot.

1159
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,360
Thor? Thor!

1160
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,000
WAR MACHINE: All right,
bring it down, Blue.

1161
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,560
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1162
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,920
-Hey, can we hurry it up?

1163
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,160
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1164
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,080
All that is really helpful.

1165
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,800
-Take care, okay?
-Yeah.

1166
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,440
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1167
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,640
-Hey.
-We got this.

1168
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,000
-Let's get it done.
-Yes, sir.

1169
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,480
I'll see you back.

1170
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,520
You guys watch
each other's six.

1171
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,440
Yeah.

1172
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,640
NEBULA: Coordinates for Vormir
are laid in.

1173
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,200
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1174
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,480
We're a long way
from Budapest.

1175
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,880
Okay, so, uh...

1176
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,360
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1177
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,360
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

1178
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,760
Let's take cover.

1179
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,840
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1180
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,360
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about right now?

1181
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,760
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1182
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,800
My father...

1183
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,760
my sister...

1184
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,080
and me.

1185
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,400
And you?

1186
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,880
Where are you right now?

1187
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,720
GAMORA: You're welcome.

1188
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,200
I didn't ask for your help.

1189
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,480
And yet, you always need it.

1190
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,920
-

1191
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,520
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1192
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,680
Why?

1193
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,880
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1194
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,840
2014 NEBULA: Where?

1195
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,760
GAMORA: On a planet
called Morag.

1196
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,280
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1197
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,480
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1198
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,840
It's a start.

1199
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,800
If he gets all of them...

1200
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,560
Ronan's located
the Power Stone.

1201
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,360
I'm dispatching you
to his ship.

1202
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,720
He won't like that.

1203
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,040
His alternative is death.

1204
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,280
Ronan's obsession...

1205
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,480
clouds his judgment.

1206
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,720
We will not fail you, Father.

1207
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,400
No, you won't.

1208
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,080
I swear...

1209
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,880
I will make you proud.

1210
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,920
...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1211
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,120
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

1212
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,840
NEBULA: Let's take cover.

1213
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,760
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1214
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,600
Who was that?

1215
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,120
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1216
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,560
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1217
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,560
Shh.

1218
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,840
Bring her to my ship.

1219
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,320
IRON MAN: Better hustle, Cap.

1220
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,560
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1221
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,360
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Got it. I'm
approaching the elevator now.

1222
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,400
LOKI: If it's all the same
to you...

1223
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,240
I'll have that drink now.

1224
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,240
2012 IRON MAN: All right,
get him on his feet.

1225
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,440
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1226
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,920
By the way,
feel free to clean up.

1227
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,080
Mr. Rogers, I almost
forgot that that suit...

1228
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,960
did nothing for your ass.

1229
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,440
CAPTAIN AMERICA: No one
asked you to look, Tony.

1230
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,520
It's ridiculous.

1231
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,720
ANT-MAN:
I think you look great, Cap.

1232
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,240
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

1233
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,280
2012 BLACK WIDOW:
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1234
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,560
2012 CAPTAIN AMERICA:
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

1235
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,800
-coming to secure it.
-

1236
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,480
SITWELL: We can take that
off your hands.

1237
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,640
By all means.

1238
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,600
Careful with that thing.

1239
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,240
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1240
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,400
And not in a fun way.

1241
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,520
We promise to be careful.

1242
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,760
Who are these guys?

1243
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,200
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1244
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,480
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1245
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,800
ANT-MAN: Seriously?
You didn't?

1246
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,480
I mean,
they look like bad guys.

1247
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,040
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1248
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,040
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1249
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,200
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1250
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,800
I mean, honestly, how do you
keep your food down?

1251
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,400
Shut up.

1252
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,280
Ooh. All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1253
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,560
There's our stone.

1254
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,720
ANT-MAN: All right.

1255
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,080
Flick me.

1256
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,240
-Move.
-Hey.

1257
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,080
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Hey, hey. Buddy!

1258
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,040
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

1259
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,200
-Take the stairs.

1260
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,960
2012 TONY: Yeah. Stop, stop.

1261
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,400
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

1262
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,880
All right, Cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1263
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,840
just passing the 80th floor.

1264
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,640
On it.

1265
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
Head to the lobby.

1266
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,360
IRON MAN: All right,
I'll see you there.

1267
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,320
SITWELL: Evidence secure.

1268
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,920
We're en route to Doctor List.

1269
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,480
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1270
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,680
Captain.

1271
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,880
I thought
you were coordinating

1272
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:27,960
search and rescue.

1273
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,600
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Change of plans.

1274
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,840
Hey, Cap.

1275
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,160
Rumlow.

1276
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,320
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1277
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,360
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1278
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,120
Sir?
I don't understand.

1279
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,400
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1280
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,160
Sorry, Cap.

1281
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,760
We can't give you the scepter.

1282
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,200
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1283
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,480
That's okay. Trust me.

1284
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Hail Hydra.

1285
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,600
So many stairs!

1286
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,960
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1287
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,200
It is go time.

1288
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,360
Bombs away.

1289
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,000
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1290
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,480
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1291
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,640
Can we focus, please?

1292
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,040
ANT-MAN:
I'm going inside you...

1293
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,760
now.

1294
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,160
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

1295
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,600
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1296
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,760
Alexander Pierce.

1297
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,160
He's the man above the folks

1298
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,400
-behind Nick Fury.
-Oh.

1299
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,680
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1300
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,760
I'm gonna have to ask you

1301
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,160
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1302
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,120
Uh, Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1303
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,280
PIERCE: No, he's going
to answer to us.

1304
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,640
Odin can have what's left.

1305
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,280
And I'm gonna need that case.

1306
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,240
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1307
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,400
Hand over the case, Stark.

1308
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,960
All right,
move it, Stuart Little.

1309
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,240
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1310
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,040
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1311
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,800
ANT-MAN: You promise me
you won't die?

1312
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,680
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1313
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,400
ANT-MAN:
That doesn't sound mild.

1314
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,600
I need the case.

1315
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,040
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying,

1316
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,480
-jurisdiction...
-Okay, then give me the case.

1317
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,640
2012 TONY:
Well, jurisdiction...

1318
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,720
AGENT: Hand it over.

1319
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,800
Do it, Lang!

1320
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,880
Get your hands off me.

1321
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,440
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1322
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,160
ANT-MAN: Here goes!

1323
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,520
-Stark?
-2012 THOR: Stark?

1324
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,040
AGENT: He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1325
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,800
-Medic!
-Medic!

1326
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,720
Give these guys some help.

1327
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,480
-2012 THOR: Speak to me.
-

1328
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,360
Stark,
is it your chest machine?

1329
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,440
Breathe, breathe.

1330
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,960
TONY: Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1331
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,040
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1332
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,480
No stairs!

1333
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,960
Uh... Come on, Stark,
stay with us.

1334
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,040
I'm going to try something.
Okay?

1335
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,280
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1336
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,120
-Yes!

1337
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,640
Oh, that worked a treat.

1338
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,800
Dude, that was so crazy.

1339
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,360
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1340
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,400
-The case.
-The case is, uh...

1341
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1342
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,560
Loki!

1343
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,120
ANT-MAN: That wasn't supposed
to happen, was it?

1344
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,280
Oh, we blew it.

1345
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,880
Loki?

1346
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,200
Tony, what's going on?

1347
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,880
Tell me you found that Cube.

1348
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,160
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

1349
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,480
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

1350
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,000
I'm not Loki...

1351
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,240
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1352
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,160
I can do this all day.

1353
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,600
Yeah, I know.

1354
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,800
I know.

1355
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,520
Where did you get this?

1356
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,880
Bucky is alive.

1357
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,440
What?

1358
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,920
That is America's ass.

1359
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,400
BANNER: Please, please.

1360
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,360
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1361
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,720
If I give up the Time Stone

1362
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,520
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1363
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,440
With all due respect,
all right...

1364
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,680
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1365
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,280
The Infinity Stones create

1366
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,640
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1367
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,320
Remove one of the stones...

1368
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,600
and that flow splits.

1369
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,200
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1370
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,520
but my new one, not so much.

1371
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,600
In this new branch reality...

1372
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,440
without our chief weapon

1373
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,840
against the forces
of darkness...

1374
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,200
our world would be overrun.

1375
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,040
Millions will suffer.

1376
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,480
So, tell me, Doctor.

1377
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,240
Can your science
prevent all that?

1378
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,400
No...

1379
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,520
but we can erase it.

1380
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,400
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1381
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,720
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1382
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,400
at the moment it was taken.

1383
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,040
So, chronologically...

1384
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,120
in that reality...

1385
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,360
it never left.

1386
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,840
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1387
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,880
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1388
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,640
We will. I will. I promise.

1389
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,520
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1390
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,920
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1391
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,800
to protect the Time Stone.

1392
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,080
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1393
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,120
What did you say?

1394
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,600
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1395
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,840
-Willingly?
-Yes.

1396
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,400
-Why?
-I have no idea.

1397
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,240
Maybe he made a mistake.

1398
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,680
Or I did.

1399
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,360
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1400
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:01,040
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1401
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,440
I fear you might be right.

1402
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,640
Thank you.

1403
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,560
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1404
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,800
We all are.

1405
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,840
Run diagnostics.

1406
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,520
Show me her memory file.

1407
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,600
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1408
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,720
It was a memory, but not hers.

1409
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,360
There's another
consciousness...

1410
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,840
sharing her network.

1411
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,720
Another Nebula.

1412
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,320
Impossible.

1413
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,120
EBONY MAW: This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1414
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,200
from nine years in the future.

1415
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,280
Where is this other Nebula?

1416
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,960
EBONY MAW: In our solar system
on Morag.

1417
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,800
Can you access her?

1418
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,000
EBONY MAW:
Yes, the two are linked.

1419
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,240
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1420
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,600
for Infinity Stones.

1421
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,320
BANNER:
And these stones have been

1422
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,120
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1423
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,360
Our history.

1424
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,600
So, not a lot
of convenient spots

1425
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,880
to just drop in.

1426
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,720
BARTON: Which means
we have to pick our targets.

1427
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,160
TONY: Correct.
THANOS: Freeze image.

1428
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,360
GAMORA: Terrans.

1429
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,080
Avengers.

1430
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,880
Unruly wretches.

1431
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,560
What's that reflection?

1432
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,360
Amplify this, Maw.

1433
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,080
GAMORA: I don't understand.

1434
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,360
Two Nebulas.

1435
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,960
THANOS: No.
The same Nebula...

1436
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,520
from two different times.

1437
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,400
Set course for Morag.

1438
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,960
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1439
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,080
I wanna see everything.

1440
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,920
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1441
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,440
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1442
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,840
What are you doing?

1443
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,080
-

1444
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,680
-FRIGGA: Oh, God!

1445
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,280
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1446
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,280
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1447
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,800
What are you wearing?

1448
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,320
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1449
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,360
THOR: Mm...

1450
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,800
What's wrong with your eye?

1451
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,960
Oh, my eye.

1452
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,080
Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...

1453
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,520
when I got hit in the face

1454
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,360
with the broadsword?

1455
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,920
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

1456
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,400
Yes, I am.

1457
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,400
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1458
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,760
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1459
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,800
I was raised by witches, boy.

1460
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,200
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1461
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,560
Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1462
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,320
Yes, you are, honey.

1463
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,000
I really need to talk to you.

1464
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,160
We can talk.

1465
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,280
His head was over there...

1466
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,400
and his body over there...

1467
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,200
I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1468
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,480
I was just standing there.

1469
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,200
Some idiot with an axe.

1470
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,080
FRIGGA: Now, you're no idiot.

1471
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,800
You're here, aren't you?

1472
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,480
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1473
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,840
I am. Yes.

1474
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,360
FRIGGA: Idiot, no.

1475
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,000
A failure?

1476
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,320
Absolutely.

1477
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,280
That's a little bit harsh.

1478
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,920
Do you know
what that makes you?

1479
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,160
Just like everyone else.

1480
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,400
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1481
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,600
FRIGGA: Mm.

1482
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,840
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1483
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,600
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1484
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,160
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1485
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,880
I've really missed you, Mom.

1486
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,520
Thor! I got it!

1487
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,920
ASGARDIAN GUARD:
Get that rabbit!

1488
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,520
Mom, I have to tell you
something.

1489
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,480
No, son, you don't.

1490
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,160
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1491
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,960
This is about your future.

1492
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,480
Uh, it's none of my business.

1493
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,600
-

1494
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,720
Hi.

1495
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,920
You must be Mom.

1496
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,520
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1497
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,160
Oh, I wish we had more time.

1498
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,160
No, this was a gift.

1499
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,760
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1500
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,360
-I love you, Mom.
-I love you.

1501
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,760
And eat a salad.

1502
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,880
Come on, we gotta go.

1503
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,640
-Goodbye.
-ROCKET: Three...

1504
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,880
-Two...
-No, wait!

1505
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,360
What am I looking at?

1506
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,960
Oh, sometimes
it takes a second.

1507
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,480
I'm still worthy.

1508
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,520
Oh, boy.

1509
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,640
-Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1510
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,480
So, he's an idiot?

1511
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,240
Yeah.

1512
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:09,960
RHODES: What's that?

1513
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,000
The tool of a thief.

1514
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,920
RHODES: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1515
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,400
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1516
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,040
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1517
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,360
What are you talking about?

1518
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,560
When you break into
a place called

1519
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,840
"The Temple
of the Power Stone"...

1520
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,320
there's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1521
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,720
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1522
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,520
I wasn't always like this.

1523
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,440
Me either.

1524
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,680
But we work
with what we got, right?

1525
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,480
Hmm.

1526
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,120
Let's sync up.

1527
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,440
Three, two, one.

1528
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,920
BANNER:
You murdered trillions!

1529
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,400
THANOS:
You should be grateful.

1530
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,720
NATASHA:
Where are the stones?

1531
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,880
Gone.

1532
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,640
Reduced to atoms.

1533
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,040
BANNER: You used them
two days ago!

1534
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,320
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

1535
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,320
It nearly killed me.

1536
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,400
But the work is done.

1537
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,400
It always will be.

1538
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:01,160
I am inevitable.

1539
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,440
What did you do to them?

1540
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,880
Nothing.

1541
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,040
Yet.

1542
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,760
They're not trying
to stop something

1543
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,560
I'm going to do in our time.

1544
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,880
They're trying
to undo something

1545
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,520
I've already done in theirs.

1546
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,360
The stones.

1547
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,160
I found them all.

1548
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,360
I won.

1549
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,040
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1550
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,800
This is your future.

1551
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,200
It's my destiny.

1552
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,440
NEBULA:
My father is many things.

1553
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,440
A liar is not one of them.

1554
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,120
Ah.

1555
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,080
Thank you, daughter.

1556
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,400
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

1557
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,800
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1558
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,600
Sire...

1559
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,880
your daughter...

1560
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,360
NEBULA: No!

1561
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,840
...is a traitor.

1562
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,480
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1563
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,800
I would never betray you.

1564
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,800
Never. Never.

1565
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,720
THANOS: I know.

1566
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,960
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

1567
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,320
No!

1568
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,240
He knows!

1569
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,880
Barton! Barton, come in.

1570
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,800
Romanoff!

1571
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:42,840
Come in, we have a problem.

1572
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,120
Come on!

1573
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,720
Come in, we have a...

1574
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,240
Thanos knows.

1575
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,120
Thanos...

1576
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:03,960
TONY: Cap.

1577
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,840
Sorry, buddy,
we got a problem.

1578
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,000
Yeah, we do.

1579
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,680
STEVE: Well,
what are we gonna do now?

1580
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,840
TONY: You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1581
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,280
I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.

1582
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,920
You said
that we had one shot.

1583
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,440
This was our shot.

1584
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1585
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,200
-It was six stones or nothing.
-You're repeating yourself,

1586
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,320
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1587
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,120
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1588
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,200
Dude. Come on!

1589
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,320
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1590
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,400
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1591
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,680
-I dropped the ball.
-You ruined the time heist.

1592
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,160
TONY: Is that what I did?
SCOTT: Yeah.

1593
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,000
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1594
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,400
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1595
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,800
There's no do-overs.

1596
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,040
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1597
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,120
Each.

1598
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,520
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1599
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,840
bye-bye,
you're not going home.

1600
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:44,000
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1601
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,320
then no one else
is going home, either.

1602
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,480
I got it.

1603
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,960
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1604
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,760
and acquire new particles.

1605
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:53,640
Little stroll down
memory lane.

1606
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,240
Military installation,
Garden State.

1607
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,640
When were they both there?

1608
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,160
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1609
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,840
-How vague?
-SCOTT: What are you

1610
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:06,960
talking about?
Where are we going?

1611
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,040
TONY: I know for a fact
they were there.

1612
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:09,120
Who's they? What are we doing?

1613
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,320
And I know how I know.

1614
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,760
SCOTT: Guys, what is it?

1615
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,960
Looks like we're improvising.

1616
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,360
-Great.
-What are we improvising?

1617
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,200
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1618
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,360
TONY: Suit up.

1619
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,040
-What's in New Jersey?
-TONY: 0-4.

1620
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,120
0-4.

1621
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,320
-TONY: Uh, 0-7.
-0-7.

1622
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,280
-Excuse me.
-1-9-7-0.

1623
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:27,760
Are you sure?

1624
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,120
SCOTT: Cap? Captain?

1625
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,120
Steve? Sorry.

1626
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,920
America. Rogers.

1627
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,280
Look, if you do this...

1628
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,120
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1629
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,000
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1630
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,240
You trust me?

1631
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,280
I do.

1632
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,680
Your call.

1633
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:49,280
Here we go.

1634
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,960
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1635
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,520
TONY: Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1636
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,200
STEVE: The idea of me was.

1637
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,920
TONY: Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1638
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:25,360
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1639
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,240
where do you hide it?

1640
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,080
In plain sight.

1641
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,640
Good luck
on your mission, Captain.

1642
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,320
Good luck
on your project, Doctor.

1643
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,840
You new here?

1644
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,720
Not exactly.

1645
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,240
Come on, you bastard.

1646
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,520
Gotcha.

1647
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,400
Whew.

1648
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,720
Back in the game.

1649
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,600
HOWARD: Arnim, you in there?

1650
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,600
Arnim?

1651
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,240
Hey!

1652
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,600
The door is this way, pal.

1653
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,480
Oh, yeah.

1654
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,520
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1655
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:09,120
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1656
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,960
Pardon me.

1657
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,320
Do I know you?

1658
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:16,560
No, sir. Uh...

1659
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,840
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1660
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,520
Oh. MIT.

1661
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,120
Got a name?

1662
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,720
Howard.

1663
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,360
-That'll be easy to remember.
-Howard...

1664
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,360
Potts.

1665
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,160
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1666
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,360
Hi.

1667
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,720
Shake that, don't pull it.

1668
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:35,880
Yeah.

1669
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,520
You look a little green around
the gills, there, Potts.

1670
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,840
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1671
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,720
You wanna get some air?

1672
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:48,080
-Hello, Potts.
-Yeah.

1673
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,480
-That'd be swell.
-That way.

1674
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:50,640
Okay.

1675
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,440
Need your briefcase?

1676
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,360
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

1677
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,000
HANK PYM: Hello?
STEVE:  Doctor Pym?

1678
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,360
HANK PYM: That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1679
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,800
This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.

1680
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,080
We have a package for you.

1681
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,640
Oh, bring it up.

1682
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,760
That's the thing, sir,
we can't.

1683
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,520
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1684
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,040
Well, it's just...

1685
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,680
Sir, the box is glowing...

1686
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,840
and to be honest,

1687
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,640
some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.

1688
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,520
They didn't open it, did they?

1689
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,840
Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.

1690
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,600
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1691
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,320
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1692
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,520
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1693
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,520
And too much time
at the office.

1694
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,720
Congratulations.

1695
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,040
-Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
-Yeah, sure.

1696
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,200
-How far along is she?
-Uh, I don't know.

1697
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,120
She's at the point where

1698
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,760
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1699
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,360
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1700
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,280
I have a little girl.

1701
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,960
A girl would be nice.

1702
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,120
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1703
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,240
What'd be so awful about that?

1704
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,440
Let's just say
that the greater good

1705
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,800
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1706
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,000
GUARD: And you've never seen
these two men before?

1707
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,880
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1708
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,080
Can you describe them?

1709
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,320
One of them
had a hippie beard.

1710
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,640
GUARD: Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1711
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:52,840
FEMALE AGENT:
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1712
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,040
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1713
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,280
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1714
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,240
We have a potential breach.

1715
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,120
PEGGY: I said bring them in.

1716
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,280
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

1717
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,400
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1718
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,520
Oh, for the love of...

1719
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,080
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1720
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:47,120
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1721
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,160
TONY: So, where you at
with names?

1722
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,480
HOWARD: Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1723
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,600
TONY: Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1724
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,120
-You got time.
-Uh-huh.

1725
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,000
Let me ask you a question.

1726
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,280
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1727
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,920
-Wildly.
-

1728
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,720
-Yeah.
-Did you feel qualified?

1729
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,760
Like you had any idea

1730
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,480
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1731
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,720
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1732
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,920
I thought about
what my dad did.

1733
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,640
My old man,

1734
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,480
he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1735
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,640
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1736
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,120
And now, looking back on it,

1737
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,520
I just remember
the good stuff.

1738
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,240
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1739
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,800
Yeah? Like what?

1740
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,440
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1741
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,800
Smart guy.

1742
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,680
He did his best.

1743
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:49,560
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1744
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:52,000
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1745
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,160
Good to meet you, Potts.

1746
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,640
Yeah.

1747
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,240
Howard...

1748
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,400
everything's gonna be
all right.

1749
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,680
Thank you...

1750
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:13,960
for everything...

1751
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,680
you've done for this country.

1752
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,680
HOWARD: Jarvis.

1753
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,920
Have we ever met that guy?

1754
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,440
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1755
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,680
Seems very familiar.

1756
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,080
Weird beard.

1757
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,400
You're weak.

1758
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,040
I'm you.

1759
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,760
NEBULA: You could stop this.

1760
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,840
You know you want to.

1761
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:11,720
Did you see
what happens in the future?

1762
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,400
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1763
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,920
You wanna know
how he does that?

1764
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:24,480
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1765
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
That's enough.

1766
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,880
-

1767
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,240
You disgust me.

1768
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,440
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1769
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,840
How do I look?

1770
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,400
Wow.

1771
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,520
Under different
circumstances...

1772
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,720
this would be totally awesome.

1773
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,000
I bet the raccoon

1774
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,680
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1775
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,760
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1776
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,480
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1777
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,000
RED SKULL: Welcome.

1778
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,480
Natasha.

1779
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:49,640
Daughter of Ivan.

1780
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,120
Clint.

1781
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,560
Son of Edith.

1782
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,400
Who are you?

1783
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,480
Consider me a guide...

1784
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,320
to you...

1785
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,320
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1786
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:09,560
Oh, good.

1787
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:11,840
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1788
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,000
If only it were that easy.

1789
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:33,840
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1790
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,480
As does what you fear.

1791
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,280
The stone's down there.

1792
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,840
RED SKULL: For one of you.

1793
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,840
For the other...

1794
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,440
In order to take the stone...

1795
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,600
you must lose
that which you love.

1796
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:01,120
An everlasting exchange.

1797
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:06,240
A soul for a soul.

1798
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,400
BARTON: How's it going?

1799
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,040
Jesus.

1800
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,080
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1801
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,280
No.

1802
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:21,120
I don't think so.

1803
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,000
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1804
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:26,560
I didn't.

1805
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,400
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1806
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:32,640
without his daughter.

1807
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,880
That's not a coincidence.

1808
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,600
Yeah.

1809
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,200
Whatever it takes.

1810
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,200
Whatever it takes.

1811
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,520
If we don't get that stone...

1812
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,360
billions of people stay dead.

1813
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,400
Yeah.

1814
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,400
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1815
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,320
I guess we do.

1816
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,880
I'm starting to think we mean

1817
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:16,480
different people here,
Natasha.

1818
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,800
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1819
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,240
Get to right here.

1820
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,400
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1821
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,760
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1822
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,920
What, you think I wanna do it?

1823
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,280
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1824
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,760
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1825
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,880
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1826
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,360
You know what I've become.

1827
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,080
Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1828
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,480
Maybe you should.

1829
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,920
You didn't.

1830
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:59,280
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1831
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,600
Okay.

1832
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,880
You win.

1833
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:22,480
Tell my family I love 'em.

1834
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,400
You tell 'em yourself.

1835
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,280
Damn you.

1836
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,800
Wait.

1837
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,680
Let me go.

1838
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,920
No.

1839
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:24,680
No. Please, no.

1840
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:29,880
It's okay.

1841
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:32,920
Please.

1842
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,040
No!

1843
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:18,480
Did we get 'em all?

1844
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,720
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1845
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,760
Clint, where's Nat?

1846
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Do we know if she had family?

1847
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,320
Yeah.

1848
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,520
Us.

1849
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:03,960
What?

1850
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:05,840
Huh?

1851
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:07,160
-What are you doing?
-Just asked him a question.

1852
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,520
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

1853
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:09,800
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

1854
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,120
We have the stones, right?

1855
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,320
As long as we have
the stones...

1856
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,240
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1857
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,400
So, stop this shit. We're the
Avengers. Get it together.

1858
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,760
Can't get her back.

1859
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,040
What's he...?
What?

1860
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:23,400
It can't be undone.

1861
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,680
It can't.

1862
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:29,560
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

1863
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,320
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

1864
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,800
And we're talking
about space magic.

1865
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,960
And "can't" seems very
definitive. Don't you think?

1866
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,480
Yeah, look,
I know that I'm way outside

1867
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:37,960
my pay grade here.

1868
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,600
But she still
isn't here, is she?

1869
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,760
THOR: No, that's my point.

1870
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,880
It can't be undone.

1871
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:45,480
Or that's at least

1872
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:47,360
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1873
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:49,000
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

1874
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:52,240
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1875
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,800
It was supposed to be me.

1876
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:07,360
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1877
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,000
She bet her life on it.

1878
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,240
She's not coming back.

1879
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,480
We have to make it worth it.

1880
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:21,520
We have to.

1881
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,640
We will.

1882
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:50,440
Boom!

1883
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:57,560
All right, the glove's ready.

1884
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,960
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

1885
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:03,200
-I'll do it.
-TONY: Excuse me?

1886
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,360
THOR: It's okay.

1887
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,440
TONY: Stop, stop. Slow down.

1888
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:07,040
Thor. Just wait.

1889
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:09,040
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1890
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

1891
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,320
waiting for
the right opportunity?

1892
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:13,640
We should at least discuss it.

1893
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,760
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

1894
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,640
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

1895
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:20,200
I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

1896
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,600
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

1897
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:22,960
-Normally, you're right.
-It's my duty.

1898
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,920
-It's not about that.
-It's not that.

1899
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:26,880
-TONY: Hey, buddy...
-Stop it! Just let me.

1900
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,400
Just let me do it.

1901
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:34,080
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1902
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,240
Look, it's not
just the fact...

1903
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,520
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

1904
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,520
to light up a continent.

1905
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:39,680
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1906
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:42,920
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1907
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:44,120
Cheez Whiz?

1908
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:47,680
Lightning.

1909
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,960
-Yeah.
-Lightning.

1910
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,520
SMART HULK:
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1911
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,520
It's gotta be me.

1912
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,000
You saw what those stones
did to Thanos.

1913
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:57,720
They almost killed him.

1914
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:01,000
None of you could survive.

1915
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,360
STEVE: How do we know
you will?

1916
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,560
SMART HULK: We don't.

1917
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:07,400
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

1918
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,480
It's like...

1919
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:16,280
I was made for this.

1920
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:36,720
Good to go, yeah?

1921
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:39,840
Let's do it.

1922
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,400
Okay, remember,

1923
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:43,040
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago...

1924
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,680
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1925
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,280
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1926
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:49,840
Got it.

1927
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:07,480
IRON MAN:
Friday, do me a favor

1928
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,040
and activate
Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1929
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,480
FRIDAY: Yes, boss.

1930
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,920
Everybody comes home.

1931
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,760
Take it off! Take it off!

1932
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,040
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1933
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:49,400
-IRON MAN: Talk to me, Banner.

1934
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:53,600
I'm okay.

1935
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,360
I'm okay.

1936
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:27,960
STEVE: Bruce!

1937
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:31,280
Don't move him.

1938
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:40,160
-Did it work?
-We're not sure. It's okay.

1939
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,560
Honey.

1940
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:28,680
LAURA: Clint?

1941
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,080
Honey.

1942
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:32,280
Guys...

1943
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,120
I think it worked.

1944
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:20,600
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1945
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:21,760
-

1946
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,640
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1947
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:32,080
Rhodey, Rocket,
get out of here.

1948
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:34,800
ROCKET: Let me up! Let me up!

1949
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:36,280
Come on!

1950
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:47,280
Rhodey!

1951
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,160
ROCKET: Huh?

1952
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,520
RHODES: Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?

1953
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,840
We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!

1954
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,720
ANT-MAN: What? What?

1955
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:03,080
RHODES: We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1956
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,400
ANT-MAN: Wait! I'm here!

1957
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:07,080
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1958
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:27,920
Cap?

1959
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,040
Okay.

1960
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,440
Daughter.

1961
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,760
Yes, Father.

1962
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:18,360
So, this is the future.

1963
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:19,840
Well done.

1964
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,280
Thank you, Father.

1965
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,800
They suspected nothing.

1966
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,600
The arrogant never do.

1967
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:31,680
Go.

1968
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:35,080
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

1969
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:36,960
What will you do?

1970
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:39,960
Wait.

1971
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,840
Tell me something.

1972
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,400
In the future...

1973
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,440
what happens to you and me?

1974
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:16,360
I try to kill you.

1975
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:19,600
Several times.

1976
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:22,640
But eventually...

1977
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,760
we become friends.

1978
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:27,960
We become sisters.

1979
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:36,840
GAMORA: Come on.

1980
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:40,680
We can stop him.

1981
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:50,120
TONY: Come on, buddy,
wake up!

1982
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:52,120
-That's my man.

1983
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:55,080
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1984
02:06:58,600 --> 02:06:59,800
What happened?

1985
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:02,080
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1986
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:03,120
You'll see.

1987
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:26,600
What's he been doing?

1988
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,920
Absolutely nothing.

1989
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:33,560
STEVE: Where are the stones?

1990
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:35,760
Somewhere under all this.

1991
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,360
All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.

1992
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,280
So, we keep it that way.

1993
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,840
You know it's a trap, right?

1994
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,320
Yeah.

1995
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:45,840
I don't much care.

1996
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:47,600
Good.

1997
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,040
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

1998
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,800
Let's kill him
properly this time.

1999
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:15,120
You could not live
with your own failure.

2000
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:18,440
Where did that bring you?

2001
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:23,280
Back to me.

2002
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:29,520
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

2003
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:32,680
the other half would thrive.

2004
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:34,160
But you've shown me...

2005
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:37,080
that's impossible.

2006
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,320
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2007
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:43,960
there will always be those

2008
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:47,680
that are unable to accept
what can be.

2009
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,680
They will resist.

2010
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,120
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

2011
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,600
I'm thankful.

2012
02:08:56,760 --> 02:08:58,520
Because now...

2013
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:00,840
I know what I must do.

2014
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:04,240
I will shred this universe...

2015
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,440
down to its last atom.

2016
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,920
And then...

2017
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,400
with the stones
you've collected for me...

2018
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,320
create a new one...

2019
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,720
teeming with life...

2020
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:18,760
that knows not
what it has lost...

2021
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:21,280
but only
what it has been given.

2022
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:25,800
A grateful universe.

2023
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,760
Born out of blood.

2024
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:29,600
They'll never know it.

2025
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,720
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2026
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:49,600
See you
on the other side, man.

2027
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,960
ANT-MAN: Hang on! I'm coming!

2028
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,240
Yeah!

2029
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:41,680
Oh, hey.

2030
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,560
I know you.

2031
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,480
Father...

2032
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:49,640
I have the stones.

2033
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:50,720
What?

2034
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,040
GAMORA: Stop.

2035
02:10:58,240 --> 02:10:59,640
You're betraying us?

2036
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,960
You don't have to do this.

2037
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:12,280
I am this.

2038
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:14,360
No, you're not.

2039
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:16,720
You've seen what we become.

2040
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,000
Nebula, listen to her.

2041
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,360
You can change.

2042
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,520
He won't let me.

2043
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:37,880
No!

2044
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:58,920
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2045
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:16,840
FRIDAY: Boss, wake up!

2046
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:09,440
I knew it!

2047
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:34,640
In all my years of conquest...

2048
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,680
violence...

2049
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:40,720
slaughter...

2050
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,240
it was never personal.

2051
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:48,920
But I'll tell you now...

2052
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:54,720
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2053
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,200
annoying little planet...

2054
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:01,120
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2055
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:04,640
very, very much.

2056
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,440
Hey, Cap, you read me?

2057
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,760
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

2058
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,200
On your left.

2059
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:50,160
Is that everyone?

2060
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:52,520
What? You wanted more?

2061
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:21,000
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Avengers...

2062
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,240
assemble.

2063
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:03,680
M'BAKU: Die!

2064
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:27,080
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

2065
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:41,600
SPIDER-MAN: Hey!

2066
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:43,600
Holy cow!

2067
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:45,120
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2068
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:46,440
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2069
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,960
And I got all dusty?

2070
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:49,200
And I must've passed out,

2071
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:50,800
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2072
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:52,600
But Doctor Strange was there,
right? And he was like...

2073
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:54,280
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

2074
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:56,000
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

2075
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:57,120
-that he does all the time.
-He did? Oh, no.

2076
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:59,600
What are you doing?
Oh.

2077
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,120
Oh, this is nice.

2078
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:27,880
Gamora?

2079
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:38,960
I thought I lost you.

2080
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:43,480
Ow.

2081
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:46,480
-Don't touch me!

2082
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:51,320
You missed the first time.

2083
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:53,480
Then you got 'em
both the second time.

2084
02:20:55,480 --> 02:20:56,560
GAMORA: This is the one?

2085
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:57,760
Seriously?

2086
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:59,920
Your choices were him
or a tree.

2087
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:11,720
Cap!

2088
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,640
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2089
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:18,400
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2090
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:19,600
SMART HULK: No!

2091
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:22,720
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

2092
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:23,920
No way to get 'em back.

2093
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,480
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2094
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:26,480
ANT-MAN: Hold on!

2095
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:30,480
That wasn't
our only time machine.

2096
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:38,400
Anyone see an ugly brown van
out there?

2097
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:42,040
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2098
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,320
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2099
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:46,720
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

2100
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,400
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2101
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,080
We're on it, Cap.

2102
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:00,960
TONY: Hey.

2103
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:04,160
You said one out of
14 million, we win, yeah?

2104
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:06,080
Tell me this is it.

2105
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:08,360
If I tell you what happens...

2106
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:09,680
it won't happen.

2107
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:14,280
You better be right.

2108
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,080
It's a mess back here.

2109
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,080
It's dead.

2110
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:28,880
-What?
-It's dead.

2111
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,480
I have to hot-wire it.

2112
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:34,760
Where's Nebula?

2113
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:37,240
She's not responding.

2114
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:38,920
Sire...

2115
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:49,960
BLACK PANTHER: Clint!

2116
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,120
Give it to me.

2117
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:18,760
You took everything from me.

2118
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:21,480
I don't even know who you are.

2119
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:23,280
You will.

2120
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:46,680
SPIDER-MAN: I got it!

2121
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:50,280
Activate Instant Kill.

2122
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:15,080
Rain fire!

2123
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:17,680
But, sire, our troops!

2124
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:19,600
Just do it!

2125
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:42,160
PEPPER: Uh, is anyone else
seeing this?

2126
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:57,200
SPIDER-MAN: I got this!

2127
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:59,240
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

2128
02:24:59,560 --> 02:25:00,720
Help, somebody help!

2129
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:02,800
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2130
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:13,880
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2131
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,680
SPIDER-MAN: Hey!
Nice to meet you...

2132
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:20,680
Oh, my God!

2133
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:58,400
What the hell is this?

2134
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:00,240
Friday,
what are they firing at?

2135
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:02,320
FRIDAY: Something just
entered the upper atmosphere.

2136
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:17,720
Oh, yeah!

2137
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:40,040
Danvers,
we need an assist here.

2138
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:51,400
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

2139
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,440
Hey, Peter Parker.

2140
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:54,760
You got something for me?

2141
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:03,000
I don't know how you're gonna
get it through all of that.

2142
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:06,080
Don't worry.

2143
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:08,520
She's got help.

2144
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:59,840
I am inevitable.

2145
02:30:19,960 --> 02:30:21,520
And I...

2146
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:24,360
am...

2147
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:29,560
Iron Man.

2148
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:30,000
PETER: Mr. Stark?

2149
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:35,600
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

2150
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,320
It's Peter.

2151
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:40,240
Hey.

2152
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:44,320
We won, Mr. Stark.

2153
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:48,320
We won, Mr. Stark.

2154
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:52,800
We won!
You did it, sir, you did it.

2155
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:55,000
I'm sorry.

2156
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:56,160
Tony.

2157
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:10,880
Hey.

2158
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:12,880
Hey, Pep.

2159
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:18,280
Friday?

2160
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:21,200
FRIDAY:
Life functions critical.

2161
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:30,800
Tony?

2162
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:33,120
Look at me.

2163
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:37,720
We're gonna be okay.

2164
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:44,320
You can rest now.

2165
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:32,640
TONY: Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?

2166
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:35,000
But it doesn't
always roll that way.

2167
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:38,760
Maybe this time.

2168
02:35:40,320 --> 02:35:43,000
I'm hoping
if you play this back...

2169
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:46,000
it's in celebration.

2170
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,920
I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.

2171
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,680
And something like
a normal version

2172
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:55,040
of the planet
has been restored.

2173
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:57,160
If there ever was
such a thing.

2174
02:35:57,720 --> 02:36:00,720
God, what a world.
Universe, now.

2175
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:03,680
If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...

2176
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:05,880
let alone to this extent,
I mean,

2177
02:36:05,960 --> 02:36:07,520
I wouldn't have
been surprised...

2178
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,320
but come on, who knew?

2179
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:12,280
The epic forces
of darkness and light

2180
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:14,120
that have come into play.

2181
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,000
And for better or worse...

2182
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:17,840
that's the reality
Morgan's gonna

2183
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,320
have to find a way
to grow up in.

2184
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:24,320
So, I thought I'd probably

2185
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:25,400
better record
a little greeting...

2186
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:29,200
in the case of an untimely
death. On my part.

2187
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:32,600
Not that death at any time
isn't untimely.

2188
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:35,160
This time travel thing
that we're gonna

2189
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:36,840
try and pull off tomorrow...

2190
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:38,000
it's got me
scratching my head

2191
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:39,240
about the survivability
of it all.

2192
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:40,840
That's the thing.

2193
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:44,720
Then again,
that's the hero gig, right?

2194
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:46,000
Part of the journey
is the end.

2195
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
What am I even tripping for?

2196
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:50,240
Everything is gonna work out

2197
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:53,240
exactly the way
it's supposed to.

2198
02:36:56,760 --> 02:36:58,400
I love you 3,000.

2199
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:15,800
You know,
I wish there was a way

2200
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:17,080
that I could let her know.

2201
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:21,720
That we won.

2202
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,800
We did it.

2203
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:30,200
She knows.

2204
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:37,160
They both do.

2205
02:39:46,120 --> 02:39:47,200
HAPPY: How you doing, squirt?

2206
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:48,400
Good.

2207
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:49,880
-You good?
-Mm-hmm.

2208
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:52,760
-Good. You hungry?
-Mm-hmm.

2209
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:54,160
What do you want?

2210
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,320
Cheeseburgers.

2211
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:03,360
You know,
your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2212
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:04,920
Okay.

2213
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:09,760
I'm gonna get you all
the cheeseburgers you want.

2214
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:10,960
Okay.

2215
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:29,120
VALKYRIE: So...

2216
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:31,560
when can we expect you back?

2217
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:34,960
Um, about that...

2218
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:37,400
Thor, your people need a king.

2219
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:39,440
No, they already have one.

2220
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:42,560
That's funny.

2221
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,000
Are you being serious?

2222
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:55,920
It's time for me
to be who I am...

2223
02:40:56,480 --> 02:40:59,080
rather than
who I'm supposed to be.

2224
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:02,120
But you, you're a leader.

2225
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:04,440
That's who you are.

2226
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,920
You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.

2227
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:10,600
I'm counting on it...

2228
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:12,240
Your Majesty.

2229
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:23,600
What will you do?

2230
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:25,760
I'm not sure.

2231
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:28,000
For the first time
in a thousand years,

2232
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:29,480
I have no path.

2233
02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:31,080
I do have a ride though.

2234
02:41:31,240 --> 02:41:33,200
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2235
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:39,240
THOR: Oh, here we are!

2236
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:41,240
Tree, good to see you.

2237
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:49,120
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2238
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:51,440
Where to first?

2239
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:53,600
Hey.

2240
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:56,160
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2241
02:41:56,320 --> 02:41:57,360
I'm in charge.

2242
02:41:57,880 --> 02:42:00,440
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2243
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:02,120
Of course.

2244
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:07,320
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2245
02:42:07,480 --> 02:42:08,520
It makes you think that maybe

2246
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:10,000
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

2247
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:11,920
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2248
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:13,120
Quail?

2249
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:15,520
Okay? I am merely trying to
be of service and assisting.

2250
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,920
Quill.

2251
02:42:17,080 --> 02:42:17,960
That's what I said.

2252
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:20,480
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2253
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:22,040
Sounds fair.

2254
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:27,160
-It's not necessary, okay?
-It's not.

2255
02:42:27,320 --> 02:42:28,320
ROCKET: I got some blasters,

2256
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:29,720
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

2257
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:32,080
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2258
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:33,320
Yeah. Knives.

2259
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:35,040
I am Groot.

2260
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:42,160
Not necessary.

2261
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:43,800
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2262
02:42:43,960 --> 02:42:46,960
Everybody knows
who's in charge.

2263
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:51,760
Me.

2264
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:53,680
Right?

2265
02:42:57,080 --> 02:42:59,480
Of course! Of course.

2266
02:42:59,640 --> 02:43:01,320
Of course.

2267
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:04,600
SMART HULK: Remember...

2268
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:06,640
you have to return the stones

2269
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:07,760
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2270
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:08,920
or you're gonna open up

2271
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,120
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

2272
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:12,280
Don't worry, Bruce.

2273
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:14,720
Clip all the branches.

2274
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:17,000
You know, I tried.

2275
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:20,320
When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2276
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:22,520
I really tried
to bring her back.

2277
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:27,440
I miss her, man.

2278
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:28,800
Me too.

2279
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:35,320
SAM: You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2280
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:39,360
You're a good man, Sam.

2281
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:41,440
This one's on me, though.

2282
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:47,840
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2283
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:50,920
How can I?

2284
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:52,880
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2285
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:02,240
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2286
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,120
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2287
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:13,320
How long is this gonna take?

2288
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:16,320
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2289
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:22,640
You ready, Cap?

2290
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:25,240
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

2291
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:27,040
You bet.

2292
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:30,120
SMART HULK: Going quantum.
Three...

2293
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:31,520
two...

2294
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:33,400
one.

2295
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:37,320
And returning in five...

2296
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:38,480
four...

2297
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:40,480
three, two...

2298
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:41,960
one.

2299
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:50,240
Where is he?

2300
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:52,160
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2301
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:53,760
He should be here.

2302
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:00,200
SAM: Get him back.

2303
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:01,480
SMART HULK: I'm trying.
SAM: Get him the hell back.

2304
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:03,520
-Hey, I said I'm trying.
-Sam.

2305
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:29,080
Go ahead.

2306
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:47,840
Cap?

2307
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:51,920
Hi, Sam.

2308
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:57,960
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2309
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:03,920
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2310
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,400
maybe...

2311
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:11,680
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2312
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:15,800
How'd that work out for ya?

2313
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:19,720
It was beautiful.

2314
02:46:21,080 --> 02:46:22,760
Good. I'm happy for you.

2315
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:24,000
Truly.

2316
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:26,040
Thank you.

2317
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:28,600
Only thing bumming me out...

2318
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,360
is the fact
I have to live in a world

2319
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:32,360
without Captain America.

2320
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:34,120
STEVE: Oh.

2321
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:38,960
That reminds me.

2322
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:48,680
Try it on.

2323
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:15,680
How does it feel?

2324
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:20,000
Like it's someone else's.

2325
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:24,200
It isn't.

2326
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:39,120
Thank you.

2327
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:42,160
I'll do my best.

2328
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:49,440
That's why it's yours.

2329
02:47:51,160 --> 02:47:52,520
You wanna tell me about her?

2330
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:00,640
No.

2331
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:03,160
No, I don't think I will.
