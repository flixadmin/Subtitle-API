Sneaking up on people

100
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,828
- You don't actually have
a plan, do you?

101
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,797
And that speech wasn't
about convincing us.

102
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,634
It was about convincing you.
Didn't work, did it?

103
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:32,537
- Not particularly, no.
Hence my desire to be alone.

104
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,773
- So we can't kill savage.

105
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,875

the concept of immortality,

106

Well done.
- Maybe we could slow him down.

107
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,980
Now, ra's al ghul
taught me a thing or two

108
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,483
About fighting
powerful adversaries.

109
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,718
If you can't kill your enemy,
weaken him.

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,187
If you can't cut off his head,

111
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,056
Take his heart.

112
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,326
- Mr. Al ghul was quite
the poet.

113
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,794
- Back at the weapons auction,

114
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:00,332
Savage was trying
to<i> sell</i> his nuke.

115
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,034
- Money is power.

116
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,237
- Take away savage's fortune
and he's just a regular guy

117
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,672
With a really long lifespan.

118
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,174
- It certainly would set
his plan for world domination

119
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,742
Back a few decades.

120
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:15,180
- So where does vandal savage
keep his money in 1975?

121
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,648
- The broken knife fragments

122
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,550
Are moving through her
circulatory system,

123
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,918
And if you'll notice these,

124
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,020
They're closing
in towards her heart.

125
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,155
- So what do we do?

126
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,389
- The fragments are miniscule.

127
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,724
Even the ship's technology

128
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,559
Isn't capable
of neutralizing them.

129
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,896
- Fortunately, there's
a technology onboard that is.

130
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,164
The atom suit.

131
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,633
I can shrink down,
slip into her bloodstream,

132
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,668
And use the photon canons
to vaporize the knife fragments.

133
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,203
- You'll be pushing
the suit's limits.

134
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,438
We should run some tests,

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,839
Make sure this is
the best plan of action.

136
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,474
- This isn't the ivory tower,
professor.

137
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,142
We don't have time--
- listen to me, raymond.

138
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,844
- I'm not your student anymore.
- You were never my student!

139
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,112
- Just because you don't
remember me--

140
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,280
- If you had been my student,

141
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,614
I'd have taught you
the principles

142
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,384
Of using scientific analysis,
not this bravado.

143
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,487
- There isn't time.
I'm going in.

144
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,490
- [sighs]

145
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,360
- Gideon!
Where's his money now?

146
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,895
- Dr. Boardman theorized
that savage entrusted it

147
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:07,032
To the brüemberg group,
the oldest bank in the world.

148
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,433
- I'll go tell
the rest of the team.

149
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,268
- That won't be necessary.

150
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,971
I'm going alone.

151
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,006
I can't have any more blood
on my hands.

152
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,375
- Except for your own?

153
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,110
You can't go in there
without backup.

154
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:22,481
- Look, I brought you all
with me under false pretenses.

155
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,715
Carter would still be alive

156
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,684
If I hadn't have
convinced him to come.

157
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,619
- No one's on this ship
that doesn't want to be here.

158
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,488
- But I can't risk
the whole team.

159
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,790
- Fine. Just me.

160
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,558
And if it helps,
I'm not giving you a choice.

161
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,926
I'm going with you to that bank.

162
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,128
- Somebody say bank?

163
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,130
- Your services aren't required,
mr. Snart.

164
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,331
This is purely reconnaissance.

165
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,433
- We know how to case banks.

166
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,834
We're practically bankers.

167
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,536
- 'cept we take the money out.

168
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,538
- Yes, and when I need someone
to steal something,

169
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,240
You'll be the first to know,
I assure you.

170
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,708
- Listen, englishman.

171
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,011
I'm getting bored being stuck
on this tin can.

172
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,113
And when I get bored,
I make bad decisions.

173
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,350
- Now, now, now,
we're all on the same side here.

174

00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,159
- Was because you
didn't have all of us.

877
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,662
- Obviously dr. Palmer
and I had our hands full

878
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,030
Tending to ms. Saunders,

879
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,798
But now that she's back
on her feet--

880
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,066
- We're back to full strength.

881
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:14,103
- Or as strong as
we can be without carter.

882
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,772
- Quite true,

883
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:18,808
But there is no point
in us continuing any further.

884
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:24,414
Unless we are all--
and myself included,

885
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,983
Committed to working in concert.

886
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,152
- You don't ditch us,
we won't ditch you.

887
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,820
Deal?

888
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,922
<i>- Sir, I've completed</i>
<i>my review of the timeline.</i>

889
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,592
<i>I calculate a 98% likelihood</i>

890
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:37,694
<i>That savage reappears in 1986.</i>

891
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,529
- Chart a course, gideon.

892
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,798
- Guess we're headed
to the '80s.

893
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,600
Better break out
your parachute pants.

894
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,569
- What the hell
are parachute pants?

895
