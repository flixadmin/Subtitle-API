00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,238
Brilliant Chang is dead.

167
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,680
Perhaps.

168
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,839
Sometimes I wonder,

169
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,076
"Is this heaven?"

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,236
(CHUCKLES)

171
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,555
Doesn't smell like heaven...

172
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
...so I would say I have survived.

173
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,679
- What happened to Maggie?
- You don't like me?

174
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,112
I like everything.

175
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,434
I like fucking everything.

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,072
You should answer the phone, Mr Shelby.

178
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,556
Micky, bring that phone here now.

Hello?

181
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,158
FINN: <i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,035
I sent a woman with a gun
to your youngest brother's office.

183
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,640
ARTHUR: All right, Finn.

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,955
FINN: <i>Right, right.</i>

185
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,398
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,909
Do you want to die again, Chang? Huh?

187
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,190
Good.

188
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,198
The guns are pointed.

189
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,755
Now we are all concentrating.

190
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,678
The moment is now pure.

191
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,031
Purity is not necessary.

192
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,755
Displays are not necessary.

193
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,399
They said, "Tommy Shelby.
That door will need some kicking down."

194
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,960
When you walked through that door,
it was open.

195
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,835
You don't need to do anything
to get my attention.

196
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,714
Now, what exactly do you want?

(SIGHS)

198
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,835
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?

199
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,154
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...

200
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,919
...you die.

201
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,474
If you die here today,
we'll bury you face down with no hands.

202
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,640
- You'll go straight to hell.
- I don't care about rituals.

203
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,797
I am a rationalist, Mr Shelby.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,117
Well, tell your friend on the phone

205
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,312
to put her gun down
and we can all have a talk.

Hold your fire!

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,949
I'm all right.

211
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,639
She fired into the ceiling.

212
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,638
Finn's all right.

213
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,035
Finn's OK.

214
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,280
Give me your order! Mm.

215
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,914
Give me your order, Tommy!

216
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,076
Yes or no.

217
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,350
At ease.

218
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,876
I said at ease.

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,029
May I take something
from my pocket, Mr Shelby?

220
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,910
(COUGHS)

221
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,272
And it's the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

222
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,189
No salt, no flour, no lies.

223
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,516
Pure truth.

224
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,956
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital,</i>

225
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,719
out of Shanghai.

226
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,672
Docked at Poplar a week ago.

227
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,752
The stevedores
were held at gunpoint,

228
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,874
Chinese unloaded the cargo
by the light of lanterns.

229
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,116
A foreman at the dock estimated there was
seven tonnes of the stuff.

230
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,233
I made a note at the time.

231
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,713
I spoke to that particular foreman

232
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,071
and I worked out that

233
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,989
seven tonnes of pure opium crystals
would be worth...

234
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,479
...approximately, £1,190,000

235
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,319
on international markets.

She had a gun to my fucking head!

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
But your trousers are dry.

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,750
You didn't piss yourself.

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,920
- He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
- Well done, Finn.

247
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,477
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

And Arthur here tells me
we should put you on the tracks.

Gonna be a good day for you after all,

Hey!

Always have your whores
searched at the door.

If I see that bitch on the street,
I'll fucking cut her.

Yeah, all right. All right, come on.

This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,396
A gesture of goodwill.

258
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,635
I'll throw it in the canal.

259
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,877
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?

260
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,776
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

261
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,156
ARTHUR: What fucking deal?

262
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,557
How does it feel
to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

263
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,798
It makes me feel young.
What fucking deal?

264
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,990
Four boats.

265
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,032
Four days.

266
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,550
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.

267
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,311
Half the cargo is coal
and underneath the coal,

268
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,794
pure opium crystal.

269
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,991
Opium.

270
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,270
I vote against it.

271
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,800
They can't use trucks

272
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,480
because the Chinese drivers
get stopped by the police.

273
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,920
They need to get it out of London

274
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,429
because all the warehouses
are being searched by Customs.

275
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,871
The seven tonnes
is bound for San Francisco,

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,959
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days from Liverpool.

277
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,639
They need somewhere safe to store it.

278
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,720
All we have to do is take it up the canal
and keep it here for a week.

279
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,311
We don't fuck with the Chinese, though,
Tom. Dad always said it.

280
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,070
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

281
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,510
to drive four boats up the canal

282
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,552
with no prospect of inspection?

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,276
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.

284
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,357
- Mm-mm.
- Polly?

285
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,995
£250,000.

286
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,716
That's half of what Michael lost
in Chicago.

287
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,878
I will ask him to take charge
of this business.

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,560
Michael's position will be reinstated
in the company?

289
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,479
His period of quarantine would be over.

290
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,315
Think about it, brother.

291
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,830
Four boats sailing up the cut,

292
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,316
smelling of wood smoke and bacon.

293
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,596
And which one
of Charlie's Gypsy didicoy friends

294
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,237
do you trust, Tom, eh,
with a cargo worth £1 million?

295
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,591
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

296
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Let's vote.

297
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,550
Those in favour.

298
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,914
(ARTHUR GRUNTS)

299
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,592
Motion carried.
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats

300
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
and four tonnes of coal
before it gets dark.

301
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,914
They sail south tonight.

302
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,912
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

303
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,190
Yes, Tommy.

304
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,469
Fuck!

305
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,634
What have you heard, Pol?

306
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,156
The man you cut went to the police...

307
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,394
...but we dealt with it.

308
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,796
Is she with him?

309
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,478
If she was, it would be your fault,
Arthur.

310
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,276
But they say his face is so badly cut
he's hard to look at.

311
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,756
So I would say not.

312
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,116
I would also say
it is time to give up on Linda,

313
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,918
find someone else
who might be able to put your fires out.

314
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,713
I can't, though, Pol.

315
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
I fucking can't!

316
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,199
And that's it.

317
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,710
That's it.

318
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,673
Whiskey?

319
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,029
Thank you, no.

320
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,877
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.

321
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,913
I've already got a time and a place
for the killing.

322
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
You see?

323
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,951
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

324
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,312
A girl called Karen who hates him,
who will give him up.

325
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,196
I have the sound of cranes and winches
to cover the gunshot.

326
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,915
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

327
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,872
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,277
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.

You can avenge the death of your son
in any way you see fit.

331
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,952
You mean when <i>you</i> say.

334
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Yeah.

335
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,352
And then you will marry
and you will settle.

336
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,711
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

337
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,357
Just let me understand you.

338
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,552
Do you mean
that Polly is part of this deal?

339
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,599
Yeah.

340

Well, Holy Lord God,
Tommy Shelby OBE,

341
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,550
does your vanity have no limits?

342
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,831
I believe it is called the ego these days.

343
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,240
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)
I read books.

344
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,796
You sit on your throne
and you instruct Polly Gray,

345
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,513
who is of far richer blood than you,

346
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,439
as to when she can
and when she can't marry.

347
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,836
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

348
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,997
She has her own strategies.

349
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
And we are of the same blood.

350
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,396
She will marry you, but only if you agree
to postpone any attack on McCavern

351
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,113
until this business is done.

352
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,712
So she <i>is</i> some young Gypsy bride
that's yours to give away.

353
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,675
Young she is,
when she's barefoot on the cobbles.

354
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,872
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's gonna be done in the old way,

355
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,277
well, you know, you throw in
a few coloured ponies or...

356
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,471
I'm having an event at my house.

357
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,114
You are invited.

358
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,152
Polly will be there.

359
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,717
There will be candles and violins

360
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,160
and dancing.

361
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,512
Polly wants you to propose
in the proper way,

362
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,950
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

363
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,437

Yeah.

367

Apparently, it's about love.

to come to your bloody house?

00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,759
It's an independent dance company

is your wife's birthday.

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,949
Yeah.

391
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,597
The party is for her.

392
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,231
And she likes ballet, your wife?

393
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,589
Why wouldn't she?

394
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,440
It's just...

395
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,677
Well, you see,
I did some research into her.

396
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,433
Into her past.

397
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,632
If you want to buy her a gift,
she likes diamonds.

Now that we are going to be
conquering the world together,

399
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,716
we need to have no secrets.

Your wife has led an interesting life.

402
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,959
It may even be possible that,
as a younger man in Birmingham,

403
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,037
I came across her.

404
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,194
My friends and I would sometimes go
to nightclubs in the south of town.

405
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,310
Well, if you recognise her,
maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

406
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,517
Maybe, if we have met before,
your wife and I

407
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,677
could even renew our acquaintance.

409

I too have done some research,
Sir Oswald.

410
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,156
Yeah.

411
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,877
I researched your wife
and your wife's younger sister

412
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,152
and your wife's stepmother, Lady Curzon,

all of whom you are fucking.

If such things were to take place
on a narrowboat,

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,753

...it's not happening on a narrowboat.

418
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,354
No. It's taking place in your apartment,
in your country house,

419
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,794
sometimes even in your office
here in the House of Commons.

420
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,230
So no secrets. And, yes,

yes, you are invited to stay the night

with whichever member of your family
finds favour.

423
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,040
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave,

424
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,470
I need to lock up my office.

425
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,753
Actually, I will come alone.

426
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,159
In society, you are judged

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,039
And I keep finding myself there.

488
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,953
And only the <i>January</i> can get me away.

489
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,717
Will you at least try
the doctors again, Tom?

490
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,592
Well, then at least throw away your opium.

491
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,234
It's that that causes the visions.

492
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,999
Just... throw it away.

493
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,918
While it's there, it's a temptation.

494
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,475
- (SIGHS)
- How much have you got left?

495
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,040
Seven tonnes.

496
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,392
- Seven tonnes?
- Yeah.

497
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,553
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

498
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,995
(SCOFFS)

499
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,510
You do me a favour?

500
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,232
When that kid of yours arrives,
keep it away from me.

501
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,873
A fucking ballet.

502
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,720
He wants to impress someone.

503
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,479
And I'm invited?

504
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,795
You and Gina.

505
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Why?

506
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,717
Because he wants to give you
the chance to come back properly.

507
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,510
Coal haulage?

508
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,869
Yeah.

509
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,040
Tommy wants you to reopen those books
and become managing director.

510
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,596
So I've come back from Detroit
to become a coal man?

511
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,597
The first delivery
is bound for San Francisco,

512
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,154
but if it works...

513
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,914
...Tommy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

514
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,159
And this, erm, this coal...

515
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,238
- ...is it snow white?
- No.

516
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,874
Golden brown.

517
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Fuck.

518
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,036
This is your opportunity, Michael.

519
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,471
There is more money in this
than there is

520
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,674
in all the other parts of our business
put together.

521
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,157
Tommy knows
what opium does to people.

522
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,749
Tommy knows
what whiskey does to people.

523
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,951
He got an OBE for selling it.

524
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,034
I'll speak to Gina.

525
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,920
(SCOFFS) You'll what?

526
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,509
I will consult my wife.

527
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,835
Your father ran this business
for a bit.

528
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,758
1901.

529
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,633
And he shipped coal. Real coal.

530
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,399
Just coal.

531
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,756
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

532
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,475
And the merchants would offer them
one price

533
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,432
and then only pay half

534
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,358
because they could.

535
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,120
And <i>that</i> was wrong, Michael.

536
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,272
Run your hands through it,
get it under your skin...

537
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,391
...and then see if Gina will let you
lay a finger on her.

538
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,474
(COAL CLATTERS)

539
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,354
I think golden brown
is more to her taste.

540
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,712
Especially when you tell her
how much money you're going to earn.

541
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,832
(DOOR OPENS)

542
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,234
(DOOR CLOSES)

543
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,950
Now we're in business together,
I should ask,

544
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,198
which foot do you kick the ball with,
Mr Shelby?

545
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,470
I have no religion.

546
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,234
Some nights I wish I had.

547
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
He's kin?

548
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Yeah.

549
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,395
And the simple fellow?

550
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,149
He's a lot less simple
than you might at first think.

551
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,116
Do you trust them?

552
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,159
Right. So I take a boatload.

553
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,595
No.

554
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,430
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

555
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,631
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

556
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,320
Cash payment on loading.

557
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,590
£10,000.

558
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,430
For that amount,
it'll have to be a cheque.

559
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,755
I don't take cheques.

560
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,714
It'll be a cheque.

561
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I will take a cheque

562
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,871
if it's guaranteed
by our mutual friend in London,

563
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Mr Mosley.

564

(CHUCKLES)

565
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,390
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business

566
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,399
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

567
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,992
Yeah, who'd have thought,
eh, Charlie?

568
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,600
CHARLIE: Who would have thought it?

569
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,030
Aye, but you're OK.

570
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,631
THOMAS: Yeah, I'm only OK
until I'm not OK.

571
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,877
Then I'm really not.

572
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,480
Delivery in seven days.

573
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,996
Cheque guaranteed.

574
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,397
Won't your Chinese friends
expect the seven tonnes that leaves London

575
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,830
to still be seven tonnes
when it reaches Liverpool?

576
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,680
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

577
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,510
Oh, you mean you're bold enough
to skim the Chinese? (CHUCKLES)

578
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,118
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?

579
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,112
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

580
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,720
When you've unpacked,
there should be a girl laid on for you.

581
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,480
Mr Shelby is a socialist

582
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,990
and believes in equality of service
for all classes.

583
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,952
According to the invitation,
there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.

584
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,072
Say that you're feeling tired
and we'll leave.

585
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,720
Well, if you see a duke,
introduce me.

586
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,832
My God, at last!

587
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,872
Something you like about England.

588
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,714
Gina, I've been made an offer.

589
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,556
To come back into the company.

590
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,955
Michael, we agreed,

591
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,914
the baby will be born in New York.
Remember?

592
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,235
The job is haulage.

593
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,959
Supply. Transport.

594
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Opium.

595
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,790
- Tommy has made contact...
- Tommy!

596
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,515
Tommy has made contact
with Chinese suppliers

597
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,438
who have plantations in the Afghan hills.

598
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
Pure grade.

599
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,193
We will take delivery
and ship it all over Europe.

600
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
You mean heroin?

601
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
Yes.

602
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,594
And how much would you make?

603
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,835
Conservative estimate,
three shipments a year from Shanghai,

604
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,474
seven tonnes each,

605
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,160
stand to make approximately
£1 million.

606
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Per annum.

607
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,913
The company will make three.

608
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,515
We could go to New York
whenever we wanted.

609
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,075
On our own fucking plane.

610
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,552
- We always have to come back, right?
- Yes.

611
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,637
For £1 million a year, we do.

612
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,240
What happens if you get caught?

613
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,430
Tommy has friends.

614
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,398
If the ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

615
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,239
Think about it, Gina.

616
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,352
When we move into our house...

617
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,349
...our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

618
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Will it now?

619
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,837
The magazines say that

620
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,158
it's all straight lines and simplicity
in the 1930s.

621
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,796
Deco is dead.

622
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,154
We'll be able to afford
dukes and duchesses.

623
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,759
And maybe...

624
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,473
...maybe a princess or two.

625
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,910
And the painting on the wall
will be of you.

626
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,234
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone

627
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,114
and it will be Michael Gray
arranging the ballet.

628
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,716
Where will Tommy be?

629
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,519
Where he wants to go to most.

630
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,960
Ah.

631
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
There.

632
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,831
A lord.

633
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,998
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

634
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,033
Where the fuck is Tommy anyway?

635
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,070
Tommy...

636
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,556
(GROANS) My house.

637
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,990
- My wife.
- (MOANS)

638
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,270
Let 'em wait.

639
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
Sir Oswald.

640
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,235
Do I not get announced?

641
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,794
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you

642
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,072
that he's busy
with the catering preparations

643
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,032
and will be joining you shortly.

644
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,029
In the meantime,
and while you're waiting,

645
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,278
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

646
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,432
I don't use opium or cocaine,

647
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,200
and brandy is for after dinner,
not before.

648
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,430
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

649
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,031
You'll notice that
the maids wear name tags.

650
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,999
We hired them specially...

651
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,039
...for those guests staying the night.

652
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,439
All things are available
except the ballerinas.

653
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,032
And who, might I ask, are you?

654
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,675
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

655
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,430
And I too am unavailable.

656
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,354
Lizzie.

657
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,757
There's something I didn't tell you
about this evening.

658
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,599
Something about our guest.

659
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,120
Mosley.

660
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,673
It's possible that...

661
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,598
...that you've met him before.

662
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Before when?

663
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,435
Before you became who you are.

664
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,395
Would you even remember him?

665
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,318
Would he remember you?

666
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,559
All I remember is,
I drank too much champagne.

667
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,194
I wasn't taking cash.

668
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,600
Lizzie...

669
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,120
There's a pile of bodies...

670
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,475
...floating by.

671
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,676
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

672
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,755
Let 'em go.

673
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,712
So that's why you brought me
in here.

674
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,513
To lay your claim.

675
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Yeah.

676
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,358
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

677
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,630
He lays a fucking hand on you,
he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.

678
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,832
You were indisposed when I arrived.

679
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,392
In society, you greet a guest,
you don't leave them hanging...

680
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,671
...looking around like a fucking dog.

681
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,874
(CLEARS HIS THROAT) Before we join
the others, I have some business.

682
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,275
I need a signature.

683
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,837
By the way,
your brandy before dinner thing amuses me,

684
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,600
but none of the maids are of interest.

685
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,871
And I despise the use of drugs.

686
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,958
Your strategies are very transparent.

687
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,352
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern,

688
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,836
your acquaintance from the north.

689
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,997
I have no idea who you mean.

690
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,430
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.

691
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,951
I need your signature
as a guarantor on the transaction

692
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,833
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

693
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,872
The sum is £10,000.

694
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,071
And what is it he's buying from you?

695
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,270
A gin distillery.

696
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,312
He's buying my old one.
I'm buying a new one.

697
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,635
Hmm.

698
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,833
So not only is the truce holding,

699
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,429
but you two
are actually doing business.

700
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,155
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

701
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,071
If I sign a cheque guarantee
for this man,

702
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,840
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

703
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,191
Something you could later use
against me.

704
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,597
Why would I want to move against you?

705
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,311
You're curious about my weaknesses.

706
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,552
And you've learned it's not cocaine,

707
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,399
not maids.

708
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,512
But now you will learn my weakness
is a tendency to trust people.

709
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,040
Do you have a pen?

710
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,000
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

711
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
Mr Shelby.

712
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,192
I know you have no classical education,

713
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,392
but just realised you are
the perfect balance between the gods

714
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,477
Dionysus and Apollo.

715
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,753
Irrational frenzy
controlled by reason and self reflection.

716
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,720
Do you know the work
of Friedrich Nietzsche?

717
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,672
- No.
- Freud?

718
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,120
Yes.

719
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,720
Ah.

720
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,875
There.

721
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,231
Your guarantee of trust.

722
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,277
Now perhaps you would introduce me
to your wonderful wife.

723
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,078
So, did you know?

724
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,873
What?

725
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,231
Oh, that tonight's special guest
might have fucked you

726
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,431
when you were a nightclub hostess?

727
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Yeah.

728
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,034
Lizzie, if we were to strike
from our guest lists

729
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,595
every man in Birmingham who you...

730
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,152
- Yes or no?
- Fucking yes.

731
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Shit.

732
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,677
Sir Oswald,
this is my wife Elizabeth.

733
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,678
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

734
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,674
Since we all appear to know,

735
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,031
and since knowledge is permission,

736
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,234
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the spirit
of our honest relationship,

737
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,033
you won't mind me saying

738
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,880
it was a bottle of Champagne
and an evening well spent.

739
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,754
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

740
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,994
For the Champagne
and brandy you bought me,

741
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,433
as I recall, it was the booze that put you
to sleep a little prematurely.

742
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,351
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the dance is about to begin.

743
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,792
Mr Mosley!

744
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,116
A toast, if I may.

745
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,755
To the end of our deal,

746
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,270
and the beginning of something more.

747
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,198
Happy Birthday, Lizzie.

748
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
This way.

749
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,114
(CLASSICAL MUSIC)

(SNORES)

751
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,117
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen,

752
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,879
will you marry me,

753
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,390
a poor commoner who loves you?

754
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,389
Let's fuck before the swan dies.

755
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,953
I heard there was a family occasion.

756
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,352
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

757
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,949
That animal inside me,

758
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,640
it comes out and I can't stop it.

759
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,313
Fuck, Linda.

760
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,159
Without you, I c...

761
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,272
Come inside, please.

762
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,993
His name was Frederick.

763
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,430
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

764
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,880
He just listened.

765
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,597
And now he has no face.

766
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,111
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

767
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,952
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

768
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,600
...in fucking hell.
