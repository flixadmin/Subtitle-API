1
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:26,013
Been a while since I was up here
in front of you.

2
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:29,182
Maybe I'll do us all a favour
and just stick to the cards.

3
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:35,022
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

4
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,523
on the freeway and the rooftop...

5
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:39,568
Sorry, Mr Stark, do you
honestly expect us to believe that

6
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:43,238
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

7
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:46,092
despite the fact
that you sorely despise bodyguards?

8
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,242
Yes.

9
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:51,997
And this mysterious bodyguard
was somehow equipped

10
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:55,500
with an undisclosed
Stark high-tech powered battle...

11
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,544
I know that it's confusing.

12
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:01,256
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

13
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:04,468
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

14
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:10,766
I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,060
A laundry list of character defects,

16
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:15,979
all the mistakes I've made,
largely public.

17
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,689
The truth is

18
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:24,613
I am Iron Man.

19
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,583
Ivan.

20
00:01:41,839 --> 00:02:39,312
Vanya.

21
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,559
270 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15,000 feet.

22
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:54,424
You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.

23
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:24,472
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

24
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,891
It's good to be back.

25
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,645
-You missed me?
-Blow something up!

26
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:34,816
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

27
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,152
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

28
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:42,407
its longest period of uninterrupted peace
in years because of me.

29
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:51,124
I'm not saying
that from the ashes of captivity,

30
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,254
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

31
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:05,263
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

32
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:06,973
sipping on an iced tea

33
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:10,101
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough

34
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:13,062
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

35
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:18,693
I love you, Tony!

36
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,904
Please, it's not about me.

37
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,073
It's not about you.

38
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:29,329
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

39
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,249
It's about what we choose
to leave behind for future generations.

40
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,378
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

41
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,881
the best and brightest men and women

42
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,008
of nations and corporations
the world over

43
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,511
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

44
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:48,640
to leave behind a brighter future.

45
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,475
It's not about us.

46
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:54,520
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

47
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:57,148
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

48
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,571
And now,
making a special guest appearance

49
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:06,157
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about,

50
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:08,660
please welcome my father, Howard.

51
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:13,957
Everything is achievable
through technology.

52
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,334
Better living, robust health,

53
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:21,381
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

54
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:23,466
So, from all of us here
at Stark lndustries,

55
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:28,262
I would like to personally introduce you
to the City of the Future.

56
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:32,100
Technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind,

57
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,019
and will one day rid society of all its ills.

58
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:38,690
Soon, technology will affect the way
you live your life every day.

59
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:40,358
No more tedious work,

60
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:45,071
leaving more time for leisure activities
and enjoying the sweet life.

61
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:47,907
The Stark Expo. Welcome.

62
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:56,082
We are coming to you live
from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,

63
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,960
where Tony Stark
has just walked offstage.

64
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:00,712
Don't worry
if you can't make it down here tonight

65
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:03,131
because this Expo goes on
all year long.

66
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:05,299
And I'm gonna be here
checking out all the attractions

67
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,845
and the pavilions and the inventions
from all around the world.

68
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:11,472
-Make sure you join me...
-All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.

69
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:14,308
-Open up, let's go.
-Hey! Nice to see you.

70
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:16,936
-All right. Thank you. I remember you.
-Tony, Tony...

71
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:18,563
Hey, hey...

72
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:21,107
-Call me.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

73
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:23,651
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

74
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,236
-Okay.
-See you, buddy.

75
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,404
This is Larry.

76
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,598
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

77
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,241
-Nice to see you.
-Call me. Call me.

78
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:32,035
-Larry King.
-Larry!

79
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,871
Yes, my people, my people.

80
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:36,497
Come on, Tony. There we go.

81
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,458
-Very mellow.
-That wasn't so bad.

82
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,834
No, it was perfect.

83
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:41,502
Look what we got here, the new model.

84
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:43,296
-Hey, does she come with the car?
-I certainly hope so.

85
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,380
-Hi.
-Hi.

86
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,675
-And you are?
-Marshal.

87
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,717
-Irish. I like it.
-Pleased to meet you, Tony.

88
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:49,948
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

89
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,345
-Bedford.
-What are you doing here?

90
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,057
-Looking for you.
-Yeah? You found me.

91
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:58,603
-What are you up to later?
-Serving subpoenas.

92
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,356
He doesn't like to be handed things.

93
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,900
-Yeah, I have a peeve.
-I got it.

94
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:05,166
You are hereby ordered

95
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,570
to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

96
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,197
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

97
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,948
-Can I see a badge?
-You wanna see the badge?

98
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,242
He likes the badge.

99
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,411
-You still like it?
-Yep.

100
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,917
-How far are we from D.C.?
-D.C.? 250 miles.

101
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,550
Mr Stark, could we pick up now
where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.

102
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,302
-Yes, dear?
-Can I have your attention?

103
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:32,386
Absolutely.

104
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:35,431
Do you or do you not possess
a specialised weapon?

105
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:37,809
-I do not. I do not.
-You do not?

106
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,478
Well, it depends
on how you define the word "weapon."

107
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:43,272
-The Iron Man weapon.
-My device does not fit that description.

108
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,941
Well... How would you describe it?

109
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:48,069
I would describe it by defining it
as what it is, Senator.

110
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:51,948
-As?
-It's a high-tech prosthesis.

111
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:53,124
That is... That is...

112
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,576
That's actually the most apt description
Ican make of it.

113
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:57,411
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.

114
00:11:57,412 --> 00:12:00,665
Please, if your priority was actually
the well-being of the American citizen...

115
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,626
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people

116
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:07,004
-of the United States of America.
-Well, you can forget it.

117
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:11,342
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.

118
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:13,970
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

119
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:17,098
which is tantamount
to indentured servitude or prostitution,

120
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,779
depending on what state you're in.

121
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,769
-You can't have it.
-Look, I'm no expert...

122
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:25,648
ln prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

123
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:29,068
I'm no expert in weapons.

124
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,112
We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.

125
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:35,825
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,
our current primary weapons contractor.

126
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:40,437
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr Hammer entering the chamber,

127
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:41,747
and I am wondering

128
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:45,626
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

129
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:53,843
Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

130
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,928
You're the wonder boy.

131
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:58,139
Senator, if I may.

132
00:12:58,223 --> 00:13:02,685
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

133
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:05,396
Your dad. Howard Stark.

134
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:09,901
Really a father to us all,
and to the military-industrial age.

135
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,031
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.

136
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:17,627
We all know why we're here.
ln the last six months,

137
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,746
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

138
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:24,665
And yet he insists it's a shield.

139
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,378
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

140
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:32,715
I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.

141
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:35,927
I'd love to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

142
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:37,470
but this ain't Canada.

143
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:39,347
You know, we live in a world
of grave threats,

144
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:43,059
threats that Mr Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

145
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,561
Thank you.

146
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:48,397
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

147
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,609
That is well said, Mr Hammer.

148
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,655
The committee would now like to invite

149
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:56,864
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
to the chamber.

150
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,449
Rhodey? What?

151
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,042
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

152
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,753
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

153
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,929
I just...

154
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,547
-Drop it.
-All right, I'll drop it.

155
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:17,009
I have before me a complete report
on the Iron Man weapon,

156
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,887
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

157
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:22,974
can you please read page 57,
paragraph four?

158
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,434
You're requesting
that I read specific selections

159
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:26,811
-from my report, Senator?
-Yes, sir.

160
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,813
It was my understanding
that I was going to be testifying

161
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:31,107
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

162
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:32,775
l understand.
A lot of things have changed today.

163
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:34,151
-So if you could just read...
-You do understand

164
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:36,654
that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect

165
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:39,949
-the summary of my final...
-Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

166
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,410
Very well.

167
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,759
"As he does not operate within
any definable branch of government,

168
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:53,713
"Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation

169
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:55,214
"and to her interests."

170
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,174
I did, however, go on to summarise

171
00:14:57,175 --> 00:15:00,094
that the benefits of Iron Man
far outweigh the liabilities.

172
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,305
-And that it would be in our interest...
-That's enough, Colonel.

173
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:03,597
-...to fold Mr Stark...
-That's enough.

174
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,182
...into the existing
chain of command, Senator.

175
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:08,644
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

176
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:11,314
We can amend the hours a little bit.

177
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,733
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,

178
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,107
the imagery
that's connected to your report.

179
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:19,030
I believe it is somewhat premature
to reveal these images

180
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:20,948
-to the general public at this time.
-With all due respect,

181
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:22,116
Colonel, I understand.

182
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,287
And if you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.

183
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,331
Let's have the images.

184
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,002
Intelligence suggests
that the devices seen in these photos

185
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:35,963
are, in fact, attempts
at making manned copies

186
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,506
of Mr Stark's suit.

187
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:42,636
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

188
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:47,850
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

189
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:51,937
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

190
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:55,524
Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.

191
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:59,028
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

192
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,113
-Now, let's see what's really going on.
-What is he doing?

193
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:04,367
If you will direct your attention
to said screens...

194
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,035
l believe that's North Korea.

195
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:17,129
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

196
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:18,381
Iran.

197
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:25,888
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

198
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:28,432
How did Hammer get in the game?

199
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:31,143
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

200
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:36,083
Okay, give me a left twist.
Left's good. Turn to the right.

201
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,861
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

202
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,113
Wow.

203
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:46,867
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

204
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,244
Hammer Industries, 20.

205
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:50,955
I'd like to point out
that that test pilot survived.

206
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,665
l think we're done,
is the point that he's making.

207
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,960
-I don't think there's any reason...
-The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

208
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:58,796
-For what?
-Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

209
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:01,423
It's working.
We're safe. America is secure.

210
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:03,498
You want my property?
You can't have it.

211
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,927
But I did you a big favour.

212
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,597
I've successfully privatized world peace.

213
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:13,978
What more do you want? For now!

214
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:17,648
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

215
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:21,110
...you, Mr Stark. ...you, buddy.

216
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:23,445
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

217
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:25,698
-Okay.
-You've been a delight.

218
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,789
My bond is with the people.

219
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:39,128
And I will serve this great nation
at the pleasure of myself.

220
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,880
If there's one thing I've proven

221
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:44,216
it's that you can count on me
to pleasure myself.

222
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,420
Wake up. Daddy's home.

223
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:23,088
Welcome home, sir.

224
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,174
Congratulations on
the opening ceremonies.

225
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:28,177
They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.

226
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,012
And may I say how refreshing it is

227
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:33,849
to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.

228
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:36,894
You!

229
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:39,772
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

230
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:42,358
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

231
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:45,110
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

232
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:46,335
am I supposed to drink?

233
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:50,366
We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.

234
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,285
Check palladium levels.

235
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:57,539
Blood toxicity, 24%.

236
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,460
It appears that the continued use
of the Iron Man suit

237
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:03,879
is accelerating your condition.

238
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:07,758
Another core has been depleted.

239
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:12,805
God, they're running out quick.

240
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:15,557
I have run simulations
on every known element,

241
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:17,768
and none can serve
as a viable replacement

242
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,770
for the palladium core.

243
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:25,067
You are running out of both time
and options.

244
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,490
Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive

245
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:33,409
is also killing you.

246
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:36,328
Miss Potts is approaching.

247
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:39,331
-I recommend that you inform her...
-Mute.

248
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,003
Is this a joke?

249
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:47,089
-What are you thinking?
-What?

250
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,591
-What are you thinking?
-Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

251
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:51,885
And you're angry about something.

252
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,429
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

253
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,930
-Did you just donate...
-Keep your business.

254
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:58,475
...our entire modern art collection
to the...

255
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,269
-Boy Scouts ofAmerica.
-...Boy Scouts ofAmerica?

256
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,070
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

257
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:05,524
I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.

258
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:07,860
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offence.

259
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,987
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled

260
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:11,572
to say "our" collection

261
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:14,867
considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years,

262
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:16,869
-curating that.
-It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

263
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,955
You know,
there's only about 8,01 1things

264
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,999
that I really need to talk to you about.

265
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,542
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

266
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:25,169
The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.

267
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,546
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

268
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:29,965
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

269
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,133
-Is that okay?
-That's rude.

270
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:32,676
There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

271
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,136
It's my primary point of concern.

272
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:37,264
-I don't know why you're...
-The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

273
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:39,141
Wow. Look at that.

274
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,728
That's modern art. That's going up.

275
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:45,647
-You've got to be kidding.
-I'm gonna put this up right now.

276
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:47,941
-This is vital.
-Stark is in complete disarray.

277
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,361
-You understand that?
-No. Our stocks have never been higher.

278
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,780
-Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
-You are... Well, if it's messy,

279
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,365
-then let's double back.
-Let me give you an example.

280
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:56,033
-Let's move on to another subject.
-No, no, no, no.

281
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:57,826
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

282
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,411
-and hanging that up!
-I'm not taking it down.

283
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:00,746
I'm just replacing it with this.

284
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:02,206
-Let's see what I can get going here.
-Okay, fine.

285
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:05,334
My point is,
we have already awarded contracts

286
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:07,169
-to the wind farm people.
-Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

287
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,338
-I'm already feeling gassy.
-And to the plastic plantation tree,

288
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,548
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

289
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,425
-Everything was my idea.
-...and you won't make a decision.

290
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,219
I don't care
about the liberal agenda any more.

291
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,679
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

292
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,973
-You do it.
-I do what?

293
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,101
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

294
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:24,978
-Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
-Pepper, I need you to run the company.

295
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,480
-Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
-You will not

296
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:28,232
-give me the information...
-I'm not asking you to try...

297
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:29,441
-...in order to...
-I'm asking you

298
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:30,734
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

299
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:32,569
-I am trying to do it.
-Pepper, you're not listening to me!

300
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,571
-No, you are not listening to me.
-I'm trying to make you CEO.

301
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,448
Why won't you let me?

302
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,993
-Have you been drinking?
-Chlorophyll.

303
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:46,166
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

304
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,168
effective immediately.

305
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:52,256
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

306
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:56,306
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

307
00:21:56,386 --> 00:22:00,305
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

308
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:04,268
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

309
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,145
And then I realised

310
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,233
it's you. It's always been you.

311
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,445
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

312
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:17,906
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

313
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:20,617
My successor being you.

314
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:24,455
Congratulations?

315
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:27,875
-Take it, just take it.
-I don't know what to think.

316
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:29,668
Don't think. Drink.

317
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:36,842
There you go.

318
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:20,081
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

319
00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:22,137
I'm on happy time.

320
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:29,686
-Sorry.
-What the hell was that?

321
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:32,189
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

322
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,358
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

323
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,818
All right, put them up. Come on.

324
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:44,368
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

325
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:47,955
I need you to initial each box.

326
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,291
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

327
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:54,795
That's it. I'm done.

328
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:57,381
-What's your name, lady?
-Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

329
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,049
Front and centre. Come into the church.

330
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,844
-No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
-If it pleases the court, which it does.

331
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,265
-It's no problem.
-I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

332
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:20,988
What?

333
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:27,536
-Can you give her a lesson?
-No problem.

334
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,621
-Pepper.
-What?

335
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:33,125
-Who is she?
-She is from legal.

336
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:37,296
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit

337
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:39,631
-if you keep ogling her like that.
-I need a new assistant, boss.

338
00:24:39,632 --> 00:24:42,522
Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.

339
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,136
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

340
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:47,097
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

341
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:48,181
No, it's not.

342
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,136
-You ever boxed before?
-I have, yes.

343
00:24:50,143 --> 00:24:54,104
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

344
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:57,941
-How do I spell your name, Natalie?
-R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

345
00:24:58,026 --> 00:25:02,446
-What, are you gonna google her now?
-I thought I was ogling her.

346
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:06,283
-Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
-You're so predictable, you know that?

347
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:08,535
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.

348
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:10,495
-Who speaks Latin?
-No one speaks Latin.

349
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:12,789
-No one speaks Latin?
-It's a dead language.

350
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,750
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

351
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,418
-but you can't speak Latin...
-Did you model in Tokyo?

352
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,229
-'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
-Well...

353
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,713
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

354
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:23,342
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

355
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:25,969
Oh, my God!

356
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:30,974
-Happy!
-That's what I'm talking about.

357
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:32,392
-I just slipped.
-You did?

358
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,811
-Yeah.
-Looks like a TKO to me.

359
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,358
Just... I need your impression.

360
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,235
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

361
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,738
-I meant your fingerprint.
-Right.

362
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:51,119
-So, how are we doing?
-Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

363
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:55,582
-You're the boss.
-Will that be all, Mr Stark?

364
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,626
-No.
-Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

365
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,544
Thank you very much.

366
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:04,216
-I want one.
-No.

367
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:40,585
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

368
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:41,920
-just go with it.
-Go with it? Go with what?

369
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:43,463
-Mr Stark?
-Hey.

370
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:44,840
Hello. How was your flight?

371
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:46,425
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

372
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:50,595
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

373
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:52,848
-When did this happen?
-What? You made me do it.

374
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,475
-I made you do what?
-You quit. Smile. Look right there.

375
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:56,685
Stop acting constipated.

376
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:58,228
-Don't flare your nostrils.
-You are so predictable.

377
00:26:58,229 --> 00:26:59,354
-That's the amazing thing.
-Right this way.

378
00:26:59,355 --> 00:27:01,148
-You look fantastic.
-Why, thank you very much.

379
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:03,066
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

380
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,985
You have a 9:30 dinner.

381
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:06,903
-Perfect. I'll be there at 11 :00.
-Absolutely.

382
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:08,739
-Is this us?
-It can be.

383
00:27:08,823 --> 00:27:10,490
-Great. Make it us.
-Okay.

384
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:13,034
-Mr Musk. How are you?
-Hi, Pepper.

385
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:15,078
-Congratulations on the promotion.
-Thank you very much.

386
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,414
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

387
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:19,499
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.

388
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,584
-You do?
-Yeah.

389
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:22,711
Then we'll make it work.

390
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:24,629
-You want a massage?
-Oh, God. No,

391
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,173
-I don't want a massage.
-I'll have Natalie make an...

392
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:27,674
-I don't want Natalie to do...
-Don't want you tense.

393
00:27:27,675 --> 00:27:28,925
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

394
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:30,051
Thank you very much.

395
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:32,179
-Green is not your best colour.
-Oh, please.

396
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,722
Anthony! Is that you?

397
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:35,182
-My least favourite person on Earth.
-Hey, pal.

398
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:36,558
-Justin Hammer.
-How you doing?

399
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,352
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

400
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:41,855
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair.

401
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:43,148
-You guys know each other?
-Hi.

402
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:44,399
-Yes.
-Yes.

403
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:45,650
-Yes, roughly.
-We do.

404
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:49,780
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

405
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:51,239
-I know. I know.
-Congratulations.

406
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,785
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

407
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:55,952
-Can I?
-Sure.

408
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:58,622
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.

409
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,543
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

410
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,708
-Right.
-Right?

411
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:05,170
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

412
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:06,634
And she wrote a story as well.

413
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:08,715
-It was very impressive.
-That was good.

414
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,842
-Very well done.
-Thank you.

415
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:12,469
-I'm gonna go wash.
-Don't leave me.

416
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,012
-Hey, buddy. How you doing?
-I'm all right.

417
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:15,388
-Looking gorgeous.
-Please, this is tough.

418
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,016
-Can I ask you... Is this the first time...
-Fromage.

419
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:19,684
-Say, "Brie."
-...that you guys have seen each other?

420
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:21,937
God, that's so awful.

421
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:24,481
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

422
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:26,162
Since he got his contract revoked...

423
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,527
-Actually, it's on hold.
-...when you were attempting to...

424
00:28:28,528 --> 00:28:30,612
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

425
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:32,531
-and "cancelled"? The truth?
-Yes, what is?

426
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:34,908
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

427
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:38,995
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

428
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,456
Well, if you invent something
that works,

429
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,981
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

430
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:45,272
-Mr Stark, your corner table is ready.
-Yes?

431
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:47,546
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

432
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,799
-Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
-We kid, yeah.

433
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:52,843
We kid. We're kidders.

434
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,242
Got any other bad ideas?

435
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:22,622
Tony!

436
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,755
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

437
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:33,383
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

438
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:35,886
for Hammer Industries, you know?

439
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,306
-Everything that Tony and I do...
-Well, what's the use of having...

440
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,267
-...is a healthy...
-...and owning a race car...

441
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:45,312
-...competition.
-...if you don't drive it?

442
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:47,898
Is he driving?

443
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:56,865
Natalie. Natalie!

444
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:59,075
-Yes, Miss Potts?
-Did you know about this?

445
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:01,286
This is the first that I have known of it.

446
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:03,154
This... This cannot happen.

447
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:04,956
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

448
00:30:04,957 --> 00:30:06,291
-Where's Happy?
-He's waiting outside.

449
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,282
-Okay, get him. I need Happy.
-Right away.

450
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,046
Tony's... You know, he...

451
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:13,089
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

452
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,257
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

453
00:30:14,258 --> 00:30:17,302
-can you excuse me just one second?
-Just read me what you wrote.

454
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:18,595
-I will. I will, after.
-Just read it back to me.

455
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:19,930
But I have to make one quick phone call.

456
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,097
-Where are you going?
-This is great.

457
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:22,557
-I've got some caviar coming.
-This is great stuff.

458
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,059
-I'll be right back.
-Look!

459
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:25,644
That's Stark.

460
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:24,888
Go, go!

461
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,768
Hang on.

462
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,547
-Give me the case.
-Here. Take it.

463
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:42,298
-Where's the key?
-It's in my pocket.

464
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,466
Car!

465
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:48,531
Oh, my God!

466
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:57,665
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

467
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,752
-Were you heading for me or him?
-I was trying to scare him.

468
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:02,837
-'Cause I can't tell!
-Are you out of your mind?

469
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,881
-Better security.
-Get in the car right now!

470
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:06,716
I was attacked! We need better security.

471
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:09,052
-Get in the car!
-You're CEO. Better security measures.

472
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:10,803
God, it's embarrassing.

473
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,890
First vacation in two years.

474
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:19,979
Oh, my God!

475
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:23,316
-I got him!
-Hit him again. Hit him again.

476
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,276
Football.

477
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:29,781
-I got him!
-Take the case! Take it!

478
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:31,616
-Take the case!
-Give him the case!

479
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:33,451
Stop banging the car!

480
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,956
Calm down.

481
00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:40,875
God! God!

482
00:35:43,462 --> 00:36:24,127
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

483
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,266
You... You lose.

484
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:29,233
You lose. You lose, Stark.

485
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:26,457
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

486
00:38:32,214 --> 00:38:35,133
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

487
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:40,680
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

488
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:43,599
It's effective. Not very efficient.

489
00:38:44,643 --> 00:38:46,978
But it's a passable knock-off.

490
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:49,272
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

491
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:51,073
you could have made a solid paycheck.

492
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,319
You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran,

493
00:38:55,404 --> 00:38:58,030
or gone right to the black market.

494
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:01,075
You look like you got friends
in low places.

495
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,706
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

496
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:10,376
And now, like all guilty men,

497
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:13,921
you try to rewrite your own history.

498
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:19,594
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

499
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:24,015
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

500
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,018
My father. Anton Vanko.

501
00:39:28,228 --> 00:39:30,396
Well, I never heard of him.

502
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:34,192
My father is the reason you're alive.

503
00:39:34,193 --> 00:39:36,527
The reason I'm alive
is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

504
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:38,070
you missed.

505
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:39,363
Did I?

506
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:44,368
If you can make God bleed,

507
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,247
the people will cease to believe in him.

508
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:53,920
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

509
00:39:55,923 --> 00:40:00,343
The truth,
all I have to do is sit here and watch

510
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:02,929
as the world will consume you.

511
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,181
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

512
00:40:05,182 --> 00:40:09,101
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

513
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:11,479
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

514
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:14,941
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

515
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:35,836
It's just unbelievable. It proves
that the genie is out of the bottle

516
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:38,381
and this man has no idea
what he's doing.

517
00:40:38,465 --> 00:40:42,218
He thinks of the Iron Man weapon
as a toy.

518
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:47,139
I was at a hearing
where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant

519
00:40:47,224 --> 00:40:50,851
that these suits
can't exist anywhere else,

520
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:53,562
don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else,

521
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:54,981
at least for five to 10 years,

522
00:40:54,982 --> 00:40:59,610
and here we are in Monaco realising,
"These suits exist now."

523
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:00,861
Mute.

524
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:06,450
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

525
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:13,791
-What is that?
-This is your in-flight meal.

526
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:18,963
Did you just make that?

527
00:41:19,047 --> 00:41:22,466
Yeah. Where do you think I've been
for three hours?

528
00:41:23,468 --> 00:41:24,635
Tony,

529
00:41:26,805 --> 00:41:29,056
what are you not telling me?

530
00:41:32,978 --> 00:41:35,980
I don't want to go home. At all.

531
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,943
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

532
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:43,612
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

533
00:41:43,697 --> 00:41:44,905
-Remember?
-Oh, yes.

534
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,866
It's a great place to

535
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:52,496
-be healthy.
-I don't think this is the right time.

536
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:54,832
We're in kind of a mess.

537
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,625
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

538
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,736
-'Cause then we...
-Well, I think as the CEO,

539
00:41:58,754 --> 00:41:59,879
I need to show up.

540
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:04,258
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

541
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,760
-A leave?
-A company retreat.

542
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:08,304
-A retreat? During a time like this?
-Just a ride.

543
00:42:08,388 --> 00:42:11,974
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

544
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,810
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

545
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:28,903
Hey, there he is.

546
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:31,071
There he is.

547
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:36,160
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

548
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:38,385
Oh, goodness gracious.

549
00:44:38,413 --> 00:44:41,916
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

550
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,503
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

551
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:49,381
I didn't want to make
a first impression like this.

552
00:44:49,466 --> 00:44:51,759
He's not an animal. Come on.

553
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:55,304
He's a human being. Thank you.

554
00:45:00,352 --> 00:45:01,769
We're fine.

555
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:05,105
My name is Justin Hammer.

556
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,526
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

557
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,740
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

558
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:18,160
-We have some salmon carpaccio.
-Salmon carpaccio.

559
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:21,455
Anything you want here, we got it.

560
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,626
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

561
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,586
It's Italian, though.

562
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:29,463
Organic ice cream.

563
00:45:29,548 --> 00:45:33,467
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

564
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:38,180
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track,

565
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:41,934
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

566
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:44,144
that was... Wow!

567
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:45,789
You spoke to me with what you did.

568
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,482
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

569
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:50,192
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

570
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:53,070
to God knows where. It would have been
such a waste of talent.

571
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:54,488
But if I might make a suggestion,

572
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:57,199
you know,
you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

573
00:45:57,325 --> 00:46:01,537
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

574
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:03,706
That's what you kill.

575
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:06,792
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

576
00:46:06,876 --> 00:46:11,505
The only difference between you and I
is that I have resources.

577
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,758
I think, if I may,

578
00:46:14,843 --> 00:46:17,177
you need my resources.

579
00:46:17,262 --> 00:46:19,847
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

580
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:22,016
I'd like to be that guy.

581
00:46:33,903 --> 00:46:38,198
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

582
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:41,201
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

583
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:42,620
Very good, man.

584
00:46:42,704 --> 00:46:45,873
-Very good, man.
-Very good, man.

585
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:47,082
Hey!

586
00:46:48,627 --> 00:46:50,794
-Hey.
-Yes?

587
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,463
I want my bird.

588
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:58,135
-A bird? You want a bird?
-I want my bird.

589
00:46:58,136 --> 00:46:59,970
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

590
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:01,513
I want my bird.

591
00:47:01,598 --> 00:47:04,141
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

592
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:07,895
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

593
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:11,106
Yes, but the fundamentals
of the company are still very, very strong

594
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:13,108
-despite the events in Monaco.
-Yes, of course.

595
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:16,570
-The AP wants a quote.
-Don't tell him. Fax them...

596
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:18,155
Where is he?

597
00:47:18,156 --> 00:47:20,115
-He doesn't want to be disturbed.
-He's downstairs.

598
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:21,659
-...what happened in Monaco?
-Yes, but...

599
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,161
But his continuing erratic behaviour

600
00:47:24,245 --> 00:47:26,372
may lead many people
to ask themselves,

601
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:28,290
"Can this man still protect us?"

602
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:31,966
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

603
00:47:32,962 --> 00:47:37,341
Query complete, sir.
Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist

604
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:40,427
who defected to the United States
in 1963.

605
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:44,682
However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.

606
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:47,142
His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,

607
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:51,980
was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

608
00:47:52,107 --> 00:47:54,566
and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.

609
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:56,777
No further records exist.

610
00:48:01,324 --> 00:48:02,950
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

611
00:48:03,034 --> 00:48:05,285
and get on top
of this situation right now.

612
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:08,500
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

613
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:12,543
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH,

614
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:15,504
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

615
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:17,715
They're gonna take your suits,
Tony, okay?

616
00:48:17,716 --> 00:48:19,633
They're sick of the games.

617
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:22,968
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

618
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:26,223
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

619
00:48:26,307 --> 00:48:28,642
It's not theoretical any more.

620
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:31,895
Are you listening to me?

621
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:35,649
-Are you okay?
-Let's go.

622
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:42,573
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

623
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:48,287
-You all right?
-Yeah, I should get to my desk.

624
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:50,497
-See that cigar box?
-Yeah.

625
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:52,499
It's palladium.

626
00:48:57,948 --> 00:49:01,049
Is that supposed to be smoking?

627
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,345
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

628
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:11,185
You had this in your body?

629
00:49:16,024 --> 00:49:19,860
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

630
00:49:19,944 --> 00:49:21,361
Road rash.

631
00:49:24,741 --> 00:49:26,116
Thank you.

632
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:41,048
-What are you looking at?
-I'm looking at you.

633
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:44,176
You wanna do
this whole lone gunslinger act

634
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:46,386
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

635
00:49:46,387 --> 00:49:48,722
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

636
00:49:48,723 --> 00:49:50,933
But you've gotta trust me.

637
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,811
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

638
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:05,864
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

639
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:09,409
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

640
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:10,911
No pressure.

641
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:13,997
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

642
00:50:13,998 --> 00:50:15,624
I may have done a few miscalculations

643
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:17,751
and rushed the prototype
into production.

644
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:19,586
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

645
00:50:19,671 --> 00:50:21,964
Go ahead, take a look around.

646
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:28,679
You don't wanna do that.

647
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:30,389
You'll be able to access that

648
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,474
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

649
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:34,643
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

650
00:50:34,644 --> 00:50:37,771
Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

651
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,607
Never mind, I...

652
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:45,153
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

653
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:49,950
-Sorry?
-Software shit.

654
00:50:52,203 --> 00:50:53,453
Well...

655
00:50:54,956 --> 00:50:56,373
You're good.

656
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:59,793
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

657
00:51:01,045 --> 00:51:03,922
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

658
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:05,966
Go ahead, take a look.

659
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:09,469
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

660
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,638
You know,
those are really just for show and tell.

661
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:16,643
They're $1 25.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

662
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,648
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

663
00:51:22,483 --> 00:51:25,068
That's where the pilot goes.

664
00:51:25,153 --> 00:51:29,197
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

665
00:51:29,324 --> 00:51:32,451
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

666
00:51:32,535 --> 00:51:34,036
What you want them do?

667
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:39,333
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

668
00:51:39,334 --> 00:51:41,543
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

669
00:51:41,544 --> 00:51:42,753
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

670
00:51:42,754 --> 00:51:44,744
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

671
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:46,256
You know what I'm talking about?

672
00:51:46,257 --> 00:51:48,425
-I can do that. No problem.
-Yeah?

673
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:50,677
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

674
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:53,472
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

675
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:05,859
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

676
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,861
I'll give them a look.

677
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,199
I should cancel the party.

678
00:52:13,284 --> 00:52:14,534
-Probably.
-Yeah.

679
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:17,245
-'Cause it's...
-Ill-timed.

680
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:18,914
Right, sends the wrong message.

681
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:20,415
Inappropriate.

682
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:28,548
Is that dirty enough for you?

683
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,303
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

684
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:35,263
Bring them over here.

685
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,727
I'll take that. Why don't you...

686
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:55,117
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

687
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,577
-Where are you from?
-Legal.

688
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:02,459
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

689
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,792
Bit odd.

690
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:07,462
If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,

691
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:09,131
how would you celebrate it?

692
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:15,971
I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

693
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:48,795
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

694
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:51,673
Yes, sir, I understand.

695
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,011
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

696
00:53:56,012 --> 00:53:58,513
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

697
00:53:58,514 --> 00:54:00,348
Iron Man will be back on watch.

698
00:54:07,648 --> 00:54:09,149
Hey, Pepper.

699
00:54:09,484 --> 00:54:11,568
I'm going to go get some air.

700
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:13,028
What's wrong?

701
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:16,231
-I don't know what to do.
-You gotta be kidding me.

702
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:25,040
-That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
-No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

703
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:27,042
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

704
00:54:27,043 --> 00:54:28,293
I know. I know. I get it.

705
00:54:28,294 --> 00:54:29,711
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

706
00:54:29,712 --> 00:54:32,672
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

707
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:35,592
You know, the question
I get asked most often is,

708
00:54:35,593 --> 00:54:38,094
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom
in the suit?"

709
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:42,933
Just like that.

710
00:54:46,562 --> 00:54:49,523
Does this guy know
how to throw a party or what?

711
00:54:53,194 --> 00:54:54,244
I love you.

712
00:54:54,362 --> 00:54:56,988
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

713
00:54:57,073 --> 00:55:01,034
Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.

714
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:05,121
And we're gonna say good night now,
and thank you all for coming.

715
00:55:05,122 --> 00:55:06,540
No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.

716
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,375
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

717
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:11,206
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

718
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,713
-You're out of control, gorgeous.
-It's time to go to bed. It's time.

719
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:14,881
-Give me another smooch.
-You're not going to be

720
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:16,216
-happy about this.
-Come on, you know you want to.

721
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:17,551
You just peed the suit.

722
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:19,219
-I know. It has a filtration system.
-It's not sexy.

723
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,595
You could drink that water.

724
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:24,266
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

725
00:55:24,392 --> 00:55:26,101
-If you say so.
-Okay.

726
00:55:26,227 --> 00:55:28,395
I'll take this, you take that.

727
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:31,398
Pepper Potts.

728
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:34,234
She's right. The party's over.

729
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:37,404
Then again, the party was over for me,
like, an hour and a half ago.

730
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:40,907
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.

731
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:48,623
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

732
00:55:55,089 --> 00:55:56,464
Yeah!

733
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:02,095
Hit!

734
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:20,947
Pull!

735
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:32,125
I think she wants the Gallagher!

736
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:43,386
I'm only gonna say this once.

737
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:48,224
Get out.

738
00:56:54,732 --> 00:56:57,817
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

739
00:56:59,445 --> 00:57:00,612
Goldstein.

740
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:03,073
Yes, Mr Stark?

741
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:06,409
Give me a phat beat
to beat my buddy's ass to.

742
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:12,207
I told you to shut it down.

743
00:57:22,718 --> 00:57:26,304
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

744
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,270
Really?

745
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:45,657
Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

746
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:48,493
Sidekick this!

747
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:58,503
Had enough?

748
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:00,880
-Natalie!
-Miss Potts.

749
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:03,091
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

750
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:05,218
You know what?
Ever since you came here...

751
00:58:08,931 --> 00:58:09,981
Pepper!

752
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:12,957
Get out of here. Get out of here.

753
00:58:19,108 --> 00:58:21,860
You want it? Take it!

754
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,319
Put your hand down.

755
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,696
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

756
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:08,137
We don't have to do this, Tony.

757
00:59:08,138 --> 00:59:10,033
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

758
00:59:10,034 --> 00:59:11,904
-Put it down!
-You gonna take a shot?

759
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:13,203
-Put it down!
-No!

760
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:14,746
-Drop it, Tony!
-Take it.

761
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:28,278
Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes,

762
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:31,489
inbound from three miles east
at 5,000 feet...

763
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,243
Colonel.

764
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:19,454
Major.

765
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:21,331
Wow.

766
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:23,833
Yeah.

767
01:01:25,669 --> 01:01:27,587
Let's take it inside.

768
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:29,172
Clear the area.

769
01:01:51,946 --> 01:01:53,154
Sir!

770
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:55,698
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

771
01:01:59,745 --> 01:02:02,575
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

772
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:06,459
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

773
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:09,754
-How's that working out for you?
-It's... It's... It's...

774
01:02:09,755 --> 01:02:12,674
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

775
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:14,467
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

776
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:16,761
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

777
01:02:16,762 --> 01:02:19,097
I'm not sure if you're real
or if I'm having...

778
01:02:19,181 --> 01:02:21,266
I am very real.

779
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,700
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

780
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:27,162
-Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
-That's not looking so good.

781
01:02:27,856 --> 01:02:29,857
I've been worse.

782
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:32,652
We've secured the perimeter,

783
01:02:32,653 --> 01:02:35,530
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

784
01:02:39,118 --> 01:02:41,953
-You're fired.
-That's not up to you.

785
01:02:42,663 --> 01:02:45,873
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.

786
01:02:45,874 --> 01:02:47,166
-Hi.
-I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

787
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:49,877
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

788
01:02:49,878 --> 01:02:51,713
I suggest you apologise.

789
01:02:51,797 --> 01:02:53,339
You've been very busy.

790
01:02:53,424 --> 01:02:56,676
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

791
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,762
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

792
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:01,227
Now, if I didn't know better...

793
01:03:01,228 --> 01:03:03,391
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

794
01:03:03,392 --> 01:03:06,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

795
01:03:06,145 --> 01:03:09,355
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

796
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:12,317
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

797
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:13,526
Is that possible?

798
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:16,321
Well, according to Mr Stark's
database security guidelines,

799
01:03:16,322 --> 01:03:19,324
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorised usage.

800
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:24,746
-What do you want from me?
-What do we want from you?

801
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,706
What do you want from me?

802
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:30,460
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

803
01:03:30,544 --> 01:03:33,796
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the centre of my universe.

804
01:03:33,797 --> 01:03:37,008
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

805
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:38,059
Hit him.

806
01:03:39,261 --> 01:03:42,597
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

807
01:03:43,057 --> 01:03:45,975
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

808
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,188
-What did she just do to me?
-What did we just do for you?

809
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:52,774
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

810
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:54,650
We're trying to get you back to work.

811
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:56,903
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

812
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:58,905
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

813
01:03:58,906 --> 01:04:01,407
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

814
01:04:01,492 --> 01:04:03,701
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

815
01:04:03,702 --> 01:04:06,245
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

816
01:04:06,246 --> 01:04:10,666
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

817
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,836
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

818
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:18,424
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

819
01:04:18,509 --> 01:04:20,051
Candygram.

820
01:04:24,264 --> 01:04:25,723
I brought you something.

821
01:04:26,308 --> 01:04:28,059
Oh, yeah.

822
01:04:30,604 --> 01:04:32,438
We got you the bird, pal.

823
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:33,856
This is not my bird.

824
01:04:33,857 --> 01:04:36,442
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

825
01:04:36,443 --> 01:04:39,237
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

826
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:40,613
This is a great bird.

827
01:04:40,614 --> 01:04:43,408
-It's a beautiful bird.
-We got this all the way from Russia.

828
01:04:43,409 --> 01:04:45,868
Hey, man, this not my bird.

829
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:52,125
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

830
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:55,002
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

831
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:56,796
Learn to let go.

832
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:02,051
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

833
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:05,721
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

834
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:17,775
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

835
01:05:17,776 --> 01:05:20,862
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

836
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:23,448
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

837
01:05:23,449 --> 01:05:25,450
-Jack, could you put your head in there?
-No.

838
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:28,701
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

839
01:05:28,745 --> 01:05:31,414
See, Ivan?
He can't put his head in there.

840
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:35,877
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

841
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:39,338
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

842
01:05:39,673 --> 01:05:41,799
-Drone better.
-What? Drone better?

843
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:44,469
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

844
01:05:44,553 --> 01:05:46,345
People make problem.

845
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,306
Trust me. Drone better.

846
01:05:48,765 --> 01:05:52,935
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

847
01:05:53,812 --> 01:05:55,646
You said, "No problem."

848
01:05:55,731 --> 01:05:58,649
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

849
01:05:58,734 --> 01:06:01,527
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

850
01:06:01,612 --> 01:06:03,613
Like Iron Man. You understand?

851
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:06,947
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

852
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:08,993
Hey, man.

853
01:06:10,537 --> 01:06:13,122
Don't get too attached to things.

854
01:06:13,832 --> 01:06:15,541
Learn to let go.

855
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:21,631
These drones
better steal the show, Ivan.

856
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:25,676
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.

857
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,938
Unbelievable.

858
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:40,066
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

859
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,528
-It's functional?
-Fully mission-capable.

860
01:06:43,904 --> 01:06:47,281
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

861
01:06:48,283 --> 01:06:49,333
Sir?

862
01:06:49,334 --> 01:06:52,119
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

863
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,746
We'd like this to introduce it.

864
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:55,498
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

865
01:06:55,499 --> 01:06:58,292
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

866
01:06:58,377 --> 01:07:01,420
-We've got to make this happen.
-Yes, General, but...

867
01:07:01,505 --> 01:07:03,506
It's also an order.

868
01:07:03,882 --> 01:07:05,216
Yes, sir.

869
01:07:05,592 --> 01:07:09,053
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

870
01:07:09,137 --> 01:07:10,763
Thank you, sir.

871
01:07:16,937 --> 01:07:20,648
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

872
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:21,782
No, it was finished.

873
01:07:21,858 --> 01:07:25,987
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

874
01:07:26,071 --> 01:07:28,197
No. Howard said the arc reactor

875
01:07:28,198 --> 01:07:30,116
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

876
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:34,620
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

877
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:36,330
He was on to something big,

878
01:07:36,331 --> 01:07:39,792
something so big that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor

879
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:41,877
look like a triple-A battery.

880
01:07:41,962 --> 01:07:44,463
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

881
01:07:44,548 --> 01:07:47,633
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

882
01:07:47,718 --> 01:07:49,760
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

883
01:07:49,845 --> 01:07:52,255
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

884
01:07:52,256 --> 01:07:54,307
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

885
01:07:54,308 --> 01:07:55,933
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

886
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:58,686
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

887
01:07:58,687 --> 01:08:01,397
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

888
01:08:01,398 --> 01:08:05,526
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

889
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:07,320
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

890
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:09,614
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

891
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:13,868
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

892
01:08:13,994 --> 01:08:15,995
to finish what he started.

893
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:17,580
He said that?

894
01:08:17,748 --> 01:08:20,374
Are you that guy? Are you?

895
01:08:20,459 --> 01:08:25,755
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

896
01:08:27,763 --> 01:08:31,594
I don't know
where you get your information,

897
01:08:31,595 --> 01:08:33,846
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

898
01:08:33,847 --> 01:08:35,389
What do you remember
about your dad?

899
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,099
He was cold, he was calculating.

900
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:40,019
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

901
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,687
so it's a little tough for me to digest

902
01:08:41,688 --> 01:08:44,231
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

903
01:08:44,232 --> 01:08:47,193
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

904
01:08:47,194 --> 01:08:48,611
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

905
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:50,196
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

906
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:51,280
That's not true.

907
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:54,033
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

908
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:58,120
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

909
01:08:58,205 --> 01:08:59,372
What?

910
01:08:59,915 --> 01:09:01,999
-I got a 2:00.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

911
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,709
-What's this?
-Okay, you're good, right?

912
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:05,544
-No, I'm not good.
-You got this? Right? Right?

913
01:09:05,545 --> 01:09:07,505
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

914
01:09:07,506 --> 01:09:10,758
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

915
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:13,761
-You remember Agent Coulson, right?
-Yeah.

916
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:15,680
And Tony,

917
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,934
remember, I got my eye on you.

918
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:29,318
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

919
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:30,695
Good luck.

920
01:09:34,783 --> 01:09:36,033
Please.

921
01:09:36,034 --> 01:09:39,912
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

922
01:09:39,913 --> 01:09:42,164
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

923
01:09:42,165 --> 01:09:44,834
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

924
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:45,960
I'm not here for that.

925
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:47,586
I've been authorised by Director Fury

926
01:09:47,587 --> 01:09:50,117
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

927
01:09:50,132 --> 01:09:52,758
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

928
01:09:52,759 --> 01:09:56,137
I will tase you and watch Supernanny
while you drool into the carpet.

929
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:58,389
-Okay?
-I think I got it, yeah.

930
01:09:58,473 --> 01:10:00,349
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

931
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:28,335
Think this is the power source?

932
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:33,215
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

933
01:10:34,342 --> 01:10:35,676
Yes, sir.

934
01:10:36,094 --> 01:10:37,386
Oh, yes!

935
01:10:37,804 --> 01:10:39,722
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

936
01:10:39,806 --> 01:10:41,557
Is it my birthday?

937
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:45,269
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

938
01:10:48,398 --> 01:10:51,233
-Is this what I think it is?
-Yes, it is.

939
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:54,403
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

940
01:10:54,571 --> 01:10:56,071
What am I going to do for you?

941
01:10:56,072 --> 01:10:59,283
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

942
01:10:59,284 --> 01:11:02,369
-And then, second, I think I should...
-That's not what I'm talking about.

943
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,705
I'm talking about firepower.

944
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,292
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

945
01:11:09,586 --> 01:11:12,880
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

946
01:11:14,174 --> 01:11:16,509
Too downtown? I agree.

947
01:11:17,052 --> 01:11:19,303
M24 shotgun, pump action.

948
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,222
Five-round magazine.

949
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:22,723
You know what? You're not a hunter.

950
01:11:22,724 --> 01:11:24,892
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

951
01:11:24,893 --> 01:11:27,353
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

952
01:11:27,437 --> 01:11:29,730
They do make something
better than waffles.

953
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:32,775
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

954
01:11:32,776 --> 01:11:34,151
so I'm gonna put it right here.

955
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:37,196
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

956
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,324
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

957
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:41,909
You're tough.

958
01:11:41,993 --> 01:11:44,495
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

959
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:46,379
Don't let anyone tell you different.

960
01:11:46,498 --> 01:11:49,792
This is an M1 34 7.62 Minigun.

961
01:11:49,876 --> 01:11:53,337
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

962
01:11:53,338 --> 01:11:55,631
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

963
01:11:55,632 --> 01:11:58,008
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

964
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:02,096
Okay.

965
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:07,810
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

966
01:12:07,811 --> 01:12:11,480
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

967
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:15,776
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

968
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:19,864
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

969
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:22,178
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

970
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,619
A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was written in crayon.

971
01:12:26,204 --> 01:12:27,454
It would read it to you.

972
01:12:28,123 --> 01:12:29,623
This is my Eiffel Tower.

973
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:32,793
This is my Rachmaninoff's Th ird.
My Piet.

974
01:12:32,877 --> 01:12:35,963
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

975
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:40,759
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

976
01:12:41,845 --> 01:12:43,762
I call it the Ex-Wife.

977
01:12:48,893 --> 01:12:50,811
That's the best I got.

978
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:57,651
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

979
01:12:57,652 --> 01:13:01,614
-You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
-I think I'll take it.

980
01:13:01,906 --> 01:13:04,575
-Which one?
-All of it.

981
01:13:06,536 --> 01:13:07,586
All of it.

982
01:13:44,991 --> 01:13:48,619
Everything is achievable
through technology.

983
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:51,246
Better living, robust health

984
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:57,169
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

985
01:13:57,671 --> 01:13:58,921
I'm Howard Stark,

986
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:03,008
and everything you'll need for the future
can be found right here.

987
01:14:03,134 --> 01:14:06,136
City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of...

988
01:14:11,976 --> 01:14:13,102
I'm Howard Stark,

989
01:14:13,186 --> 01:14:17,106
and everything you'll need in the future
can be found right here.

990
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:20,025
So, from all of us at Stark lndustries,

991
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:22,444
I would like to personally...

992
01:14:22,445 --> 01:14:25,364
Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?

993
01:14:25,365 --> 01:14:28,992
Put that back.
Put it back where you got it from.

994
01:14:29,202 --> 01:14:31,370
Where's your mother? Maria?

995
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:33,706
Go on. Go, go, go, go.

996
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,210
All right, I think we got...

997
01:14:38,545 --> 01:14:40,379
I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...

998
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,218
Are you waiting on me?

999
01:14:48,012 --> 01:14:52,641
So, from all of us at Stark lndustries,
I'd like to personally show you

1000
01:14:53,393 --> 01:14:54,476
my ass.

1001
01:14:54,561 --> 01:14:56,645
I'd like to... I can't... This is...

1002
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:59,064
I can't... We have this, don't we?

1003
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:02,151
This is a ridiculous way...

1004
01:15:02,569 --> 01:15:04,069
Everything

1005
01:15:05,071 --> 01:15:06,572
is achievable

1006
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:09,241
through technology.

1007
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:22,838
Tony?

1008
01:15:22,839 --> 01:15:24,923
You're too young
to understand this right now,

1009
01:15:24,924 --> 01:15:27,926
so I thought
I would put it on film for you.

1010
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:31,597
I built this for you.

1011
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:35,267
And someday you'll realise
that it represents a whole lot more

1012
01:15:35,268 --> 01:15:39,271
than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.

1013
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,775
This is the key to the future.

1014
01:15:45,737 --> 01:15:50,532
I'm limited by the technology of my time,
but one day you'll figure this out.

1015
01:15:51,409 --> 01:15:53,118
And when you do,

1016
01:15:54,037 --> 01:15:56,121
you will change the world.

1017
01:15:57,582 --> 01:16:01,543
What is and always will be
my greatest creation

1018
01:16:03,922 --> 01:16:05,297
is you.

1019
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:29,071
-$6. Six.
-I don't have any dough.

1020
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:30,785
-Here.
-No, sir, that's too much.

1021
01:16:30,824 --> 01:16:31,990
No, it's fine. Take that.

1022
01:16:32,116 --> 01:16:34,117
-It's fine.
-No, seor.

1023
01:16:34,327 --> 01:16:37,329
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

1024
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:39,643
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

1025
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:42,292
-Are you Iron Man?
-Sometimes.

1026
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,169
We believe in you.

1027
01:16:44,629 --> 01:16:47,339
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

1028
01:16:47,757 --> 01:16:48,847
-Miss Potts?
-Relax.

1029
01:16:48,967 --> 01:16:50,017
-Mr Stark...
-Is here.

1030
01:16:50,093 --> 01:16:51,927
-He refuses...
-I don't. It's fine.

1031
01:16:52,011 --> 01:16:54,596
-I'll just be a second.
-Listen, it's our position

1032
01:16:54,681 --> 01:16:56,932
that Stark has and continues to maintain

1033
01:16:57,016 --> 01:16:59,768
proprietary ownership
of the Mark II platform.

1034
01:16:59,853 --> 01:17:02,604
When Mr Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,

1035
01:17:02,605 --> 01:17:04,982
-he was making a promise to America.
-No, the suit belongs to us.

1036
01:17:04,983 --> 01:17:06,903
We trusted that he would look out for us.

1037
01:17:06,904 --> 01:17:09,152
-Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
-He obviously did not.

1038
01:17:09,153 --> 01:17:11,530
-And now we learn that his secretary...
-Yes, it does.

1039
01:17:11,531 --> 01:17:13,866
...a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,

1040
01:17:13,992 --> 01:17:16,702
has been appointed
as CEO of Stark lndustries.

1041
01:17:16,786 --> 01:17:18,287
What are her qualifications?

1042
01:17:18,371 --> 01:17:19,521
-No.
-Ms Potts is doing

1043
01:17:19,522 --> 01:17:20,789
nothing to manage this terrible...

1044
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:22,291
-Mute.
-No...

1045
01:17:23,126 --> 01:17:25,127
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1046
01:17:25,128 --> 01:17:27,713
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent laWyers in the country

1047
01:17:27,714 --> 01:17:29,840
and then not let me pursue this.

1048
01:17:29,841 --> 01:17:31,383
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1049
01:17:31,384 --> 01:17:34,219
Well, then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1050
01:17:35,013 --> 01:17:36,513
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1051
01:17:36,556 --> 01:17:39,558
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1052
01:17:39,642 --> 01:17:42,519
-Will Tony Stark be there?
-Will I?

1053
01:17:43,146 --> 01:17:45,397
-No, he will not. Bye.
-I would like to be.

1054
01:17:46,691 --> 01:17:47,741
-Got a minute?
-No.

1055
01:17:47,859 --> 01:17:50,809
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

1056
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,323
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1057
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:56,074
I was just driving over here,

1058
01:17:56,075 --> 01:17:58,744
and I thought I was coming
to basically apologise, but I'm not.

1059
01:17:58,745 --> 01:18:01,580
-You didn't come here to apologise?
-Look, that goes without saying,

1060
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:03,165
and I'm working on that.

1061
01:18:03,249 --> 01:18:07,252
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1062
01:18:07,253 --> 01:18:08,587
and I just want to try to make good.

1063
01:18:08,588 --> 01:18:10,923
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1064
01:18:10,924 --> 01:18:12,215
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1065
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:13,606
-I'm trying to get some...
-No.

1066
01:18:16,095 --> 01:18:18,430
Do you know how short life is?

1067
01:18:18,556 --> 01:18:21,600
And if I never got to express...

1068
01:18:21,684 --> 01:18:24,353
And by the way,
this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1069
01:18:24,437 --> 01:18:26,855
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1070
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,607
I'm not expecting you to...

1071
01:18:28,608 --> 01:18:29,942
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1072
01:18:29,943 --> 01:18:31,902
-I'm just gonna say it.
-Let me stop you right here, okay?

1073
01:18:31,903 --> 01:18:34,363
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1074
01:18:34,447 --> 01:18:37,277
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

1075
01:18:37,784 --> 01:18:39,701
I am trying to run a company.

1076
01:18:39,786 --> 01:18:42,371
-Do you have any idea what that entails?
-Yes.

1077
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:45,540
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared,

1078
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:48,971
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

1079
01:18:51,464 --> 01:18:54,967
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

1080
01:18:58,721 --> 01:19:01,056
Did you bring me strawberries?

1081
01:19:01,057 --> 01:19:05,644
Did you know that there's only
one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1082
01:19:05,645 --> 01:19:07,938
Allergic to strawberries.

1083
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,608
This is progress, Pepper.

1084
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:14,319
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

1085
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,571
-I need you...
-I need you, too.

1086
01:19:16,572 --> 01:19:19,241
-...to leave now.
-That's what I'm trying to...

1087
01:19:24,414 --> 01:19:25,831
Ms Potts?

1088
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:29,793
-Hi, come on in.
-Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1089
01:19:30,336 --> 01:19:31,670
Thank you.

1090
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:35,007
-Anything else, boss?
-I'm good, Hap.

1091
01:19:35,008 --> 01:19:38,135
No, I'll be just...another minute.

1092
01:19:39,137 --> 01:19:40,817
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1093
01:19:45,018 --> 01:19:46,101
No.

1094
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:53,358
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1095
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:56,778
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1096
01:19:56,863 --> 01:19:59,781
I thought you two didn't get along.

1097
01:19:59,866 --> 01:20:03,201
-No. That's not so.
-It's just me you don't care for.

1098
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:05,787
-No? Nothing?
-Actually, while you're here,

1099
01:20:05,788 --> 01:20:09,041
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

1100
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:10,500
Absolutely.

1101
01:20:14,797 --> 01:20:18,050
I'm surprised
you can keep your mouth shut.

1102
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:19,134
Boy, you're good.

1103
01:20:19,135 --> 01:20:21,887
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

1104
01:20:21,888 --> 01:20:23,805
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

1105
01:20:23,806 --> 01:20:26,183
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

1106
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:27,384
Do you even speak Latin?

1107
01:20:29,395 --> 01:20:32,064
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

1108
01:20:32,148 --> 01:20:35,698
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

1109
01:20:36,986 --> 01:20:38,403
You're good.

1110
01:21:35,163 --> 01:21:40,966
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

1111
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:43,468
I need a manipulatable projection.

1112
01:21:50,768 --> 01:21:54,312
1974 Stark Expo
model scan complete, sir.

1113
01:21:56,524 --> 01:21:58,358
How many buildings are there?

1114
01:21:58,484 --> 01:22:00,902
Am I to include
the Belgian waffle stands?

1115
01:22:00,987 --> 01:22:03,530
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1116
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:20,922
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

1117
01:22:21,007 --> 01:22:24,509
In which case the nucleus
would be here.

1118
01:22:25,553 --> 01:22:27,679
Highlight the unisphere.

1119
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,484
-Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
-What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1120
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:43,403
I'm discovering... Correction.

1121
01:22:43,529 --> 01:22:47,490
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.

1122
01:22:48,242 --> 01:22:51,286
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

1123
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:53,705
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1124
01:22:58,502 --> 01:23:04,507
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

1125
01:23:07,553 --> 01:23:08,720
Dad.

1126
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:34,746
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

1127
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,548
The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.

1128
01:23:45,633 --> 01:23:46,716
Thanks, Dad.

1129
01:23:46,801 --> 01:23:50,053
Unfortunately, it is impossible
to synthesise.

1130
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,144
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

1131
01:24:45,484 --> 01:24:47,777
-I heard you broke the perimeter.
-Yeah.

1132
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:50,363
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

1133
01:24:50,364 --> 01:24:54,367
-I was doing some stuff.
-Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1134
01:24:54,368 --> 01:24:56,536
Hey, I'm playing for
the home team, Coulson,

1135
01:24:56,537 --> 01:24:58,705
you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1136
01:24:58,706 --> 01:25:01,116
Now, are you gonna let me work
or break my balls?

1137
01:25:02,835 --> 01:25:04,836
What's this doing here?

1138
01:25:06,672 --> 01:25:07,722
That's it.

1139
01:25:09,008 --> 01:25:11,134
-Bring that to me.
-You know what this is?

1140
01:25:11,218 --> 01:25:13,328
It's exactly what I need
to make this work.

1141
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,730
Lift the coil.

1142
01:25:16,223 --> 01:25:17,603
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1143
01:25:18,309 --> 01:25:20,185
There you go. And...

1144
01:25:21,187 --> 01:25:23,146
Drop it. Drop it.

1145
01:25:26,317 --> 01:25:29,402
Perfectly level.
I'm busy. What do you want?

1146
01:25:29,528 --> 01:25:32,697
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

1147
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:34,908
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1148
01:25:34,909 --> 01:25:37,368
-Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
-So I'm told.

1149
01:25:37,495 --> 01:25:39,537
-Secret stuff?
-Something like that.

1150
01:25:40,915 --> 01:25:41,965
-Good luck.
-Bye.

1151
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:44,125
-Thanks.
-We need you.

1152
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:47,212
-Yeah, more than you know.
-Not that much.

1153
01:26:05,564 --> 01:26:08,191
Initialising prismatic accelerator.

1154
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,699
Approaching maximum power.

1155
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:05,415
That was easy.

1156
01:27:21,974 --> 01:27:23,933
Congratulations, sir.

1157
01:27:25,644 --> 01:27:28,146
You have created a new element.

1158
01:27:36,113 --> 01:27:39,908
Sir, the reactor has accepted
the modified core.

1159
01:27:39,992 --> 01:27:42,619
I will begin running diagnostics.

1160
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,834
Hey, Ivan.

1161
01:27:50,127 --> 01:27:51,753
I got Senator Stern here.

1162
01:27:51,754 --> 01:27:54,297
Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.

1163
01:27:54,298 --> 01:27:56,549
The drone is not going to be ready.

1164
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:58,176
Not ready? What do you mean?

1165
01:27:58,177 --> 01:28:01,596
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

1166
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,681
What the hell is the difference?

1167
01:28:03,807 --> 01:28:06,559
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1168
01:28:06,852 --> 01:28:08,686
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1169
01:28:08,687 --> 01:28:12,023
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

1170
01:28:12,024 --> 01:28:15,318
-I can make salute.
-You can make salute?

1171
01:28:15,319 --> 01:28:16,861
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1172
01:28:16,862 --> 01:28:20,949
What the hell does that mean, lvan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1173
01:28:21,033 --> 01:28:23,743
You promised me suits
and then you promised me drones.

1174
01:28:23,744 --> 01:28:27,872
-Hey, man, everything will be okay.
-This is not what I wanted.

1175
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:42,595
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1176
01:28:44,181 --> 01:28:49,769
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1177
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:54,107
You said it wasn't,
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1178
01:28:54,233 --> 01:28:58,111
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.

1179
01:28:59,905 --> 01:29:01,072
Hey!

1180
01:29:03,117 --> 01:29:05,785
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1181
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:08,997
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1182
01:29:13,085 --> 01:29:14,752
I took your stuff.

1183
01:29:14,837 --> 01:29:18,006
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

1184
01:29:18,757 --> 01:29:21,426
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1185
01:29:23,345 --> 01:29:25,263
We had a contract.

1186
01:29:25,806 --> 01:29:27,640
I saved your life

1187
01:29:28,434 --> 01:29:30,435
and you give me suits.

1188
01:29:30,936 --> 01:29:32,687
That was our deal.

1189
01:29:32,771 --> 01:29:34,814
And you did not deliver.

1190
01:29:35,649 --> 01:29:40,153
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

1191
01:29:42,489 --> 01:29:45,825
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

1192
01:29:46,452 --> 01:29:49,662
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1193
01:29:49,955 --> 01:29:53,708
Now I have a piece of Stark tech
that I pimped out myself.

1194
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:55,793
And now your overpriced paperweights

1195
01:29:55,794 --> 01:29:58,384
are gonna look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

1196
01:29:58,881 --> 01:30:01,132
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1197
01:30:03,344 --> 01:30:07,638
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1198
01:30:11,018 --> 01:30:12,894
I'm gonna leave now.

1199
01:30:12,978 --> 01:30:16,064
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1200
01:30:16,065 --> 01:30:18,816
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1201
01:30:18,817 --> 01:30:21,319
They are not to be trifled with.

1202
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,654
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate

1203
01:30:23,655 --> 01:30:25,990
the terms of our agreement.

1204
01:30:26,575 --> 01:30:28,925
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement

1205
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:30,286
because if you don't,

1206
01:30:30,287 --> 01:30:32,872
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

1207
01:30:32,873 --> 01:30:34,540
a dead man.

1208
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:36,042
You got that?

1209
01:30:37,002 --> 01:30:39,337
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1210
01:30:45,935 --> 01:30:51,224
Dummy, you, can we clean up
this mess? You're killing me.

1211
01:30:51,225 --> 01:30:52,725
-You know I don't...
-Incoming call

1212
01:30:52,726 --> 01:30:54,477
with a blocked number, sir.

1213
01:30:54,561 --> 01:30:57,772
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

1214
01:30:57,773 --> 01:30:59,399
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

1215
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,110
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

1216
01:31:03,695 --> 01:31:05,738
-I double cycle.
-You what?

1217
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:10,618
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

1218
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:12,703
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

1219
01:31:12,704 --> 01:31:14,205
You, too.

1220
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:18,126
-Trace him.
-Sir.

1221
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:21,963
Now, the true history of Stark name
will be written.

1222
01:31:22,047 --> 01:31:23,131
Jarvis, where is he?

1223
01:31:23,215 --> 01:31:27,343
Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.

1224
01:31:27,428 --> 01:31:31,556
What your father did
to my family over 40 years,

1225
01:31:32,391 --> 01:31:35,059
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1226
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,437
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

1227
01:31:37,438 --> 01:31:38,771
Tri-State area.

1228
01:31:38,897 --> 01:31:41,107
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

1229
01:31:41,233 --> 01:31:43,109
I hope you're ready.

1230
01:31:45,904 --> 01:31:47,905
Call trace incomplete.

1231
01:31:58,459 --> 01:32:01,085
-Sir...
-You want to run some tests, run them.

1232
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:04,130
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

1233
01:32:04,131 --> 01:32:07,381
-We are unclear as to the effects...
-I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1234
01:32:10,971 --> 01:32:13,055
That tastes like coconut.

1235
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,849
And metal.

1236
01:32:15,184 --> 01:32:16,767
Oh, wow, yeah!

1237
01:32:27,445 --> 01:32:31,282
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

1238
01:32:31,283 --> 01:32:32,575
Thank you, Happy.

1239
01:32:32,659 --> 01:32:37,455
...Justin Hammer. His presentation
will begin shortly in the main pavilion.

1240
01:32:55,891 --> 01:32:57,141
Yeah.

1241
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:01,646
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.

1242
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:04,211
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,

1243
01:33:04,316 --> 01:33:08,819
this country has had to place its
brave men and women in harm's way,

1244
01:33:08,987 --> 01:33:10,613
but then the Iron Man arrived,

1245
01:33:10,697 --> 01:33:14,367
and we thought the days
of losing lives were behind us.

1246
01:33:15,202 --> 01:33:17,954
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

1247
01:33:18,038 --> 01:33:20,373
That's not fair. That's not right.

1248
01:33:20,457 --> 01:33:22,708
-And it's just too bad.
-Oh, Lord.

1249
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:24,961
Regardless, it was
an impressive innovation,

1250
01:33:24,962 --> 01:33:27,880
one that grabbed headlines
the world over.

1251
01:33:28,257 --> 01:33:29,882
Well, today, my friends,

1252
01:33:29,967 --> 01:33:33,427
the press is faced
with quite a different problem.

1253
01:33:33,929 --> 01:33:36,430
They are about to run out of ink.

1254
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:43,938
Get that out of here.

1255
01:33:44,898 --> 01:33:46,774
Ladies and gentlemen,

1256
01:33:47,818 --> 01:33:50,194
today I present to you

1257
01:33:50,487 --> 01:33:53,656
the new face
of the United States military.

1258
01:33:55,033 --> 01:33:56,325
The Hammer drone.

1259
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:00,288
Army!

1260
01:34:13,427 --> 01:34:14,594
Navy!

1261
01:34:24,813 --> 01:34:26,272
Air Force!

1262
01:34:34,156 --> 01:34:35,448
Marines!

1263
01:34:47,336 --> 01:34:49,962
Yeah!

1264
01:34:53,633 --> 01:34:57,063
That's a hell of a lot better
than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1265
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:00,556
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

1266
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:04,352
there will always be a need for man
to be present in the theatre of war.

1267
01:35:04,936 --> 01:35:07,980
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I am proud to present to you

1268
01:35:08,065 --> 01:35:09,815
the very first prototype

1269
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:13,194
in the Variable Threat Response
Battle Suit

1270
01:35:13,278 --> 01:35:17,114
and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

1271
01:35:18,658 --> 01:35:25,790
What?

1272
01:35:41,807 --> 01:35:45,057
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries is reporting for...

1273
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:02,785
We got trouble.

1274
01:36:02,869 --> 01:36:04,609
Tony, there are civilians present.

1275
01:36:04,663 --> 01:36:07,289
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1276
01:36:07,374 --> 01:36:08,666
Give them a wave.

1277
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,918
Hey, all right. Yeah.

1278
01:36:10,919 --> 01:36:13,129
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1279
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:15,214
You gotta trust me
for the next five minutes.

1280
01:36:15,215 --> 01:36:17,383
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

1281
01:36:17,384 --> 01:36:19,427
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1282
01:36:19,511 --> 01:36:21,137
Vanko's alive?

1283
01:36:22,347 --> 01:36:23,514
Yeah.

1284
01:36:23,598 --> 01:36:24,849
Where is he?

1285
01:36:25,225 --> 01:36:27,226
-What?
-Where's Vanko?

1286
01:36:27,686 --> 01:36:28,978
-Who?
-Tell me.

1287
01:36:29,604 --> 01:36:31,605
What are you doing here, man?

1288
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:33,357
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1289
01:36:37,737 --> 01:36:40,267
-Is that you?
-No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1290
01:36:41,241 --> 01:36:43,909
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

1291
01:36:44,703 --> 01:36:47,593
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

1292
01:36:48,248 --> 01:36:50,166
Let's take it outside.

1293
01:37:02,304 --> 01:37:03,554
No. No!

1294
01:37:13,523 --> 01:37:16,734
-Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
-Yes, sir.

1295
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:21,489
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1296
01:37:21,573 --> 01:37:23,240
-On what?
-On you.

1297
01:37:28,246 --> 01:37:30,080
Tony, on your six!

1298
01:37:43,823 --> 01:37:49,892
-What's going on? What's happening?
-The software's been overridden.

1299
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:51,185
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1300
01:37:51,186 --> 01:37:52,603
-What does that mean?
-I think he slaved the drones.

1301
01:37:52,604 --> 01:37:53,687
That's impossible.

1302
01:37:53,688 --> 01:37:55,564
-Call the guards.
-All the phones are down, sir.

1303
01:37:55,565 --> 01:37:57,691
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1304
01:37:57,692 --> 01:37:59,401
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

1305
01:37:59,402 --> 01:38:00,694
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

1306
01:38:00,695 --> 01:38:01,946
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1307
01:38:01,947 --> 01:38:03,531
Please, please, go away. Go away.

1308
01:38:03,532 --> 01:38:05,032
-I've got this handled.
-Have you now?

1309
01:38:05,033 --> 01:38:06,116
Yes, I do.

1310
01:38:06,117 --> 01:38:08,786
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

1311
01:38:08,787 --> 01:38:11,121
So please, now go away. Thank you.

1312
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:13,890
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

1313
01:38:14,084 --> 01:38:15,543
What?

1314
01:38:15,544 --> 01:38:17,044
You tell me who's behind this.

1315
01:38:17,045 --> 01:38:21,590
-Who's behind this?
-Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1316
01:38:21,967 --> 01:38:24,593
-Where is he?
-He's at my facility.

1317
01:38:27,931 --> 01:38:29,621
-I need NYPD, please.
-No, no, no!

1318
01:38:29,622 --> 01:38:30,933
-Command Central.
-No, no, honey.

1319
01:38:30,934 --> 01:38:32,935
-Don't call the authorities.
-Okay. Right away. Right away.

1320
01:38:32,936 --> 01:38:34,979
Step aside. Step aside.

1321
01:38:35,939 --> 01:38:37,606
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1322
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:47,992
-How are we doing, Jarvis?
-Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1323
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:07,011
This way.

1324
01:39:07,012 --> 01:39:09,597
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

1325
01:39:09,598 --> 01:39:11,849
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

1326
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:14,435
-I'm not taking you anywhere.
-Fine. You want me to drive?

1327
01:39:14,436 --> 01:39:16,979
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1328
01:40:15,413 --> 01:40:17,081
Nice work, kid.

1329
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:22,365
-You got multiples coming in on you.
-Let's get this away from the Expo.

1330
01:40:27,592 --> 01:40:30,062
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

1331
01:40:30,095 --> 01:40:33,764
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1332
01:40:36,059 --> 01:40:38,686
-Watch the road.
-I got it. I got it.

1333
01:41:09,092 --> 01:41:10,142
Listen, listen.

1334
01:41:10,143 --> 01:41:12,344
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

1335
01:41:12,345 --> 01:41:13,679
Got it.

1336
01:41:17,475 --> 01:41:18,934
I'm closing on you.

1337
01:41:19,018 --> 01:41:21,437
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

1338
01:41:37,287 --> 01:41:39,955
-Stay in the car.
-I'm not staying in the car.

1339
01:41:40,039 --> 01:41:41,623
I said, stay in the car.

1340
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:43,792
What are you wearing?

1341
01:41:45,044 --> 01:41:47,337
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

1342
01:41:47,338 --> 01:41:48,964
You want to help? Keep the car running.

1343
01:41:48,965 --> 01:41:50,215
Okay.

1344
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:56,013
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

1345
01:41:56,473 --> 01:41:58,015
Hold on. Hey!

1346
01:42:42,727 --> 01:42:44,645
Each set of drones is communicating

1347
01:42:44,646 --> 01:42:47,564
-in its own unique language.
-Well, choose one and focus on that.

1348
01:42:47,565 --> 01:42:50,155
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

1349
01:42:53,238 --> 01:42:55,614
Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.

1350
01:42:55,698 --> 01:42:57,950
We got it. We're on our way.

1351
01:43:39,409 --> 01:43:40,826
I got him!

1352
01:43:55,675 --> 01:43:57,718
-Rhodey, you still locked on?
-Yeah.

1353
01:43:57,802 --> 01:44:01,305
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

1354
01:44:03,474 --> 01:44:04,600
Wait, wait, wait!

1355
01:44:24,162 --> 01:44:25,621
He's gone.

1356
01:44:29,667 --> 01:44:31,717
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

1357
01:44:32,503 --> 01:44:34,338
What's your 20?

1358
01:44:45,975 --> 01:44:48,810
-What are you doing?
-I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1359
01:44:55,193 --> 01:44:56,243
Tony!

1360
01:45:12,752 --> 01:45:14,419
Reboot complete.

1361
01:45:15,088 --> 01:45:16,838
You got your best friend back.

1362
01:45:16,839 --> 01:45:20,384
-Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
-Well done with the new chest piece.

1363
01:45:20,385 --> 01:45:24,137
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

1364
01:45:24,138 --> 01:45:26,890
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.

1365
01:45:26,891 --> 01:45:29,142
What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?

1366
01:45:29,143 --> 01:45:30,894
Is that you? No, I'm not.

1367
01:45:30,895 --> 01:45:32,604
-Not any more.
-What's going on?

1368
01:45:32,605 --> 01:45:34,439
I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.

1369
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,066
You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?

1370
01:45:36,067 --> 01:45:37,901
-You didn't let me.
-Why didn't you tell me that?

1371
01:45:37,902 --> 01:45:40,612
I was gonna make you an omelette
and tell you.

1372
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:43,657
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1373
01:45:43,658 --> 01:45:45,409
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1374
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:47,244
-Great. Pepper?
-Are you okay now?

1375
01:45:47,328 --> 01:45:48,537
I am fine. Don't be mad.

1376
01:45:48,538 --> 01:45:50,288
-I will formally apologise...
-I am mad!

1377
01:45:50,289 --> 01:45:53,250
...when I'm not fending off
a Hammeroid attack.

1378
01:45:53,251 --> 01:45:54,835
-Fine.
-We could have been in Venice.

1379
01:45:54,836 --> 01:45:55,886
Oh, please.

1380
01:45:59,257 --> 01:46:00,632
Rhodes?

1381
01:46:01,092 --> 01:46:03,760
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.

1382
01:46:04,512 --> 01:46:06,805
They're coming.
Come on, let's roll. Get up.

1383
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,269
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

1384
01:46:15,773 --> 01:46:17,107
You okay?

1385
01:46:17,275 --> 01:46:18,817
Yeah, thanks.

1386
01:46:20,361 --> 01:46:22,779
-Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
-Don't be.

1387
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:24,156
No. I should have trusted you more.

1388
01:46:24,157 --> 01:46:25,824
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

1389
01:46:25,825 --> 01:46:28,235
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1390
01:46:28,286 --> 01:46:31,538
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

1391
01:46:31,789 --> 01:46:35,375
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

1392
01:46:35,376 --> 01:46:37,711
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

1393
01:46:37,712 --> 01:46:39,379
So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

1394
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:40,672
Got you.

1395
01:46:40,673 --> 01:46:42,674
-Where do you want to be?
-Where are you going?

1396
01:46:42,675 --> 01:46:44,384
-What're you talking about?
-I meant me.

1397
01:46:44,385 --> 01:46:46,386
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

1398
01:46:46,387 --> 01:46:47,971
-Tony, don't be jealous.
-No. It's subtle,

1399
01:46:47,972 --> 01:46:49,181
-all the bells and whistles.
-Yeah.

1400
01:46:49,182 --> 01:46:51,683
-It's called being a badass.
-Fine.

1401
01:46:52,393 --> 01:46:55,771
All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.

1402
01:46:55,772 --> 01:46:57,814
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

1403
01:46:57,815 --> 01:46:59,149
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

1404
01:46:59,150 --> 01:47:33,308
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

1405
01:47:51,869 --> 01:47:53,578
-See that?
-Yeah, yeah, nice.

1406
01:48:01,587 --> 01:48:02,879
Rhodey?

1407
01:48:04,215 --> 01:48:05,715
Get down.

1408
01:48:15,935 --> 01:48:18,395
Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.

1409
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:21,815
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1410
01:48:24,235 --> 01:48:26,403
I told you that five minutes ago.

1411
01:48:27,738 --> 01:48:29,114
That's your guy here.

1412
01:48:29,115 --> 01:48:32,576
-Excuse me?
-You're being placed under arrest.

1413
01:48:32,577 --> 01:48:34,077
-Are you kidding me?
-Hands behind your back, sir.

1414
01:48:34,078 --> 01:48:35,745
I'm trying to help here.

1415
01:48:39,834 --> 01:48:43,378
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1416
01:48:43,462 --> 01:48:45,046
That's good. That's good.

1417
01:48:45,047 --> 01:48:48,258
You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.

1418
01:48:48,259 --> 01:48:50,760
I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?

1419
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:51,928
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

1420
01:48:51,929 --> 01:48:54,931
I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.

1421
01:48:56,514 --> 01:49:00,687
When they get here,
I think you should station them

1422
01:49:00,688 --> 01:49:03,523
at the south, east and both west exits.

1423
01:49:03,524 --> 01:49:05,775
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

1424
01:49:05,776 --> 01:49:08,653
Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.

1425
01:49:08,654 --> 01:49:10,155
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1426
01:49:10,281 --> 01:49:13,742
-No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.
-Okay.

1427
01:49:15,494 --> 01:49:17,996
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

1428
01:49:18,122 --> 01:49:19,456
This one looks different.

1429
01:49:19,916 --> 01:49:22,446
The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

1430
01:49:33,387 --> 01:49:35,055
Good to be back.

1431
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:37,015
This ain't gonna be good.

1432
01:49:40,561 --> 01:49:42,646
I got something special for this guy.

1433
01:49:42,813 --> 01:49:44,983
I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.

1434
01:49:45,024 --> 01:49:46,483
With the what?

1435
01:49:56,869 --> 01:49:59,371
-Hammer tech?
-Yeah.

1436
01:50:01,207 --> 01:50:02,791
I got this.

1437
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,721
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1438
01:50:58,097 --> 01:51:00,598
-You want to be a hero?
-What?

1439
01:51:00,933 --> 01:51:03,893
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

1440
01:51:03,978 --> 01:51:05,854
-This is your idea?
-Yep.

1441
01:51:06,564 --> 01:51:09,149
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

1442
01:51:12,945 --> 01:51:14,029
Take it.

1443
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,017
You lose.

1444
01:51:51,567 --> 01:51:54,757
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

1445
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:56,071
Pepper?

1446
01:52:36,237 --> 01:52:38,037
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

1447
01:52:38,038 --> 01:52:39,572
-You can't?
-I can't take this.

1448
01:52:39,573 --> 01:52:41,074
-Look at me.
-My body, literally,

1449
01:52:41,075 --> 01:52:42,335
cannot handle the stress.

1450
01:52:42,409 --> 01:52:46,913
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.

1451
01:52:46,997 --> 01:52:48,998
I think I did okay.

1452
01:52:49,166 --> 01:52:51,209
I quit. I'm resigning.

1453
01:52:51,836 --> 01:52:53,211
That's it.

1454
01:52:53,796 --> 01:52:56,381
What did you just say? You're done?

1455
01:52:57,675 --> 01:53:01,177
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

1456
01:53:01,178 --> 01:53:04,973
-You don't have to make any excuses.
-I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1457
01:53:04,974 --> 01:53:06,182
You actually were just making excuses.

1458
01:53:06,183 --> 01:53:07,767
-But you don't have to.
-No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1459
01:53:07,768 --> 01:53:09,185
-I'm actually very justified.
-Listen. Hey, hey.

1460
01:53:09,186 --> 01:53:11,521
-You deserve better.
-Well...

1461
01:53:11,605 --> 01:53:14,190
You've taken such good care of me.

1462
01:53:14,191 --> 01:53:17,569
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

1463
01:53:17,570 --> 01:53:18,820
Right?

1464
01:53:18,904 --> 01:53:20,155
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1465
01:53:20,156 --> 01:53:23,992
-Thank you for understanding.
-Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1466
01:53:23,993 --> 01:53:26,744
-I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
-Okay. What about the press?

1467
01:53:26,745 --> 01:53:28,705
Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

1468
01:53:28,706 --> 01:53:30,498
-Well, with you it's like dog years.
-I know.

1469
01:53:30,499 --> 01:53:32,119
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1470
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:46,181
Weird.

1471
01:53:46,182 --> 01:53:48,016
-No, it's not weird.
-It's okay, right?

1472
01:53:48,017 --> 01:53:49,934
-Yeah.
-Run that by me again.

1473
01:53:50,019 --> 01:53:51,895
I think it was weird.

1474
01:53:52,313 --> 01:53:55,273
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1475
01:53:55,816 --> 01:53:58,276
-I had just quit, actually.
-Yeah, so we're not...

1476
01:53:58,360 --> 01:54:00,862
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1477
01:54:00,946 --> 01:54:03,865
-You should get lost.
-I was here first. Get a roof.

1478
01:54:03,866 --> 01:54:07,410
-I thought you were out of one-liners.
-That's the last one.

1479
01:54:07,411 --> 01:54:10,121
-You kicked ass back there, by the way.
-Thank you. You, too.

1480
01:54:10,122 --> 01:54:12,624
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1481
01:54:12,708 --> 01:54:15,877
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1482
01:54:15,961 --> 01:54:17,712
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1483
01:54:18,297 --> 01:54:19,547
It wasn't a question.

1484
01:54:25,137 --> 01:54:28,473
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

1485
01:54:48,953 --> 01:54:51,245
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1486
01:54:51,413 --> 01:54:53,581
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

1487
01:54:53,666 --> 01:54:58,920
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1488
01:55:00,172 --> 01:55:01,255
Read it.

1489
01:55:03,175 --> 01:55:07,178
"Personality overview. Mr Stark displays
compulsive behaviour."

1490
01:55:07,262 --> 01:55:09,430
In my own defence, that was last week.

1491
01:55:11,475 --> 01:55:14,310
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1492
01:55:14,436 --> 01:55:17,021
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1493
01:55:17,398 --> 01:55:20,233
"Textbook narcissism"?

1494
01:55:22,277 --> 01:55:23,361
Agreed.

1495
01:55:24,446 --> 01:55:25,822
Okay, here it is.

1496
01:55:25,906 --> 01:55:29,242
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1497
01:55:29,326 --> 01:55:31,869
-I gotta think about it.
-Read on.

1498
01:55:34,415 --> 01:55:35,957
"Tony Stark not...

1499
01:55:36,041 --> 01:55:37,583
"Not recommended"?

1500
01:55:37,584 --> 01:55:40,086
That doesn't make any sense.

1501
01:55:40,087 --> 01:55:43,006
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1502
01:55:43,674 --> 01:55:45,091
I got a new ticker.

1503
01:55:45,175 --> 01:55:48,177
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1504
01:55:48,762 --> 01:55:51,681
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1505
01:55:51,682 --> 01:55:54,475
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1506
01:55:54,476 --> 01:55:57,645
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1507
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:06,446
You can't afford me.

1508
01:56:06,447 --> 01:56:11,117
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1509
01:56:11,118 --> 01:56:13,995
in exchange for a small favour.

1510
01:56:14,955 --> 01:56:19,876
Rhodey and I are being honoured
in Washington and we need a presenter.

1511
01:56:21,712 --> 01:56:23,212
I'll see what I can do.

1512
01:56:24,923 --> 01:56:29,761
It is my honour to be here today
to present these distinguished awards

1513
01:56:29,845 --> 01:56:33,848
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
and Mr Tony Stark,

1514
01:56:33,932 --> 01:56:37,268
who is, of course, a national treasure.

1515
01:56:37,819 --> 01:56:40,855
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1516
01:56:40,856 --> 01:56:43,524
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1517
01:56:43,525 --> 01:56:45,526
-You deserve this.
-Thank you, sir.

1518
01:56:47,237 --> 01:56:48,529
Mr Stark.

1519
01:56:48,614 --> 01:56:52,700
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1520
01:56:52,785 --> 01:56:54,452
You deserve this.

1521
01:56:55,913 --> 01:56:58,372
Oh, sorry.

1522
01:56:58,457 --> 01:57:01,876
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

1523
01:57:03,337 --> 01:57:05,129
Let's get a photo.

1524
02:04:31,284 --> 02:04:33,244
