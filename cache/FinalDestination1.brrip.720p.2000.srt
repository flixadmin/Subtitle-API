1
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,890
Alex.

2
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,393
Tod and George's dad just called.

3
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,312
He's picking you up at 3:30 tomorrow.

4
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,440
And the bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.

5
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,609
How's my suitcase working out for you?

6
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,195
Whoa, Mom, Mom, Mom,
you gotta leave that on.

7
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,949
Yeah, it's like the tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing or anything.

8
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,953
So I figure it's gotta be on the bag,
or at least, with the bag.

9
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,456
For luck.

10
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,292
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

11
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,793
I'm still here.

12
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,593
So 17, on the loose.

13
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,095
Senior trip with your friends in Paris.

14
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,973
Ten days in the springtime.

15
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,726
Live it up, Alex.

16
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,645
You got your whole life ahead of you.

17
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,400
Alex.

18
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,193
Alex.

19
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,963
The white zone...

20
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,091
...is for immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.

21
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,843
No parking.

22
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,638
Yeah, I've been sitting here
for over an hour.

23
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,557
Where are you?

24
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,808
- Hey, Hitchcock.
- What?

25
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,561
Let me give you a hand with this, man.
There you go.

26
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,062
Carter, you dick.

27
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,565
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

28
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,402
- You left this on the bus.
- Oh, thanks.

29
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,112
Come on, let's get your stuff together.

30
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,073
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

31
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,951
- What are you doing?
- He's the man. The man.

32
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,745
All right, you guys got everything?

33
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,997
Yeah, yeah. Dad, we're all set.

34
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,586
Does that mean go?

35
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,339
Don't know.

36
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,092
Look, this is for both of you, all right?
Have a great time.

37
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

38
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,595
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

39
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,929
- Alex.
- Yes?

40
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,724
- You take care of them.
- I will.

41
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,444
You know, I didn't think anything
could look worse than my yearbook photo.

42
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,405
How do you think I feel
having to look at you all the time?

43
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,083
- What the fuck does he want?
- Shh.

44
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,548
"The airport does not endorse solicitors."

45
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,810
Death is not the end.

46
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,148
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

47
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,819
- Hare Rama.
- Fuck off.

48
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,910
I have to ask you a few questions
this evening.

49
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,537
Did you pack your bags yourself?

50
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,707
Have your belongings remained
in your possession the entire time?

51
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,503
Mr. Browning?

52
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,589
Oh, yeah.

53
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,009
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

54
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,775
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

55
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,862
September 25, 9:25.

56
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,532
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

57
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,290
- Because I looked at him.
- Are you sure?

58
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,375
Lisa, wait up.

59
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,170
No, it's okay.

60
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,588
Fuck, that was good.

61
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,047
Dick.

62
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,216
- Hey.
- Hey, George, Dad said both.

63
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,719
Both of us, all right, man?
Just give me some cash.

64
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,180
Hey, hey, knock it off.

65
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,474
Excuse me.
Catch.

66
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,517
You asshole.

67
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,447
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

68
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,686
Alex, let's go take a shit.

69
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,649
- Why don't you go by yourself?
- No, dude. Listen, okay?

70
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,108
Listen, take some knowledge.

71
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,194
We're about to board a seven-hour flight.

72
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,656
The toilets in coach are barely
ventilated closets, all right, if that.

73
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,368
Now, let's say halfway through the flight,
your body wants that food out.

74
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,161
You gotta go torque a wicked cable.

75
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,791
And then right after you, like,
directly after you walks in Christa or Blake.

76
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,796
You want them to associate you
with that watery sting in their eye?

77
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,465
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

78
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,313
John Denver.

79
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,154
Died in a plane crash.

80
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,157
Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for your patience.

81
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,326
At this time,
we would like to begin preboarding...

82
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:43,039
...of Volee Air Flight 180 to Paris
through Gate 46.

83
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,719
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?

84
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,304
How did we lose him?

85
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,563
Go. Go.

86
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,591
Go. Ow.

87
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,676
Ow. That hurt.

88
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,568
Oh, my little baby.

89
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,363
That's a good sign.
The younger, the better.

90
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,740
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

91
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,368
Hi.

92
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,914
A really fucked-up God.

93
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,999
Yeah.

94
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,085
-Hi.
-Hey, Tod.

95
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,171
Hello. How you doing?
I'm gonna sit here.

96
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,315
-Can you switch seats with Christa?
-Oh, God.

97
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,110
You know, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

98
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,905
It's a urinary tract infection.

99
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,573
Let's go ask Alex.

100
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,210
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

101
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,797
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some sort of medical thing.

102
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,591
Please?

103
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,344
Yeah.

104
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,515
You're so sweet.

105
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,977
-Thanks, Alex.
-Thank you, Alex.

106
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,646
You're welcome, you're welcome,
you're welcome.

107
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,982
Fag.

108
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,863
Did you really think we're gonna
titty fuck them over Greenland?

109
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,618
You know, because of you, I gotta sit here
and watch fucking Stuart Little.

110
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,537
Thank you.

111
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,748
Thanks, man. That's great.

112
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,211
Sorry I'm late.
That's my seat right there.

113
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,590
-Hello?
-I'm going that way.

114
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,759
May I have your attention?

115
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,721
To properly fasten your seat belts,
slide the flat portion into the buckle.

116
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,935
--equipped with six emergency exits: two
in front, two over the wing, two in the rear.

117
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,437
All exits are clearly marked.

118
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,732
Follow the red exit signs
and public lighting in the aisle way.

119
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,610
Flight attendants, prepare for departure.

120
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,532
-All right.
-All right, all right.

121
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,536
Yeah.

122
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,498
Whatever.

123
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,090
Huh?

124
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,263
It's okay.

125
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,852
-I wanna go.
-It's fine.

126
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,945
It's okay, honey, I....

127
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,328
What the...?

128
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,464
Oh, my God!

129
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,306
Everybody....

130
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,498
No! No!

131
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,418
Christa! No!

132
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,862
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

133
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,740
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some medical thing.

134
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,159
Please?

135
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,042
What's up, dude?

136
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,215
-Is there a problem, sir?
-What's your problem?

137
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,675
Alex, qu'est-ce que c'est?

138
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,970
-The fucking plane's gonna explode.
-Shut up, Browning.

139
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,389
-You're so not funny.
-If this is your joke--

140
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,182
It's not a joke. It's not a joke.

141
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,810
-Alex, take it easy.
-That's it, sit down, Browning.

142
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,396
-It's going down.
-We will remove you.

143
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,564
-I'll remove him.
-I'll remove myself.

144
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,066
-Excuse me.
-Get off him.

145
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,903
-That's my seat right there.
-This plane is going down.

146
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,322
Everybody in the aisle, off the plane.

147
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,324
-Get off the plane.
-Stay where you are.

148
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,910
-Just sit tight.
-The fucking plane is going down.

149
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,080
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

150
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,373
Okay.

151
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,051
-I got my ticket here.
-Get off me.

152
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,595
Jerk.

153
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,180
-Hey.
-You got this?

154
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,932
No one gets back onboard.

155
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,685
-That's my call.
-Wait, please.

156
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,271
I've got 40 students going to Paris.
Please, please?

157
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,150
-Look, you must understand my position.
-I understand, and I apologize for Alex.

158
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,193
But one of us needs to be on that plane.

159
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,612
I cannot let students
go to Paris for ten days....

160
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,573
Carter, no.

161
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,450
-Sit the fuck down, Carter.
-Sit down.

162
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,617
Sit.

163
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,162
One of you can go on the flight. That's it.

164
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,039
Larry.

165
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,793
Airline's not taking this well.
They'll let one of us back on.

166
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,588
The rest can take an 11:10 flight.
It gets in three--

167
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,339
I'll stay.

168
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,135
No, no, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane, it's fine.

169
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,888
Hi, Mr. Murnau.
See, I was in the bathroom.

170
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,973
And the lock, it was stuck, and....

171
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,975
Oh, wait, I didn't fight with anyone.

172
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,145
Damn.

173
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,147
Thanks.

174
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,738
I just-- I called your parents.
They're on their way.

175
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,161
We should be going.

176
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,792
Alex, talk to me. Tell me what happened.

177
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,002
I saw it.

178
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,297
Like, I don't know. I saw it.
I saw it on the runway.

179
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,840
I saw it take off.

180
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,258
I saw out my window.

181
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,761
-I saw the ground, and....
-Carter.

182
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,348
The cabin, it starts to shake, right?
And the left side blows up.

183
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,350
And then the whole plane just explodes.

184
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,020
And it was so real. Just like
how everything happens, you know?

185
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,647
You been on planes that blew up?

186
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,273
You must have fallen asleep.

187
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,360
Whoa, we get thrown off the plane.

188
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,362
We blow, what, a half a day in Paris...

189
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,948
...all because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

190
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,118
But wait, "The plane, it's gonna blow up,
it's gonna blow up."

191
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,161
-Hey, hey, fuck you, Horton.
-Tod.

192
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,872
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital.

193
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,457
Get off him.
Hey, hey.

194
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,668
Alex, stop it.
Come on, now.

195
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,674
There they go, here we stay.

196
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,304
-You're paying for my trip.
-I wish you were on that plane.

197
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,890
-You fucking prick.
-Oh, shit!

198
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,068
Call it in.
Security....

199
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,331
You're looking at me as if I caused this.

200
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,836
I didn't cause this.

201
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,883
Are there any survivors?

202
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,973
How should I know?

203
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,729
-What, you think I'm some sort of--?
-He's not a witch.

204
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,739
Hello, I'm Howard Seigel,
National Transportation Safety Board.

205
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,660
We've contacted all your families.
They are on the way.

206
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:50,164
Is there anyone here who feels they
might need a little medical attention...

207
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,541
...or spiritual counseling at this time?

208
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,001
What's going on?

209
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,003
Are there any survivors?

210
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,841
Well, the cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

211
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,302
The Nassau County authorities
are on the scene.

212
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,263
Naval Search and Rescue en route. We--

213
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,848
Excuse me.

214
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,976
I'm Agent Weine. This is Agent Schreck.

215
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,811
We're with the FBI.

216
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,355
I understand how you all
must be feeling right now.

217
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,023
I know it's gonna be difficult.

218
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,818
We're gonna ask you questions
regarding today's events...

219
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,987
...while they're still fresh in your mind.

220
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,491
This will prove invaluable to our rescue
attempts and any criminal investigation.

221
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,541
You said, "Listen to me.
This plane will explode on takeoff."

222
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,127
How did you know that?

223
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,546
I got this feeling.

224
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,382
This weird feeling.

225
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,427
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding the plane?

226
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,471
Did you take any sleeping pills,
any narcotics, hallucinogens?

227
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,974
-Alex, do you take any drugs?
-No.

228
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,394
I saw it.

229
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,231
I saw it happen.

230
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,233
I saw the plane explode.

231
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,944
Did the feelings
have anything to do with your saying...

232
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:06,240
...that you wished that Carter Horton
was on the plane just before it exploded?

233
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,202
-No.
-Then why'd you say it?

234
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,622
Because I really didn't think
it was gonna happen.

235
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,419
If that's the case, Alex,
then why did you really get off the plane?

236
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:27,511
My brother, George,
he told me to go and keep an eye on Alex.

237
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:32,558
And so he stayed, and....

238
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,858
He told me to get off the plane.

239
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:47,490
Larry Murnau said I should get back on,
but I told him that he should go.

240
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,577
I sent him back on the plane.

241
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,581
All right.

242
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,709
Nobody forced you off the plane.

243
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,962
You said you weren't friends
with those that were.

244
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,382
So, Clear,
why did you get off the plane?

245
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,512
Because I saw and I heard Alex.

246
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,935
And I believed him.

247
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,616
Honey.

248
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,495
Oh, God.

249
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,417
There he is.

250
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,168
Over here.

251
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,195
Thank you for the ride.

252
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,760
You're looking
at the first piece of debris...

253
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,429
...to wash ashore
from Volée Air Flight 180...

254
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,599
...which erupted shortly
after a 9:25 p.m. takeoff...

255
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,227
...from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.

256
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,312
There are no known survivors.

257
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,190
However, Coast Guard
and Naval Search and Rescue efforts...

258
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:31,237
...are continuing at this moment even
as jet fuel burns on the ocean's surface.

259
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,989
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

260
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:37,243
...of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

261
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,288
All 287 passengers are feared dead.

262
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:45,417
Amongst the travelers,
a class of 40 students and four teachers...

263
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,295
...from Mount Abraham High School
in southeast New York...

264
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,631
...en route to Paris on a field trip.

265
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,510
There are reports that several students
were removed from the aircraft...

266
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,136
...moments before departure.

267
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:00,307
However, investigators remain guarded
about the specifics of this incident.

268
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,727
Authorities from the National Transportation
and Safety Board...

269
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,939
...and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
have arrived at JFK...

270
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,483
...to begin the initial investigation.

271
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,486
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...

272
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,197
...report seeing the plane explode.

273
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,033
No other aircraft
were visibly near Flight 180.

274
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,995
At JFK, air traffic controllers
are corroborating...

275
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,830
...these eyewitness accounts.

276
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:28,794
After the explosion, debris apparently rained
into the Atlantic Ocean for several miles.

277
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,548
However, investigators are cautious
about verifying these accounts...

278
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:38,012
...believing they'll learn more
from the found debris when daylight arrives.

279
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,698
Thirty-nine days have passed...

280
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:03,037
...since we lost our 39 loved ones,
friends and teachers.

281
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:07,875
As each day passes without
a determining cause for the accident...

282
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,045
...we ask ourselves, "Why?"

283
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,173
Ecclesiastes tells us:

284
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:20,387
"Man no more knows his own time
than fish taken in the fatal net...

285
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,057
...or birds trapped in the snare.

286
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:29,396
Like these, the children of men caught
when the time falls suddenly upon them."

287
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,608
And so, before we can heal...

288
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:37,237
...before we can escape
the presence of death and time...

289
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:42,534
...we must mourn and celebrate theirs
with this memorial.

290
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,790
I hope you don't think
because my name ain't up on this wall...

291
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,625
...that I owe you anything.

292
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,502
I don't.

293
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,379
Because all I owe are these people.

294
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,131
To live my life to the fullest.

295
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,426
Why don't you stay off
the J.D., then, huh, Carter?

296
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,512
Listen. Don't you ever fucking tell me
what to do, all right?

297
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,972
I control my life, not you.

298
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,640
Carter.

299
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,019
I'm never gonna die.

300
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,863
Hey, Alex.

301
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,990
-Hey.
-Hey.

302
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,118
I took my driver's test last week
at the DMV.

303
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,163
Got a 70. It's the lowest score you can get,
but I passed.

304
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,331
When I was done with the test....

305
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,459
You know the guy that drives with you?

306
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,918
-Right.
-Yeah, well, anyways.

307
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,590
He goes, "Young man, you're gonna die
at a very young age."

308
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,759
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,094
Is that true?

310
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,264
Not now, not here, not ever, Billy.

311
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,395
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

312
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,147
Fuck.

313
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,356
-Okay.
-Yeah.

314
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,983
Yeah.

315
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,159
-Miss Lewton--
-Don't talk to me.

316
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,286
You scare the hell out of me.

317
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,414
I'm gonna go up.

318
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,799
Hey.

319
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,051
Hey.

320
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,387
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

321
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,599
But I miss you, you know?

322
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,059
Yeah.

323
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,394
Yeah, I miss you too.

324
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,314
But my father, you know,
he doesn't understand.

325
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,857
Yeah.

326
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,820
Hey, look, when he gets over this thing...

327
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,073
...you and me,
little road trip to the city, you know?

328
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,908
Catch the Yanks.

329
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,161
Yeah. Yeah, all right, we'll do that.

330
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,746
Cool.

331
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,000
-Look, I'd better go.
-Yeah.

332
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,796
This thing Miss Lewton showed me in class,
they're gonna let me read it.

333
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,049
It says what I'm feeling.

334
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,427
Take care, man.

335
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,606
Because of you, I'm still alive.

336
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,110
Thank you.

337
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,204
"We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast.

338
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:21,086
But when we say this,
we imagine that the hour is placed...

339
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,798
...in an obscure and distant future.

340
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,302
It never occurs to us
that it has any connection...

341
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,971
...with the day already begun.

342
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,933
Or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

343
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,271
This afternoon, which is so certain...

344
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:44,484
...and which has every hour
filled in advance."

345
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,872
What happened?

346
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,041
Where's Tod?

347
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,128
Alex.

348
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,006
Get out of here.

349
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,148
-Didn't you see it?
-What happened?

350
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:03,530
You caused Tod so much guilt over George
staying on the plane, he took his own life.

351
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,949
-No.
-Time to go.

352
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,954
Look, he wouldn't do that.

353
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,040
Okay? He said to me we'd be friends again
after you got better.

354
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,128
Why would he make plans with me
if he was thinking about killing himself?

355
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,629
Mr. Waggner.

356
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,383
-Mr. Waggner.
-Here we go.

357
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,218
Easy.

358
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,595
All right.

359
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,098
Here we go.

360
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,657
Let's go.

361
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,772
Almost autumn.

362
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,649
It's only the end of June.

363
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,196
Yeah, but everything`s
always in transition.

364
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,114
If you focus, one week into summer...

365
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,784
...you can feel almost feel
autumn coming.

366
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,286
Kind of like being able to see the future.

367
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,748
Why were you at Tod's house last night?

368
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,130
I've seen enough TV to know that
the FBI doesn't investigate teen suicides.

369
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,800
They were there last night.
They don't have a clue...

370
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,343
...what caused the crash.

371
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,969
They haven't ruled out anything.

372
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,431
The fact that seven people
got off the plane is probably weird enough.

373
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,185
Not to mention that one of those people
had a vision, or whatever...

374
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,481
...of the plane exploding minutes
before it did explode, is highly suspicious.

375
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,151
And it doesn't help that the visionary's
friend just committed suicide.

376
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,613
Why were you there last night?

377
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,955
Do you know what this is?

378
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,626
This is a....

379
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,297
Who's the spring-head guy?

380
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,842
It's you.

381
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,469
Not a likeness.

382
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,141
It's how you make me feel, Alex.

383
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,017
I'm sorry.

384
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,231
You know, like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know what, or why, it is.

385
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,567
It's reluctant to take form.

386
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:51,322
And yet, creating an absolute
but incomprehensible attraction.

387
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,786
In four years of high school,
we haven't said one word to each other.

388
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,415
At that moment on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

389
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,709
I didn't know
where those emotions were from...

390
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,128
...until you started freaking out.

391
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,049
I didn't see what you saw, but I felt it.

392
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,886
You can still feel it, can't you?

393
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,848
Something from that day is still with you.

394
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,603
I know because I can still feel you.

395
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,399
That's why I was there last night.

396
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,362
You know,
I've never dealt with death before.

397
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,866
This could all be in our head.

398
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,952
It just feels like it's all around us.

399
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,246
It?

400
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,376
What if Tod was just the first?

401
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,420
Of us?

402
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,756
Is that something that you're feeling?

403
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,427
I don't know, you know.
I just wish I could see him again.

404
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,346
One last time.

405
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,932
So maybe I would know.

406
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,892
Then let's go see him.

407
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,466
Easy.

408
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,054
Gives me a rush.

409
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,516
This place?

410
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,727
Doing something I'm not supposed to.

411
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,107
Come on.

412
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,280
Hurry up.

413
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,463
-Is that him?
-I think.

414
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,008
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

415
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,719
Yeah, that's him.

416
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,848
But whatever it was that made him Tod
is definitely gone.

417
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,977
Christ.

418
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,813
Shh.

419
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,732
Please.

420
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,526
You'll wake the dead.

421
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,455
Why did his hand do that?

422
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:51,294
Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasms.

423
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,755
Look, um....

424
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,633
-I'm his friend and--
-I know who you are.

425
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,094
What are all those tiny marks?

426
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,890
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

427
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,017
Pulling at the wire?

428
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,103
If he was pulling at the wire,
he wasn't trying to kill himself.

429
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:13,274
-It was an accident.
-In death, there are no accidents.

430
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,402
No coincidences. No mishaps.

431
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,905
And no escapes.

432
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:25,995
What you have to realize is that we're all
just a mouse that a cat has by the tail.

433
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:30,917
Every single move we make,
from the mundane to the monumental...

434
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,003
...the red light that we stop at or run...

435
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,756
...the people we have sex with,
or won't with us...

436
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,218
...the airplanes that we ride,
or walk out of...

437
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:45,264
...it's all part of death's sadistic design
leading to the grave.

438
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,476
Design?

439
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:54,023
Does that mean if you figure out
the design, you could cheat death?

440
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,526
Alex.

441
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,904
You've already done that
by walking off the plane.

442
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,281
Your friend's departure shows...

443
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:06,619
...that death has a new design
for all of you.

444
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:13,042
Now, you have to figure out how
and when it's coming back at you.

445
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,753
Play your hunch, Alex.

446
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,132
If you think you can get away with it.

447
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:24,303
But remember the risk
of cheating the plan...

448
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:28,766
...of disrespecting the design
could incite a fury...

449
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,811
...that could terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

450
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,442
And you don't even wanna fuck
with that Mack Daddy.

451
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,698
Okay, then, well....

452
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,118
Yeah, I'm sorry we broke in and....

453
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,954
No harm. No foul.

454
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,501
I'll see you soon.

455
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,844
The mortician said
that death has a design.

456
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,637
Okay.

457
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,390
I'm talking about omens.

458
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,686
How do we know that just by sitting here,
by sipping this coffee...

459
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,439
...or breathing the air
or crossing the intersection...

460
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,235
...that we haven't started in motion
the events that will lead to our death...

461
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,696
...40 years from now,
10 years from now, tomorrow?

462
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,451
We don't unless we open ourselves up...

463
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,121
...to the signs it's willing to show us.

464
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,501
I don't understand.

465
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,462
Did you see Tod die?

466
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,465
Did it happen again, like on the plane?

467
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,052
No, no, it didn't, but I mean,
it might as well have.

468
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,597
This is a message of something, Clear.

469
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,017
Or someone, hinting at a design.

470
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:57,522
Total bullshit. I mean, you can find
death omens anywhere you want to.

471
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,024
Coffee.
Starts with a C and ends with an E.

472
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,361
So does the word choke.
So, what, we're gonna choke to death?

473
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,779
I wanna hear you.

474
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,366
We'll go nuts if you start with this shit.

475
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,703
The mortician said
that death has a design, right?

476
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:18,417
Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter,
Terry, Billy, Miss Lewton...

477
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,628
...messed up that design
for whatever reason?

478
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,966
I saw death's plan, then we cheated it.

479
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,467
But what if it was our time?

480
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,053
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

481
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,557
What if it still is our time?

482
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:36,185
If it is, then it's not finished.

483
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,565
And we will die now, not later.

484
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,441
Unless....

485
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,945
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

486
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,999
After hearing you, I do believe...

487
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,377
...that Tod killed himself.

488
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,909
Yeah, I'm fine. Whatever.

489
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,662
-You all right, man?
-Hey, baby, come on, not now.

490
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,998
-Carter.
-Oh.

491
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,250
It looks like
we have a bit of a reunion here.

492
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,502
-Let it go.
-When are you moving?

493
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,795
A couple weeks.

494
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,255
-That's too bad.
-You dick.

495
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,674
-We're losing our favorite teacher.
-Baby, come on.

496
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,344
Look, guys.
There's something I need to tell you, okay?

497
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,013
-Alex.
-And you lived here your whole life? Yeah.

498
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,682
And now she's gotta move
all because of Browning.

499
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,852
Enough, both of you.

500
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,979
They died and we lived.

501
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,523
Get over it.

502
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,444
I will not let this plane crash
be the most important thing in my life.

503
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,490
I'm moving on, Carter.

504
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,867
And if you wanna waste your life...

505
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,371
...beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

506
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,499
...then you can just drop fucking dead.

507
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,219
Okay.
You look like a smart shopper.

508
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,553
Well, thank you.

509
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,598
Let's just say you were to see
this knife set in a department store.

510
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,183
What do you think you'd have
to pay?

511
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,144
Wow, that's a huge knife set,
but how many--?

512
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,945
-Hello?
-Is Alex there?

513
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,155
Oh, hi, Clear. Yeah, just a minute.

514
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,909
It's Clear again. You wanna talk to her?

515
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:01,080
 --the economy kept trading
volume below average today, and stocks--

516
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,833
Clear, he's in the shower.

517
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,962
-Can I get him to call you back?
-Sure, bye.

518
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,756
She's concerned about you.

519
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,675
I'm concerned about you.

520
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,468
Why won't you talk to her?

521
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,679
Or me?

522
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,724
--which could put a cloud
over both stocks and bonds.

523
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,435
Dad, you and Mom
have both been a big help.

524
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:27,356
But there's something I need to understand
before I can talk to anyone.

525
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,859
--the Dow down 75.

526
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,154
The National Transportation Safety Board
has a new theory tonight...

527
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,824
...on the possible cause of the explosion
of Volee Air Flight 180.

528
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,952
Officials believe
deterioration of silicon insulation...

529
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,621
...on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...

530
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,540
...may have leaked combustible fluids.

531
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,126
-A spark in the fuel switch...
-That's Tod's seat.

532
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,213
...in the fuselage may have ignited the
fuel line and proceeded to the fuel pump...

533
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,717
...which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.

534
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,166
The path of the explosion.

535
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,962
Okay, the first was Tod.
Then it was Terry.

536
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,632
They're dying in the order
they would have died.

537
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,926
That's death's design.

538
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,970
Miss Lewton's next.

539
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,974
And whenever I can fall asleep, I just....

540
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,434
I see Terry Chaney.

541
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,229
And in the day, out of nowhere...

542
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,856
...I hear the sound of my own voice
in my head...

543
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,191
...saying to Larry Murnau:

544
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,986
"No, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane."

545
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,781
Everything reminds me of that day.

546
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,910
Right, yeah.

547
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,495
I'm hoping a change will help.

548
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:10,376
It's just that I've lived here
my whole life, you know?

549
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,337
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

550
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,048
And now all I see is Larry...

551
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,427
...and those kids, you know?

552
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:24,849
Just looking out my own front yard
makes me feel nothing but fear.

553
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,066
Laura, I'm gonna have to call you back.

554
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,734
Right.

555
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,204
Hi, this is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.

556
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,733
What are you doing here?

557
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,110
I was just....

558
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,572
I was checking the air in the tire
to make sure it's safe.

559
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,115
Get in the car.

560
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,837
Put on your seat belt.

561
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:05,199
I believe that Miss Lewton is next.

562
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,284
-Next?
-Yes.

563
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:14,333
Yeah, next, because there's this pattern
that's occurring.

564
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,795
Oh, right, a pattern, yeah.
You noticed that too, huh?

565
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,355
Mom's favorite.

566
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,546
So, what about this pattern, Alex?

567
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,840
Did you see it
in another one of your visions?

568
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,217
Did you catch it in some TV static?

569
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,098
You know, I never asked
for what happened on the plane.

570
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,853
You guys are gonna sit on your little chairs
and make fun of me. Whatever, it's fine.

571
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,772
But I saved six lives on that plane.

572
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,651
Six lives, and everybody in my entire school
thinks I'm a freak.

573
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,739
And I'm not-- I'm not suffering
from posttraumatic stress.

574
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,200
I don't have a narcissistic deity complex.

575
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,454
I'm not going Dahmer on you guys.

576
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,788
This just is.

577
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,250
There is a pattern for us all.

578
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,128
There's a pattern for you,
there is a pattern for you.

579
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,714
There's a design for everyone.
I don't know how yet.

580
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,966
But I'm gonna break this one.

581
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,132
Alex, you came to our attention at first...

582
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,343
...because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

583
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:15,639
Now, I know
you didn't blow up the plane.

584
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:21,061
And we were ready to move on,
but then the other survivors started to die.

585
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,980
First, your friend Tod.

586
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,566
Then Terry Chaney,
while you were there at the scene.

587
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,444
And now tonight we pick you
up at Val Lewton's house.

588
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,821
Alex, nobody has control
over life and death.

589
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,366
Unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

590
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,327
Now, can you promise me
that no one else is going to die?

591
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,872
No, I can't.

592
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,000
As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control, I'm sorry.

593
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:53,135
Okay, go ahead. Get out of here.

594
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,971
Thank you.

595
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,148
That kid gives me the creeps.

596
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,567
What are we gonna do?
We got nothing to hold him.

597
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,360
That's not what I'm talking about.

598
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,280
There were a couple of moments there...

599
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,283
...where I almost believed him.

600
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,329
Can I tell you something?
Don't take this the wrong way.

601
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,706
But sometimes, you give me the creeps.

602
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,559
You've gotta stop this.
Stop this, it's a stupid mug.

603
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,938
You're out of here.
Pretty soon, you'll be gone.

604
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,814
You'll be gone.

605
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,239
Miss Lewton.

606
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,500
Miss Lewton.

607
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,420
Okay, all right, okay.

608
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,589
Just stay still, okay?

609
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,516
Oh, God. Oh, God. Miss Lewton.

610
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,741
Hey, Alex.

611
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,972
Dude.

612
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,226
I don't know where he is.

613
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,271
-He's not talking to me.
-Why?

614
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,440
Because I didn't believe him.

615
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,816
If he does contact you...

616
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,486
...I think it would be in the best
interest of your safety if you called us.

617
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,406
Now, here's my card.

618
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,074
Toll-free number.

619
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,747
Interesting work.

620
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,426
Carter, you dick.

621
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,278
What are you doing?

622
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,783
Terry's name should be on this wall.

623
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,704
Shit.

624
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,874
Why'd you want us
to meet you here anyway, huh?

625
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,544
Because they're watching me,
see if I go to Alex.

626
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,630
That's why you're taking me.

627
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,089
Why would I wanna see him?

628
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,968
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

629
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,735
So drive the speed limit, okay?

630
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,988
Oh, and don't pass on the right.

631
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,407
Billy, wait a minute here.
I'm getting a vision.

632
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,786
You're the next one, man.

633
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,704
Hey, man, why'd you say that?

634
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:58,333
Because if you say another word,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

635
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,439
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down.

636
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,317
So you guys drive down there,
we'll meet around the middle.

637
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,444
It'll take half the time.

638
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,727
Do you think they're still up there?

639
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:04,316
Somehow, Flight 180,
are they still in flight?

640
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,569
Somewhere, are they safe?

641
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,701
When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...

642
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,495
...I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

643
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,457
Lying awake at night just worrying.

644
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,918
Yeah, well, most kids do, I guess.

645
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,795
Most kids never have it happen.

646
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:34,512
When I was 10,
my dad went into a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.

647
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,182
I guess that he heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

648
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,685
So on reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

649
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,647
And the guy blew his head off.

650
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,192
Life became shit after that.

651
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,904
My mom just couldn't deal anymore.

652
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,281
She married this asshole...

653
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:57,702
...who my mom with my real dad would
have crossed the street to avoid this guy.

654
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,873
He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.

655
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,963
If that was the design
for my father and my family...

656
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,298
...then fuck death.

657
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:15,637
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere, Alex.

658
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,474
It exists, that place.
Where my dad is still safe.

659
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:23,812
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes
that night and just kept driving.

660
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,731
Where me and my mom
and my dad are still together...

661
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,901
...and have no idea about this life here.

662
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,656
Where our friends are still in the sky.

663
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,827
Where everyone gets a second chance.

664
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,872
Alex, we can't give up.

665
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,545
Look, I can't go home.

666
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,756
All right? After Miss Lewton,
they're gonna be looking for me.

667
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,758
No, we're taking you to my dad's cabin.

668
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,593
It's only a couple miles from my house.

669
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,763
All right, Browning, you fucking warlock.

670
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:03,143
-Did you know about Miss Lewton, or what?
-Why do you think I was hiding?

671
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,312
Billy told the FBI
he saw you running from her house.

672
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,189
I was running because they blame me.

673
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,484
They blame me for Tod,
they blame me for her, for the plane crash.

674
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:15,989
The fire, like, caramelized her blood, Alex.
Your shoe prints were in it.

675
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,242
-Your fingerprints were on the knives.
-I told you they were not--

676
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,997
I'm not talking about whether or not you
did it. Or even if you knew she was dead.

677
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,208
Did you know she was gonna be next
before she was?

678
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,258
Yeah, I did.

679
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:39,596
-I knew.
-All right.

680
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:43,558
Out of us, who's next to see it?

681
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:47,645
Please, tell me I'm gonna get to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

682
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,107
It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.

683
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,529
I knew I should have felt up Tammy
in the pool that time.

684
01:07:56,697 --> 01:08:01,493
-What are you whining about? I'm next.
-He didn't say anything. Just drive.

685
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,454
You have a responsibility to tell me.

686
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:07,165
Do you think it's gonna make it
easier to know, Carter?

687
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,503
Huh? It's not,
it's gonna make it fucking harder.

688
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,672
You know, you get off
having control over me.

689
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,052
-You let me decide how to deal with it.
-It doesn't matter who's next.

690
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,846
Because we're all
on the same list. All of us.

691
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,018
Oh, fuck. Really?

692
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,861
All right, then why bother?
What's the fucking point, right?

693
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:40,698
Me and Terry, we'll be back together
on the other side, so why wait any longer?

694
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,785
Carter, what are you doing?

695
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,747
Carter, slow down.

696
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,041
-Slow down, Carter!
-Fuck you.

697
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,547
-Knock it off.
-May as well go out on my own free will.

698
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,215
Not with us in the fucking car.

699
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,890
-Jesus, Carter, no.
-Stop it.

700
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,351
Carter, stop the car.

701
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,562
Hey, what's the worry
if it ain't your time?

702
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,398
I could get nailed
and you all wouldn't give a shit, right?

703
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,526
-It's only me.
-It doesn't work that way, Carter.

704
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,245
And I fucking hated French class.

705
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,582
-Control yourself.
-That's what I'm doing.

706
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,418
I know what you're doing.
And it's all right to be scared.

707
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,171
I'm not afraid, all right?
I decide when it's time.

708
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,090
I control my life, I control my death.

709
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,843
You don't have to prove to us
how big your balls are. Not now.

710
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,600
-Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.
-What are you doing?

711
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,355
Fuck it, Carter, Jesus Christ.
Carter, put your hands back on the wheel.

712
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,608
Carter, stop.
Hands on the wheel, Carter.

713
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,777
Oh, shit.

714
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,573
Okay, Carter, easy.

715
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,534
I am so close to puking
right now, you don't even wanna know.

716
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,915
We're afraid too, Carter,
but we're not going to quit.

717
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:15,168
Stop what you're doing
and stop this fucking car.

718
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:19,297
Damn it, Carter.
I want you to stop this car right now.

719
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,816
-Billy.
-Move it.

720
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,778
-Hey, open the door, Billy.
-Move the fucking car!

721
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,822
-Hey, open the fucking door.
-Move the car.

722
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,032
Open it.

723
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,159
Open the door.
Easy, easy, open the door.

724
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,662
Open the door.
Billy, open the fucking door!

725
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,664
Billy, open it!
Open the door!

726
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:53,915
Open the door!

727
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,672
Carter, listen to me. Don't do this.

728
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,721
Goddamn it! Get out of the fucking car.

729
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:11,474
Carter, listen to me. Hey, listen to me.

730
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,684
This isn't the way.

731
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,644
It's not the way. Get out of the car.

732
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,604
-Come on!
-It's coming, it's coming!

733
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,152
-Carter.
-It ain't my time.

734
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,540
Oh, shit.

735
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,002
Carter, listen to me. This isn't the way.
Get out of the car, Carter.

736
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,713
Carter, get out of the car.

737
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,465
Come on, get out!

738
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,224
I can't get out!

739
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,688
Alex! No!

740
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,487
Man, he really is next.

741
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,199
-Get out!
-Get out!

742
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,909
-Come on!
-Fuck!

743
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,639
Oh, God.

744
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,352
I saw it. I saw the belt.

745
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,771
-Scared now?
-It broke.

746
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,732
Bullshit. He saved your life again.

747
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,108
That's right.

748
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,279
You're next, Carter.
I'm staying the fuck away from you.

749
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,782
-Shut up.
-We don't need this shit right now.

750
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,285
I don't need it ever. What are you doing?
Get away from him, he's next.

751
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,120
Hey, fuck you, Billy. I'm not dead.

752
01:12:56,288 --> 01:13:00,458
Oh, you will be.
You're dead, you're dead.

753
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,294
And you ain't taking me with you!

754
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:09,050
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

755
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,561
Jesus fucking Christ!

756
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,941
You should've been next.
You should've been next after Lewton.

757
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,901
That's the plan. That's the design.

758
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,278
-You should be dead.
-You're the fucking devil.

759
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,114
I saw the seat belt. I knew it would rip.

760
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,200
That's how I saved him.
Just like the plane.

761
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,743
Just like the explosion, I saw it.

762
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,912
-The police are coming.
-Fuck, I saved him.

763
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,122
Because I saved him...

764
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:42,834
...it skipped Carter, went to the next
in the path of the explosion, Billy.

765
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,502
I have to see it.

766
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,673
And if I see it, then I intervene.
And if I intervene, I cheat the design.

767
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,300
What, intervene?
What are you, God now?

768
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,469
Gods aren't afraid to die.

769
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,972
Gods don't die. We do.

770
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,015
-You know?
-Baby, you're losing it, okay?

771
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,726
The police will be here.
We have to get you to my cabin.

772
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,854
You can hide,
and get your head together.

773
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:06,899
Okay, after Billy, I'm next. I'm next.

774
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,695
-And then me.
-Hey, hey, hey, listen.

775
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,488
I'm not gonna let it happen, okay?

776
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,949
-Listen to me, all right?
-Hey, hey, hey.

777
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,869
Why don't you two
just get the fuck out of here?

778
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,419
Rusted.

779
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,880
Tetanus.

780
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,841
Nice one.

781
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,136
I overlooked it.

782
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:28,893
You tried to capitalize.
But I caught you, you fuck.

783
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,562
I can beat you.

784
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:37,777
Yeah, I mean, not forever,
but I got this cabin rigged to beat you now!

785
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:33,249
-She was there a minute ago.
-What are you talking about?

786
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,793
I'm not turning him in.

787
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,796
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

788
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:44,427
-I go with you.
-You can't.

789
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,348
Clear, you just tell us where he is.

790
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,142
Wait at home, I give you my word...

791
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:54,478
...that we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

792
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,427
I never moved.

793
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,181
Christa asked me to change seats
but I never moved.

794
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:33,142
I would've been up next to Tod.

795
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,895
Fuck, why didn't I remember that?

796
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,355
I never moved.
Clear's seat was in front of mine.

797
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,540
She's next.

798
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,580
Alex!

799
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,042
Alex!

800
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:43,379
Come on, get in the car.
We're going around. Get in the car.

801
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,588
Come on!

802
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,757
-Go!
-Move!

803
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,829
Oh, shit.

804
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,824
There!
Come on, let's go, over here.

805
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,247
Alex!

806
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,124
Alex, we're trying to help you.

807
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,962
Fritz, get away from it.

808
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:20,768
Come on.

809
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:25,689
Alex!

810
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:52,883
Run!

811
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,472
We lost him.

812
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,267
From the direction,
there's only one place he's heading.

813
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,768
No shit.

814
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,483
Clear!

815
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:28,956
No.

816
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,379
Oh, my God.

817
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:43,470
Don't move. Stay there.

818
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:47,558
Don't move, don't move.
Don't touch anything.

819
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,685
You're grounded by the tires, okay?

820
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,758
The car's gonna explode.

821
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,432
I can only hold on for so long,
you know what to do.

822
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,100
Don't!

823
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,561
When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll be over.

824
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:36,398
-It's the only way we can cheat death again.
-No, don't!

825
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:40,110
Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both.
You know what to do.

826
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:45,073
I'll always be with you.

827
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:49,536
No!

828
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,627
Alex! Alex, get away from there.

829
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,254
No!

830
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,775
Alex. Alex.

831
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:25,614
Damn it, you can't do this to me.

832
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,158
Come on, baby. Come on.

833
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,701
Alex, Alex?

834
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:33,914
Alex, Alex? Oh, shit, he's not breathing.

835
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,833
Hold on, Alex. Come on, stay with me.

836
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:16,665
-Well, we made it.
-Paris, I can't believe it.

837
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,875
I just can't believe
we got on a plane again.

838
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,044
You know what I'm saying?

839
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,323
Wow.

840
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,241
It's weird being here, huh?

841
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,744
We finally completed a puzzle.

842
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,082
It's just there's something missing,
you know?

843
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,170
-To Terry.
-Yeah.

844
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,340
-To Tod.
-To all of our friends that can't be here.

845
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:08,842
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

846
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:12,763
What?

847
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:15,766
If you would have told me
six months ago...

848
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:19,061
...that the three of us
would be sitting here having a drink....

849
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:20,354
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

850
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:23,023
I mean, sometimes it just feels
like the two of you...

851
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,776
...are the only ones
who can really understand.

852
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:33,700
You were right, Browning.
It did skip us. There was a design.

853
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:36,370
We beat it. You know, we won.

854
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,749
I think the only thing we won, Carter,
is a chance at a full life.

855
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:44,669
A chance that I won't ever waste.

856
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:48,131
Yeah, there's just something....

857
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:50,384
You know, something I can't figure out.

858
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,886
-What?
-About the design.

859
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,847
Alex, just let it go. All right?

860
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:58,266
I swear-- Just hear me out, all right?

861
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,020
-Oh, my God.
-It's just-- Listen.

862
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:06,608
Now, the path of the explosion
determined the order of our deaths, right?

863
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,777
When I intervened and saved Carter...

864
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:12,447
...it skipped him and went to the
next person in the path. It went to Billy.

865
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:14,241
All right, and then it was Clear.

866
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,412
But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me, but in my case...

867
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,081
...no one intervened, right?

868
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,209
I was thrown from that power line
by the explosion.

869
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,129
-So--
-So why did it skip you, right?

870
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,590
How do we know that this isn't exactly
what was meant to happen?

871
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:34,594
That out of everyone on Flight 180,
you, me and Carter were meant to live.

872
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,140
Maybe that was the design all along.

873
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,685
-Or you could still be next.
-Shut up, Carter.

874
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,229
What? I didn't make up the rules.

875
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,898
Somebody's gotta intervene
before death can skip them.

876
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:50,318
Alex proved that three times.
In the plane, with me, you.

877
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:53,655
For all I know, it could circle back
and get us all again.

878
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:59,369
But I am the safest fucker in the world
because you're still next.

879
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,126
Can we just stop talking about this?

880
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,545
Let's figure out
what we're gonna do tomorrow.

881
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,396
I'm gonna meet you back at the hotel.

882
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,566
-Just wait, I'll go with you.
-No, just stay here.

883
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,359
Okay, Clear? Just stay here.

884
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:32,611
All right?

885
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:35,572
See, it's true.
I told you you were next, man.

886
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,781
Stop it, Carter.

887
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:39,409
-Alex, wait.
-No, Clear, stay there.

888
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,412
Okay? Stay away.

889
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,462
Alex!

890
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:10,774
Alex!

891
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,071
I told you, you were next.

892
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:19,449
-Then it just skipped me.
-So who's next?
