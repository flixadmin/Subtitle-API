1
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,260
You could've killed me.

2
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,524
Were you doing back there?

3
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,316
Ending the war. Killing her.

4
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,740
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

5
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,993
And?

6
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,798
Listen to me.
Till I get what I want,

7
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,721
a dragon doesn't get to kill you.
You don't get to kill you.

8
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,923
Only I get to kill you.

9
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,812
That was only one of them.

10
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,980
She has two more.

11
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,814
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

12
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,145
You're

13
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,320
Don't you mean we're

14
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,898
No, I do not.

15
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,863
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

16
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,743
I'm not gonna be around

17
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,113
when those things
start spitting fire on King's Landing.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,457
I have to tell Cersei.

19
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,372
May as well jump back in that river.

20
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Episode 5 - Eastwatch.

21
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,038
I know what Cersei has told you.

22
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,160
That I've come to destroy your cities,

23
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,214
burn down your homes,
murder you and orphan your children.

24
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,969
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

25
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,299
I'm not here to murder,

26
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:14,183
and all I want to destroy is the wheel
that has rolled over rich and poor,

27
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,390
to the benefit of no one but
the Cersei Lannisters of the world.

28
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,603
I offer you a choice.

29
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,939
Bend the knee and join me.

30
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,068
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

31
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:32,246
Or refuse, and die.

32
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,147
Step forward, my lord.

33
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,121
You will not kneel?

34
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,748
I already have a queen.

35
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,288
My sister.

36
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,999
She wasn't your queen
until recently, though, was she?

37
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,965
When she murdered your rightful queen,

38
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,918
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

39
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,971
So, it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

40
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,014
There are no easy choices in war.

41
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,853
Say what you will about your sister,
she was born in Westeros.

42
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,106
She's lived here all her life.

43
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,605
You, on the other hand,

44
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,692
murdered your own father,

45
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,951
and chose to support
a foreign invader,

46
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,282
one with no ties to this land,

47
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,616
an army of savages at her back.

48
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,430
You will not trade
your honour for your life.

49
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,714
I respect that.

50
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,630
Perhaps he could take the black,
Your Grace.

51
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,091
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

52
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,343
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

53
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,178
You cannot send me to the Wall.

54
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,894
You are not my queen.

55
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,694
You will have to kill me, too.

56
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,486
Step back and shut your mouth.

57
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,622
Who are you?

58
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,744
A stupid boy.

59
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,329
I am Dickon Tarly,
son of Randyll Tarly.

60
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,630
You are the future of your house.

61
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,668
This war has already wiped
one great house from the world.

62
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,919
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

63
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,978
I will not.

64
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,271
Your Grace,

65
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,153
nothing scrubs bold notions
from a man's head

66
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,519
like a few weeks in a dark cell.

67
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,939
I meant what I said.

68
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,575
I'm not here to put men in chains.

69
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,286
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

70
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,658
I gave them a choice.

71
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,369
They made it.

72
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,456
Your Grace, if you start beheading
entire families...

73
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,287
I'm not beheading anyone.

74
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,545
Your Grace.

75
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,452
Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

76
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,079
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
first of my name,

77
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,037
Breaker of Chains
and Mother of Dragons,

78
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,042
sentence you to die.

79
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,884
Dracarys.

80
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,350
My... My lord...

81
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,937
How many men did we lose?

82
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,359
We haven't done a full accounting.

83
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,616
It's not only armies that win wars.

84
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,241
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank behind us,

85
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,826
we can buy mercenaries.

86
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,038
Not the same as our men,

87
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,715
but they'll fight if
they're well paid, which they will be.

88
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,134
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

89
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,048
They'll beat any mercenary army.
They'll beat any army I've ever seen.

90
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,759
Killing our men wasn't war for them,
it was sport.

91
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,220
Her dragon burned 1,000 wagons.

92
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,430
Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts
bigger than you,

93
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,686
they couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

94
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,564
This isn't a war we can win.

95
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,521
So, what do we do?

96
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,907
Sue for peace?

97
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,154
I sit on her father's throne,
the father you betrayed and murdered.

98
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,031
And in her mind, she's winning.

99
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,208
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

100
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,752
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf,

101
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,626
by way of apology
for murdering our father and son.

102
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,678
He didn't.

103
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,722
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

104
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,674
I'm not talking about Father.

105
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,473
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

106
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,896
After all this time,

107
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,564
- it still amazes me...
- It was Olenna.

108
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,769
She confessed before she died.

109
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,740
And this was before or after she drank
the poison you so kindly provided her?

110
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,366
After.

111
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,992
And you believed her.

112
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,910
If you were Olenna,

113
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,761
would you rather have seen
your granddaughter

114
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,456
married to Joffrey or Tommen?

115
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,319
Which one would Margaery
have been better able to control?

116
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,836
Which one would have made Olenna
the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

117
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,008
She was telling the truth.

118
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,556
I shouldn't have listened to you.

119
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,731
She should have died screaming.

120
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,608
She's dead, like her son,
her grandchildren, her whole house.

121
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,320
And if we don't find
a way out of this war,

122
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,445
we'll follow them.

123
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,656
So, we fight and die
or we submit and die.

124
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,746
I know my choice.

125
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,452
A soldier should know his.

126
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,369
They're beautiful, aren't they?

127
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,460
Wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

128
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,672
But, yes, they are.

129
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,086
Gorgeous beasts.

130
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,804
They're not beasts to me.

131
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,055
No matter how big they get,
or how terrifying to everyone else,

132
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,477
they're my children.

133
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,601
You weren't gone long.

134
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,728
No.

135
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,529
And?

136
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,695
And I have fewer enemies today
than I did yesterday.

137
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,390
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

138
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,118
No, I'm not.

139
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,703
How many men did your army kill taking
Winterfell back from the Boltons?

140
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,921
Thousands.

141
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,465
We both want to help people.

142
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,760
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

143
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,089
Sometimes strength is terrible.

144
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,680
When you first came here,

145
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,630
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

146
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,270
Ser Davos gets carried away.

147
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,610
So, it was a figure of speech.

148
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,407
This man says
he is your friend, Khaleesi.

149
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,373
He is my friend.

150
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,090
Your Grace.

151
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,264
Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,
an old friend.

152
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,266
I served with your father.

153
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,439
He was a great man.

154
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,726
You look strong.

155
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,821
You found a cure?

156
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,773
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

157
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,652
I return to your service, my queen.

158
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,029
If you'll have me.

159
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,326
It would be my honour.

160
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,892
Ravens. We need to send ravens.

161
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,727
I put very little stock in it myself.

162
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,854
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

163
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,151
especially when winter comes.

164
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,983
I remember Wolkan.

165
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,733
A little timid but a sharp mind.

166
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,493
The North has dulled
many a good Maester's wits.

167
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,323
Hard to say whether it's the cold,
the drink, or the company.

168
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,993
A crippled boy claims
to have seen dead men

169
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,622
on the march Beyond the Wall,

170
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,797
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

171
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,502
Yes, it is a bit much.

172
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,134
- Still, we ought to write back for...
- Brandon Stark.

173
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,223
The crippled boy.

174
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,887
Do you know him?

175
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:10,147
I led him through the Wall years ago.
I saw him go Beyond the Wall.

176
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,850
And?

177
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,187
Somehow, a crippled boy survived
for years Beyond the Wall

178
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,522
when no one else could.

179
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,529
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

180
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,408
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

181
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,491
Perhaps you need more scribing work
to discipline your mind.

182
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,998
I sense a more detailed proposal
is forthcoming?

183
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,299
Everyone in Westeros trusts
and respects you.

184
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,557
If you tell people the threat is real,
they'll believe it.

185
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,035
If you advise all the lords to send
their men north to hold the Wall,

186
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,068
they'll do it.

187
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,354
And if you tell every maester
in the Citadel

188
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,945
to search every word of every
faded scroll about the Long Night,

189
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,361
they may find something that lets us
defeat the Army of the Dead for good.

190
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,618
It could be done.

191
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,215
And this news could be authentic.
It's possible.

192
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,798
It's also possible that this message
is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen

193
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,177
to lure southern armies away

194
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,988
from the lands
they are currently defending,

195
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,726
to open those lands to easy conquest.

196
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,272
That does seem far more likely
than magic birds talking to cripples.

197
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,689
Archmaester, please.

198
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,318
It's real.

199
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,146
I've seen it.

200
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,278
We will write to Maester Wolkan
at Winterfell for clarification.

201
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,697
I promise you, we will get
to the truth of it one way or another.

202
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,791
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

203
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,211
It brings to mind
the work of Jenny of Oldstones,

204
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,540
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the Children of the Forest.

205
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,465
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,
who promised

206
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,136
that the Drowned God would rise up
and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

207
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,633
Oh, Lodos.

208
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,975
Is he the one whose father and brother
were just burned alive?

209
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,934
I'm afraid so.

210
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,270
A horrible business.

211
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,397
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

212
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,649
He's a good lad.

213
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,860
Right.

214
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,533
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

215
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,242
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

216
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,577
That's why they're rulers.

217
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,547
She gave Tarly a choice.

218
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,464
A man who had taken up
arms against her.

219
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,295
What else could she do?

220
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,423
Not burn him alive alongside his son?

221
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,765
I am her Hand, not her head.
I can't make her decisions for her.

222
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,722
That's what I used to tell myself
about her father.

223
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,109
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

224
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,487
I was only a purveyor of information.

225
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,326
It's what I told myself
when I watched them beg for mercy.

226
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,490
"I'm not the one doing it."

227
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,710
And the pitch of their screams
rose higher.

228
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,332
"I'm not the one doing it."

229
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,417
When their hair caught fire,

230
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,171
and the smell of their burning flesh
filled the Throne Room,

231
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,968
"I'm not the one doing it."

232
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,646
Daenerys is not her father.

233
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,563
And she never will be.

234
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,312
With the right counsel.

235
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,940
You need to find
a way to make her listen.

236
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,113
Who's that for?

237
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,121
Jon Snow.

238
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,197
Did you read it?

239
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,162
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

240
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,924
What's it say?

241
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,301
Nothing good.

242
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,760
I thought Arya was dead.

243
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,346
I thought Bran was dead.

244
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,024
I'm happy for you.

245
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,690
You don't look happy.

246
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,573
Bran saw the Night King and his army
marching towards Eastwatch.

247
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,694
If they make it past the Wall...

248
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,371
The Wall has kept them out
for thousands of years, presumably.

249
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,824
I need to go home.

250
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,662
You said you don't have enough men.

251
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,540
We'll fight with the men we have.

252
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,830
Unless you'll join us?

253
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,211
And give the country to Cersei?

254
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,543
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

255
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,970
Perhaps not.

256
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,804
Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead
is nothing but a story

257
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,261
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

258
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,725
What if we prove her wrong?

259
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,229
I don't think she'll come see the dead
at my invitation.

260
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,486
So, bring the dead to her.

261
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,870
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

262
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,554
We don't have to bring the whole army.

263
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,569
Only one soldier.

264
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,745
Is that possible?

265
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,793
The first wight I ever saw

266
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,879
was brought into Castle Black
from Beyond the Wall.

267
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,631
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing,

268
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,128
and show her the truth.

269
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,211
Anything you bring back
will be useless

270
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,012
unless Cersei grants us an audience

271
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,512
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

272
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,059
the moment we set foot in the capital.

273
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,353
The only person she listens to
is Jaime.

274
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,724
He might listen to me.

275
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,150
And how would you
get into King's Landing?

276
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,740
I can smuggle you in.

277
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,615
But if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

278
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,245
I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.

279
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,205
Well, it'll all be for nothing if
we don't have one of these dead men.

280
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,790
Fair point.
How do you propose to find one?

281
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,134
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

282
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,760
You asked me to find a cure
so I could serve you.

283
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,970
Allow me to serve you.

284
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,563
The Free Folk will help us.

285
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,233
They know the real north
better than anyone.

286
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,904
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

287
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,107
They won't have to.

288
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,664
You can't lead
a raid Beyond the Wall.

289
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,104
You're not in
the Night's Watch anymore,

290
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,244
you're King in the North.

291
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,897
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

292
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,999
I'm the only one here who knows them.

293
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,464
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

294
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,757
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

295
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,892
I am a king.

296
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,723
And I came here knowing that
you could have your men behead me

297
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,523
or your dragons burn me alive.

298
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,568
I put my trust in you, a stranger,

299
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,400
because I knew it was
the best chance for my people,

300
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,406
for all our people.

301
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,329
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger,

302
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,461
'cause it's our best chance.

303
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:53,356
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

304
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,941
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

305
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,117
But perhaps we should have.

306
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,368
The Knights of the Vale
came here for you, Lady Stark.

307
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,377
You are very kind, my lords.

308
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,431
But Jon is our king.
He is doing what he thinks is best.

309
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,689
I warned Jon this would happen.

310
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,812
That he couldn't leave the North

311
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,444
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

312
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,526
He didn't,
he trusted you to hold it for him.

313
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,574
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern Lords are proud.

314
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,331
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

315
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:53,999
And?

316
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,633
Nothing.

317
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,175
Don't do that.

318
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,555
What?

319
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,096
Say what you mean.

320
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,221
You always liked nice things.

321
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,055
Made you feel better than everyone.

322
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,311
Are you angry with me?

323
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,365
They were insulting Jon,
and you sat there and listened.

324
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,067
I listened to their complaints,

325
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,949
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

326
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,951
Their opinions are important to you.

327
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,917
Glover has 500 men
and Royce has 2,000.

328
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,370
Offend them and Jon loses his army.

329
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,546
Not if they lose their heads first.

330
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,088
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

331
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,888
We took it back.

332
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,642
And the Mormonts, and the Hornwoods,
and the wildlings, and the Vale.

333
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,060
All of us, working together.

334
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:55,390
Now, I'm sure cutting off heads
is very satisfying,

335
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:59,023
but that's not the way
you get people to work together.

336
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,658
And if Jon doesn't come back,
you'll need their support.

337
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,037
So you can work together
to give you what you really want.

338
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,074
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

339
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,628
You're thinking it right now.

340
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,458
You don't want to be.

341
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,003
But the thought just won't go away.

342
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,594
I have work to do.

343
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,024
My lady.

344
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,031
Last time I was here,
I killed my father with a crossbow.

345
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,075
Last time I was here,
you killed my son with wildfire.

346
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,790
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

347
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,756
The guards hardly ever patrol it.
Too many steps.

348
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,179
You're not staying here?

349
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,306
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

350
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,475
What if someone takes the boat?

351
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,933
Then we're Best hurry.

352
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,114
We don't have time for this.

353
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,941
We should be preparing the city
for a siege.

354
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,117
The Dothraki are coming.

355
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,910
All the more reason
for you to train.

356
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,205
Unless you plan
on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.

357
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,728
Well, I seem to recall them
giving you a bit of trouble as well.

358
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,493
And here I am, ready to train.

359
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,873
Why down here?

360
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,420
I don't think you want people to see
how you look swinging that thing yet.

361
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,927
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

362
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,763
Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.

363
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,686
I'll leave you to it.

364
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,770
I needed to see you.

365
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,069
And I knew you'd never agree to meet.

366
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,824
You made me look like a complete fool.

367
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,747
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock.

368
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,917
But you were three steps ahead of me.

369
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,371
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

370
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,708
Father would have been proud.

371
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,527
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

372
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,962
I once told Bronn

373
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,011
that if I ever saw you again,
I'd cut you in half.

374
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,392
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

375
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,437
He was going to execute me.

376
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,155
He knew I was innocent.

377
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,609
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did.

378
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,989
He hated me because of what I am.

379
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,037
A little monster sent to punish him.

380
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,454
Did he...

381
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,120
Did he think... Did he think
I wanted to be born this way?

382
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,094
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?

383
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,929
Daenerys will win this war.

384
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,683
You're a military man.

385
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,476
You must know
there's no way around that.

386
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,106
Daenerys is not her father.

387
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,018
She's even willing
to suspend hostilities

388
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,069
if Cersei agrees to certain terms.

389
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,571
You want Cersei to bend the knee,
you can ask her yourself.

390
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,822
I... I don't. And Daenerys doesn't.

391
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,954
Not right now, anyway.

392
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,333
She has a more important request.

393
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,617
Wasn't sure I'd find you.

394
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,009
Thought you might still be rowing.

395
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,558
I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.

396
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,016
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

397
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:47,106
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

398
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,273
Haven't been here in years.

399
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,396
Why should they recognize me?

400
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,066
Sometimes I hardly do.

401
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,275
Nothing you harder than time.

402
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,827
Anybody give you any trouble?

403
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,793
Here I am, arming Lannisters,
and I never get a second look.

404
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,829
But you were right.

405
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,293
Safest place for me
was right under the queen's nose.

406
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,003
Don't be so sure.

407
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,087
Safety is never
a permanent state of affairs.

408
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,339
Bad things are coming.

409
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,263
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

410
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,833
Well, I think you'll need
to understand...

411
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,018
I'm ready. Let's go.

412
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,650
You should know
what you're heading into.

413
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,945
What do you think I've been thinking
about with every swing of the hammer?

414
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:40,027
How happy I am making weapons
for the family that killed my father?

415
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,440
The family that tried to kill me?

416
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,531
I've been getting ready.

417
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,418
Never knew what for, but I've always
known I'd know it when it comes.

418
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,727
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

419
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,675
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

420
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,470
But this,

421
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,674
this I know.

422
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,150
Keep your father's name to yourself.

423
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,354
Situation's complicated
enough already.

424
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,023
Well, who should I say I am?

425
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,932
I told you, Clovis,
if we don't get out of here soon,

426
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,538
- someone's going to...
- You there!

427
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,328
No weapons, friends. I promise.

428
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,920
What can I do for you?

429
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,210
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

430
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,214
- The docks are that way.
- That they are.

431
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:43,048
I try to stay away from them
to avoid good men such as yourselves.

432
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,100
Still five gold dragons?

433
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,099
Are you joking?

434
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,055
You must be even older than you look.

435
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,978
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?

436
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,309
Apiece.

437
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,031
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

438
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,656
What's in the boat?

439
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,291
Not more gold.

440
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,132
- Wine? I like wine.
- Mmm.

441
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,675
Or hams.

442
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,136
Come have a look.

443
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,929
Fermented crab.

444
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,440
- What?
- Fermented crab.

445
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,485
One bucket of this triples
a brothel's earnings for the week.

446
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,856
A man thinks he's done, he's ready
to go back to his loving family.

447
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,694
But before he gets his breeches up,

448
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:47,495
his lady of the hour pops
a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.

449
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,869
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

450
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,576
Here, have a taste.

451
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,182
I'd hurry
to your favourite establishment,

452
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,476
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

453
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,026
We should have saved some
for later.

454
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,546
Oi! Dwarf!

455
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,424
I really wouldn't try any more

456
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,217
until you see
how the first bite hits you.

457
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,886
That dwarf.

458
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,838
Where'd you get that scar?

459
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,470
Fish hook.
Some men you just can't teach.

460
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,177
We was looking for a dwarf
with a scar like that a while back.

461
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,429
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

462
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,517
Arrangement?

463
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,024
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

464
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,240
- This is Gendry.
- He'll do.

465
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,165
Go, go, go.

466
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,962
- I could give you something.
- That won't be necessary.

467
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,304
Ser Jaime.

468
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,189
Why was Qyburn here?

469
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,560
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

470
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,112
I met with Tyrion.

471
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,081
What did our brother have to say?

472
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,798
Daenerys wants to meet.

473
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,133
To discuss her surrender?

474
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,883
To discuss an armistice.

475
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,636
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

476
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,560
Because an army of dead men
is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.

477
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,060
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

478
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,438
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

479
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,989
Bronn.

480
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:36,372
He betrayed you. He set up a meeting
without your knowledge or consent.

481
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,522
Do you think anything of importance

482
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,287
happens in this city
without me knowing?

483
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,295
You let it happen. Why?

484
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,717
I've come to believe

485
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,676
that an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

486
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,165
could be in our immediate interest.

487
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,557
She has the numbers.

488
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,431
If we want to beat her,
we have to be clever.

489
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,683
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

490
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,145
Dead men, dragons, and Dragon Queens,

491
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,902
whatever stands in our way,
we will defeat it.

492
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,620
For ourselves, for our house.

493
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,993
For this.

494
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,346
- Who will you say is the father?
- You.

495
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,512
People won't like that.

496
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,443
Do you remember
what Father used to say about people?

497
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,491
"The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep."

498
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,039
Never betray me again.

499
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,803
We're leaving today.
The king's got a lot on his mind.

500
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,009
I understand.

501
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,706
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harbouring the bastard of a dead king.

502
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,811
You don't have to worry.

503
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,059
You're just Clovis,

504
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,433
a smith who's come to pay his respects

505
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,520
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

506
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,149
Understood.

507
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,607
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

508
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,363
You survived King's Landing.

509
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,161
Yet again. Your Grace, this is...

510
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,160
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

511
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,459
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.
Bastard son.

512
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,918
He was meant to keep that to himself.

513
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,218
Our fathers trusted each other.
Why shouldn't we?

514
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,843
I saw your father once at Winterfell.

515
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,308
I met yours. In my shop.

516
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,222
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

517
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,072
I grew up on stories about them.

518
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:23,531
All I ever knew was that
they fought together, and won.

519
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,493
Ser Davos told me where you're going,
Your Grace, and why.

520
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,544
Let me come with you.

521
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,166
Don't be a fool, you're not a soldier.

522
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,123
No, but I'm a fighter.

523
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,339
And he won't be needing a smith
with a sword like that.

524
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,055
You know how to use one?

525
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,466
Well, that's a problem.

526
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,096
Prefer a hammer.

527
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,855
He can handle himself.

528
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,643
We could use the help.

529
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,944
As my father used to say,

530
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,822
"It's better to be a coward
for a minute,"

531
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,740
"than dead for the rest of your life."

532
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,995
I owe you my life. Twice over.

533
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,582
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

534
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,659
I can't wait out this war.

535
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,631
Yeah, nobody mind me.

536
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,460
All I've ever done is live to
a ripe old age.

537
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:34,310
You may not believe it,
but I've missed you, Mormont.

538
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,279
Nobody glowers quite like you.

539
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,482
Not even Grey Worm.

540
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,331
This is the coin the slaver gave me

541
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,033
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

542
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,291
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

543
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,960
Take it with you.

544
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,223
But bring it back.
Our queen needs you.

545
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,019
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

546
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,530
Your Grace, I...

547
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,712
If I don't return,
at least you won't have to deal

548
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,202
with the King in the North anymore.

549
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,305
I've grown used to him.

550
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,094
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come, Your Grace.

551
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,813
Heave!

552
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,344
Do you know how many steps
there are in the Citadel?

553
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,383
No.

554
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:32,561
15,782.

555
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,610
Guess how many windows
are in the Great Sept of Baelor?

556
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,609
None anymore.

557
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,942
That's true.

558
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:51,155
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

559
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,457
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

560
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,126
What does annulment mean?

561
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,213
It's when a man sets aside
his lawful wife.

562
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:09,469
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince Ragger,

563
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,800
and remarried him to someone else

564
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,513
at the same time
in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

565
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,313
Is that a common thing in the South?

566
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,858
Look, these Maesters, I...

567
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,195
They set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

568
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,740
and annulments and bowel movements
for all eternity,

569
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,428
while the secret
to defeating the Night King's

570
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,536
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere completely ignored.

571
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,862
But that's all right, isn't it?

572
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,783
We can all become slavering,
murderous imbeciles

573
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,083
in thrall to evil incarnate,

574
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,689
as long as we can have access
to the records

575
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:42,502
of High Septon Maynard's 15,782 shits!

576
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,376
Steps.

577
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,882
That number was the steps.

578
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,598
Are you sure you want to do this?

579
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,643
You always wanted to be a maester.

580
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:24,270
I'm tired of reading
about the achievements of better men.

581
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,774
I found it, my lord.

582
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,949
Took some searching.

583
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,202
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

584
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,125
You're sure this is the only copy
in Winterfell?

585
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,335
Yes, my lord.

586
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,922
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

587
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:55,003
Isn't it your job to talk him
out of stupid ideas like this?

588
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,706
And I've been failing
at that job of late.

589
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,384
How many queens are there now?

590
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,711
Two.

591
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,798
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons,

592
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,553
or the one who her brother?

593
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,389
Both.

594
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,645
How many men did you bring?

595
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,853
- Not enough.
- The big woman?

596
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,866
We were hoping
some of your men could help.

597
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,321
Hmm.

598
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,739
I'll be staying behind.

599
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,117
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

600
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,916
You are.

601
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,871
You really want
to go out there? Again?

602
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,011
You're not the only ones.

603
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,053
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

604
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,104
Said they were on their way here.

605
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,275
You're the Hound.

606
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,025
I saw you once at Winterfell.

607
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,907
They want to go Beyond the Wall, too.

608
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,085
We don't want to go Beyond the Wall,
we have to.

609
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,371
Our lord told us that
a great war is coming...

610
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,002
Don't trust him.

611
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,550
Don't trust any of them.

612
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,803
They're the Brotherhood.

613
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,386
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

614
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,688
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

615
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,773
Thoros?

616
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,442
Well, I hardly recognized you.

617
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,823
Ser Jorah Mormont.

618
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,701
They won't give me anything to drink
down here.

619
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,746
I haven't been feeling like myself.

620
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,869
You're a Mormont?

621
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,580
Like the last Lord Commander?

622
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,874
- He was my father.
- He hunted us, like animals.

623
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,876
You returned the favor, as I recall.

624
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,591
Here we all are,
at the edge of the world,

625
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,468
at the same moment,

626
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:17,020
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

627
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,065
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

628
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,689
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

629
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,321
There's a greater purpose at work.

630
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,952
And we serve it together,
whether we know it or not.

631
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,955
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light clears the...

632
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,205
will you shut your hole?

633
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,035
Are we coming with you or not?

634
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,542
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

635
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:48,593
Is it worse than sitting
in a freezing cell, waiting to die?

636
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,090
He's right.

637
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,510
