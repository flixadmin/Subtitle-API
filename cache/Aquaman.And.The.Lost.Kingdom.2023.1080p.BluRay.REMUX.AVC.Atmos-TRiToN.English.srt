Come on, get up. Go, we gotta go!
We gotta go!

[whispering] There's something back there.

176
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,569
[Dr. Shin] Astounding.

177
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,822
My readings show something's down here.

178
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,825
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

179
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,079
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

180
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,457
[David] How is this place even possible?

181
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,503
[Dr. Shin] This was all probably solid ice
until we started heating the planet.

182
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,966
[David] Well, thank God for global warming,
am I right?

183
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,969
[Dr. Shin] Uh, yeah,
that's not exactly a good thing.

[David] The tracks lead down there.

Suit up.

186
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,704
Wait. The tracks lead down there,
which means...

187
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,998
...the monster's down there.

188
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,586
[sighs]

189
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,755
Okay. I guess we're going down there.

[heavy splash]

191

[laughs] I don't believe this.

192
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,077
It's a structure of some kind.

193
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,247
And there's more buried in the ice.

194
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,417
Here I thought we were just going
to find a ship.

195
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,713
- [David] Everyone, fan out and search.
- [man] Yes, sir.

196
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,674
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

197
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,680
This has to be a few thousand years old.

198
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,265
Astounding.

What is this place?

205
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,508

Free me from my prison

<i>to kill the man who murdered your father.</i>

211

You can't leave him like this!

212
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,135
You ask the sea for mercy.

213
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:54,556
Get out of here. You need to live
so you can kill that son of a bitch.

The Council's called

There's been another plague outbreak.

[councilwoman]
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

244
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,170
and there are now reports of outbreaks
in the Fishermen Kingdom as well.

245
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,965
There haven't been outbreaks like this
in centuries.

246
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,049
Why now?

247
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:57,304
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

248
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,222
Take your pick.

249
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:04,019
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

250
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,813
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

251
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,732
if they don't even know we exist.

252
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,151
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

253
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,486
we have to take our seat at the table.

254
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,703
It's time for Atlantis to reveal itself
to the surface.

255
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,289
[council members murmuring]

256
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,918
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position on this.

257
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,172
Listen, we can talk to their scientists
and combine our technologies

258
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,424
to reverse the damage
that they've already done.

259
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:39,512
And I know this is against our traditions,
but the world is shrinking,

260
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,848
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

Times have changed.

262
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,145
Atlantis wants this.

263
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,023
There's a whole generation out there
that don't want to hide anymore.

264
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,360
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

265
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,363
killed your own beloved mentor,

266
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,908
and you want to negotiate with them?

267
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:04,412
We gave your brother war powers
and made him Ocean Master for a reason.

268
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,125
If we ever decide to make ourselves known
to the surface dwellers,

269
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,171
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us,

277
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,671
but that little baby boy is still
kicking our asses.

- Mm.

Well, my job was a little less
stressful than yours.

284

Yeah, well, I just plain suck at my job.

285

Vulko told me to bring
the land and the sea together.

286
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,080
The problem is half of Atlantis
still wants to destroy the surface.

287
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,458
They won't listen.
I can't bring shit together.

288
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,586
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

You can't save them all, son.

293
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,353
You really want to know how
I raised you here? By myself?

294
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,523
I just keep going.

You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

And you wake up the next day
and you do it again.

Yeah, don't worry about that.

427
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:59,181
He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

428
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,433
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

429
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,602
And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

430
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:07,439
The technology seems ancient,
but we've never seen anything like it.

431
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:11,610
That weapon he used
fires some kind of ultrasonic energy

432
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,237

Do we know what was stolen?

He escaped with a large stockpile
of orichalcum.

435
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,579
Am I supposed to know what that is?

436
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:25,833
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

437
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,502
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

438
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,337
that are highly destructive to our planet.

439
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,215
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

440
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,050
before we realized what we were doing.

441
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,555
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

442
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,225
has been buried in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

443
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,060
Well, we should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

444
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,813
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

445
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,650
We think he's been launching secret raids
for at least five months.

446
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,235
This is just the time he got caught.

447
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,905
Well, this spike in global temperatures
that's causing disasters on the surface

448
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:01,160
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

449
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,955
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

450
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,751
Why would he do that?

451
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,586
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

452
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,130
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet,

453
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,298
we don't have much time.

454
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,425
He is pushing this past the tipping point.

455
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:21,013
He must be stopped
or a global climate meltdown is imminent.

456
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,891
[King] We need to find him, but he has
completely vanished off the radar.

457
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,643
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

458
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,063
But you're not gonna like it.

459
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,815
Your brother?

460
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,777
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

461
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,695
but he's dealt with Manta in the past,

462
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:39,031
and he's the only one who might know
how to find him in time.

463
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,201
The Fishermen will never allow you
to speak to Orm.

464
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,244
He killed their king.

465
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,414
I wasn't exactly gonna ask for permission.

466
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:51,877
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract Orm
from an allied nation.

467
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,171
It would be an act of war.

468
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,216
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

469
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,052
I'm gonna break him out myself.

470
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,014
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason
to seize war powers.

471
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,725
You will be nothing more
than a figurehead if she does that.

472
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,520
My place is out there where I belong,
where I'm actually good at what I do.

473

00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,677
[both grunting]

797
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,249
Are you seeing this?

798
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,420
[Orm] That's not normal?

799
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,510
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

800
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:00,306
[Orm] Let's get out of here.

801
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,767
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

802
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,061
I bet it mutated the flora and fauna
in a short amount of time,

803
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,522
turning them mons... trous.

804
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:09,523
Whoa.

805
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:11,609
[heavy chewing]

806
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:18,949
[chittering]

807
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,075
Oh, shi...

808
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:31,879
[screeching]

809
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,422
Run!

810
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:35,049
[Orm exclaiming]

811
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,009
Come on.

812
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:39,553
[Orm panting]

813
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:40,679
[Aquaman] Faster!

814
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,771
What the hell are you doing?

815
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:50,856
I don't know. I'm not used to running.

816
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,982
Just do what I do.

817
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,776
Use your arms, use your legs.
Lift them up.

818
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:55,444
Like this?

819
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,864
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

820
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:00,282
- Wait up.
- Yeah!

821
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,034
[yelling]

822
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,435
- [yelping]
- Whoa!

823
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,563
[both panting]

824
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,441
[Orm] We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

825
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,151
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

826
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,904
So, what do you wanna do?
Stay here and fight the hopping demons?

827
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,116
[growls] What is that? What does that say?

828
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,701
[Orm] The writing is ancient Atlantean.

829
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,787
"A true king builds bridges."

830
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,002
- [Orm] What are you doing?
- [whoops]

831
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:54,461
[prolonged yell]

832
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:56,297
[grunts]

833
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,508
Got any more krill-brained ideas?

834
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:02,887
- [groaning weakly]
- [stone crumbling]

835
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,914
[grunts] See?
A true king builds bridges.

836
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:31,332
[laughs]

837
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,000
[giant bugs chittering]

838
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,209
That's a metaphor!

839
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,087
[Aquaman] Hey! I forgot to tell you.

840
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,505
Mom says she loves you.

841
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,591
She thinks about you all the time.

842
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,676
[Orm] Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

843
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,346
I don't know. I'm just tired of waiting
for the right moment.

844
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:52,144
[both yelling]

845
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,228
Come on.

846
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:57,733
[Aquaman yells]

847
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,704
[screeching]

848
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,460
[distant rumbling thud]

849
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,842
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

850
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:33,519
[rhythmic thudding]

851
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:36,772
Uh, David? I just ran more tests,
and this data is really disturbing.

852
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,858
We have to stop
burning the orichal... cum.

853
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,237
David?

854
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:50,119
[quietly] Oh.

855
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,574
[screaming]

856
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:43,422
[overlapping shrieks and growls]

857
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,507
[yells]

858
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,135
[gasping]

859
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:57,603
Okay, doc, you want to know
my plan so bad.

860
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,022
Here it is.

861
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:04,693
I'm gonna kill Aquaman
and destroy everything he holds dear.

862
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:11,158
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

863
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,954
I will avenge my father.

864
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:19,917
Even if I have to make a deal
with the devil to do it.

865
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,670
David, you can't trust the trident.

866
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:27,382
- [steel knife rasping]
- [yelps]

867
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:34,556
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

868
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,603
Pray I never show it to you again.

869
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:42,856
[breathing shakily]

870
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,942
[gasps]

871
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,115
[door bangs open]

872
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,577
[door closes]

873
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:06,213
[Aquaman] We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

874
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,966
[Orm] We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

875
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,759
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

876
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:13,762
[Aquaman] Yeah. Look, Loki,
I'm not asking for your advice on this.

877
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,681
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

878
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,100
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

879
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,643
[Orm] So, what's your plan?

880
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,978
[Aquaman] I don't have one, yet.

881
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:24,064
But he came after my wife, which means
I'm gonna pull his tongue out of his butt.

882
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,276
Arthur, you are the king.
You cannot let this get personal.

883
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,945
This coming from the guy
who turned the entire nation of Atlantis

884
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,613
into his own private ego trip?

885
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:32,739
My ego?

886
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,993
You're the one who swam to the front gate
and challenged my claim for the throne.

887
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,287
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

888
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,664
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

889
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,332
Unbelievable.

890
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:43,750
Wait, wait! Wait!

891
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,336
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

892
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,047
Are you kidding me? I hate this job.

893
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:52,009
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

894
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:53,719
And I might even be screwing that up.

895
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,012
You really had no ambition for it?

896
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,180
Absolutely not.

897
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:58,849
From the day
my father found out you existed,

898
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,601
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

899
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:01,852
and challenge me for the throne.

900
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,478
Wow, that's really sad.

901
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:04,980
Especially when you think how easily
I kicked your ass

902
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,815
with basically no prep time whatsoever.

903
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,151
[clicks teeth] Roasted.

904
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,320
That is not how it happened.

905
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:12,946
- That's exactly how it happened.
- Mera saved you.

906
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,406
[Aquaman] No, she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

907
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,034
[Orm] Nope. She made
the little water tornado, I fell in it.

908
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,493
[Aquaman] Okay, shut up.
I think we're here.

909
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:23,373
- [Aquaman mimics bird call]

01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,795
Sleep, <i>aloha.</i>

912
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,172
[Orm] Come on, let's do this.

913
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,758
[Aquaman] Once this is over with,
we should go get some burgers and beers.

914
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,843
- [Orm] Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

915
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:36,720
[Orm] I don't even know those words.

916
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,477
[deep, rhythmic thudding]

917

[Aquaman mimics bird call]

01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,274
- Huh?
- Shh!

920
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:51,610
[attacking grunts]

921
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:04,706
Hey!

[yells]

926
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,117
Whoa, brother.

927
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,830
[cusses in Maori]

928
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,379
It's an orichalcum furnace.

929
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:55,173
All that stolen orichalcum.

930
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:56,925
They're just burning it up.

931
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,927
[Aquaman] He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

932
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:01,013
[Orm] This is catastrophic.

933
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:03,432
This whole place must
be heat-shielded to protect it

934
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,309
from the surface's thermal satellites.

935
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,352
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

936
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:10,522
To take out this reactor,
we would have to crater the entire island.

937
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,607
Get away from there! Now!

938
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,780
This blaster may be ancient,
but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

939
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,247
Okay, I am so sorry. I did not mean that.

940
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:29,833
I just didn't want you to break me in half
before I could surrender.

941
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:32,711
Please take me with you.

942
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,340
Knock him out
and then help me hide these bodies.

943
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,342
No, no. Wait, please.

944
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,677
I didn't want any of this.

945
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:43,889
All I wanted was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

946
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:46,099
I thought I could share its wonders
with the world.

947
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:49,561
I'm a scientist
and I just wanted to be taken seriously.

948
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,315
David Kane said he could help me,
but now he won't let me leave.

949
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,526
You expect us to believe
you have nothing to do with this?

950
01:09:57,569 --> 01:09:58,695
I know.

951
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:00,781
I've done things I'm not proud of.

952
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:03,116
But he would've killed me if I hadn't.

953
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:06,119
[scoffs] Knock him out.

954
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,580
No.

955
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,415

When I touched that black trident.

1040
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,161
Why is he even here?

1041
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,538
He should be on his way back to prison.

1042
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:54,248
We should hear what he has to say.

1043

I made that mistake once.

1044
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:58,294
That's why I know he can't be trusted.

1045
01:19:58,378 --> 01:20:01,089
And he cut off my claw.

1046
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:04,342
This thing took a whole year to grow back.

1047
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,803
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

1048
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:08,638
And just for the record,

1049
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,848

is because of him.

Is that even possible?

is there once was a seventh kingdom

1056

every record of it was stricken
from the chronicles.

was the Lost Kingdom?

No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

1059
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,585
It's called Necrus.

1060
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,213
And I didn't just see it.

1061
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:44,590
I knew it.

1062
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:49,512
It's almost like I was... remembering it.

Flashes of someone else's memories.

1064
01:20:55,268 --> 01:21:00,023
During King Atlan's time, there were
seven united kingdoms of Atlantis.

1065
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:05,319
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

1067

<i>thinking his own brother

But even with the ice cap melting,
Kordax still can't be freed.

1097
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,359
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

1098
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,319
Only Atlan himself could release him.

Manta doesn't need Atlan himself.
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

Blood magic isn't really magic, it's DNA.

1101
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:22,206
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

1102
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:26,169
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.

I'm gonna leave you alive,

01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,656
Dad!

1123
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:38,366
- [Mera] Tom!
- Dad!

1124
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,660
[Mera] Tom!

1125
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,412
[Aquaman] No! Dad!

1126
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:44,664
[Mera] Where's Junior?

1127
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:49,085
[Queen grunting] No!

1128
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:50,878
I'm sorry, son.

1129
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:52,630
Where's Junior?

1130
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:56,217
Manta... took Junior.

1131
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:58,761
- No!
- No!

1132
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,222
No!

1133
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,599

1137
01:25:56,986 --> 01:25:59,071
[man] The medics have
stabilized his condition.

1138
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:00,740
He will be okay.

1139
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,283
[King] We just picked up a signal.

1140
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:06,829
It's faint, but it's broadcasting
on an old Atlantean sonar frequency.

1141
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,664
Headed to Antarctica.

1142
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,501
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

1143
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,339
I've dreamed of this.

1144
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:18,966
The two of you standing together
as brothers.

1145

[shaky sigh]

1146
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:24,972
Promise me you will protect each other.

1147
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:30,144
Promise me, Orm.

1148
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:45,701
Go.

1149
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:14,146
[Brine King] Great waves, Nereus.

1150
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:18,067
Your warship is powerful,
but it's slower than a sea cow.

1151
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:23,489
I say we ditch all this dead weight
and travel light. Hmm?

1152
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,991
And what are you gonna do
when he turns on that sonic cannon?

1153
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:30,579
Our only chance is to hit him with total
overwhelming force from every direction.

1154
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,666
- Not with Junior in the crossfire.
- What choice do we have?

1155
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,751
We have no defense against that cannon.

1156
01:27:35,835 --> 01:27:37,211
Well, wait a minute.

1157
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:41,090
So this cannon sends out soundwaves that
messes with our nervous system, right?

1158
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:44,051
That's right. Ultrasonic echoes.

1159
01:27:44,135 --> 01:27:45,678
Well, what if we disrupt those echoes

1160
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,555
with another soundwave
on the same frequency,

1161
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:49,723
but just much, much louder?

1162
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,767
You wanna disrupt their disruption?

1163
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:53,853
Well, that's gonna be the easy part.

1164
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:56,981
Take your weapons.

1165
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:00,192
And ready your steeds.

1166
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,327
[Brine King] Hmm.

1167
01:28:10,411 --> 01:28:12,079
[sets down gun]

1168
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:22,465

[David] Made a lot of progress, doc.

1173
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:58,125
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

1174
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:00,002
but we were damn close.

1175
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,630
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

1176
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:05,299
[breath shaking]

1177
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,051
My God, what did we do?

1178
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:10,429
Nothing the world wasn't already doing.

1179
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:13,182
All we did was fast forward things
a few years.

1180
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,727
The ice hasn't fully melted yet,
but our scanning reveals a weak spot.

1181
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:18,604
Here.

1182
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,232
This will lead you straight to Kordax.

1183
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,735
Power up the sonic cannon.

1184
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:27,738
Bag the child and suit up.

Astounding.

[Nereus] This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

Yes. I did.

[Aquaman] Keep your eyes open.

1208

Well, that'll be easy. Mine don't close.

[Nereus] I think this goes
all the way through.

1217

My men and I can deal with these worms.

1218

Go now and save the prince.
