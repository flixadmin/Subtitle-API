- Look, sir.

317
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,316
I am already divorced once.

318
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:27,522
I have somehow got
a second match, sir.

319
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:31,839
If I lose my job,
I will also lose the girl, sir.

320
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,484
- Try to understand my situation...

323
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:12,418
Hello.

324
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:14,329
Stop this investigation, Mr. Tyagi.

325
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:16,329
I am requesting you.

326
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:18,775
My wife has been nabbed.

327
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,936
And Awasthi was killed
in front of me.

328
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:23,347
That was bound to happen, you dog.

329
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:27,284
You and your lowly wife.

330
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,217
Don't say anything about her,
Mr. Tyagi.

331
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:30,927
Keep her away from all this.

332
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:34,088
I accept that
I kidnapped your daughter.

333
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:35,740
But my wife is innocent.

334
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,579
I am begging you, Mr. Tyagi.

335
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,025
Everything will go wrong.

336
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,177
You have already done
the wrong deed.

337
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:44,606
Now you are going to pay for it.

338
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:46,696
Everything will go wrong for you,
Mr. Tyagi.

339
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,579
Everything will go wrong for you.

340
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:54,141
I don't have anyone
but Ranjana in my life.

341
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:58,597
If anything happens to her then
to hell with the police

342
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:00,195
and damn you.

343
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:01,954
I will find you.

344
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:05,179
And I will be damned
if your daughter's memorial

345
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,119
and your funeral is not observed
on the same day.

346
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:14,467
If you think I am lying,
then you can wait and see.
