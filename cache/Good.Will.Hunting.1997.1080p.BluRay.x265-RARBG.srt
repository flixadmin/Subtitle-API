Mod f x square dx.

4
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,348
So please finish Percival
by next time.

5
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:47,390
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

6
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,351
Thank you, Steven.

7
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:59,653
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

8
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,451
And I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

9
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,327
Now, the person to do so
will not only be in my good graces...

10
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,703
but also go on to fame and fortune...

11
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,583
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

12
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,626
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

13
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:18,620
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

14
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:23,382
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. Professors.

15
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,969
Well, that's all.

16
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:29,388
If you have any questions,
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

17
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:08,922
- Hi, Will.
- Kirsten, how you doing?

18
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,337
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Good.

19
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,839
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.
- No?

20
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,250
- No.
- Why not?

21
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:18,305
- I don't know. Cathy!
- What?

22
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,800
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

23
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:25,683
Oh, fuck you and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

24
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:29,680
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

25
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:33,149
- So go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

26
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:35,187
Toot-Toots!

27
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:38,405
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

28
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:41,533
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

29
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,281
Plus, it's like 5-to-2, Morgan ends
up marryin' her, you know what I mean?

30
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:47,448
There's only so many times you can bang
your friend's future wife.

31
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,037
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

32
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:54,627
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's like, what, 10:00?

33
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm tired.

34
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,126
Irish curse?

35
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,130
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

36
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:14,402
- Out!
- Stop brushing me back.

37
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,693
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

38
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,945
You're gonna get charged,
you know that.

39
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,827
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

40
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:31,583
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar, uh, at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

41
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,787
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

42
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,918
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
You'll probably fit right in.

43
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:42,464
Ow! Fuckin' punk!

44
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,303
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

45
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,761
- You want this?
- Ah, come on, come on. That's it.

46
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,554
<i><font color=Lime>♪ I'd hold you forever here ♪</i></font>

48
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,978
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

49
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,942
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

50
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:08,856
Come here. It's Saturday!

51
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:11,483
Unless you want to have a drink
with me tonight.

52
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,620
Maybe. We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

53
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:18,412
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

54
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,260
This is correct.
Who did this?

55
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:46,603
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

56
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,357
- Nemesh?
- No way.

57
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:56,193
- Come on, Joey Mac!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

58
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,696
Come on, kid!

59
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:01,068
- Joey, dig it out of there. Dig it out!
- I love the pitch!

60
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:04,618
Lay it down, Mac. That's how to do it!
Attaboy! Take two, Mac, take two!

61
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,329
- Nice hit.
- Taylor, you're up.

62
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,159
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with
the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

63
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:15,213
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

64
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,791
It's that fuckin' guinea. I hate
that little bitch. Will knows him.

65
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,298
- You know him?
- Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

66
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,421
That kid used to beat the shit out of me
in kindergarten.

67
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:25,298
- That guy?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,348
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

69
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,600
Oh, what, Morgan,
you're not gonna go talk to her?

70
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,057
Fuck her.

71
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:35,809
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

72
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,941
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's
just 'cause you like the take-out girl.

73
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:43,480
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

74
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:46,857
Double burger.

75
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:51,486
Double burger?

76
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:54,862
Chuck I had a double burger

77
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:57,703
Would you shut the fuck up?
I know what you ordered. I was there.

78
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:00,835
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

79
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:02,670
Morgan, how much money you got on you?

80
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:06,710
I said I'd get change when I get the snow
cone. I said that before when we pulled up.

81
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:09,048
Why don't you just gimme my sandwich
and stop bein' a prick?

82
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:13,755
All right, well, give me your fuckin' 16 cents that you
got on you now. We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.

83
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,756
Here we go. Keep it right up here
for ya. We'll put you on a programme.

84
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:21,178
Every day you come in with your six cents.
At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.

85
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:25,012
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
- What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?

86
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,940
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

87
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,352
Like how you bought your couch:
Payment plans.

88
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:33,238
Remember how your mother brought
in ten dollars every day for a year?

89
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,107
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

90
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:38,526
- Can I have my food now, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

91
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:42,700
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

92
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,119
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

93
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,822
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

94
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,209
- Yeah, you, you skank face!
- Shut the fuck up!

95
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:54,291
- Let's get outta here. - What are
you worried about? - Come on, Will.

96
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,083
Why don't you lick my love stick?

97
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:59,632
We just seen the guy 15 minutes ago at the park.
If we was gonna fight him, we should fight him then.

98
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:02,596
- We got snacks now.
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.

99
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,880
- I'm not goin'. - So
don't go. - I am not goin'!

100
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,423
Fuckin' go, Morgan.

101
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,888
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not out there in
two fuckin' seconds, when I'm done with them, you're next.

102
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:16,066
Carmine, it's me. It's me, Will.
Remember? We went to kindergarten together.

103
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:20,569
Way down the street
there's a light in his place

104
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,233
He opens the door
He's got that look on his face

105
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:33,828
- Fuckin', let's go, man!
- Step on his fuckin' head.

106
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:37,906
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

107
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:46,252
Motherfucker, die!

108
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,922
- Carter!
- Come on!

109
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,597
Will! Will, come on! Come on.

110
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,105
Will, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

111
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:12,938
- Easy, brother, easy.
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.

112
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,947
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

113
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:23,783
Fuck!

114
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:35,382
Ls this just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

115
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,923
Well, by no stretch of my imagination do I
believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.

116
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:46,049
Or rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

117
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:50,976
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

118
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,739
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

119
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,655
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

120
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,405
However, um, my colleagues and I
have conferred...

121
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,576
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

122
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,832
that took us more than two years
to prove.

123
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:22,495
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down...

124
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:26,676
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour.

125
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,388
- Hi.
- When's the arraignment?

126
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:43,396
Next week.

127
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:14,633
- Sorry. - What are
you doing? - Sorry.

128
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,131
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

129
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:20,013
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

130
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:23,092
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

131
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,445
Oh, my God.

132
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,250
Looks right.

133
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:14,593
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

134
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:17,300
I mean, how hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around the room?

135
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,892
Mitch, you got fired from pushin'
a fuckin' broom.

136
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,766
I got fired 'cause management
was restructuring.

137
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,853
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

138
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:27,061
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

139
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:30,564
- At least I got a motherfuckin' job right now, don't I?
- Yeah.

140
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:35,241
- Why did you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Uh, management was restructuring.

141
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,283
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

142
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:43,660
- You kiddin' me? I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.
- And I told you "no" yesterday.

143
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,330
- What's up, Case? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

144
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,422
Let's sit over here.

145
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:02,216
Oh, this is,
this is a Harvard bar, huh?

146
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,888
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the walls.

147
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,637
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

148
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:21,740
Time-out. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

149
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:25,365
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

150
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,842
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

151
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,877
- Hi, how are ya?
- Fine.

152
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,051
- So, do you ladies, uh...
- Come here often?

153
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,174
Do I come here? I come here a bit. I'm
here, uh, uh, you know, from time to time.

154
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,551
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

155
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:59,554
- Yeah. That's it. Yes, I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah?

156
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,015
- What class?
- History.

157
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,068
- Maybe.
- Yes, I think that's what it was.

158
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:08,694
You don't necessarily... May not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

159
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:11,029
It doesn't mean 'cause I go here,
I'm a genius.

160
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:12,438
- I am very smart.
- Hey.

161
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:14,782
- Hey! How's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

162
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,449
- You wanna...
- What, uh... What class did you, did you say that was?

163
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,454
- History.
- History. Yeah.

164
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:23,081
Just history? Lt must've been
a survey course then, huh?

165
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,752
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

166
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,547
You should check it out. It's
a good course. It'd be a good class.

167
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,131
How'd you like that course?

168
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:34,132
You know, frankly, I found the class,
you know, rather, uh, elementary.

169
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,337
Elementary. You know,
I don't doubt that it was.

170
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,721
- Yeah.
- I, uh, I remember that class.

171
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,597
It was, um, it was
just between recess and lunch.

172
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:46,218
Clark, why don't you go away?

173
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,430
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go just away?

174
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:50,438
I'm just having fun with my new friend.
That's all.

175
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:53,520
- What, we gonna have a problem?
- No, no, no, no, no. There's no problem here.

176
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:57,566
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

177
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:00,947
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

178
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,859
My contention is that, uh,
prior to the Revolutionary War...

179
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:09,242
the economic modalities,
especially in the southern colonies...

180
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,995
could most aptly be characterized as...

181
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:13,917
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you something. All right?

182
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:16,286
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

183
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:19,588
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian, Pete Garrison, probably.

184
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:22,586
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

185
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,968
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

186
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,883
were entrepreneurial and capitalist
way back in 1740.

187
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:32,514
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

188
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,644
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

189
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:40,064
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

190
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:44,189
Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because
Wood drastically underestimates the impact of...

191
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,020
"Wood drastically, Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of social distinctions...

192
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:51,193
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth"?

193
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:55,489
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

194
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:58,112
Yeah, I read that, too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

195
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:01,913
Do you have any thoughts, uh,
of your own on this matter?

196
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:03,621
Or do you... Is that your thing?
You come into a bar.

197
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:08,213
You read some obscure passage and then
pretend... You, You pawn it off as your own...

198
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,085
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

199
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,837
See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years
you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own.

200
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,344
And you're gonna come up with the fact
that there are two certainties in life.

201
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:22,144
One: Don't do that.

202
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,020
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

203
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:28,312
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

204
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,939
Yeah, but I will have a degree...

205
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,983
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

206
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:41,533
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

207
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:46,243
But I mean, if you have a problem with that, I mean,
we could just step outside. We could figure it out.

208
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:51,620
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

209
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,993
- It's cool?
- Yeah. - Cool.

210
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,536
- Fuckin' damn right, it's cool.
- How do you like me now?

211
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:02,916
My boy's wicked smart.

212
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,341
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place, and run into a barney, huh?

213
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,262
Well, there it is.
Hello, nice to meet ya.

214
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:14,347
They were fine, man. I was gonna...
We was gonna close the deal...

215
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,765
but then Chuck, uh,
Billy insulted one of 'em...

216
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:21,481
and the heavyset girl said that I even had a
receding hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

217
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,852
And I was like, "Go fuck yourself. "

218
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,361
I swallowed a bug.

219
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,033
Hi.

220
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,864
- You're an idiot.
- What?

221
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:37,372
You're an idiot. I've been sitting over there for
45 minutes waiting for you to come and talk to me.

222
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:39,740
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

223
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:42,545
And I, I couldn't sit there any more
waiting for you.

224
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,627
- Wh... I'm Will.
- Skylar.

225
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,379
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way...

226
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:49,957
that guy over there,
Michael Bolton clone...

227
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:52,050
he wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

228
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,051
Yeah, I know.
I kinda got that impression.

229
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,346
Good. Okay.
Well, I've got to go.

230
00:20:57,474 --> 00:21:01,423
Gotta get up early and waste some
more money on my overpriced education.

231
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,098
- No, I didn't mean you. I...
- Ah, that's all right.

232
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,515
There's my number. So maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

233
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:11,693
All right, yeah. May-Maybe we can just
get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

234
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,567
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it, it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

235
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:18,319
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

236
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,451
- Uh, right, then.
- Come on.

237
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,377
- Yo! - Fuck you, bitch!
- Hey, fuck you the same.

238
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:35,085
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with their skiin' trip.
- Hold up. Hold up.

239
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:38,380
I should've beat that old bitch's ass.

240
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:46,923
Do you like apples?

241
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,426
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

242
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,353
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

243
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:04,443
We arrived tonight

244
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:09,280
The miles were over me

245
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:16,153
I turned off the light

246
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,163
So, come on, night

247
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:28,256
Everyone is gone

248
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:34,047
Home to oblivion

249
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:41,309
So come on

250
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:45,648
So come on by

251
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:49,357
Tom.

252
00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:57,481
Excuse me. Is this the Buildings
and Grounds office?

253
00:22:57,617 --> 00:22:59,823
Yeah. What can I do for you?

254
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:01,909
I just need the name of a student
who works here.

255
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:04,409
- No students work for me.
- Well, could you please check?

256
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,662
I have this guy who works
in my building. He's about this high.

257
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:09,460
- Which one is your building?
- Two.

258
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,744
Two. Building two.

259
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:20,334
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

260
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,379
I just need his name.

261
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:25,383
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

262
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:28,682
- This is Professor Lambeau.
- And this is Professor Hayes.

263
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,383
Tom, please.

264
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:36,647
This is important. Please.

265
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:40,689
Willy didn't show up for work today.

266
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,896
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

267
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,028
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

268
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,786
Thank you.

269
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:55,955
Asshole.

270
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:03,376
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honour, going back to 1789...

271
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:06,756
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

272
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:11,177
if that act is deemed a defence against
tyranny, a defence of liberty.

273
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:15,633
Your Honour, Henry Ward Beecher, in Proverbs from
the Plymouth Pulpit, 1887, said, and I quote...

274
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:18,138
- 1887? This is the 20th century, Your Honour.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

275
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:20,012
- He's gonna make a mockery of the courtroom.
- I am afforded the right...

276
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:24,189
to speak in my own defence, sir, by
the Constitution of the United States.

277
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:27,150
- This is the same document which guarantees my liberty.
- Don't tell me about the Constitution of the United States.

278
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:29,731
And liberty, in case you've forgotten,
is a souI's right to breathe.

279
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:32,317
And when it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

280
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:34,735
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

281
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:37,950
- Ibid., Your Honour.
- Son, my turn.

282
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:42,738
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

283
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:46,739
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

284
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,952
September '93, assault.

285
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:52,585
Grand theft auto, February of '94.

286
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:56,925
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

287
00:24:57,051 --> 00:25:01,380
"free property rights of horse
and carriage" from 1798.

288
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:04,846
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

289
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:08,924
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

290
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:12,644
I'm also aware that you've
been through several foster homes.

291
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:16,936
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

292
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:21,196
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

293
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:25,615
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

294
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:28,280
- Thank you.
- Court, rise.

295
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:32,946
- Hello?
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Uh, Skylar?</font>

296
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:35,240
- Yep.
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Hey, uh, it's Will.</font>

297
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,953
- Who?
- It's Will.

298
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:40,121
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

299
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:43,789
I don't recall meeting anyone who matched
that description. I think I'd remember.

300
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:47,090
Oh, all right, you got me. It's
the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

301
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,341
who got hammered
and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

302
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,514
Oh, Will! I remember.

303
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:56,890
- How are you? I-I was wondering
if you'd call me. - Yeah, look.

304
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:58,726
- I was wondering...
- Yo, so, baby. What's up?

305
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:00,513
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing?

306
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:03,054
- Hey!
- What's up, baby? Want some of my ass?

307
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,808
- Herve! I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
<i><font color="#80ffff">- What's up, baby? What you doing?</font>

308
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:09,150
<i><font color="#80ffff">Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Um...</font>

309
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,983
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together, um, sometime this week.

310
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:14,439
<i><font color="#80ffff">You know, sit out at a cafe.
Maybe have some caramels.</font>

311
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,863
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Yeah?</font>

312
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,867
Yeah. Sure. Where are you?

313
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,782
Um, well, actually, this is, uh,
this is just a shot in the dark...

314
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:26,243
but, uh, there's no chance that you're,
uh, pre-law, is there?

315
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,499
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

316
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,542
Nice talking to ya.

317
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,128
What the fuck do you want?

318
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:41,888
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

319
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:45,673
The professor you told
to fuck himself.

320
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:50,185
Well, what the fuck do you want?

321
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:54,393
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

322
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:57,559
- Really?
- Yeah.

323
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:04,689
- But under two conditions.
- What are those?

324
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:07,316
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

325
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:10,987
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on...

326
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:15,700
get into some, some more advanced...

327
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,871
combinatorial mathematics...

328
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,878
finite math.

329
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,881
Sounds like a real hoot.

330
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:30,964
And the second condition is that,
that you see a therapist.

331
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:39,137
And I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

332
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:42,272
And if you fail to meet with any
of those conditions...

333
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,272
you will have to serve time.

334
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:48,777
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

335
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:52,736
It's better than spending that time
in jail, isn't it?

336
00:28:56,503 --> 00:29:00,583
I read your book, and, uh, and, and
"Mike" was havin' the same problems...

337
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:03,004
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

338
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:06,087
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will. Very nice.

339
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,797
Thank you.

340
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,132
Will, the pressures,
and I'm not judging them...

341
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,935
I'm not, uh, labelling them...

342
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,013
but they are destroying
your potential.

343
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:22,139
Now no more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

344
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:25,062
You're right.

345
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:27,068
God, I know.

346
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,984
You know, you're not gonna get off
that easily. Come on, Will, a bit more.

347
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:32,823
Well, I mean, I do, I do do things,
you know? I mean...

348
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:35,406
What, uh, what kind of things?

349
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:38,739
I do things that, you know, I, uh... You
know, I mean, I hide from, from people.

350
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:43,664
- You hide, do you?
- No, no. I mean, I like... I, I go places. I interact, you know.

351
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:46,331
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

352
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:48,501
More. That's nice, yes.
What sort of clubs?

353
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:51,631
- Like, um, like Fantasy.
- Fantasy?

354
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,632
- It's not bad.
- Bit more.

355
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,172
It's just something like when you get
in there and, the music like owns you.

356
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:00,843
It's like that house music.
It's like...

357
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:08,679
- You know, you start dancin'. It's just...
- Boom, boom, boom. Yes.

358
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:12,690
- Yes.
- Yeah.

359
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:16,607
Do you find it hard to hide the fact
that you're gay?

360
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:19,691
What are you... What are you...
What are you talking about? What?

361
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:22,361
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

362
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:25,695
A jump? Are you...

363
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,987
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.
But...

364
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:30,827
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

365
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:34,741
What are you... P-Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

366
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:40,084
A difficult theorem
can be like a symphony.

367
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:42,255
It's very erotic.

368
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:45,053
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

369
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:48,381
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

370
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,973
Ah, Henry.

371
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,384
Hi, Gerry. Hey, you know something?
I can't do this pro bono work any more.

372
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,392
It's just not... It's not worth it.

373
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,093
- What happened?
- Well, I'm going on national television next week.

374
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:02,062
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you,
much less talk to that raving loony in there.

375
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,897
An absolute lunatic, he is.

376
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:07,104
Henry.

377
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:10,239
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

378
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:14,066
Now, how old are you?

379
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:17,077
Seven.

380
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,696
What do you see?

381
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,242
Something's in my room.

382
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:26,331
What is it?

383
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:31,208
It's like a, uh... It's a figure.
It's, it's hoverin' over me.

384
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:34,876
You are in a safe place, Will.

385
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:38,594
It's t... It's touching me.

386
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:41,296
Where is it touching you?

387
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:44,185
Lt's touching me down there.

388
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:47,769
And, uh, I'm nervous.

389
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:51,598
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

390
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:55,566
We start dancin' and dancin'.

391
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:59,563
It's just beautiful,
'cause we can make...

Come on, one dance! You, you really
hypnotized me, you know.

400
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,509
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on.

401
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,635
I... He left.
You can't pin that on me.

402
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,391
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

403
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:39,357
- Look into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

404
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:43,978
- I don't need therapy.
- That's enough! Get out!

405
00:32:45,488 --> 00:32:47,362
I called Mel Weintraub this morning
to see...

406
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,980
Oh, what's the use?

407
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:52,275
What do you want to do?

408
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,697
- Well, there is someone.
- Who is he?

409
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:01,917
He used to be my, um...

410
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:04,332
my roommate in college.

411
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:11,588
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

412
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,877
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

413
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:16,681
Why is trust
the most important thing...

414
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:19,178
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

415
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:25,896
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

416
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:27,896
Vinnie?

417
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:32,436
Um, because, uh...

418
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:35,689
Trust is, uh... Trust is life.

419
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:39,404
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

420
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:40,992
<i><font color="#80ffff">Next time, get the notes
from your brother.</font>

421
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:45,661
<i><font color="#80ffff">You know, if a patient doesn't feel safe enough
to trust you, then he won't be honest with you.</font>

422
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,746
Then there's really no point for them
being in therapy.

423
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:50,874
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you know,
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

424
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:52,875
And that should be the goal
of any good therapist.

425
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:55,079
Nail them while they're vulnerable.
That's my motto.

426
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:59,501
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

427
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:04,668
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

428
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:11,557
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

429
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:15,932
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

430
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:18,851
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

431
00:34:18,984 --> 00:34:21,735
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

432
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:25,360
Except they only give it out
once every four years.

433
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,406
It's, it's a great thing.
It's an amazing honour.

434
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,526
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.
Thanks. Um...

435
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,447
We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

436
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:37,411
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

437
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,291
How are you?

438
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:42,956
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

439
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:44,285
- Sean?
- Yeah?

440
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:47,173
I think I got
something interesting for ya?

441
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:49,754
What? You have to have blood and urine?
What's up?

442
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:55,471
- Why didn't you come to the reunion?
- Time. You know, I'm... I've been busy.

443
00:34:55,598 --> 00:34:57,555
- You were missed.
- Really?

444
00:34:57,683 --> 00:35:00,802
So, how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

445
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:04,269
- Before Nancy died.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

446
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:06,804
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

447
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:08,648
I got your card.
It was nice.

448
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,821
- Come here.
- Now, that's a good takedown.

449
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:19,815
Hey, uh, what happened?
Did you, uh, get leniency or what?

450
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:24,743
I got, uh, probation and then, uh,
counselling two days a week.

451
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,323
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

452
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:32,664
Hey, Bill, just, just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

453
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:34,753
- I've got a full schedule.
- Sean, Sean. - I'm very busy.

454
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:37,835
This, this boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

455
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:41,051
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

456
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:45,424
- Ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

457
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:50,182
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago.
He was, uh, Indian.

458
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,015
- Dots not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

459
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:55,186
Well, he lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

460
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:57,556
He had no formal education.

461
00:35:57,692 --> 00:36:00,229
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

462
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:02,437
- You, sir? - Just
a little. - And, um...

463
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:04,859
But he came across
this old math book.

464
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,659
And from this simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

465
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:09,693
that had baffled mathematicians
for years.

466
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:12,863
Yes. Continued fractions.
Yeah, he, he wrote, uh...

467
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:16,863
- Well, he, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah. Cambridge. Yeah.

468
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,203
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

469
00:36:20,336 --> 00:36:23,835
and brought him over to England, and
then they worked together for years...

470
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:26,715
creating some of the most exciting
math theory ever done.

471
00:36:26,842 --> 00:36:29,083
Uh, This, this Ramanugan...

472
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:33,263
his, his genius was unparalleled, Sean.

473
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:36,638
Well, this boy's just like that.

474
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:40,301
But he's, um, he's a bit defensive.

475
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:43,472
And I need someone
who can get through to him.

476
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:46,227
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

477
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:49,062
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

478
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:52,443
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighbourhood.

479
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:55,145
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

480
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:57,524
Boy genius from Southie.

481
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:02,996
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

482
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,783
- Let me guess. Barry?
- Yeah.

483
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:07,410
- Henry? -
Yeah. - Not Rick?

484
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:10,578
Sean, please,
just meet with him once a week.

485
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:12,621
Please?

486
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:18,919
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

487
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:21,922
He's probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

488
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,380
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

489
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:26,009
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

490
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:28,098
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.

491
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:30,634
How are ya?

492
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:36,438
- Yeah, let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

493
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,606
I'm pumped!
Let's let the healing begin.

494
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:42,234
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

495
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:46,906
- You, too, Gerry.
- Yeah, of course.

496
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:54,785
How are you?

497
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,289
Where are you from in Southie?

498
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:01,372
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

499
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:04,790
Do you buy all these books retail,
or do you send away for like...

500
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:07,960
a shrink kit that comes
with all these volumes included?

501
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:11,592
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

502
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,259
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

503
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,762
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

504
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:20,676
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

505
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:24,430
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

506
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:27,483
Hey, I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

507
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,318
I did. I had to.

508
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:33,228
- It must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

509
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,246
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

510
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,042
Jesus.

511
00:38:57,177 --> 00:39:00,462
If you wanna read a real history book, read Howard
Zinn's A People's History of the United States.

512
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:02,470
That book will fuckin' knock you
on your ass.

513
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:04,507
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

514
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:08,341
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

515
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,436
You spend all your money
on these fuckin' fancy books.

516
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:14,185
You surround yourselves with 'em.
They're the wrong fuckin' books.

517
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:18,183
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?
- Hey, whatever blows your hair back.

518
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,024
Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

519
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:25,104
Hey, you know you'd be better off shoving that cigarette
up your ass. It'd probably be healthier for you.

520
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:29,369
- Yeah, I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

521
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:32,200
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

522
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:34,324
- Uh, Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

523
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,035
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Free weights, huh?

524
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,959
- Yeah, big time. -
Yeah? - Just like that.

525
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:40,375
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

526
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,874
You paint that?

527
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:48,424
Yeah. You paint? Do you sculpt?

528
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,380
- No.
- Do you like art?

529
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,883
Do you like music?

530
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,056
This is a real piece of shit.

531
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,059
Oh. Well, tell me
what you really think.

532
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:02,520
Uh, just, uh, the linear
and impressionistic mix...

533
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,890
makes a very muddled composition.

534
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:08,809
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey, uh, rowin' the boat there.

535
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:10,819
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

536
00:40:10,947 --> 00:40:13,568
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

537
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,107
- Just the colouring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

538
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:18,236
It's paint-by-number.

539
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,825
Is it colour-by-number? Because
the colours are fascinating to me.

540
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:22,533
- Aren't they, really? What about that?
- You bet.

541
00:40:22,665 --> 00:40:25,583
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

542
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,785
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

543
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,668
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to Vincent?

544
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:33,625
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

545
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:36,675
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Maybe that means you.

546
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,178
In what way?

547
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:41,589
- Uh, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

548
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:44,724
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

549
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:47,057
The oars are about to snap.

550
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:48,846
You just piss in you pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

551
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,268
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

552
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:53,723
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

553
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:57,441
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

554
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:03,570
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

555
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,651
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

556
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,121
Ah.

557
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:18,375
Mmm, that's it, isn't it?

558
00:41:18,504 --> 00:41:20,746
You married the wrong woman.

559
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:26,628
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

560
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:29,050
Was she, you know,
banging some other guy?

561
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,555
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

562
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:36,724
I will fuckin' end you.

563
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:38,644
Got that, chief?

564
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:44,646
- Time's up.
- Yeah.

565
00:41:57,954 --> 00:41:59,828
At ease, gentlemen.

566
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,876
You okay?

567
00:42:13,342 --> 00:42:17,042
Look, I'll, I'll understand
if you don't wanna meet with him again.

568
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:20,879
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

569
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:25,430
Yeah.

570
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,470
Thanks.

571
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,698
Well, you look lovely in those glasses.

572
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:36,571
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

573
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:38,743
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

574
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:40,746
Wonderful.

575
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:46,412
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

576
00:43:46,546 --> 00:43:52,085
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

577
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:56,428
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

578
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:58,132
You know, I figured out,
at the end...

579
00:43:58,264 --> 00:44:03,056
my brain's gonna be worth $250,000.

580
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:05,426
That sounded horrible, didn't it?

581
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,270
Bring me another mai tai!

582
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:13,316
No, that's cool, I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

583
00:44:13,444 --> 00:44:17,571
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

584
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:21,066
Wow. Well, is, uh,
is Harvard gettin' all that money?

585
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,070
No. Stanford. I'm going there in June
when I graduate.

586
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:28,413
All right, so you just wanted to, to use
this sailor and then, uh, run away, huh?

587
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,584
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

588
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,667
Oh, in that case, that's fine.

589
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,668
Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks,
Skylar?

590
00:44:36,797 --> 00:44:39,252
- Of course.
- All right. Promise...

591
00:44:41,134 --> 00:44:43,375
All right.

592
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:47,211
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait, you need my wand.

593
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:49,968
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

594
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,092
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

595
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:54,978
You ready? Ready.

596
00:44:55,104 --> 00:44:57,641
One, two, three.

597
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,317
They're all gone. Yeah. That, that was...
It works better when I have my rabbit.

598
00:45:03,444 --> 00:45:06,314
Well...

599
00:45:06,447 --> 00:45:08,902
I don't really date, you know,
that much.

600
00:45:09,032 --> 00:45:12,317
How very unfortunate, I think for me.

601
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:17,198
You know what I mean.
I know you've been thinking about uh...

602
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:19,074
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

603
00:45:19,207 --> 00:45:22,291
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have! You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

604
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:26,665
No, you know, I tell ya.
I was hoping to get good-night laid.

605
00:45:27,923 --> 00:45:30,248
But I'll settle for like a good kiss,
you know.

606
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:33,834
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

607
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,923
No, I was, I was hopin' for a kiss.

608
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:41,515
Well, I think we should just get it
out of the way now.

609
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,133
- Right now?
- Yeah.

610
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:47,144
Come on.

611
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:58,192
I think I got some of your pickle.

612
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,457
You again, huh?

613
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,330
Come with me.

614
00:46:21,843 --> 00:46:26,670
So what's this? A Taster's Choice
moment between guys?

615
00:46:26,806 --> 00:46:30,056
This is really nice.
You got a thing for swans?

616
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:33,718
Is this like a fetish? Ls it something
like maybe we need to devote some time to?

617
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:39,733
I thought about what you said to me
the other day. About my painting.

618
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:41,057
Oh.

619
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:43,814
Stayed up half the night
thinkin' about it.

620
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:47,361
Something occurred to me.

621
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,950
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

622
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:55,031
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

623
00:46:55,163 --> 00:46:59,291
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

624
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:02,916
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

625
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:05,370
You've never been out of Boston.

626
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:09,256
Nope.

627
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:14,377
So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give
me the skinny on every art book ever written.

628
00:47:14,513 --> 00:47:18,380
Michelangelo.
You know a lot about him.

629
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:21,885
Life's work. Political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

630
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:26,479
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

631
00:47:26,606 --> 00:47:30,853
I bet you can't tell me what
it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

632
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,114
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

633
00:47:39,909 --> 00:47:42,447
Seen that.

634
00:47:42,578 --> 00:47:44,452
If I ask you about women...

635
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,162
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites.

636
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:50,782
You may have even been laid
a few times.

637
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,756
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

638
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:02,209
and feel truly happy.

639
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:07,304
You're a tough kid.

640
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:12,683
I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh,
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

641
00:48:12,812 --> 00:48:16,097
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends. "

642
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:20,728
But you've never been near one.

643
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:23,612
You've never held
your best friend's head in your lap...

644
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:27,735
and watch him gasp his last breath
lookin' to you for help.

645
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:33,486
I ask you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet...

646
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:39,499
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

647
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:43,706
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

648
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:48,334
Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth
just for you...

649
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,172
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

650
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,588
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel...

651
00:48:54,722 --> 00:48:57,758
to have that love for her
be there forever.

652
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:02,352
Through anything. Through cancer.

653
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:06,523
And you wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in
a hospital room for two months holding her hand...

654
00:49:06,649 --> 00:49:08,558
because the doctors could see
in your eyes...

655
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:11,812
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

656
00:49:13,613 --> 00:49:15,736
You don't know about real loss...

657
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:19,530
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

658
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:24,368
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

659
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:32,285
I look at you, I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

660
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:37,875
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.

661
00:49:39,594 --> 00:49:42,927
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

662
00:49:43,055 --> 00:49:46,637
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

663
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:49,720
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

664
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,521
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

665
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:58,481
You're an orphan, right?

666
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:06,487
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been...

667
00:50:06,616 --> 00:50:09,189
how you feel, who you are...

668
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:12,612
because I read Oliver Twist?

669
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:15,154
Does that encapsulate you?

670
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:19,913
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that.

671
00:50:20,044 --> 00:50:25,204
Because you know what? I can't learn anything
from you I can't read in some fuckin' book.

672
00:50:26,842 --> 00:50:31,005
Unless you want to talk about you,
who you are.

673
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:36,557
Then I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

674
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:41,270
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

675
00:50:43,898 --> 00:50:45,771
You're terrified
of what you might say.

676
00:50:51,863 --> 00:50:53,855
Your move, chief.

677
00:52:01,463 --> 00:52:03,621
Hello? Hello?

678
00:52:05,175 --> 00:52:06,585
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hello?</font>

679
00:52:07,552 --> 00:52:09,544
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

680
00:52:13,348 --> 00:52:14,379
Freak.

681
00:52:16,393 --> 00:52:19,144
Oh. Oh, God.

682
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:22,473
- Christ, who did you call?
- No one. I forgot the number.

683
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:26,057
You fuckin' retarded? You went all the way out
there in the rain, and you didn't bring the number?

684
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:29,359
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

685
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:32,690
Why don't we get off of mothers?
I just got off of yours.

686
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:37,442
That's pretty funny, Morgan.
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch!

687
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:39,819
- Keep antagonizing me, watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

688
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:41,745
- Watch what happens. - All right,
then, Morgan! - Watch what happens.

689
00:52:41,872 --> 00:52:43,912
- What are you gonna fuckin' do to me?
- Keep fuckin' with me.

690
00:52:50,046 --> 00:52:51,919
No smoking.

691
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:26,321
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

692
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:29,654
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

693
00:53:29,788 --> 00:53:32,492
- It's pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

694
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:36,573
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

695
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:40,577
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighbourhood?

696
00:53:40,714 --> 00:53:44,663
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

697
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:48,667
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

698
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:52,848
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

699
00:53:52,974 --> 00:53:56,888
- But I can do the sum.
- Well, it's how you group the terms, Alexander.

700
00:53:57,019 --> 00:53:59,936
But, Gerry, if we do the whole thing
this way, then...

701
00:54:00,063 --> 00:54:02,768
Hey, look, look.

702
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:05,900
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

703
00:54:16,828 --> 00:54:19,745
Sometimes people get lucky.

704
00:54:19,872 --> 00:54:21,781
You're a brilliant man.

705
00:54:59,113 --> 00:55:01,651
You know, I was on this plane once.

706
00:55:01,782 --> 00:55:04,355
And I'm sittin' there, and, uh...

707
00:55:04,493 --> 00:55:08,075
the captain gets on, he does his whole, you
know, "We'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet. "

708
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,243
But then he puts the mike down,
he forgets to turn it off.

709
00:55:11,332 --> 00:55:14,167
And so he turns to the copilot.
He's like, "You know...

710
00:55:14,293 --> 00:55:18,621
all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee. "

711
00:55:18,755 --> 00:55:22,752
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up from the
back of the plane to tell him the microphone's still on.

712
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:25,588
This buy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee. "

713
00:55:28,263 --> 00:55:30,136
You ever been on a plane?

714
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:33,218
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

715
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,224
Yeah, it does.

716
00:55:38,396 --> 00:55:40,305
I have been laid, you know.

717
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,930
Really? Goody for you.

718
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:44,644
- Big time. Big time.
- Big time, huh?

719
00:55:44,777 --> 00:55:47,861
Yeah. I went on a date last week.

720
00:55:47,988 --> 00:55:50,905
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

721
00:55:51,032 --> 00:55:52,775
- You goin' out again?
- I don't know.

722
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:54,700
- Why not?
- Haven't called her.

723
00:55:54,827 --> 00:55:58,077
- Christ, you're an amateur. -
I know what I'm doin'. - Really?

724
00:55:58,205 --> 00:56:02,368
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

725
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,788
Yeah, but this girl is like,
you know, beautiful.

726
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:09,414
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

727
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:11,374
So call her up, Romeo.

728
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:13,299
Why? So I can realize
she's not that smart?

729
00:56:13,426 --> 00:56:15,667
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

730
00:56:15,803 --> 00:56:19,254
This girl is like fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna r-ruin that.

731
00:56:20,265 --> 00:56:23,265
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

732
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:26,933
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

733
00:56:27,062 --> 00:56:31,309
That way you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

734
00:56:35,486 --> 00:56:37,443
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

735
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:39,896
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

736
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:43,234
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

737
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:46,159
Sorry I shared that with you.

738
00:56:46,287 --> 00:56:49,786
And one night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

739
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,417
She woke up and gone like,
"Was that you?"

740
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:57,497
I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have the heart
to tell her. Oh, God.

741
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,121
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

742
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:10,468
Oh, Christ. Ah, but, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

743
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:13,304
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

744
00:57:13,435 --> 00:57:17,764
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

745
00:57:17,897 --> 00:57:21,063
The little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

746
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:23,516
That's what made her my wife.

747
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:26,855
Boy, and she had the goods on me, too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

748
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,363
People call these things imperfections,
but they're not.

749
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:33,982
Oh, that's the good stuff.

750
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:37,618
And then we get to choose who we let
into our weird little worlds.

751
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,574
You're not perfect, sport.

752
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,748
And let me save you the suspense.

753
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,878
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

754
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,753
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

755
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:54,252
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

756
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:56,881
Now, you can know everything
in the world, sport...

757
00:57:57,013 --> 00:58:00,382
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

758
00:58:00,516 --> 00:58:03,221
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

759
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:07,729
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

760
00:58:07,856 --> 00:58:12,813
Yeah, why not? You told me
every other fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

761
00:58:12,943 --> 00:58:15,351
You fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

762
00:58:15,487 --> 00:58:19,567
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

763
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:21,608
Yeah.

764
00:58:26,246 --> 00:58:30,195
- You ever think about gettin' remarried?
- My wife's dead.

765
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:33,452
- Hence the word "remarried. "
- She's dead!

766
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,250
Yeah. Well, I think that's
a super philosophy, Sean.

767
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,422
I mean, that way you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

768
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,342
without ever really knowing anybody.

769
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,960
Time's up.

770
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:05,104
Hold it open.

771
00:59:05,238 --> 00:59:07,230
- Okay.
- Thank you.

772
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:23,044
I am happy with you

773
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:28,209
I know I'm about to love you

774
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:33,678
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him

775
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,757
Oh, my, you made me...

776
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:39,261
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

777
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:43,476
- Hello.
- Hey.

778
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:46,438
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I've been like...

779
00:59:46,564 --> 00:59:49,185
I've been really busy, and...
But, um...

780
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:51,889
Me, too. Yeah.

781
00:59:52,027 --> 00:59:54,814
I... I thought you'd call.

782
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:58,357
Yeah. Um...

783
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:00,448
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time, too.

784
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:02,615
I mean, I just... I...

785
01:00:02,744 --> 01:00:04,653
I'm sorry, you know.
I, I blew it.

786
01:00:04,788 --> 01:00:07,113
No, no. I mean, you know,
it's all right.

787
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:12,372
Yeah. Uh, so I was, I was wonderin' if, uh,
if, you know, you'd give me another crack at it.

788
01:00:12,503 --> 01:00:16,167
- You know, let me take you out again.
- Oh, I can't.

789
01:00:17,382 --> 01:00:19,291
- All right.
- Oh, no. I didn't...

790
01:00:19,425 --> 01:00:23,257
I didn't mean I can't, like ever.
I just can't right now.

791
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,340
I've got to assign the proton spectrum
for "ebogamine. "

792
01:00:26,473 --> 01:00:28,382
All that sounds really, really
interesting.

793
01:00:28,516 --> 01:00:30,390
It's actually fantastically boring.

794
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:33,222
- All right, um...
- But, um, maybe some other time.

795
01:00:33,354 --> 01:00:36,722
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

796
01:00:36,857 --> 01:00:39,145
- Okay.
- Okay.

797
01:00:39,275 --> 01:00:41,149
- Bye.
- Bye.

798
01:00:56,206 --> 01:00:58,993
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

799
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:04,167
- Where the fuck did you get this?
- I had to sleep with someone in your class.

800
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:07,961
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

801
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:13,918
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- No, I... I've got to learn this.

802
01:01:14,055 --> 01:01:16,592
Well, you're not goin' to his surgery
tomorrow, are you?

803
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:18,716
- No.
- Let's go.

804
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:26,263
Oh, my God. My dog is winning!

805
01:01:27,107 --> 01:01:28,685
Come on, Misty!

806
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:31,438
Come on, run! Look at that!
Come on!

807
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:33,443
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

808
01:01:34,447 --> 01:01:38,444
- And Misty flying down the track.
- We won.

809
01:01:38,575 --> 01:01:40,484
I totally won!

810
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:46,451
- So did you grow up around here, then?
- Not far. South Boston.

811
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:51,409
- Still glowing from my win.
- Yeah, I know. Look at you.

812
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:53,418
You're so happy.

813
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:00,547
- What was that like then?
- It was, you know, normal I guess. Nothin' special.

814
01:02:01,928 --> 01:02:03,968
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

815
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:06,718
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

816
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:08,888
Well, Irish Catholic,
what do you think?

817
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:11,425
Right. That's right.

818
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:16,644
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

819
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,395
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

820
01:02:21,528 --> 01:02:24,731
Seven? Eight? How many?

821
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,987
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not have 12 brothers.

822
01:02:27,116 --> 01:02:29,903
I swear to God, I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

823
01:02:30,035 --> 01:02:32,905
Do you know all their names?

824
01:02:33,038 --> 01:02:35,742
- Do I... Yeah, they're my brothers.
- What are they called?

825
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:41,162
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

826
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:43,371
Say it again.

827
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:47,834
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

828
01:02:50,202 --> 01:02:51,577
- And Willy.
- Willy?

829
01:02:51,703 --> 01:02:53,078
- Yeah.
- Will.

830
01:02:53,205 --> 01:02:56,240
Wow! Do you still see all of them?

831
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:59,161
Yeah, well, they all live in Southie. I'm,
I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.

832
01:02:59,293 --> 01:03:00,408
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

833
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:04,411
- Well, I'd like to meet them.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

834
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:06,917
Oh, you know, I read your book
last night.

835
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,671
Oh, so you're the one.

836
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:11,711
Do you still, uh, do you still
counsel veterans?

837
01:03:11,845 --> 01:03:13,043
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

838
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,255
Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

839
01:03:17,975 --> 01:03:21,095
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you, uh...

840
01:03:21,228 --> 01:03:23,600
if you never met your wife?

841
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,186
- What, wonder if I'd be better off without her?
- No, no, no.

842
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:28,937
- I'm not saying like better off. I didn't mean it like that.
- No, it's all right.

843
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:31,606
It's an important question.

844
01:03:31,737 --> 01:03:34,062
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

845
01:03:34,197 --> 01:03:36,356
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

846
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:39,032
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

847
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,781
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

848
01:03:41,912 --> 01:03:46,241
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

849
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:54,464
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

850
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:57,259
October 21, 1975.

851
01:03:57,384 --> 01:03:59,376
Jesus Christ, you know the fuckin' day?

852
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:04,468
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

853
01:04:04,598 --> 01:04:05,796
Yeah, sure.

854
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:09,633
My friends and I had, you know, slept out
on the sidewalk all night to get tickets.

855
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:13,220
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar...

856
01:04:13,356 --> 01:04:16,806
waitin' for the game to start,
and in walks this girl.

857
01:04:16,942 --> 01:04:19,777
It was an amazing game, though. You
know, bottom of the 8th, Carbo ties it up.

858
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:22,440
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

859
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:27,316
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped Carlton
Fisk, old Pudge. Steps up to the plate.

860
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:29,158
- You know, he's got that weird stance.
- Yeah, yeah.

861
01:04:29,286 --> 01:04:32,156
And then, boom!
He clocks it, you know. High!

862
01:04:32,288 --> 01:04:34,695
Fly ball down the left field line!

863
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:37,749
35,000 people on their feet
yellin' at the ball.

864
01:04:37,876 --> 01:04:40,248
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

865
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:42,121
- You know, "Get over! Get over!"
- Yeah, I've seen that. Right. Right.

866
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:45,458
"Get over!" And then it hits
the foul pole.

867
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:50,252
Well, he goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans,
you know, they charge the field. You know?

868
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,675
- Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin' people outta the way.
- And he's goin', goin', "Look out!

869
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,845
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

870
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,093
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to
that fuckin' game! Did you rush the field?

871
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,227
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

872
01:05:01,354 --> 01:05:04,355
- What?
- No, I was in a bar having a drink with my future wife.

873
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:06,439
- You missed Pudge Fisk's home run?
- Oh, yeah.

874
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:08,855
To have a fuckin' drink with some lady
you never met?

875
01:05:08,986 --> 01:05:11,192
Yeah, but you should've seen her.
She was a stunner.

876
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:13,859
- I don't care if fuckin'...
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

877
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:16,944
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room! That's game six!
- Oh, Helen of Troy.

878
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:20,112
Oh, my God. And who are these fuckin' friends
of yours? They let you get away with that?

879
01:05:20,245 --> 01:05:22,866
- Oh, they had to. - What do you mean,
they had? W- What did you say to 'em?

880
01:05:22,998 --> 01:05:25,369
I just slid my ticket across the table
and I said...

881
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,833
"Sorry, guys. I gotta see about a girl. "

882
01:05:28,961 --> 01:05:31,119
"I gotta go see about a girl"?
Yeah, that's what you said?

883
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:32,665
- I had to.
- And they let you get away with that?

884
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:35,502
Oh, yeah. They saw it in my eyes
that I meant it.

885
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:38,717
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

886
01:05:38,844 --> 01:05:41,382
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

887
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:44,597
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

888
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:47,215
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

889
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:50,222
I don't regret the six years I had to
give up counselling when she got sick.

890
01:05:50,354 --> 01:05:53,141
And I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

891
01:05:54,691 --> 01:05:57,941
And I sure as hell don't regret
missin' a damn game.

892
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:59,646
That's regret.

893
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:01,652
Wow!

894
01:06:07,785 --> 01:06:09,659
Would've been nice
to catch that game, though.

895
01:06:09,787 --> 01:06:12,112
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

896
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:19,751
You know, I'm very, very useful
on the court. I'm extremely tall.

897
01:06:21,797 --> 01:06:24,502
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

898
01:06:27,218 --> 01:06:30,587
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

899
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:33,888
"It is decidedly so. " Hmph.

900
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:39,762
Why do we always stay here?

901
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:41,972
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

902
01:06:42,106 --> 01:06:44,513
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

903
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,808
I know.

904
01:06:46,943 --> 01:06:49,434
When am I gonna meet your friends
and your brothers?

905
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,904
Oh. Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

906
01:06:53,032 --> 01:06:55,190
Well, I think I can make it
to South Boston.

907
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,115
It's kind of a hike.

908
01:06:59,245 --> 01:07:02,945
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

909
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:06,082
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

910
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,961
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

911
01:07:09,087 --> 01:07:13,629
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

912
01:07:19,096 --> 01:07:22,796
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

913
01:07:22,932 --> 01:07:26,301
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

914
01:07:26,435 --> 01:07:29,519
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

915
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:33,892
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get like an advance payment?

916
01:07:34,025 --> 01:07:35,982
I don't know. Let's ask.

917
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:39,602
- "Outlook does not look good. "
- What?

918
01:07:39,738 --> 01:07:42,311
Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No, nothing.
Go back to sleep.

919
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:45,532
"Outlook does not... " That's the same thing that told
you you was gonna play in the N.B.A. I think I'm in.

920
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,696
Well, exactly, so look out. You better
start buying some season tickets.

921
01:07:51,456 --> 01:07:55,074
I- I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

922
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:57,000
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

923
01:07:57,128 --> 01:07:59,832
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

924
01:07:59,963 --> 01:08:02,121
Maybe I'm all about three points.

925
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:05,048
I'm all about home runs.

926
01:08:06,469 --> 01:08:09,837
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

927
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:24,522
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

928
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:28,315
And Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind... "

929
01:08:30,864 --> 01:08:34,529
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

930
01:08:34,659 --> 01:08:36,699
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

931
01:08:36,828 --> 01:08:40,825
You know, my Uncle Marty drinks. You know.
He'll go on a bender for six, eight months.

932
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:43,494
I ever tell you what happened to him when he
was drivin' up there and he got pulled over?

933
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,368
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, Marty, yeah.

934
01:08:45,502 --> 01:08:47,245
Let me tell you about... Let me tell ya
what happened to my Uncle Marty...

935
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:49,620
because you oughta know this.

936
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:53,171
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here, he's got another story.

937
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,131
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead, just say it anyway. Go ahead.

938
01:08:57,262 --> 01:09:01,045
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

939
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:05,179
Um, yeah, my Uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

940
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:10,055
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked!

941
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:12,680
This state trooper, uh, sees him
and pulls him over.

942
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,734
So my uncle's fucked, basically. Got him out
of the car, and tried to make him walk the line.

943
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:20,487
He gets out of the car, you know, pukes and the
guy statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

944
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:24,232
So, he's about to throw the cuffs on him
and put him in jail.

945
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:28,412
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road
there's this huge fuckin' boom, right?

946
01:09:28,538 --> 01:09:32,072
- So statie gets real spooked, and he turns around...
- He got shot?

947
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:33,868
- No, no.
- So, so...

948
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:36,918
- You've heard this story before.
- Yeah, Morgan, stop it. Stop it.

949
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:40,496
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
Okay? There was an accident.

950
01:09:42,216 --> 01:09:45,086
- Anyway... Shut the fuck up!
- How could he hear the other car accident if it wasn't right behind him?

951
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:47,756
- I'm gonna break your neck. - You're driving
him nuts, Morgan. - Shut up! Okay, shut up.

952
01:09:47,888 --> 01:09:49,595
- Sorry.
- He told you the story once before. Go ahead.

953
01:09:49,723 --> 01:09:52,130
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move. "

954
01:09:52,266 --> 01:09:56,429
So statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

955
01:09:56,562 --> 01:10:00,144
After a few minutes of, of just lyin'
in his own piss and vomit...

956
01:10:00,273 --> 01:10:02,598
my uncle st-starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

957
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:05,058
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

958
01:10:05,194 --> 01:10:08,111
Well, the next mornin',
my uncle's just passed out...

959
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:10,277
and he hears this knocking at the door.

960
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:13,491
So he goes downstairs,
fuckin' pulls the door open. "What?"

961
01:10:13,618 --> 01:10:15,610
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

962
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,366
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What? '
You know what.

963
01:10:18,497 --> 01:10:21,284
I pulled you over last night is what,
and you fuckin' took off. "

964
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:23,704
He's like, "Bet you I never seen you
before in my life.

965
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:26,705
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are. "

966
01:10:26,837 --> 01:10:30,040
He said, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage. "

967
01:10:30,173 --> 01:10:32,462
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let met get in your garage. "

968
01:10:32,592 --> 01:10:35,261
My uncle's like, "All right, fine. " Takes
him 'round to the garage, opens the door.

969
01:10:35,386 --> 01:10:40,462
And there's... The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

970
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:45,598
He was so fuckin'... He was so fuckin'
hammered, he drove the wrong car home.

971
01:10:45,728 --> 01:10:49,310
And the best part about it is
the fuckin' state trooper...

972
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,895
had been so embarrassed,
he didn't do anything...

973
01:10:52,025 --> 01:10:55,394
'cause he'd been drivin' around all night
in my uncle's Chevelle lookin' for the house.

974
01:10:55,528 --> 01:10:59,442
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

975
01:10:59,573 --> 01:11:01,482
Well, he goes away.
That's the point.

976
01:11:01,617 --> 01:11:04,985
- All right. Well, question. Are you...
- Come on, stop.

977
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,491
I'm tryin' to clarify somethin', probably
'cause you're too embarrassed to ask...

978
01:11:07,622 --> 01:11:09,495
'cause you know
it doesn't make any sense.

979
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:12,458
It does make sense if you listen
to the story and quit askin' questions.

980
01:11:12,584 --> 01:11:15,834
Morgan, let's see if you can get this
one. I've got a little story for ya.

981
01:11:15,962 --> 01:11:21,418
All right. There's an old couple
in bed. Mary and Paddie.

982
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:26,342
And they wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

983
01:11:26,471 --> 01:11:28,843
And Mary looks over
and gazes adoringly at Paddie.

984
01:11:28,973 --> 01:11:33,967
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie. You're
such a good-lookin' fella. I love ya.

985
01:11:34,102 --> 01:11:36,260
I want to give ya
a little present.

986
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:39,432
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

987
01:11:39,565 --> 01:11:41,439
What would you like?"

988
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,027
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

989
01:11:46,154 --> 01:11:51,065
Now, in 50 years,
there's one thing that's been missin'...

990
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,861
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

991
01:11:55,996 --> 01:11:58,783
I would like for it. "
And Mary's like, "All right. "

992
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:03,244
She takes her teeth out, puts them in
the glass, and she gives him a blow job.

993
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:07,208
And afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah,
geez, now that's what I've been missin'.

994
01:12:07,339 --> 01:12:11,206
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

995
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:13,418
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

996
01:12:13,552 --> 01:12:16,636
Is there anything
that I can do for you?"

997
01:12:16,763 --> 01:12:21,389
And Mary looks up to him
and she goes, "Give us a kiss. "

998
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:24,767
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

999
01:12:24,895 --> 01:12:27,220
- That's filthy.
- Not that filthy. I've heard filthier.

1000
01:12:31,693 --> 01:12:33,899
Get off of me! Lt's this fuckin'...

1001
01:12:34,028 --> 01:12:37,028
- All right, see you guys later.
- All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1002
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,405
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1003
01:12:41,534 --> 01:12:43,491
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1004
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:46,786
Ah, well, you don't want to rush the judgment on
that one 'cause, you know, they're not all like me.

1005
01:12:46,914 --> 01:12:49,665
Oh, well, I'm sure.
But it was nice to meet ya.

1006
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:52,495
- Take it easy.
- Oh, all right.

1007
01:12:52,627 --> 01:12:55,165
- Slowly back away.
- Oh, come on. Hey. Brother.

1008
01:12:55,296 --> 01:12:58,499
I don't know what you're doin', dude.
You're givin' us a ride.

1009
01:12:58,632 --> 01:13:00,790
- What the fuck do I look like to you?
- Come on, Chuck.

1010
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:03,001
Else you're walkin', bitch.
WilI's takin' the car.

1011
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,259
All right. Thanks, Chuck.
I appreciate it.

1012
01:13:06,389 --> 01:13:09,175
Wait, wait. I don't know what
you're gettin' all serious about.

1013
01:13:09,308 --> 01:13:11,181
You're droppin' me off first.

1014
01:13:11,309 --> 01:13:13,800
- Dude, it's really out of the way.
- Oh, okay.

1015
01:13:13,937 --> 01:13:16,225
- It's real far. - Just 'cause you have
to sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1016
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:18,015
- don't start thinkin' you're bad.
- All right, come on.

1017
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:20,390
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1018
01:13:20,525 --> 01:13:23,443
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night, hon.

1019
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:27,353
He knows once you see that little shit-hole,
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1020
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,529
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1021
01:13:29,658 --> 01:13:31,947
No. We're gonna do that another time.

1022
01:13:32,077 --> 01:13:33,950
All right.

1023
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,237
Need them keys.

1024
01:13:38,374 --> 01:13:42,288
The stewardess hears this and
goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1025
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:45,704
And I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee. "

1026
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:48,543
No shit!
You didn't say that.

1027
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,667
- For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.
- Yeah.

1028
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,924
- I know someone that it actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke?

1029
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:56,137
- Gerry. Have trouble findin' the place?
- Hi. No, I took a cab.

1030
01:13:56,264 --> 01:14:00,095
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1031
01:14:00,226 --> 01:14:03,012
- How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.
- Pleased to meet ya.

1032
01:14:03,145 --> 01:14:06,845
- Can I get you a beer?
- Uh, no, just a Perrier.

1033
01:14:06,981 --> 01:14:08,808
That's French for club soda.

1034
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:12,191
- Huh. Club soda, yeah.
- Yeah. A couple of sandwiches, too.

1035
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:13,647
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1036
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:15,937
You ever plan on payin' your tab?

1037
01:14:16,072 --> 01:14:18,314
Yeah, chief. Got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1038
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:19,991
- What's the jackpot?
- $12 million.

1039
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:24,826
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- Yeah, but it'll cover your sex change operation.

1040
01:14:28,082 --> 01:14:30,454
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1041
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:37,500
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1042
01:14:37,632 --> 01:14:40,170
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1043
01:14:43,137 --> 01:14:45,841
Have you talked to him at all
about his future?

1044
01:14:45,973 --> 01:14:49,507
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1045
01:14:49,642 --> 01:14:53,177
Well, maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1046
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:57,143
- What kind?
- Well, cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1047
01:14:57,274 --> 01:15:00,607
The kind of place where a mind
like WilI's is given free rein.

1048
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,273
That's, that's great
that there are offers...

1049
01:15:03,404 --> 01:15:05,361
but I, I don't really think
he's ready for that.

1050
01:15:10,118 --> 01:15:12,241
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

1051
01:15:13,663 --> 01:15:16,367
- Well, what don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1052
01:15:16,498 --> 01:15:18,372
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1053
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,497
Just so you don't get
sticky fingers, huh?

1054
01:15:22,629 --> 01:15:25,831
Tim, can you help us?
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1055
01:15:25,965 --> 01:15:27,245
Uh-oh.

1056
01:15:27,383 --> 01:15:30,798
- You ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1057
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:33,548
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1058
01:15:35,848 --> 01:15:39,051
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1059
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:42,842
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1060
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:44,852
- So, who won the bet?
- I did.

1061
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:50,232
This isn't about me, Sean. I'm...

1062
01:15:52,153 --> 01:15:54,229
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1063
01:15:57,825 --> 01:15:59,698
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1064
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:02,827
In 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown...

1065
01:16:02,954 --> 01:16:05,741
for their study of the universe,
but it was a...

1066
01:16:05,873 --> 01:16:09,040
It was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk...

1067
01:16:09,168 --> 01:16:11,741
doing physics in his spare time
who changed the world.

1068
01:16:11,878 --> 01:16:13,752
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1069
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,335
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night?

1070
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:21,091
We all would've lost something.
Tim would never have heard of him.

1071
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,255
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1072
01:16:24,389 --> 01:16:26,926
This boy has that gift.

1073
01:16:27,058 --> 01:16:29,513
He just hasn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1074
01:16:29,643 --> 01:16:32,264
Hey, Gerry,
in the 1960s...

1075
01:16:32,396 --> 01:16:34,886
there was a young man graduated
from the University of Michigan.

1076
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:38,226
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1077
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:40,601
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1078
01:16:40,736 --> 01:16:42,775
Then he went on to Berkeley.
He was assistant professor.

1079
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:46,854
Showed amazing potential. Then he moved to
Montana and he blew the competition away.

1080
01:16:46,991 --> 01:16:49,861
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1081
01:16:49,994 --> 01:16:51,785
Haven't heard of him.

1082
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:53,323
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1083
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:56,621
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1084
01:16:58,584 --> 01:17:03,246
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
We gotta give this kid direction.

1085
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:06,085
He can contribute to the world, and,
and we can help him do that.

1086
01:17:06,216 --> 01:17:08,920
- Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another, all right?
- Sean!

1087
01:17:09,052 --> 01:17:12,385
- We have to let him find...
- Sean, I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache...

1088
01:17:12,513 --> 01:17:15,430
and hatching a, hatching a plan
to ruin this boy's life.

1089
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:18,474
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was, when I was 18...

1090
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:21,471
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1091
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:23,477
Well, maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1092
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:26,310
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1093
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:30,273
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1094
01:17:30,403 --> 01:17:32,561
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Gerry.
Let's talk about the boy.

1095
01:17:32,697 --> 01:17:35,650
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1096
01:17:35,783 --> 01:17:38,985
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1097
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:41,656
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick.

1098
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:46,491
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I came here today.

1099
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,748
I came here out of courtesy.
I- I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1100
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,953
Oh, nice to be in the loop.

1101
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:54,621
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1102
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:58,754
Well, Will, uh, I'm not
exactly sure what you mean.

1103
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:00,759
We've already offered you
a position.

1104
01:18:00,887 --> 01:18:03,175
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1105
01:18:03,306 --> 01:18:06,757
You think you can find somebody who does,
let me tell you, you have my blessin'.

1106
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:10,058
But I think we all know that person's
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1107
01:18:10,187 --> 01:18:13,306
Will, our offer
i- is $84,000 a year plus...

1108
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,350
Retainer
Retainer.

1109
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:21,106
You want us to give you cash
right now?

1110
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,282
Whoa-ho-ho. Go easy.
Now, I didn't say that.

1111
01:18:25,408 --> 01:18:30,532
Allegedly, your situation, for you...

1112
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:32,868
would be concurrently improved...

1113
01:18:32,997 --> 01:18:36,745
if I had $200
in my back pocket right now.

1114
01:18:38,168 --> 01:18:42,331
Well, I don't think I-I can, uh, uh...
Larry?

1115
01:18:42,464 --> 01:18:46,627
- I've got $73.
- Uh, will you take a cheque?

1116
01:18:48,177 --> 01:18:51,380
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1117
01:18:51,513 --> 01:18:53,671
Yeah, you.

1118
01:18:53,807 --> 01:18:57,970
I don't know what your reputation is
in this town...

1119
01:18:58,102 --> 01:19:02,348
but after the shit you tried to pull
today, you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1120
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:07,391
Now, any business
we have heretofore...

1121
01:19:07,527 --> 01:19:10,064
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1122
01:19:11,321 --> 01:19:15,235
Good day, gentlemen.
And until that day comes...

1123
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:17,240
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1124
01:19:31,505 --> 01:19:33,414
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1125
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:35,624
Yeah.

1126
01:19:35,759 --> 01:19:38,593
Good.

1127
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,755
- You want some help?
- No.

1128
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:44,593
- Come on. Give me one little peek, we'll go to the batting cages.
- No.

1129
01:19:46,893 --> 01:19:50,511
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1130
01:19:50,646 --> 01:19:54,430
- It's really important to me. Okay?
- All right. All right.

1131
01:19:56,568 --> 01:19:59,438
- So, why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1132
01:20:01,822 --> 01:20:05,405
All right, Mr Nosey Parker.

1133
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,910
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls...

1134
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,911
let me ask you a question.

1135
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:14,115
All right.

1136
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:18,081
Do you have a photographic memory?

1137
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:20,085
I don't know.
I just kinda remember, you know?

1138
01:20:20,213 --> 01:20:23,712
I mean, how do you remember your
phone number? You know? You just do.

1139
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:26,794
- Well, have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1140
01:20:26,927 --> 01:20:29,631
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1141
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:32,549
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1142
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:35,219
Are you mad?

1143
01:20:35,351 --> 01:20:39,478
Have you completely lost your mind?
Nobody studies it for fun.

1144
01:20:39,604 --> 01:20:42,640
It's not a, a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1145
01:20:42,774 --> 01:20:45,015
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1146
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:49,278
Someone who divides their time fairly
evenly between batting cages and bars.

1147
01:20:49,404 --> 01:20:51,313
I mean, I would hardly say
it was a necessity.

1148
01:20:51,448 --> 01:20:52,823
Oh.

1149
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,987
You know, there are very smart people
here at Harvard.

1150
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,986
And even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1151
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,870
And yet, you do it so easily.

1152
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:08,499
I don't understand. I, I, I don't
understand how your mind works.

1153
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:11,333
- Do you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1154
01:21:11,464 --> 01:21:13,504
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1155
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:18,010
- Yeah, a bit.
- All right. So when you, when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1156
01:21:18,137 --> 01:21:21,671
- I see "Chopsticks. "
- All right. Well, Beethoven, okay?

1157
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:25,638
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1158
01:21:25,768 --> 01:21:28,057
- So, what are you saying? You play the piano?
- No, not a lick.

1159
01:21:28,187 --> 01:21:32,018
I mean, I look at a piano, I see a bunch
of keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1160
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:36,857
But Beethoven, Mozart,
they saw it, they could just play.

1161
01:21:36,986 --> 01:21:40,604
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1162
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:42,613
And I can't play the piano.

1163
01:21:42,741 --> 01:21:46,405
But you can do my O-chem paper
in under an hour.

1164
01:21:46,536 --> 01:21:48,611
Right. Well, I mean, when it came
to stuff like that...

1165
01:21:48,746 --> 01:21:50,703
I could always just play.

1166
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:55,367
That's the best I can explain it.

1167
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:59,331
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1168
01:21:59,463 --> 01:22:02,168
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1169
01:22:02,299 --> 01:22:04,375
Well...

1170
01:22:18,813 --> 01:22:23,391
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1171
01:22:23,525 --> 01:22:26,561
I've been here for four years...

1172
01:22:26,695 --> 01:22:29,399
and I've only just found you.

1173
01:22:30,323 --> 01:22:32,564
Well, you found me.

1174
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,457
Are you awake?

1175
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:48,543
Nope.

1176
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,545
Yes, you are.

1177
01:22:54,551 --> 01:22:57,671
Will, come to California with me.

1178
01:22:59,305 --> 01:23:01,179
What?

1179
01:23:03,225 --> 01:23:05,977
I want you to come to California
with me.

1180
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,106
You sure about that?

1181
01:23:13,234 --> 01:23:15,771
Oh, yeah.

1182
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:18,939
Yeah, but how do you know?

1183
01:23:19,072 --> 01:23:22,986
I don't know.
I just know.

1184
01:23:23,117 --> 01:23:25,987
Yeah, but h-how do you know?

1185
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:31,196
I know because I feel it.

1186
01:23:31,332 --> 01:23:33,905
- 'Cause that's a really serious thing you're sayin'. I mean...
- I, I know.

1187
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:36,498
You could be in California next week,
and you know...

1188
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:40,127
you might find out something about me
you don't like, and, you know...

1189
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:43,257
maybe you wish you hadn't said that, but
you know it's such a serious thing...

1190
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:45,792
that you can't take it back,
and now I'm stuck in California...

1191
01:23:45,928 --> 01:23:48,715
with someone that doesn't really want to
be with me, just wish they had a take-back.

1192
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:52,180
A what? What's a take-back?

1193
01:23:52,309 --> 01:23:54,633
I don't want a take-back.

1194
01:23:54,769 --> 01:23:58,351
I just want you to come
to California with me.

1195
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,813
Well, I can't go to California
with you, so...

1196
01:24:04,277 --> 01:24:09,271
- Why not?
- Well, one, because I, I, I got a job here.

1197
01:24:09,406 --> 01:24:11,897
And two, because I live here.

1198
01:24:12,033 --> 01:24:15,983
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me because...

1199
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,121
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1200
01:24:19,248 --> 01:24:24,490
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1201
01:24:24,627 --> 01:24:26,584
What am I so scared of?

1202
01:24:26,713 --> 01:24:30,128
Well, what aren't you scared of?

1203
01:24:30,257 --> 01:24:34,041
You live in this safe little world where no one challenges
you, and you're scared shitless to do anything else.

1204
01:24:34,177 --> 01:24:37,213
- Because that might mean that you'd have to change.
- Don't, don't tell me about my world. Don't tell me about my world.

1205
01:24:37,347 --> 01:24:39,588
I mean, you just wanna have your little fling
with like the guy from the other side of town.

1206
01:24:39,724 --> 01:24:42,724
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1207
01:24:42,851 --> 01:24:44,843
who your parents will approve of,
and just sit around...

1208
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:48,560
with the other trust-fund babies and talk
about how you went slummin', too, once.

1209
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:51,606
Why are you saying this?

1210
01:24:51,734 --> 01:24:54,271
What is your obsession with this money?

1211
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:58,863
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1212
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:04,328
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1213
01:25:04,453 --> 01:25:06,362
That I would give it back in a second...

1214
01:25:06,496 --> 01:25:09,034
if it meant I could have one more day
with him, but I can't.

1215
01:25:09,165 --> 01:25:11,241
And that's my life,
and I deal with it.

1216
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:14,495
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1217
01:25:14,628 --> 01:25:17,249
I'm afraid? W-W-What am I afraid of?
So, what the fuck am I afraid of?

1218
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,871
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1219
01:25:20,008 --> 01:25:22,296
And you know what?
I'm afraid, too!

1220
01:25:22,426 --> 01:25:25,546
But fuck it, I wanna give it a shot.
And at least I'm honest with you.

1221
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,593
- I'm not honest with you?
- No. What about your 12 brothers?

1222
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,633
All right.

1223
01:25:31,767 --> 01:25:33,925
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1224
01:25:34,061 --> 01:25:36,896
What do you wanna know? What?
That I don't have 12 brothers?

1225
01:25:37,022 --> 01:25:39,394
- That I'm a fuckin' orphan? No, you don't wanna hear that.
- I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

1226
01:25:39,524 --> 01:25:43,142
No, you don't wanna hear that. You don't wanna hear that I
got fuckin' cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid.

1227
01:25:43,277 --> 01:25:45,400
- Honey, I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1228
01:25:45,529 --> 01:25:48,898
That the motherfucker stabbed me.
You don't wanna hear that shit, Skylar!

1229
01:25:49,032 --> 01:25:51,523
- I do wanna hear that.
- Don't tell me you wanna hear that shit!

1230
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:54,743
- I wanna hear it because I wanna help you, because I wanna be with you.
- Help me? What the fuck!

1231
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:57,575
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1232
01:25:57,706 --> 01:25:59,164
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1233
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:03,204
- No! God, I just want to be with you because I love you.
- Don't bullshit me. Don't bullshit me.

1234
01:26:03,336 --> 01:26:06,170
- Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!
- I love you. I love you.

1235
01:26:06,297 --> 01:26:08,752
I love you.

1236
01:26:10,091 --> 01:26:14,089
I wanna hear you say
that you don't love me.

1237
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:16,259
Because if you say that...

1238
01:26:18,098 --> 01:26:20,137
then I won't call you...

1239
01:26:21,518 --> 01:26:24,554
and I won't be in your life.

1240
01:26:31,026 --> 01:26:33,267
I don't love you.

1241
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:39,029
You don't...

1242
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:17,314
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1243
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,144
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1244
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:23,810
They get convinced they're stupid.

1245
01:27:23,945 --> 01:27:26,862
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing...

1246
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:30,275
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you...

1247
01:27:30,409 --> 01:27:32,615
not against you.

1248
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:38,371
Hello, Will.

1249
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:41,617
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1250
01:27:41,752 --> 01:27:43,626
Sure.

1251
01:27:47,173 --> 01:27:49,082
Now, let's see.

1252
01:27:55,138 --> 01:27:58,341
Good. This is correct.

1253
01:27:59,934 --> 01:28:02,222
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1254
01:28:02,353 --> 01:28:05,472
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

1255
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,853
This can't be right.

1256
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,809
This would be very embarrassing.

1257
01:28:17,324 --> 01:28:19,861
- Did you ever consider...
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1258
01:28:19,993 --> 01:28:21,866
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1259
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:26,288
Because I, I gotta knock off work to
come here and the commute is killing me.

1260
01:28:26,415 --> 01:28:27,790
Yeah, sure.

1261
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:29,992
- But did you think of the possibility...
- It's right.

1262
01:28:31,169 --> 01:28:35,166
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1263
01:28:38,467 --> 01:28:40,376
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1264
01:28:41,469 --> 01:28:45,680
I couldn't go. I had a date.
So, uh, so I sent my chief negotiator.

1265
01:28:49,518 --> 01:28:53,052
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1266
01:28:53,187 --> 01:28:55,892
But when I set up a meeting with,
with my associates...

1267
01:28:56,023 --> 01:28:58,478
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1268
01:28:58,609 --> 01:29:00,897
- Well, then don't set up any more meetings.
- Well, I won't.

1269
01:29:01,027 --> 01:29:03,352
I'll cancel them.

1270
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:07,022
I'll give you a job myself. I, I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1271
01:29:07,157 --> 01:29:10,324
Look, maybe I don't wanna spend the, the rest of my
fuckin' life sittin' around explaining shit to people.

1272
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:20,912
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1273
01:29:21,044 --> 01:29:24,128
A little appreciation? Do you know
how easy this is for me?

1274
01:29:24,255 --> 01:29:27,421
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1275
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:29,423
And I'm sorry you can't do this.
I really am.

1276
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:32,089
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin'
sit here and watch you fumble around...

1277
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,129
and fuck it up.

1278
01:29:38,893 --> 01:29:42,510
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1279
01:29:42,646 --> 01:29:47,188
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1280
01:30:01,328 --> 01:30:03,451
Yeah, you're right, Will.

1281
01:30:05,623 --> 01:30:08,292
I can't do this proof.

1282
01:30:09,919 --> 01:30:13,121
But you can. And when it comes to that,
it's only about...

1283
01:30:13,255 --> 01:30:16,588
It's just a handful of people in the world
who can tell the difference between you and me.

1284
01:30:16,716 --> 01:30:18,792
- But I'm one of 'em.
- Sorry.

1285
01:30:18,926 --> 01:30:21,084
Yeah, so am I.

1286
01:30:22,012 --> 01:30:24,384
Most days I wish I never met you...

1287
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,973
because then I could sleep at night.

1288
01:30:29,102 --> 01:30:31,972
And I didn't, I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge...

1289
01:30:32,104 --> 01:30:35,021
that there was someone like you
out there.

1290
01:30:41,153 --> 01:30:44,604
I- I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1291
01:30:51,829 --> 01:30:54,154
Bill, hold it.

1292
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:56,496
Did you hear that?

1293
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,291
Morgan!

1294
01:30:59,419 --> 01:31:01,956
If you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again...

1295
01:31:02,088 --> 01:31:04,163
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'.

1296
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:23,724
What's up, fellas?

1297
01:31:23,856 --> 01:31:26,810
Morgan, dude, why don't you jerk off
in your own fuckin' house, dude?

1298
01:31:26,942 --> 01:31:31,188
- That's fuckin' filthy.
- I don't got a V.C.R. At my house.

1299
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:35,188
- You're kiddin'.
- Come on. Not in my glove.

1300
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:37,696
I didn't, I didn't use the glove.

1301
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,700
That's my Little League glove.

1302
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:44,743
What do you want me to do?

1303
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:47,032
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1304
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:49,207
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1305
01:31:49,336 --> 01:31:52,704
I didn't. I didn't.
I just used it for the, for cleanup.

1306
01:31:53,798 --> 01:31:56,371
Will you stop jerkin' off
in my mother's room, please?

1307
01:31:56,509 --> 01:31:59,711
- Is there another V.C.R. In the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1308
01:32:01,555 --> 01:32:06,180
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1309
01:32:06,309 --> 01:32:09,511
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1310
01:32:09,645 --> 01:32:12,645
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology
that you wouldn't see anywhere else...

1311
01:32:12,772 --> 01:32:15,559
because we've classified it.

1312
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:19,226
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1313
01:32:19,361 --> 01:32:22,362
Code breaking.

1314
01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:25,110
Well, that's one aspect
of what we do.

1315
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:27,115
Oh, come on.
I mean, that is what you do.

1316
01:32:27,243 --> 01:32:30,279
You guys handle 80%
of the intelligence workload.

1317
01:32:30,412 --> 01:32:32,903
You're seven times the size
of the C.I.A.

1318
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,075
We don't like to brag
about that, Will.

1319
01:32:36,209 --> 01:32:39,375
But you're exactly right.

1320
01:32:39,503 --> 01:32:42,706
So, the way I see it,
the question isn't...

1321
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:45,412
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1322
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:48,088
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1323
01:32:48,219 --> 01:32:51,967
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1324
01:32:52,097 --> 01:32:56,046
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1325
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:58,591
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
And somebody puts a code on my desk.

1326
01:32:58,728 --> 01:33:00,601
Somethin' no one else can break.

1327
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:02,686
Maybe I take a shot at it,
and maybe I break it.

1328
01:33:02,815 --> 01:33:04,973
And I'm real happy with myself
'cause I did my job well.

1329
01:33:05,108 --> 01:33:08,559
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.

1330
01:33:08,695 --> 01:33:12,063
And once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1331
01:33:12,198 --> 01:33:16,408
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1332
01:33:16,535 --> 01:33:19,535
Now the politicians are sayin', "Oh,
send in the marines to secure the area. "

1333
01:33:19,662 --> 01:33:22,200
'Cause they don't give a shit. It won't
be their kid over there gettin' shot.

1334
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:24,205
Just like it wasn't them
when their number got called...

1335
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:26,455
'cause they were all pullin' a tour
in the National Guard.

1336
01:33:26,585 --> 01:33:29,419
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1337
01:33:29,546 --> 01:33:31,621
He comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at...

1338
01:33:31,756 --> 01:33:34,128
got exported to the country
he just got back from...

1339
01:33:34,258 --> 01:33:36,380
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1340
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,427
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks.

1341
01:33:39,554 --> 01:33:41,961
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1342
01:33:42,098 --> 01:33:45,134
was so that we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1343
01:33:45,267 --> 01:33:49,051
And, of course, the oil companies used a little
skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1344
01:33:49,187 --> 01:33:51,061
A cute little ancillary benefit
for them...

1345
01:33:51,189 --> 01:33:53,679
but it ain't helpin' my buddy
at $2.50 a gallon.

1346
01:33:53,816 --> 01:33:55,808
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil back, of course.

1347
01:33:55,943 --> 01:33:58,149
Maybe they even took the liberty
of hirin' an alcoholic skipper...

1348
01:33:58,278 --> 01:34:01,444
who likes to drink martinis and
fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1349
01:34:01,573 --> 01:34:03,648
It ain't too long till he hits one,
spills the oil...

1350
01:34:03,783 --> 01:34:06,320
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1351
01:34:06,452 --> 01:34:08,610
So now by buddy's out of work.
He can't afford to drive...

1352
01:34:08,745 --> 01:34:10,821
so he's walkin' to the fuckin'
job interviews, which sucks...

1353
01:34:10,955 --> 01:34:13,576
because the shrapnel in his ass
is givin' him chronic haemorrhoids.

1354
01:34:13,708 --> 01:34:16,115
And meanwhile, he's starvin' 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat...

1355
01:34:16,252 --> 01:34:21,127
the only blue plate special they're servin'
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1356
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:23,129
So what did I think?

1357
01:34:23,258 --> 01:34:26,756
I'm holdin' out for something better.

1358
01:34:26,886 --> 01:34:30,088
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy...

1359
01:34:30,222 --> 01:34:32,095
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy...

1360
01:34:32,223 --> 01:34:34,679
hike up gas prices, bomb a village,
club a baby seal...

1361
01:34:34,809 --> 01:34:37,513
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1362
01:34:37,645 --> 01:34:40,182
I can be elected president.

1363
01:34:40,314 --> 01:34:43,516
- You feel like you're alone, Will?
- What?

1364
01:34:44,609 --> 01:34:47,016
Do you have a soul mate?

1365
01:34:47,153 --> 01:34:49,822
Do I have a...
Define that.

1366
01:34:49,947 --> 01:34:51,856
Somebody who challenges you.

1367
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:54,900
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family.

1368
01:34:55,034 --> 01:34:57,607
He'd lie down
in fuckin' traffic for you.

1369
01:34:57,745 --> 01:35:01,244
No, I'm talkin' about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1370
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,875
- I got... I got...
- Who?

1371
01:35:07,003 --> 01:35:09,672
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1372
01:35:09,797 --> 01:35:12,999
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

1373
01:35:13,133 --> 01:35:16,050
- That's great. They're all dead.
- Not to me they're not.

1374
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:18,466
Nah. You don't have
a lot of dialogue with them.

1375
01:35:19,805 --> 01:35:21,679
You can't give back to them, Will.

1376
01:35:21,807 --> 01:35:24,214
Not without some serious smelling salts
and a heater.

1377
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:26,390
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1378
01:35:27,854 --> 01:35:29,976
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1379
01:35:30,106 --> 01:35:32,312
where you're always afraid
to take the first step...

1380
01:35:32,441 --> 01:35:35,940
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1381
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:38,476
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1382
01:35:38,613 --> 01:35:39,988
- No.
- Look, I didn't want the job.

1383
01:35:40,114 --> 01:35:42,521
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1384
01:35:42,658 --> 01:35:45,742
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1385
01:35:47,245 --> 01:35:50,744
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1386
01:35:50,873 --> 01:35:52,996
I mean, there are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1387
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:55,580
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1388
01:35:55,711 --> 01:35:58,166
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1389
01:35:58,296 --> 01:36:00,703
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind, "I didn't ask for this. "

1390
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,173
What do you mean, "cop out"? I mean,
w- w-what's wrong with layin' brick?

1391
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:07,052
- Nothin'.
- There's nothin' wrong with it. That's, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1392
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:11,887
Right. My day laid brick, okay? Busted
his ass so I could have an education.

1393
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:15,515
Exactly. That's an honourable profession.
What's wrong with, with fixin' somebody's car?

1394
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,099
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. There's honour in that.

1395
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,388
Yeah, there is, Will. There's honour
in that. And there's honour in...

1396
01:36:20,523 --> 01:36:22,515
you know, taking that
40-minute train ride...

1397
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,105
so those college kids could come in
in the morning and the floors are clean.

1398
01:36:25,235 --> 01:36:26,943
And the wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1399
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,395
- That's right.
- Right. And that's honourable.

1400
01:36:29,531 --> 01:36:33,231
Sure, that's why you took that job.
I mean, for the honour of it.

1401
01:36:33,367 --> 01:36:35,276
I just have a little question here.

1402
01:36:35,411 --> 01:36:38,080
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1403
01:36:38,205 --> 01:36:41,869
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1404
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,249
And why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1405
01:36:45,377 --> 01:36:49,244
that only one or two people in the world
could do, and then lie about it?

1406
01:36:51,925 --> 01:36:54,249
'Cause I don't see a lot of honour
in that, Will.

1407
01:36:57,554 --> 01:36:59,879
So what do you really want to do?

1408
01:37:04,102 --> 01:37:07,055
- I wanna be a shepherd.
- Really?

1409
01:37:07,187 --> 01:37:09,394
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread...

1410
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:11,432
get some sheep
and tend to them.

1411
01:37:11,566 --> 01:37:14,436
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1412
01:37:14,569 --> 01:37:17,273
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

1413
01:37:17,404 --> 01:37:18,946
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1414
01:37:19,073 --> 01:37:20,981
- Hey, no, no, no. Time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1415
01:37:21,116 --> 01:37:23,357
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- Listen, you're not gonna answer my questions.

1416
01:37:23,493 --> 01:37:26,328
- You're wastin' my fuckin' time.
- What? I thought we were friends. What do you mean, you...

1417
01:37:26,454 --> 01:37:29,988
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Well, why you kickin' me out, Sean? I mean, what... I mean...

1418
01:37:30,123 --> 01:37:33,457
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1419
01:37:33,585 --> 01:37:35,743
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1420
01:37:35,878 --> 01:37:38,914
Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk
about soul mates? Where is she?

1421
01:37:39,048 --> 01:37:41,123
- Dead.
- That's right, she's fuckin' dead.

1422
01:37:41,258 --> 01:37:43,927
She fuckin' dies, and you just
cash in your chips and you walk away?

1423
01:37:44,052 --> 01:37:48,179
- Hey, at least I played a hand.
- Oh, and you played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1424
01:37:48,305 --> 01:37:51,639
And some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1425
01:37:51,767 --> 01:37:54,851
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1426
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,849
You and your bullshit. You got
a bullshit answer for everybody.

1427
01:38:05,987 --> 01:38:09,818
But I ask you a very simple question,
and you can't give me a straight answer.

1428
01:38:11,533 --> 01:38:13,858
Because you don't know.

1429
01:38:15,495 --> 01:38:17,701
See ya, Bo-Peep.

1430
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,949
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1431
01:38:27,672 --> 01:38:29,711
Shepherd.

1432
01:38:29,841 --> 01:38:31,916
White little prick.

1433
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,134
I just wanted to, you know, um...

1434
01:38:35,262 --> 01:38:38,713
call you up, uh, before you left, um...

Well, you know,
I never really cared about that.

1438
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:49,604
Yeah.

1439
01:38:52,735 --> 01:38:54,110
I love you.

1440
01:38:59,449 --> 01:39:00,943
Will?

1441
01:39:02,493 --> 01:39:03,868
You take care.

Will, come on.
Will!

1459
01:40:19,433 --> 01:40:21,674
Will, that's it.
We're done here.

1460
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:24,810
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1461
01:40:26,564 --> 01:40:30,395
Well, it's ten past 5:00.
An hour and ten minutes late.

1462
01:40:30,526 --> 01:40:34,226
I can make you satisfied
in everything

1463
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,485
Well, what if he doesn't show up
and I file a report...

1464
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:38,488
saying he wasn't here
and he goes back to jail?

1465
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:41,367
Lt won't be on my conscience.

1466
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:44,447
Now becoming true

1467
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:47,070
Okay. Fine.

1468
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,082
What's up?

1469
01:40:53,003 --> 01:40:54,876
Thanks.

1470
01:40:59,759 --> 01:41:01,632
Fuck, that's good.

1471
01:41:05,305 --> 01:41:07,428
So how's your lady?

1472
01:41:07,557 --> 01:41:09,430
Ah, she's gone.

1473
01:41:10,726 --> 01:41:12,932
Gone? Gone where?

1474
01:41:13,062 --> 01:41:17,438
Uh, med school.
Medical school in California.

1475
01:41:17,565 --> 01:41:18,763
- Really?
- Yeah.

1476
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,437
- When was this?
- It was like a week ago.

1477
01:41:26,323 --> 01:41:28,564
That sucks.

1478
01:41:31,077 --> 01:41:34,694
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetin's?

1479
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,703
I think the week after I'm 21.

1480
01:41:36,832 --> 01:41:39,501
Yeah? They gonna hook you up
with a job or what?

1481
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:43,837
Yeah. Fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1482
01:41:43,963 --> 01:41:47,296
Ah, probably make some nice bank though.

1483
01:41:47,424 --> 01:41:49,297
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1484
01:41:49,426 --> 01:41:52,794
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1485
01:41:52,929 --> 01:41:54,755
Well, uh, what do I want a way
out of here for?

1486
01:41:54,889 --> 01:41:57,426
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin' live here
the rest of my life.

1487
01:41:57,557 --> 01:41:59,633
You know, be neighbours.
You know, have little kids.

1488
01:41:59,768 --> 01:42:02,638
Fuckin' take them to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1489
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,995
Look, you're my best friend
so don't take this the wrong way...

1490
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:12,873
but in 20 years,
if you're still livin' here...

1491
01:42:13,003 --> 01:42:16,206
comin' over to my house to watch the
Patriot's games, still workin' construction...

1492
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:18,415
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1493
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:21,171
- That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.
- What?

1494
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:23,425
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1495
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:27,503
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on. W-Why is it always this?

1496
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:30,725
I mean, I fuckin' owe it to myself to do
this or that. What if I don't want to?

1497
01:42:30,852 --> 01:42:34,849
Oh, no, no, no. No, fuck you.
You don't owe it to yourself.

1498
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:37,138
You owe it to me...

1499
01:42:37,274 --> 01:42:39,764
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up
and I'll be 50...

1500
01:42:39,901 --> 01:42:42,736
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1501
01:42:42,862 --> 01:42:44,819
And that's all right. That's fine.

1502
01:42:44,947 --> 01:42:47,616
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1503
01:42:47,741 --> 01:42:51,441
And you're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1504
01:42:53,621 --> 01:42:56,290
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1505
01:42:56,415 --> 01:42:59,285
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1506
01:42:59,417 --> 01:43:01,873
It'd be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1507
01:43:02,003 --> 01:43:05,122
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1508
01:43:05,256 --> 01:43:06,833
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1509
01:43:06,966 --> 01:43:09,041
- No, you don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that.

1510
01:43:09,176 --> 01:43:11,049
Let me tell you what I do know.

1511
01:43:11,177 --> 01:43:14,344
Every day I come by your house
and I pick you up.

1512
01:43:14,472 --> 01:43:18,469
And we go out and we have a few drinks
and a few laughs, and it's great.

1513
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,221
You know what the best part
of my day is?

1514
01:43:21,353 --> 01:43:25,646
For about ten seconds, from when I pull
up to the kerb and when I get to your door.

1515
01:43:25,773 --> 01:43:27,812
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there
and I'll knock on the door...

1516
01:43:27,942 --> 01:43:30,479
and you won't be there.

1517
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:34,026
No "goodbye," no "see ya later. "
No nothin'. You just left.

1518
01:43:35,781 --> 01:43:39,399
I don't know much, but I know that.

1519
01:43:50,878 --> 01:43:53,084
This is a disaster, Sean.

1520
01:43:53,213 --> 01:43:55,786
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy.

1521
01:43:55,923 --> 01:43:57,999
- Not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy, Gerry.

1522
01:43:58,134 --> 01:44:01,585
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy! I
don't care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense.

1523
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,258
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1524
01:44:04,389 --> 01:44:07,425
- Undermine?
- This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1525
01:44:07,558 --> 01:44:10,642
I do understand. He is at a fragile
point, okay? He's got problems.

1526
01:44:10,769 --> 01:44:14,268
Well, what problems does he have, Sean? That he's
better off as a janitor? That he's better off in jail?

1527
01:44:14,397 --> 01:44:17,314
Better off hanging out with a bunch
of retarded gorillas?

1528
01:44:17,442 --> 01:44:21,355
Oh, why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Do you have any fuckin' clue why? Hmm?

1529
01:44:21,487 --> 01:44:24,902
He can handle the problems. He can handle
the work, and he obviously handled you.

1530
01:44:25,031 --> 01:44:29,111
Gerry, listen to me. Listen. Why is he
hiding? Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1531
01:44:29,243 --> 01:44:32,612
Because the first thing that happened to him, he was
abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.

1532
01:44:32,746 --> 01:44:35,118
- Oh, come on, don't give me that Freudian crap.
- Oh, no, listen, Gerry.

1533
01:44:35,248 --> 01:44:38,118
And why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1534
01:44:38,251 --> 01:44:42,034
Because any one of them, if you asked them to,
would take a fuckin' bat to your head. Okay?

1535
01:44:42,171 --> 01:44:44,080
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1536
01:44:44,214 --> 01:44:48,163
And who is he handling? He pushes people
away before they have a chance to leave him.

1537
01:44:48,301 --> 01:44:50,792
It's a defence mechanism, all right?

1538
01:44:50,928 --> 01:44:53,466
And for 20 years he's been alone
because of that.

1539
01:44:53,597 --> 01:44:56,302
And if you push him right now, it's
gonna be the same thing all over again.

1540
01:44:56,433 --> 01:44:58,306
And I'm not gonna let
that happen to him.

1541
01:44:58,435 --> 01:45:00,094
- Now, don't you do that, Sean.
- What, Gerry?

1542
01:45:00,228 --> 01:45:03,098
Don't you do that. Don't infect him
with the idea that it's okay to quit.

1543
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,147
That it's okay to be a failure,
because it's not okay, Sean.

1544
01:45:06,274 --> 01:45:09,857
And if you're angry at me for being, being
successful, for being what you could have been, Sean...

1545
01:45:09,986 --> 01:45:12,773
- I'm not angry at you, Gerry.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean.

1546
01:45:12,905 --> 01:45:17,151
You resent me. But I'm not gonna
apologize for any, any success I've had.

1547
01:45:17,284 --> 01:45:19,821
You're angry at me for doing what
you could have done.

1548
01:45:19,953 --> 01:45:24,199
But ask yourself, Sean. Ask yourself
if you want Will to feel that way.

1549
01:45:24,331 --> 01:45:27,616
- If you want him to feel like a failure.
- Oh, you arrogant shit!

1550
01:45:27,751 --> 01:45:30,324
That's why I don't come
to the goddam reunions.

1551
01:45:30,462 --> 01:45:32,335
'Cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

1552
01:45:32,463 --> 01:45:35,333
- You know, that condescending embarrassed look?
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1553
01:45:35,466 --> 01:45:37,505
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1554
01:45:37,634 --> 01:45:40,551
And I'm proud of what I do.
It was a conscious choice.

1555
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:42,386
I didn't fuck up.

1556
01:45:42,513 --> 01:45:44,802
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1557
01:45:44,932 --> 01:45:48,632
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around
going, "The Field's medal! The Field's medal!"

1558
01:45:48,769 --> 01:45:51,853
Why are you still so fuckin' afraid
of failure?

1559
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:55,680
It's about my medal, is it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1560
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:59,149
Oh, please don't. You know... You know what, Gerry?
Shove the medal up your fuckin' ass, all right?

1561
01:45:59,278 --> 01:46:03,357
'Cause I don't give a shit about your medal because
I knew you before you were a mathematical god.

1562
01:46:03,489 --> 01:46:07,024
When you were pimple-faced and homesick, and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1563
01:46:07,159 --> 01:46:08,950
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1564
01:46:09,077 --> 01:46:11,153
So don't blame me for how your life
turned out. It's not my fault.

1565
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:15,201
I don't blame you. It's not about you,
you mathematical dick!

1566
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:17,870
It's about the boy.
He's a good kid.

1567
01:46:18,002 --> 01:46:21,370
And I won't see you fuck him up like
you're trying to fuck up me right now.

1568
01:46:21,505 --> 01:46:24,078
I won't see you make him feel
like a failure, too.

1569
01:46:24,215 --> 01:46:27,050
- He won't be a failure, Sean!
- But, but if you push him, Gerry...

1570
01:46:27,176 --> 01:46:30,011
- If you ride him...
- Sean, I am what I am today...

1571
01:46:30,137 --> 01:46:33,387
because I was pushed and
because I learned to push myself.

1572
01:46:33,515 --> 01:46:35,887
He's not you! Do you get that?

1573
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:41,061
- I can come back.
- No, come in. Uh...

1574
01:46:41,188 --> 01:46:43,595
I was just leaving.

1575
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:57,572
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way
between me and him.

1576
01:46:57,702 --> 01:46:59,908
You know. Not about you.

1577
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:08,535
- What is that?
- This is your file.

1578
01:47:08,669 --> 01:47:11,041
I have to send it back to the judge
for evaluation.

1579
01:47:11,172 --> 01:47:13,958
Oh.

1580
01:47:14,091 --> 01:47:16,249
Hey, you're not gonna fail me, are you?

1581
01:47:20,012 --> 01:47:21,886
What's it say?

1582
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:25,429
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1583
01:47:28,895 --> 01:47:31,101
Have you had any, uh, experience
with that?

1584
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:34,764
Twenty years of counselling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1585
01:47:35,734 --> 01:47:39,149
I mean, have you had any experience
with that?

1586
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,606
Personally?

1587
01:47:45,742 --> 01:47:47,735
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I have.

1588
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:50,781
It sure ain't good.

1589
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:59,287
My father was an alcoholic.
Mean, fuckin' drunk.

1590
01:48:00,838 --> 01:48:03,755
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1591
01:48:03,883 --> 01:48:07,334
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't
go after my mother and little brother.

1592
01:48:09,346 --> 01:48:11,967
Interesting nights
were when he wore his rings.

1593
01:48:13,808 --> 01:48:17,259
Yeah, he used to just put
a, uh, a wrench...

1594
01:48:17,394 --> 01:48:20,098
a stick and a belt
on the table...

1595
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:22,518
and just say, "Choose. "

1596
01:48:22,649 --> 01:48:24,308
Well, I gotta go with the belt
there, then.

1597
01:48:24,442 --> 01:48:28,486
- I used to go with the wrench.
- Why the wrench?

1598
01:48:28,612 --> 01:48:30,688
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1599
01:48:30,822 --> 01:48:34,155
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1600
01:48:34,283 --> 01:48:39,277
So, uh, you know, what is it? Like Will has
an attachment disorder? Ls it all that stuff?

1601
01:48:40,914 --> 01:48:43,487
Fear of abandonment?

1602
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:46,827
Is that why, uh, is that why
I broke up with Skylar?

1603
01:48:46,961 --> 01:48:50,294
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1604
01:48:50,422 --> 01:48:52,498
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1605
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:59,083
Hey, Will?

1606
01:48:59,221 --> 01:49:01,260
I don't know a lot.

1607
01:49:02,641 --> 01:49:05,724
But you see this?
All this shit?

1608
01:49:10,814 --> 01:49:12,723
This is not your fault.

1609
01:49:14,818 --> 01:49:17,189
Yeah, I know that.

1610
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:19,193
Look at me, son.

1611
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:22,814
It's not your fault.

1612
01:49:22,949 --> 01:49:27,361
- I know.
- No. It's not your fault.

1613
01:49:30,164 --> 01:49:32,370
- I know.
- No, no, you don't.

1614
01:49:32,499 --> 01:49:34,705
It's not your fault.

1615
01:49:36,711 --> 01:49:38,502
- I know.
- It's not your fault.

1616
01:49:38,629 --> 01:49:41,665
- All right.
- It's not your fault.

1617
01:49:44,509 --> 01:49:46,383
It's not your fault.

1618
01:49:46,511 --> 01:49:48,420
Don't fuck with me.

1619
01:49:51,265 --> 01:49:54,052
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me. All right?

1620
01:49:54,184 --> 01:49:57,220
- Don't fuck with me, Sean. Not you.
- It's not your fault.

1621
01:50:06,528 --> 01:50:09,101
It's not your fault.

1622
01:50:14,118 --> 01:50:15,991
Oh, my God!

1623
01:50:17,203 --> 01:50:21,117
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, God.

1624
01:50:35,803 --> 01:50:37,711
Fuck them, okay?

1625
01:52:04,169 --> 01:52:06,494
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm, uh, Will Hunting.

1626
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:10,413
- I'm here about a position.
- Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1627
01:52:14,302 --> 01:52:17,837
Yes, there's a Mr Hunting in the lobby.
He's here for his appointment.

1628
01:52:37,822 --> 01:52:39,861
Which one did you take?

1629
01:52:39,991 --> 01:52:44,735
I was over at, uh, McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1630
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:49,198
Uh, I haven't told him yet, but I went, I
went down there and I talked to my boss, and...

1631
01:52:49,332 --> 01:52:52,285
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1632
01:52:52,418 --> 01:52:55,371
Is that what you want?

1633
01:52:55,504 --> 01:52:58,208
Yeah, you know, I think so.

1634
01:52:58,339 --> 01:53:01,423
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1635
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:03,424
Thanks.

1636
01:53:06,555 --> 01:53:08,428
Time's up.

1637
01:53:11,434 --> 01:53:14,553
So that's, so that's it?
So we're, we're done?

1638
01:53:14,687 --> 01:53:17,391
Yeah, that's it.

1639
01:53:17,522 --> 01:53:19,894
You're done. You're a free man.

1640
01:53:21,692 --> 01:53:26,318
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that...

1641
01:53:26,446 --> 01:53:28,320
You're welcome, Will.

1642
01:53:33,744 --> 01:53:36,745
So, you know, I, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1643
01:53:36,872 --> 01:53:39,197
Yeah, me, too.

1644
01:53:39,332 --> 01:53:41,953
I'll be travelling around a bit,
and it'll be a little hard, but, uh...

1645
01:53:42,085 --> 01:53:45,749
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1646
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:49,330
So, here's the number.

1647
01:53:49,466 --> 01:53:52,003
You call that, and I'll
get back to you right away.

1648
01:53:53,761 --> 01:53:56,548
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1649
01:53:56,680 --> 01:54:00,013
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1650
01:54:02,727 --> 01:54:05,099
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

1651
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:10,106
Yeah.

1652
01:54:10,233 --> 01:54:12,309
- Thank you, Sean.
- Yeah.

1653
01:54:12,444 --> 01:54:14,436
Thank you, Will.

1654
01:54:16,155 --> 01:54:19,405
Hey, does this violate the, uh,
patient-doctor relationship?

1655
01:54:19,533 --> 01:54:21,739
Nah. Only if you grab my ass.

1656
01:54:25,455 --> 01:54:27,661
- Take care.
- You, too.

1657
01:54:27,790 --> 01:54:29,663
Yeah.

1658
01:54:31,626 --> 01:54:33,500
Hey.

1659
01:54:33,628 --> 01:54:35,953
Good luck, son.

1660
01:54:47,098 --> 01:54:49,137
Two beers!

1661
01:54:53,395 --> 01:54:56,644
- What's up? Did you guys go?
- No. I had to talk him down.

1662
01:54:56,773 --> 01:54:58,397
Why didn't you yoke him?

1663
01:54:58,524 --> 01:55:00,730
Uh, little Morgan's got
a lot of scrap to him.

1664
01:55:00,859 --> 01:55:04,026
You know, people try to whip his ass
every week. Fuckin' kid won't back down.

1665
01:55:04,154 --> 01:55:08,945
- What are you sayin' about me?
- Was I talkin' to you? Mind your fuckin' business.

1666
01:55:09,867 --> 01:55:12,274
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers.

1667
01:55:12,411 --> 01:55:14,569
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1668
01:55:14,704 --> 01:55:18,203
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch? Fuckin' come on.

1669
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:21,368
- Come on. I got ya first.
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1670
01:55:21,502 --> 01:55:23,625
- All right, who's first?
- Come on, motherfucker.

1671
01:55:23,754 --> 01:55:27,371
- All right. Who's first? Come on. Who's first?
- Oh, Danny boy

1672
01:55:27,507 --> 01:55:29,499
Here's your present.

1673
01:55:31,052 --> 01:55:32,594
- Come on, brother.
- What?

1674
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:36,468
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1675
01:55:36,598 --> 01:55:41,176
And, anyway, I wasn't gonna
fuckin' drive you every day, so...

1676
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:42,970
- Fuckin' can't be.
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

1677
01:55:43,103 --> 01:55:45,345
That's not what I was sayin'.

1678
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,805
But, uh, 21 now, so...

1679
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:51,440
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for you, kid, was a car.

1680
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:53,894
- How do you like it?
- This is like...

1681
01:55:56,657 --> 01:56:00,701
This is the ugliest fuckin' car
I ever seen in my life.

1682
01:56:00,827 --> 01:56:03,946
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1683
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:06,321
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts...

1684
01:56:06,456 --> 01:56:09,790
and, uh, Morgan was out
panhandlin' for change every day.

1685
01:56:09,918 --> 01:56:13,084
- I had the router do all the bodywork.
- Yeah, I have a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1686
01:56:13,212 --> 01:56:16,296
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1687
01:56:16,423 --> 01:56:17,882
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1688
01:56:18,008 --> 01:56:20,084
Yeah, had one.
Now I'm fucked again.

1689
01:56:20,218 --> 01:56:23,384
- So what is it, a lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1690
01:56:23,513 --> 01:56:25,552
Me and Bill rebuilt this engine
ourselves here.

1691
01:56:25,681 --> 01:56:28,765
It's a good car, dude.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1692
01:56:29,684 --> 01:56:33,183
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1693
01:56:41,653 --> 01:56:43,562
Hi.

1694
01:56:43,696 --> 01:56:45,689
Come on in.

1695
01:56:48,367 --> 01:56:51,284
- Sean, I, um...
- Me, too, Gerry.

1696
01:56:52,829 --> 01:56:54,738
Yeah. Good.

1697
01:56:56,749 --> 01:56:58,457
- I heard you're takin' some time.
- Yeah.

1698
01:56:58,584 --> 01:57:02,711
I'll travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1699
01:57:02,837 --> 01:57:04,711
So where are you going?

1700
01:57:04,839 --> 01:57:08,753
India and China and Baltimore.

1701
01:57:10,511 --> 01:57:12,550
Oh.

1702
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:18,099
- You know when you'll be back?
- Well, I got this flyer the other day.

1703
01:57:18,225 --> 01:57:21,179
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1704
01:57:21,311 --> 01:57:23,185
Yeah, I got one of those, too.

1705
01:57:23,313 --> 01:57:25,056
Why don't you come?
I'll buy you a drink.

1706
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:27,933
The drinks at those things are free.

1707
01:57:28,067 --> 01:57:31,601
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1708
01:57:35,824 --> 01:57:38,361
Oh.

1709
01:57:38,492 --> 01:57:41,065
How about a drink right now?

1710
01:57:41,203 --> 01:57:42,946
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1711
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,405
Come on. This one's on me.

1712
01:57:48,209 --> 01:57:50,332
- Got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh.

1713
01:57:50,461 --> 01:57:52,619
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1714
01:57:53,797 --> 01:57:56,288
This is my ticket to paradise.

1715
01:57:56,424 --> 01:57:58,298
Sean, do you know what the odds are
against winning the lottery?

1716
