1
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,514
'Cause the way you drive is wrong! See?

2
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,723
You really a badass, cowboy, or you just talk like one?

3
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,189
You call that drifting?

4
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:10,899
That's for selling me a broken iPod!

5
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,873
Not bad.

6
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:36,212
Hey Han...

7
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:38,679
Take a look at this.

8
00:56:42,324 --> 00:56:43,791
You have a visitor.

9
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:33,303
Uncle.

10
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:38,445
Uncle Kamata, I was just about to go see you.

11
01:06:40,222 --> 01:06:41,782
Have you been well?

12
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:43,980
Yes.

13
01:06:44,726 --> 01:06:45,785
Here's last week's take.

14
01:06:47,996 --> 01:06:50,397
Business good?

15
01:06:51,698 --> 01:06:52,398
Yes.

16
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:54,490
Please.

17
01:07:05,013 --> 01:07:06,913
To tell you the truth...

18
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,449
I look over these printouts of yours...

19
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:17,317
and I don't understand half of what l'm looking at.

20
01:07:19,294 --> 01:07:21,660
lt looks more complicated than it is.

21
01:07:23,932 --> 01:07:28,301
Then how is it even I am able to figure out...

22
01:07:30,272 --> 01:07:35,266
that your partner is stealing from us?

23
01:07:39,214 --> 01:07:40,647
Even if that were true...

24
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:45,818
lt couldn't have been much, uncle. I would've caught it.

25
01:07:50,258 --> 01:07:52,317
There's an old saying:

26
01:07:54,129 --> 01:07:56,097
For want of a nail...

27
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,522
the horseshoe was lost.

28
01:08:00,101 --> 01:08:03,502
For want of a horseshoe, the steed was lost.

29
01:08:04,606 --> 01:08:06,506
For want of a steed...

30
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:09,735
the message was not delivered.

31
01:08:11,513 --> 01:08:13,310
For want of an undelivered message...

32
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,850
the war was lost.

33
01:08:34,035 --> 01:08:38,232
I miss your father.

34
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:38,841
Get in.

35
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:07,316
l'd like to see Mr. Kamata, please.

36
01:21:54,902 --> 01:21:56,631
Who's your friend?

37
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,261
Nobody.

38
01:22:00,307 --> 01:22:01,399
I can handle this.

39
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:05,809
I have something which belongs to you, sir.

40
01:22:48,155 --> 01:22:50,123
Don't listen to this gaijin.

41
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:52,516
Takashi...

42
01:22:54,028 --> 01:22:56,656
after everything you've done, you're giving me orders?

43
01:22:56,964 --> 01:22:58,158
I apologize.

44
01:34:55,548 --> 01:34:57,379
You're free to go.
