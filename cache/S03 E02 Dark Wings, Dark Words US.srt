1
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,121
Don't think too much, Bran.

2
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,708
Relax your bow arm.

3
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,844
And which one of you
was a marksman at ten?

4
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,846
Father?

5
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,107
-You can't kill it, you know.
-Why not?

6
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,195
Because the raven is you.

7
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,292
-Hodor.
-It's all right, Hodor.

8
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,045
Hodor.

9
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,052
Were you inside the wolf again,
Little Lord?

10
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,803
No.

11
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,973
It was the three-eyed raven. He's back.

12
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,102
I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.

13
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,229
-There was a boy--
-I don't want to hear about it.

14
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,690
-But you asked.
-We've got plenty of worries.

15
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,193
We don't need
to pour black magic on top of them.

16
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,404
I didn't ask for black magic dreams.

17
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:00,740
I know you didn't, Little Lord.

18
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,868
We need to move.

19
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,371
We don't know who might be after us.

20
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,498
No one even knows we're alive.

21
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,543
And who told you that?
The three-eyed raven tell you?

22
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,921
-No.
-Some good he is, then.

23
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,551
I don't know what other people know
and what they don't.

24
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,471
I only know the Wall is a long way off.

25
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,026
My mother always told me
you Westerosi were a grim lot.

26
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:43,449
Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians

27
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,578
that would row across the Narrow Sea
and steal us from our beds.

28
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,456
Did you ever think you'd marry one?

29
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,877
I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.

30
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,587
Never?

31
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:03,302
Not until I met the king
of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.

32
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,644
Pardon me, Your Grace.

33
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,023
-My Queen.
-Lord Bolton.

34
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,694
Let me guess which one is the good news.

35
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,324
Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.

36
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,915
I hadn't seen him in years.

37
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,919
I don't even know how many.

38
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,215
We'll travel to the funeral together.

39
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,135
Lord Bolton will garrison here
until we return.

40
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,723
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

41
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,606
Something else?

42
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,278
By the time Bolton's bastard
got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.

43
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,283
They massacred everyone
and put the castle to the torch.

44
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,622
And Bran and Rickon have not been found.

45
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,294
And they may have escaped.

46
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,673
Or Theon may have taken them back
to the Iron Islands as hostages.

47
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,258
Have you received any demands?

48
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,220
No.

49
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,347
Have you heard anything from Theon at all?

50
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,829
Where am I?

51
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,170
Who are you?

52
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,638
-What do you want?
-I want to do this.

53
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,605
Do you know how long it's going
to take us to get to King's Landing

54
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,941
-walking through fields and forests?
-Yes.

55
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,862
So, how shall we pass the time?

56
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,905
By putting one foot in front of the other.

57
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,699
It's going to be a very dull walk.

58
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,617
I'm here to take you to King's Landing

59
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,995
and bring back
Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.

60
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,038
Dull is fine.

61
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,791
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

62
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,919
no one enjoys
the company of a humorless mute.

63
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,421
Trust me on this.

64
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,590
People have been serving me
since I was born.

65
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,427
You think Lady Stark
is going to want a giant towheaded plank

66
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,554
following her around
for the rest of her life?

67
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,472
A week's journey with you

68
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,183
and she'll order you
to fall on your sword.

69
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,603
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

70
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,271
I'm sure she'll let me know.

71
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,983
-She's an honest woman.
-All the good it's done her.

72
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,742
How did you come
into Lady Stark's service?

73
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,162
-There's something we can talk about.
-Not your concern, Kingslayer.

74
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,415
It had to be recently.
You weren't with her at Winterfell.

75
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,168
How would you know?

76
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,170
Because I visited Winterfell.

77
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,465
I would have noticed your dour head
smacking into the archways.

78
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,051
Move.

79
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,516
-Were you pledged to Stannis?
-Gods, no.

80
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,645
Renly. Really?

81
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,857
He wasn't fit to rule over anything
more important than a 12-course meal.

82
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,400
-Shut your mouth.
-Why?

83
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,195
I lived with him at court
since he was a boy, don't forget.

84
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,781
Could hardly escape the little tulip.

85
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,825
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

86
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,329
-I knew him far better than you.
-I knew him as well as anyone.

87
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,999
As a member of his Kingsguard,
he trusted me with everything.

88
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,709
He would have been a wonderful king.

89
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,213
-Sounds like you quite fancied him.
-I did not fancy him.

90
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,131
Gods, you did.

91
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,593
-Did you ever tell him?
-No, of course not.

92
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,056
You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.

93
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,143
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

94
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,853
You're far too much man for him.

95
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,274
-I'm not interested in foul rumors.
-Unless they're about me.

96
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,526
It's all true about Renly.

97
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,904
His proclivities
were the worst kept secret at court.

98
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,365
It's a shame
the throne isn't made out of cocks.

99
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,742
-They'd have never got him off it.
-Shut your mouth!

100
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,331
I don't blame him.
And I don't blame you, either.

101
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,918
We don't get to choose who we love.

102
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,765
-Where are you headed, then?
-South.

103
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,767
-You?
-Riverrun.

104
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,687
Staying off the kingsroad, are you?

105
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,649
They get you no matter where you go.
You can't win.

106
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,819
-No, you really can't.
-Looks like you're safe enough, though.

107
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,531
Meaning no offense, My Lady, but…
I wouldn't tangle with you.

108
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,452
-Seven blessings to you.
-And you.

109
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,627
He knows who I am.

110
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,421
-He doesn't.
-Maybe you're right.

111
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,923
But what if you're not?
What if he tells someone?

112
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,597
We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.

113
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,433
More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?

114
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,780
Make it tighter here.

115
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,075
That's better.

116
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,704
-It makes you look very strong.
-No flowers.

117
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,998
I said no flowers.

118
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,961
-All these are wrong. Bring others.
-Yes, Your Grace.

119
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,050
Flowers! On the king.

120
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,886
Looks like a Tyrell rose.

121
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,764
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.

122
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,141
Should be more than enough fabric.

123
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,482
Tell me what you think of her.

124
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,443
-Who?
-Margaery.

125
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,570
She's an ideal match.

126
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,366
With the Tyrells beside us,
we'll crush the Northerners.

127
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,161
Hang their lords, burn their strongholds,

128
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,163
sow their fields with salt,

129
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,916
and no one will think
of rebelling for another century.

130
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,962
It is a good match,
but what do you think of her?

131
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,844
She's beautiful and intelligent.

132
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,721
Yes, she is.

133
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,349
Her concern with the well-being
of the common people is interesting.

134
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,852
Not to me.

135
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,356
I only meant that to go out
of your way to endanger yourself--

136
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,110
This is becoming one of the most boring
conversations I've ever had.

137
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,284
Margaery Tyrell dotes
on filthy urchins for a reason.

138
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,454
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.

139
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,250
She married a traitor and known degenerate
like Renly Baratheon for a reason.

140
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,128
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

141
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,799
That's what intelligent women do…
what they're told.

142
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,848
-You need to ask yourself what--
-I don't need to do anything.

143
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,736
Better.

144
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,364
Much better.

145
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,911
I still don't believe it.
He didn't. He didn't want anything.

146
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,247
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

147
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,127
Men only want one thing
from a pretty girl.

148
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,632
Littlefinger's not in love with me.

149
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,720
Love is not the thing he wants.

150
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,184
-He's too old.
-They never see it that way.

151
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,608
He didn't ask you to do something for him?

152
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,569
-Spy on someone or…
-No.

153
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,580
If he does ask you
for anything or try anything,

154
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,750
or touch you, I want you to tell me.

155
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,128
Why? What will you do?

156
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,506
I will make him stop.

157
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,593
Ser Loras Tyrell, My Lady.

158
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,263
Send him in.

159
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,191
-Lady Sansa.
-Ser Loras.

160
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,735
My sister Margaery invites you
to take the air with her

161
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,071
and our grandmother
the Lady Olenna in the gardens.

162
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,574
May I escort you to them?

163
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,584
I believe you grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

164
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,836
You are too kind, Ser Loras.

165
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,675
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

166
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,054
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

167
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,935
-A rose, a red rose.
-Of course, I did.

168
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,190
It's more your color. You take it.

169
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,109
Thank you.

170
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,613
-You're such a dear.
-I'll take my leave.

171
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,575
-Lady Sansa.
-Thank you, Ser Loras.

172
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,328
Come.

173
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,671
Lady Sansa, it is my honor
to present my grandmother…

174
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,342
the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.

175
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,218
Kiss me, child.

176
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,514
It's so good of you to visit me
and my foolish flock of hens.

177
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,767
We're very sorry for your losses.

178
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,729
And I was sorry when I heard
of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

179
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,231
-He was very gallant.
-Gallant, yes.

180
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,816
And charming and very clean.

181
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,860
He knew how to dress and smile

182
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,738
and somehow this gave him
the notion he was fit to be king.

183
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,784
Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.
Father liked him and so did Loras.

184
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,496
Loras is young and very good
at knocking men off horses with a stick.

185
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,206
That does not make him wise.

186
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,416
As to your fathead father…

187
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,461
Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?

188
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,338
She might think
we have some wits about us.

189
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,881
One of us, at any rate.

190
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,967
It was treason. I warned them.

191
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,221
Robert has two sons
and Renly has an older brother.

192
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:16,350
How could he possibly have any claim
to that ugly iron chair?

193
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,812
We should have stayed well out
of all this if you ask me.

194
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,189
But once the cow's been milked,

195
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,608
there's no squirting the cream
back up her udders.

196
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,610
So, here we are to see things through.

197
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,570
What do you say to that, Sansa?

198
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,490
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

199
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,369
-Lemon cake's my favorite.
-So we've been told.

200
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,289
Are you going to bring the food
or do you mean to starve us to death?

201
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,377
Here, Sansa. Come sit with me.

202
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm much less boring than these others.

203
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,301
Do you know my son?

204
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,348
-The Lord of Highgarden?
-I haven't had the pleasure.

205
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,394
No great pleasure, believe me.
A ponderous oaf.

206
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,187
His father was an oaf as well.

207
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,648
My husband, the late Lord Luthor.

208
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,943
He managed to ride off
a cliff whilst hawking.

209
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,612
They say he was looking up at the sky

210
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,323
and paying no mind
to where his horse was taking him.

211
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,285
And now my son is doing the same,

212
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,871
only this time he's riding a lion
instead of a horse.

213
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,081
Now…

214
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:27,838
I want you to tell me the truth
about this royal boy, this Joffrey.

215
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,050
-I… I…
-You, you.

216
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,052
Who else would know better?

217
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,513
We've heard some troubling tales.

218
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,515
Is there any truth to them?

219
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,268
Has this boy mistreated you?

220
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,480
Has he ripped out your tongue?

221
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:50,444
Joff-- King Joffrey, he…
His Grace is very fair

222
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:55,908
-and handsome and as brave as a lion.
-Yes, all Lannisters are lions.

223
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,620
And when a Tyrell farts,
it smells like a rose.

224
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,625
But how kind is he? How clever?
Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?

225
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,920
I'm to be his wife.
I only want to know what that means.

226
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,304
Bring me some cheese.

227
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,015
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, My Lady.

228
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,518
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

229
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,769
And I want it served now.

230
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,318
Are you frightened, child?
No need for that.

231
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,779
We're only women here.

232
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,199
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

233
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,494
My father always told the truth.

234
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,580
Yes, he had that reputation.

235
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,916
And they named him traitor
and took his head.

236
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,501
Joffrey.

237
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,170
Joffrey did that.

238
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,258
He promised he would be merciful
and he cut my father's head off.

239
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,218
And he said that was mercy.

240
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,763
Then he took me up on the walls
and made me look at it.

241
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,352
Go on.

242
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,065
I… I can't. I never meant…

243
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,569
My father was a traitor.
My brother as well.

244
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,780
I have traitor's blood.
Please don't make me say anymore.

245
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,824
She's terrified, Grandmother.
Just look at her.

246
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,159
Speak freely, child.

247
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,746
We would never betray your confidence,
I swear it.

248
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,209
He's a monster.

249
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,717
-That's a pity.
-Please, don't stop the wedding.

250
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,429
Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

251
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,015
is determined
that Margaery shall be queen.

252
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,642
Even so, we thank you for the truth.

253
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,354
Here comes my cheese.

254
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,749
We're at war. This march is a distraction.

255
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,419
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

256
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,796
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?

257
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,882
-No.
-Then it's a distraction.

258
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,970
My Uncle Edmure has his forces
garrisoned there. We need his men.

259
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,806
Unless he's been breeding them,

260
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,726
he don't have enough to make a difference.

261
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,478
Have you lost faith in our cause?

262
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,315
If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.

263
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,653
-If you no longer believe…
-I can believe till it snows in Dorne.

264
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,073
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

265
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,035
You don't think we can win?

266
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,163
May I speak my mind, Your Grace?

267
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:50,874
Have you not been speaking your mind,
Lord Karstark?

268
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,505
I think you lost this war
the day you married her.

269
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,474
Whoa, whoa.

270
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,437
-Your Grace.
-You're afraid of her.

271
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,358
-And she knows it.
-I'm not afraid of her.

272
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,371
-May I help you, Lady Stark?
-No.

273
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,083
I'm sorry, I shouldn't--

274
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,170
You can't help because a mother makes one
for her children, to protect them.

275
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,425
Only a mother can make them.

276
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,100
You've made them before?

277
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,603
Twice.

278
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,940
Did they work?

279
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,235
After a fashion.

280
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,241
I prayed for my son, Bran,
to survive his fall.

281
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,624
Many years before that,
one of the boys came down with the pox.

282
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,088
Maester Luwin said if he made it
through the night, he'd live.

283
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,799
But it would be a very long night.

284
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,847
So, I sat with him
all through the darkness.

285
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,392
Listened to his ragged little breaths,

286
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,479
his coughing, his whimpering.

287
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,231
Which boy?

288
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,109
Jon Snow.

289
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,782
When my husband
brought that baby home from the war,

290
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,492
I couldn't bear to look at him.

291
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:54,414
I didn't want to see those brown
stranger's eyes staring up at me.

292
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:59,336
So, I prayed to the Gods.
Take him away. Make him die.

293
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,091
He got the pox.

294
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,972
And I knew I was the worst woman
who ever lived.

295
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,810
A murderer.

296
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,941
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child to a horrible death,

297
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,361
all because I was jealous of his mother.

298
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,280
A woman he didn't even know.

299
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,784
So, I prayed to all seven Gods,

300
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,537
let the boy live.

301
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,081
Let him live,

302
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,375
and I'll love him.

303
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,044
I'll be a mother to him.

304
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll beg my husband
to give him a true name,

305
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,718
to call him Stark and be done with it,

306
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,013
-to make him one of us.
-And he lived.

307
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,558
And he lived.

308
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,646
And I couldn't keep my promise.

309
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,862
And everything
that's happened since then…

310
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,575
all this horror
that's come to my family…

311
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,747
it's all because I couldn't love
a motherless child.

312
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,595
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?

313
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,349
-Yes.
-You liked him?

314
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,812
I like you,
but if you're playing us false,

315
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,647
it won't be hard for me to kill you.

316
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,691
I've got wildling blood in my veins.

317
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,194
-These are my people.
-I understand.

318
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,571
Well, how could you understand?

319
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,699
You want to protect your people.

320
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,911
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

321
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,623
half of whom want to massacre
the other half for one insult or another?

322
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,793
They speak seven different languages
in my army.

323
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,296
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.

324
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,049
The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.

325
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,884
Everyone hates the cave people.

326
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,679
So, you know how I got moon worshippers

327
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,475
and cannibals and giants
to march together in the same army?

328
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,435
No.

329
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,564
I told them we were all going
to die if we don't get south.

330
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,067
Because that's the truth.

331
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,622
Shouldn't be long now.

332
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,551
What's wrong with him?

333
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,054
He's a warg.

334
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,516
He can enter the mind of animals,
see through their eyes.

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,144
-He's scouting for us.
-But you've never met a warg?

336
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,656
Orell.

337
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,334
Where were you this time?

338
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,259
The Fist of the First Men.

339
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,136
What did you see?

340
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,684
Dead crows.

341
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,364
What's the matter, Piggy?
You crying 'cause you're cold?

342
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,662
There's 200 brothers killed by dead men

343
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,666
and you're still here, whimpering.

344
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,961
That seem fair to you?

345
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,007
I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting

346
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,259
while you was off somewhere
hiding in a hole.

347
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,721
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while?

348
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,433
You know you want to.

349
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,243
Hey.

350
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,668
-Get up, Sam.
-No.

351
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,380
-Get up.
-I can't.

352
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,132
If you stop, you'll die.

353
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,220
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die too.

354
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,764
-You don't care.
-'Course we care.

355
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,724
You left me.

356
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,895
When the White Walkers came,
you left me.

357
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:13,191
Aye, we left you.
You're fat and you're slow.

358
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,193
We didn't want to die.

359
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,781
Help me get him up.

360
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,867
Looks like that piggy is done for.

361
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,286
-Help us get him up.
-He's slowing us down.

362
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,332
-Just get him up!
-Why? So, the rest of us can die?

363
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,420
We'll move faster without him.

364
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,006
What is this? Get up, Tarly.

365
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,636
-Is he all right?
-I think so.

366
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,221
'Cause if he can't,
we may as well just go without him.

367
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,222
That's enough.

368
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,474
Tarly.

369
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,018
I forbid you to die.

370
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,897
-Do you hear me?
-Why should the rest of us--

371
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,357
Rast…

372
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,775
You're responsible for him.

373
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,195
What am I supposed to do?

374
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,283
Make sure he gets back alive.
If he doesn't, you don't.

375
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,910
Move on!

376
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,004
I'm not dying for you, Piggy.
You hear me?

377
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,656
Where's Rickon and Hodor?

378
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,450
Looking for food.

379
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,539
What's out there?

380
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,049
Not another step, boy.

381
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,010
Unless you want
to drown in your own blood.

382
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,972
-I'm unarmed.
-That was poor planning.

383
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,100
My sister carries the weapons.

384
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm better with them.

385
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,565
Drop the spear.

386
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,944
Drop it.

387
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,285
If you kill me,
that wolf will tear you to bits.

388
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:17,875
You must be Summer.

389
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,610
I'm Jojen Reed.

390
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,946
This is my sister Meera.

391
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,078
We've come a long way to find you,
Brandon.

392
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,457
And we have much farther to go.

393
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,921
I'm just trying to understand.

394
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:08,593
-Would you please shut up about it?
-Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.

395
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,678
-I'm not listening.
-But just explain it to me.

396
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,598
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted.

397
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,059
Dead. All you had to do
was give him the names.

398
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,103
Anyone.
You could have picked King Joffrey.

399
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,980
-Shut up.
-You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

400
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,275
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal,
so why are you complaining?

401
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,985
But you could have ended the war.

402
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,780
-Where are we going?
-North.

403
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,075
If we were going north, we should've come
to the Red Fork River by now.

404
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,368
Maybe we already passed it.

405
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,705
It's a hundred feet wide.
How could we have passed it?

406
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,168
If we hit the Red Fork,
we can follow it west to Riverrun.

407
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,922
My mother grew up there.
My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us.

408
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,302
-Could be a minstrel.
-Shut up.

409
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,640
A lion still has claws…

410
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,266
A minstrel's got gold sometimes.

411
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,270
We could jump him, tie him up,
steal his gold, and buy some food.

412
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,859
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

413
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,862
That Lord of Castamere

414
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,951
But now the rains, weep o'er his hall

415
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,371
With no one there to hear

416
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,918
What's lurking behind that wall?

417
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,462
A lion? A wolf?

418
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,133
Just a dirty little cub, I think.

419
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,176
-Loose a few more shafts.
-Don't.

420
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,940
Put the sword down, girl.

421
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,026
You go on down the road.

422
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,112
Just keep on singing
so we know where you are.

423
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,449
Leave us be and I won't kill you.

424
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,747
Generous. You're a dangerous person.

425
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,624
I like dangerous people.

426
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,172
Why are your friends so shy?

427
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,383
What friends?

428
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,636
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

429
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,703
Three young ones on the run,
carrying castle-forged swords.

430
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,539
You escape from Harrenhal?

431
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,292
-Who are you?
-Thoros of Myr.

432
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,711
And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.

433
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,714
-No, who do you fight for?
-The Brotherhood without Banners.

434
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,468
Now, come along.

435
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,972
I wanna hear how two boys
and a very dangerous girl

436
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:04,227
-escaped Harrenhal.
-I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood?

437
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,021
That's who the Mountain
and them all were looking for.

438
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,691
-They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
-You've got nothing to fear from us, son.

439
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,402
The lords of Westeros want
to burn the countryside.

440
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,656
We're trying to save it. Now, come on.

441
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,742
We'll talk some more
over brown bread and stew.

442
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,786
And then you can go on your way.

443
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,754
Here's the thing, fat boy.

444
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,969
When I'm done talking,
that arrow's falling down

445
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,178
on your fat head.

446
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,765
So, I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

447
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,616
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

448
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,744
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

449
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,755
My lion.

450
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,717
We've spoken of this.

451
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,013
You cannot come here.

452
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,519
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

453
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,687
Did anyone see you?

454
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,606
-No.
-You sure?

455
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,317
My father does not make idle threats.

456
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,570
Having you killed
would be the high point of his week.

457
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,447
You have to be absolutely certain.

458
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,913
All right. What is this problem?

459
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,334
I'm worried about Sansa.

460
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:56,464
When she spoke with Lord Baelish,
his friend warned me about him.

461
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,633
Baelish doesn't have friends.

462
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,385
I don't know her name.

463
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,722
-Ros? The redhead?
-How do you know her?

464
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,309
I try to know as many people as I can.
You never know which one you'll need.

465
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,895
She's a whore.

466
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,856
Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental
about these things.

467
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,942
-You fucked her.
-Please.

468
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,029
All right, yes, I fucked her once.

469
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,908
Twice.

470
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:29,372
But since I met you, my lady,
I've been with no one else.

471
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,835
And was she good? Did you like her?

472
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,338
Not as much as I like you, obviously,

473
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,590
or she'd be the one
torturing me right now.

474
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,137
What did she say about Littlefinger?

475
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,059
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

476
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,980
Is there an idiot
in any village who trusts Littlefinger?

477
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,026
We have to protect her.

478
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,444
We can't.

479
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,072
Now that the Lannisters
have discarded her,

480
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,408
Sansa will have many suitors.

481
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,452
A great beauty with a very old name.

482
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,206
A great beauty? A great beauty?

483
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,917
Yes, she is, objectively, very.

484
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,962
Her face is quite pleasing…

485
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,132
to other men and to women,
people in general.

486
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,925
But not to me, of course.

487
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,012
I only have eyes for you.

488
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:32,268
-You pervert. You want her? This child?
-I don't even want to talk about her.

489
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,187
-But you are.
-Only because you're making me.

490
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,401
I didn't force you to open your mouth
and make words come out.

491
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,529
This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.

492
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,950
The cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.

493
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,704
Yes.

494
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,340
Now, do you think I'm cruel?

495
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,093
Only if you stop.

496
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,264
But you mustn't come here again.

497
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,519
Do you hear me?

498
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:22,651
You've come to a dangerous place.
Full of dangerous people.

499
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,864
Dangerous people.

500
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,377
-Lady Tyrell, My King.
-Send her in.

501
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,978
You wanted to see me, Your Grace?

502
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,064
I'm leaving on a hunting trip.

503
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:04,276
I just wanted to make sure
you had everything you need before I left.

504
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,364
That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.
I have everything I could want.

505
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,698
Good.

506
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,118
How are you finding life in the capital?

507
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,079
It must be quite a change
after Renly's camp.

508
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,539
A welcome one.

509
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,876
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

510
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,420
And the bedside of a traitor?

511
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,676
Is that a place for a lady?

512
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:30,970
Your Grace…

513
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,058
I tried to do my duty as a wife,
that is all.

514
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,228
What was your duty
to this traitor as you saw it?

515
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:43,274
The duty of any wife to any husband,
to provide him with children.

516
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,984
You failed to do this.

517
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,570
-Why?
-I…

518
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,117
I would not speak ill of the dead,
Your Grace.

519
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,912
You think one ought
to speak kindly of a traitor

520
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,706
merely because he's had a sword
put through his heart?

521
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,707
No.

522
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,418
I do beg your pardon.

523
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,338
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

524
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,132
Renly…

525
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,472
I don't believe he was interested
in the company of women.

526
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,310
What makes you say this?

527
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,107
Whenever I wanted
to make a child with him, he…

528
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,155
he had so many excuses,
so many late-night war councils.

529
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,490
He never wanted to try.

530
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,661
Except one evening,

531
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,750
after he'd had far too much wine
to drink, he suggested something.

532
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:52,468
Something that sounded very painful
and couldn't possibly result in children.

533
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,557
-Maybe the fault was with me. Maybe--
-No, he was a known…

534
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,268
degenerate.

535
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,231
It's such a relief
to hear you say so, Your Grace.

536
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,944
I've considered making his perversion
punishable by death.

537
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,822
As is your right.

538
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,452
You must do whatever you need to do.

539
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,416
You are the king.

540
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,293
Yes.

541
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,798
I am.

542
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,347
Do you like it?

543
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,516
I just had it made.

544
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,269
Probably one of the finest weapons
in the Seven Kingdoms.

545
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,105
It's beautiful.
Will you show me how it works?

546
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,655
It's a new design.
Much easier to load. There's no crank.

547
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,701
You use this lever to draw the string.

548
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,833
The bolt goes here.

549
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,214
And then you just aim…

550
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,552
and…

551
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,767
Would you take me hunting sometime?

552
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,939
Forgive me, Your Grace, I…
I know a hunt is no place for a woman--

553
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,149
It's not unheard of.

554
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,693
My father would never let me before…

555
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,695
You no longer belong to him.

556
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,990
Do you want to hold it?

557
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,908
May I? Please.

558
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,754
I imagine it must be so exciting
to squeeze your finger here and…

559
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,506
watch something die over there.

560
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,346
Could you do it?

561
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,225
Could you… kill something?

562
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,188
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

563
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,814
Yes.

564
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,901
Would you like to watch me?

565
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,615
Yes.

566
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,620
Stop! Stop!

567
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,789
-Tell us the truth.
-About what?

568
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,834
I don't know what you want!

569
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,920
I want the truth.

570
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,296
What truth?

571
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,298
Why'd you take Winterfell?

572
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,176
I took it to… I took it--

573
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,719
-Who gave the orders?
-No one.

574
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,513
-I took it on my own.
-Why?

575
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,473
To take the North while it was vulnerable.

576
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,225
What were you going
to do once you took it?

577
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,227
-Hold it. Rule it.
-Good.

578
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,896
Good. That's very good.

579
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,947
-Why did you do that? I told you.
-Why did you take Winterfell?

580
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,409
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

581
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:16,463
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I took it because I hated the Starks.

582
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,467
I hated them for holding me prisoner.
I wanted to hurt them.

583
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,559
What are you doing?

584
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,022
Please.

585
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,238
I'll tell you anything.

586
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,116
Just take it off.

587
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,411
Please. Please, just take it off.

588
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,423
-Your sister sent me.
-Yara?

589
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,641
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

590
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,811
No, don't go. Please, please.
No, please don't leave me.

591
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,063
Please, please.

592
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,149
Please, please don't go! Please.

593
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,693
Please. Don't leave me.

594
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,155
Please don't go.

595
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,287
Rickon, stay with us.

596
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,250
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.

597
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,305
You can get inside his head,
see through his eyes.

598
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,599
Only when I'm asleep.

599
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,643
That's how it begins
until you learn to control it.

600
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,436
You're a warg.

601
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:58,982
It's not just wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there's a--

602
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,151
-A three-eyed raven?
-You've seen it?

603
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,904
We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten?

604
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,698
Does it have anything to do with warging?

605
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,244
No, the raven is something different,
something deeper.

606
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,914
The raven brings the sight.

607
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,375
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

608
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,669
Or things that happened
long before you were born

609
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,922
or things that are happening right now
thousands of miles away.

610
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,341
What's he telling him?

611
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,176
Why don't you ask?

612
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,182
Isn't he ashamed, your brother,
needing you to protect him?

613
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,685
Where's the shame in that?

614
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,480
Any boy his age
who needs his sister to protect him

615
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,358
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

616
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,529
Some people will always need help.

617
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,991
That doesn't mean
they're not worth helping.

618
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,998
When my father died, I dreamt it.

619
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,543
You didn't dream it. You saw it.

620
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,630
-So did I.
-You have the sight, too?

621
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,596
When I told my father about your father,

622
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,766
for the first time in my life,
I saw him cry.

623
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,352
Your father is Howland Reed?

624
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,353
Yeah.

625
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,357
He saved my father's life
during the rebellion.

626
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,360
Your father told you about the rebellion?
Mine never did.

627
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,738
But I saw that too.

628
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:29,990
What else have you seen?

629
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,786
The only one thing that matters, you.

630
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,760
I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.

631
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,305
Not that I'm averse to drinking
from a puddle every now and again,

632
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,723
-you understand.
-I don't drink ale.

633
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,060
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

634
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,853
-Yeah!
-You see?

635
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,230
They've all suffered
through my bouts of sobriety.

636
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,940
It's very tedious for all concerned.

637
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,778
-Now, how did three children--
-We're not children.

638
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,323
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

639
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:15,410
untrained in the art of war,
escape from Harrenhal?

640
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,458
Gendry's a smith.
He was apprenticed in the armory.

641
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,336
A smith? Where'd you train?

642
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,677
-King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
-That criminal.

643
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,596
He charges twice as much
as every other armorer in the city.

644
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,348
That's because he's twice as good.

645
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,975
A smith and a salesman.

646
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,269
Gendry stole us weapons.

647
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,690
Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.

648
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,151
He knows how to use a sword
and so do I.

649
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,822
My brothers taught me.

650
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,219
To your brothers!

651
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,813
You can finish your meals before you go.

652
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,399
It may be a while before you see another.

653
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,026
-You'll free us?
-I gave you my word.

654
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,740
But before you go,

655
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,618
allow me to raise a cup, to--

656
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,828
-Hey!
-Hey!

657
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,999
Now, that is an uncommonly large person.

658
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,127
How does one manage to subdue
such an uncommonly large person?

659
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,880
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

660
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,507
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.

661
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,804
Not a man at all.

662
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,807
A Hound!

663
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,060
So good to see you again, Clegane.

664
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:05,896
Thoros?

665
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,940
The fuck you doing here?

666
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,943
Drinking and talking too much.
Same as ever.

667
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,738
A pretty prize, lads.

668
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,615
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

669
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,285
Girl.

670
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,082
What in seven hells are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

671
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,471
It's a tough decision,

672
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:44,100
take the bridge and risk being seen
or cross the great water.

673
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,353
Silence, Kingslayer.
Anyone can see us on the bridge,

674
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,815
but cross by water
and the current could take us

675
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,275
-or I could escape down the river.
-Good luck.

676
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,115
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

677
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,243
Which will she choose?

678
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,459
Gambler at heart.
Wouldn't have guessed.

679
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,378
Be quick about it.

680
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,720
-I need to rest.
-Get up.

681
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,223
I have these, you know,
on your feet when you walk too far.

682
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,599
-What do you call them?
-Get up now.

683
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,977
Corns. I never used to get corns.

684
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,771
Of course, I used to ride everywhere,

685
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,898
not march around
like a common foot soldier

686
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,359
wearing the same shit boots
for over a year.

687
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,361
This heel is ruined. There's no way--

688
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,164
I never understood why some knights felt
the need to carry two swords.

689
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,228
You move well…

690
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,942
for a great beast of a woman.

691
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,408
You shouldn't grimace before you lunge.
Gives away the game.

692
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:42,636
Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.

693
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,138
But if you don't kill me…

694
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,099
I'm going to kill you.

695
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,440
You're good.

696
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,984
Graceless, but good.

697
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,747
See? If you were willing to hurt me,
you might have had me there.

698
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,419
Looks like your woman's getting
the better of you.

699
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,172
-If you can call that a woman.
-We enjoy a good fight.

700
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,466
Gets our juices flowing.

701
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,594
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.

702
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,763
A bit gruesome for my taste.

703
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,559
-You sure he's the one?
-That's him, all right.

704
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:16,229
I saw him fight at the tourney
for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

705
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,816
Give the man his silver.

706
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,362
Let us go and my father will pay
you whatever you want.

707
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,823
Enough to buy me a new head?

708
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,702
If the King in the North hears
I had the Kingslayer

709
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,704
and let him go,
he'll be taking it right off.

710
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,998
I'd rather he takes yours.
