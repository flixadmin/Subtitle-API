171

in the back.

That could have come from anywhere.

173
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,511
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

174
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,750
If there were such documents...

175
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,592
that's not an admission.

176

Good idea.

178
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,557
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

This is all very interesting,

238
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,512

it'll sort of be sucking power from...

"Red Triangle Circus put on a swell show
with fierce lions.

00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,430
"Circus return for two-week...

321
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,919
"Kids will love..."

322
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,469
Thanks.

323
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,950
- It's cold!
- It's vichyssoise, sir.

324
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,117
It's supposed to be cold.

325
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,478
"Circus is back with a freak show.
May not be suitable for kids.

"and aquatic bird-boy."

329
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,588
Why are you now determined to prove...

330
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,188
that this Penguin is not what he seems?

331
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,952
Must you be
the only Ionely man-beast in town?

"The circus folded its tents yesterday...

freak-show performer vanished before...

"he could be questioned."

337
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,236
I suppose you feel better now, sir.

338
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,915
No.

339
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,071
Actually, I feel worse.

342
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,950
I think he knows who his parents are.

343
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,472
There's something else.

Penguin!

346
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,519
Can we get a statement from you?

347
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,074
So, Mr. Penguin...

348
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,594
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly.

349
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,799
I am a man.

350
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,193
I have a name.

351
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,310
Oswald Cobblepot!

352
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,196
Mr. Cobblepot, you'll never get a chance
to settle up with them?

353
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,709
True.

354
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,030
I was their number one son...

355
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,874
and they treated me like number two.

356
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,558
But it's human nature to fear...

357
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,793
the unusual.

358
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,837
Perhaps when I held...

359
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,031
my Tiffany baby rattle...

360
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,991
with a shiny flipper...

361
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,392
instead of five chubby digits...

362
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,793
they freaked.

363
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,431
But I forgive them.
