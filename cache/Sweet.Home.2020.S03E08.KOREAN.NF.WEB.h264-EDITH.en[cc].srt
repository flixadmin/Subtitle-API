[Hyun-su] I'll just kill

I'll let him enter me.

I'll go in there and hold out
till he burns to death.

Are you saying you'll die too?

[Eun-hyeok] I won't let you.

wouldn't it be harder to kill him?

[Sang-wook] That's right.

If I see Eun-yu first,

346

I'm going to turn her back.

It seems there isn't anywhere close by.
