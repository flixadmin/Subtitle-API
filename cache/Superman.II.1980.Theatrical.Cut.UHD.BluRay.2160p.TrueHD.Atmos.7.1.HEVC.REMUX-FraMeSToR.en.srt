1
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:22,274
Alert! Alert! Alert!

2
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:56,773
You three criminals have been caught...

3
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,104
...in a further act of seditious treason.

4
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,978
General Zod, your only feeling
was contempt for our society.

5
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,440
Your only desire was to command.

6
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:12,025
Ursa, the only feeling you showed
was for your vicious general.

7
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:15,703
Your only wish, to rule at his side.

8
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,040
Non, you are as without thought
as you are without voice.

9
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:26,053
This council has no hesitation
in proclaiming you all--

10
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:35,847
Guilty.

11
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,670
You will lie down before me, Jor-El.

12
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,843
Both you, and then one day, your heir!

13
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:07,213
Your heir!

14
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:46,086
- Here, I'll just get the door for you.
- Yeah, thanks a--

15
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,680
Sorry, after you.

16
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:51,722
Yeah, thanks a lot.

17
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,850
- Morning, Phil.
- Excuse me, Kent.

18
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,185
Hi, Alice. That's a very pretty
blouse you're wearing today.

19
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:03,438
I'll catch you later, Clark.

20
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,280
Hello?

21
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,030
I don't know. Okay. Yep.

22
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:11,028
- Morning, Leueen. How's it--?
- Okay. I'll check it.

23
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:15,458
Mr. White, how long should
we hold the front page?

24
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,292
Give it another 10 minutes,
and-- Oh, I'll tell them.

25
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,209
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Hello, Pete.

26
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,457
If we don't get anything
new in 10 minutes...

27
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:26,633
...go with the wire-service copy and
run the picture in three columns.

28
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,140
I need a story for the page-three
sidebar on this terrorist group.

29
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,965
Right.

30
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,894
Sorry, terrorists?

31
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,806
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent.
Where you been?

32
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,149
- I was at home.
- Don't you watch television?

33
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,435
I don't enjoy television.
Too much violence.

34
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:44,899
I was just reading Dickens.

35
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:48,318
Mr. Kent, a gang of terrorists
seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

36
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,489
He knows where the
Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.

37
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,117
- You do, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:55,084
- Has anybody been hurt?
- So far the hostages are unharmed.

39
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,655
- The hostages?
- Yeah, tourists. About 20 of them.

40
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,501
But that's just penny-ante stuff.

41
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,496
They claim if the government
doesn't meet their demands...

42
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:04,343
...they've got a hydrogen bomb.

43
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,763
Mr. White, that's terrible.

44
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,677
That's why they call
them terrorists, Kent.

45
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:13,138
Now, get to the morgue. I wanna
know everything on terrorism.

46
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,425
Mr. White, does Lois
know about any of this?

47
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:18,019
- Does she know about it? She's in it.
- She's what?

48
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,185
The minute the story broke, I
bundled her on the first Concorde.

49
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:24,315
If Paris is gonna go kablooey,
I want my best reporter there.

50
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:28,113
- But, gee, Mr. White--
- You're good, but Lois Lane is better.

51
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,858
No, I meant, isn't that a
little bit dangerous, sir?

52
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,281
That goes with the territory, Kent.

53
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,620
Don't worry.

54
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:38,535
If I know Lois Lane, she'll not only
come back with a Pulitzer Prize story...

55
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,209
...but a one-on-one interview
with a hydrogen bomb...

56
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,455
...titled "What Makes Me Tick."

57
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,167
Now, don't stand around, Kent--

58
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:30,255
- How did they get up there?
- They were disguised as repair workers.

59
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,934
Can you tell us why they
released the first hostages?

60
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,093
We insist they do this
to show good faith.

61
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,005
If not, we refuse to negotiate.

62
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,390
Will they release the
rest of the hostages?

63
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,728
In return for a guarantee that we
will not launch an attack on them.

64
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:46,114
There will be no attack, no attempt
to overpower the terrorists?

65
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:48,935
- We've made a guarantee.
- And you'll honor it?

66
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,939
We have not the choice to refuse...

67
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,611
...if we believe it's a real
hydrogen bomb they have.

68
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:56,244
- Where is the bomb?
- It's in a big oilcan.

69
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,448
Hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?

70
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,920
How can we be sure? Today it's
possible for anyone to make a bomb.

71
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,343
This could blow up all of Paris.

72
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:10,462
What's the government's position?
Will they meet their demands?

73
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,971
I am not authorized to
say what they will do.

74
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:17,053
At this moment, there is an emergency
meeting in the Elysee Palace.

75
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,151
Wait. Wait, wait.

76
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,283
- Stairs. Stairs? Stairs.
- Stairs.

77
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:42,082
Okay?

78
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:06,016
- All right. We'll bring them down now.
- Get in.

79
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,356
- Come on. Watch out for any tricks.
- Do we look like the sort of--?

80
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:14,283
I don't know what you look like. Get in.
You're being released. Shut up.

81
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:57,194
- Come on then, everybody out.
- Okay, ready.

82
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,491
This way.

83
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,235
- Come on. Quick, quick, quick.
- Hurry up.

84
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:07,164
Look, you're being released. Get moving.

85
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,999
I'll take a last look around.

86
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:18,224
Okay, send them down.

87
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:25,885
Okay, up we go.

88
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,902
Pulitzer Prize.

89
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,614
Capital P-- Darn.

90
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,378
Should we have let the hostages go?

91
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:56,133
They'll give in to us as
soon as we plant the bomb.

92
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,046
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

93
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,051
Nobel Prize.

94
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,600
Capital N...

95
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:06,893
...little O, little B...

96
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:09,727
...little E, little L.

97
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:13,653
Nobel. Nobel. Nobel.

98
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,818
Prize.

99
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:26,952
Now, be careful.

100
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:30,618
It's me that controls the bomb,
not the bomb that controls me.

101
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,329
I hope you have not many
sins left to be forgiven...

102
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,800
...because if you let go of that, you'll
only have 60 seconds to list them.

103
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:42,934
- You are right.
- Did you hear something?

104
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,143
Sounded like someone moving underneath.

105
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:46,723
It's your nerves.

106
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,190
- Where are they now?
- They are near to the lift.

107
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:58,323
But one is still inside with the bomb.

108
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:05,195
The third one has come
out of the lift now.

109
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,485
- The third one is out now.
- The bomb, is it still in there?

110
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,990
Yes, we think so.

111
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,166
This is the boring bit.

112
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,398
Tell them to get ready.

113
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,777
Stand by.

114
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:48,491
Get ready. Come on.

115
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,913
We'll cut the cable as
soon as we get the word.

116
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,160
Are you sure they haven't
primed the bomb?

117
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:58,001
No, no, of course not. They haven't.
We've been watching them all the time.

118
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:10,183
Now!

119
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,441
- It started.
- Oh, my God.

120
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:55,982
I believe this is your floor.

121
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,102
Oh, thank God.

122
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:01,153
How did I get myself into this?

123
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,231
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

124
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,239
A bomb! There's a bomb up there.

125
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:10,605
- They've got a bomb.
- I know. I know.

126
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:42,248
Nice fresh melons. Nice fresh melons.
Get them fresh here.

127
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,325
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

128
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:53,513
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

129
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:57,932
Hey!

130
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,017
Clark.

131
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:10,231
- You ever heard of crosswalks?
- Yeah, but you know, I mean...

132
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:12,361
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?

133
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:15,026
Freak.

134
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,953
Clark, you know, you were
really lucky that time.

135
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,290
You gotta be careful. When you
cross the street, look both ways.

136
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,376
Well, I mean, gee, Lois,
usually I do, you know.

137
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:36,471
- Come in.
- Hi.

138
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,723
You know, maybe you ought to
get your glasses checked.

139
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:45,599
Uh, well, you know, not everybody can
have x-ray vision, you know, Lois.

140
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:49,306
Do I detect a note of
jealousy in that voice?

141
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:53,572
Jealousy? No, no. Not me.

142
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,161
Golly, Lois, what are you doing?

143
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,993
When was the last time
you heard me sneeze?

144
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,790
You are never gonna hear me sneeze again.

145
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:04,504
- No?
- No. I read this book...

146
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:09,174
...and it says that if you get 1000
milligrams of vitamin C every day...

147
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,839
...you stay in perfect health.

148
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:14,174
Golly, 1000? That's certainly a
lot of oranges, isn't it, Lois?

149
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,010
- There are pills. I've seen them.
- Pills.

150
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,337
That's the modern way to do things.

151
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,262
This is natural.

152
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:25,142
Besides, I get my exercise that way.

153
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,940
And, Clark, you don't have to be jealous.

154
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,280
- Uh, I don't?
- No, you got so much going for you.

155
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:34,483
I do?

156
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:37,362
Do you mind if I give you a
little constructive criticism?

157
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,200
- Well, actually, yes, I--
- You gotta be more aggressive.

158
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,370
You have to go from the instinct.

159
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,995
You see something, you
want it, you go for it.

160
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,543
That's what I do.

161
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,876
Yes, I've noticed. Perhaps
I could help you there.

162
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,883
Oh, thanks. That would be great.

163
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:54,295
Let me see now...

164
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,046
Oh, I see.

165
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:58,466
Just put the orange in there.
That's really very clever.

166
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:02,388
Clark.

167
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,350
You know that I wouldn't say ail those
things to you if I didn't really care.

168
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,728
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

169
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:16,572
I mean, what else are friends for?

170
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:20,197
- Friends, huh?
- Mm-hm.

171
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:25,491
Here, Clark.

172
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,406
Here's to friendship.

173
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,003
Hm.

174
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,602
This is how it ends for the
greatest criminal mind of our time.

175
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,072
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

176
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:57,783
How do they choose to
reward Lex Luthor...

177
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,864
...the greatest genius in this world?

178
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,949
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

179
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:08,197
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

180
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,132
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

181
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:18,125
I mean, California almost fell
down, right in the ocean.

182
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,128
Millions of people was almost killed.

183
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,470
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

184
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,886
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- There's a scratch on it.

185
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,766
What are you gonna do
with a guy like that?

186
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:32,143
He flies around so fast and everything.

187
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:36,316
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

188
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:39,476
Every time they try, he just flies off.

189
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:40,992
- Where?
- North.

190
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,994
Why?

191
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,446
To ski?

192
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:47,985
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

193
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:51,411
Some, like you, Otis, have more than one.

194
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:53,501
I didn't see Superman's in time.

195
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,336
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

196
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:01,468
...my little black box
is just about ready.

197
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:04,842
- Oh, that little black box in our cell?
- Shh!

198
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,927
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

199
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,521
...what's it for?

200
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:19,266
That little black box, Otis, goes
beyond any conventional radar.

201
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:22,322
- It tracks alpha waves.
- Oh.

202
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,160
Alpha waves. Hm.

203
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:37,288
Those alpha waves will take
me north to his secret.

204
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,169
And his secret will give me Superman.

205
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:47,677
The MAB is 196 at 0.5.

206
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:51,135
We ought to see the old beauty
when we top the rise there.

207
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:56,311
Follow the bouncing ball for a while.
It's giving me a headache.

208
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:59,559
Anyway, somebody's gotta
check up on those guys.

209
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:02,572
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

210
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,525
How long they been up there, 45 days?

211
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:08,656
The whole world's forgotten about it.

212
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:13,038
Houston calling Artemis ll.

213
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,670
Houston calling Artemis ll. Come in.

214
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,423
- Morning, Houston.
- Hold on, Nate.

215
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:21,495
- Yo.
- How are things going?

216
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:24,755
Ail systems normal, Houston.

217
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,844
- Andy is out doing the geological survey.
- Okay.

218
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,260
More rocks. Nice.

219
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,560
And cosmonaut Boris is
getting some soil samples.

220
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,274
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

221
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,939
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

222
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,396
Just a little detente
humor there, Houston.

223
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,567
Surface conditions unchanged?

224
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:47,775
Well, it's mighty pretty out there.
Mighty...

225
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:51,947
- ...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.

226
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:54,291
Right.

227
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:56,544
Look, Nate?

228
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:58,286
Nate, wake up, will you?

229
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,038
That's it. I'm dreaming.

230
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,460
Artemis, come in.

231
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:07,763
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

232
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:09,295
Unidentified?

233
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,639
- What does it look like?
- Well...

234
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,465
...a lot like a girl.

235
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,619
You.

236
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,832
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

237
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,749
A man?

238
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:49,901
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

239
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,101
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

240
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,072
Come in, Houston. Come in.

241
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:32,855
Attempting manual liftoff.

242
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,240
Can somebody hear me?

243
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,620
Houston!

244
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,411
Come in, Houston!

245
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:46,714
Oh, no. No!

246
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,131
Somebody help me!

247
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:57,795
- Artemis, this is Houston calling.
- What's up?

248
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:01,971
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?

249
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:05,101
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

250
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:06,979
Well, we really--

251
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:10,773
Artemis, come in, please.
Houston calling.

252
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:14,651
What was that he said before?
He saw a girl?

253
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:18,494
- I thought he said "curl."
- What's a curl?

254
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:21,658
Isn't that what the old Canaveral
guys used to call a comet...

255
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,327
...with an east-west trajectory?

256
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:27,416
How should I know? I was back
in high school in those days.

257
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:32,423
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

258
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:36,508
And what he did was amazing.

259
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:41,136
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

260
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:47,519
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

261
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,517
...a yellow sun...

262
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:53,689
...the more our molecular density
gives us unlimited powers.

263
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,649
They come from there.

264
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
A place called Houston.

265
00:29:57,988 --> 00:30:00,368
Then we will go there too...

266
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,493
...to rule.

267
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:05,622
Finally, to rule.

268
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,726
Three-eighty, out.

269
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:30,814
Three-eighty-one, out.

270
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,734
Three-eighty-two, out.

271
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:36,571
Three-eighty-three, out.

272
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,569
Three-eighty-four, out.

273
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,873
Three-eighty-five, out.

274
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,909
Lights out, Luthor.

275
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,708
I said, lights out.

276
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:58,011
You guys are about 10 seconds away
from solitary, you know that?

277
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,182
I told you to--

278
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:22,574
Freeze, freeze.

279
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:37,381
Go out there and find it.

280
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:42,548
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

281
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:56,272
I think I found it.

282
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,607
What is it?

283
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:07,413
It's a ladder, you dummy.

284
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:09,578
- Hi, Miss Teschmacher.
- Sh!

285
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,670
Come on.

286
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:24,676
Hurry up. Hurry up.

287
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,854
Come on, hurry.

288
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:31,928
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

289
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:35,941
--50-yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.

290
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:38,855
But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against--

291
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,453
- Come up.
- Come on.

292
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:48,204
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

293
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:51,164
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

294
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:54,621
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

295
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:40,998
Excuse me.

296
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:47,761
If you'd like to carry Mrs.
Smith over the threshold...

297
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,677
it's sort of traditional.

298
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:52,675
I can give you a hand if
you have trouble lifting.

299
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:56,428
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

300
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:58,555
Certainly, dear.

301
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:03,938
- Well, here you are.
- Well, sure is pink.

302
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,779
Careful with the bags, please, sir.

303
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:08,105
Is this your first visit
to Honeymoon Haven?

304
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:12,076
- Together, anyway.
- Yes.

305
00:34:12,242 --> 00:34:14,622
Let me just show you some
of our special features.

306
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:19,037
These are our Flames of Love, exclusive
with this motel in the area.

307
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,208
If you want the flames to go
higher, you just pull this.

308
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,538
Oh, I see.

309
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:27,722
- Look, dear. That's kind of romantic.
- In July?

310
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:30,392
- Honey?
- For a nominal charge...

311
00:34:30,552 --> 00:34:33,052
...our staff photographer
will be happy to prepare...

312
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:35,812
...a special souvenir album
of your honeymoon stay.

313
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:39,305
He'll photograph you in some of
our more intimate locations...

314
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:42,608
...in the tub for two,
on the bearskin rug.

315
00:34:42,773 --> 00:34:44,483
Gee, real polyester!

316
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,903
And here's the bed.

317
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:48,739
Right. Thank you.

318
00:34:48,904 --> 00:34:50,824
Thank you, sir.

319
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,453
Oh, of course. Um...

320
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,501
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

321
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,463
And have a happy...

322
00:34:59,623 --> 00:35:01,293
...whatever.

323
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:06,671
Ugh! Can you believe this?

324
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:11,009
Posing as newlyweds to expose a
honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.

325
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,510
- Well...
- What a waste of a great writer.

326
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Writers.

327
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,599
Perry White and his
Sunday magazine exposes.

328
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:23,018
How am I supposed to get a Pulitzer
Prize writing about a pink bear?

329
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:26,018
I don't know, I think this kind
of thing should be exposed.

330
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:29,531
They get kids who are just starting
out, and take them for every cent.

331
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:32,355
- That's what Mr. White says.
- Yeah?

332
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:36,781
On the other hand, this is kind of nice.
Complimentary champagne.

333
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:39,002
- Kissing contest tonight.
- Really?

334
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:40,873
Lois, would...? Uh...

335
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,710
No.

336
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,375
Hey, look at this.

337
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:48,343
Lois? Gee.

338
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:51,298
Look what I found. A
complimentary corsage.

339
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:54,177
Yeah, everything's complimentary
around here till you get the bill.

340
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:55,394
Yeah.

341
00:35:57,514 --> 00:36:00,394
Gee, you look very pretty.

342
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,139
Thank you, Clark.

343
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:04,902
Sure.

344
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:08,484
You know, Lois, um, I
was sort of thinking...

345
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,650
Well, later on-- Well, I--

346
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:15,319
I was wondering what you wanted
to do about the arrangements.

347
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:17,241
What arrangements, Clark?

348
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:23,249
Well, um, I was thinking
primarily about the, um...

349
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,365
...sleeping arrangements.

350
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:28,498
- Mr. Smith?
- Uh-huh.

351
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:32,168
- The complimentary couch.
- Right.

352
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:34,718
What? Oooh.

353
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,221
Gosh, it's alive.

354
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:47,727
Very good, Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

355
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:50,068
Why am I here? What am I doing here?

356
00:36:50,234 --> 00:36:53,614
Miss Teschmacher, is this
a philosophy seminar?

357
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,446
No. This is a getaway.

358
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:57,905
- Getaway.
- Right.

359
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:00,785
Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

360
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:03,123
What else is ballast for?

361
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:04,712
Miss Teschmacher...

362
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:09,207
...north. Due north.

363
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:12,706
Right. North.

364
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:35,153
- Where's Jimmy when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

365
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,160
Yes, gorgeous. Gorgeous.

366
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:39,657
- Lois?
- Yeah?

367
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:44,655
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

368
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,920
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

369
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,340
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

370
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:54,423
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

371
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,470
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

372
00:37:57,634 --> 00:38:00,014
That's because you're blind, Clark.

373
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,012
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

374
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:04,101
- No, I've got it. No, I--
- Yeah. Clark.

375
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:07,516
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

376
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,146
- God.
- Lois?

377
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:10,483
- Now, here.
- Right.

378
00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:13,517
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

379
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:18,606
Son! Excuse me, please.

380
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:20,487
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

381
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,487
Get down! Get down!

382
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:28,662
You embarrass me here
in front of everybody.

383
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:34,553
Lois, did you see what almost happened there?
That little boy--

384
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

385
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,890
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

386
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:44,893
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

387
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:48,057
...and you're thinking about food.
Aren't you impressed?

388
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:51,647
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

389
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:54,323
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

390
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:56,233
Him again, huh?

391
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:58,739
Oh, I'm sorry.

392
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:01,237
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

393
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,576
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

394
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:05,873
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

395
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:07,406
Hot dog.

396
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,159
Could I have some orange juice?

397
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:12,501
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know. Okay.

398
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:20,715
Hey, Mom. Look!

399
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:22,894
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

400
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:28,932
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

401
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:34,396
Oh, my God!

402
00:39:35,524 --> 00:39:39,034
Help!

403
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:42,445
Somebody help!

404
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:48,235
Somebody do something!

405
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,256
Way to go, Superman!

406
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:08,143
What a nice man. Of course he's Jewish.

407
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:23,067
- There you go.
- Again, again!

408
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:26,488
No, I'm sorry. Only one
ride to a customer.

409
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:30,618
Superman. Superman, it's me, Lois!

410
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:32,997
Come here. You're gonna get it!

411
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:36,665
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

412
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,915
Lois Lane.

413
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:42,134
Well, hello and goodbye.

414
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:46,469
What's the hurry? I mean, seeing as
you happen to be in Niagara Falls?

415
00:40:47,596 --> 00:40:50,256
Happen to be in Niagara Falls.

416
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:53,519
And Clark...

417
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:57,185
Clark is not around, as usual.

418
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,020
Hmm.

419
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,290
Lois?

420
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:16,213
Hey, Lois?

421
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,535
- Here you go.
- Where were you?

422
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,550
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?

423
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:25,473
Well, it just seems kind of strange to
me that every time Superman's around...

424
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:27,514
...you disappear.

425
00:41:27,677 --> 00:41:29,887
Superman? You mean he was here?

426
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:34,675
- Golly.
- And you weren't. As usual.

427
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:37,063
So, what have you got to say about that?

428
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,189
Darn, I forgot your orange juice.

429
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:41,146
Clark.

430
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:43,651
No orange juice?

431
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:55,699
Mush! Mush!

432
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:57,922
I am mushing.

433
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:01,093
Ice and snow. Is this
your idea of a good time?

434
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:03,883
A good time? Is that all you care about?

435
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:06,007
North, Miss Teschmacher.

436
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:08,884
North. North, north, north!

437
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:10,932
Yes, Lex. North.

438
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:12,929
Look. It's his home.

439
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,721
It's Superman's home.

440
00:42:14,891 --> 00:42:17,181
Oh, good, more ice.

441
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,607
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

442
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,700
It's fantastic!

443
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:35,369
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

444
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:38,537
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

445
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:50,719
- This place is genius.
- Genius.

446
00:42:53,597 --> 00:42:55,557
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

447
00:42:55,724 --> 00:42:57,734
No, me.

448
00:42:58,477 --> 00:42:59,887
Oh! Ah!

449
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:02,232
Why can't you be more careful?

450
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,319
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

451
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:08,895
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

452
00:43:10,322 --> 00:43:14,662
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

453
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:23,747
This looks like some
kind of control panel.

454
00:43:27,506 --> 00:43:30,466
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

455
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:34,508
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

456
00:43:35,263 --> 00:43:37,643
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

457
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:50,778
Kryptonian memory bank.
Education crystal number 308.

458
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:53,199
- I told you it's a crystal.
- Shut up.

459
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:55,365
Earth culture, section B.

460
00:43:56,284 --> 00:44:00,204
Trees by Joyce Kilmer
of the Planet Earth.

461
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:01,962
What's this?

462
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:04,293
I think that I shall never see

463
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:06,879
A poem lovely as a tree.

464
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:09,295
- A tree whose hungry mouth...
- He's not here.

465
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:13,514
It's a voice from the past. That's cute.
That's very cute.

466
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:16,047
A tree that looks at God all day--

467
00:44:16,805 --> 00:44:18,465
I like trees.

468
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,390
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another one.

469
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:25,311
No, no, no. The big one there.

470
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:35,912
Kal-El, my son...

471
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:38,993
...as keeper of the
archives of Krypton...

472
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,330
...it falls to me to tell you of the
darkest episode in our planet's history.

473
00:44:43,498 --> 00:44:45,078
Now, this I wanna hear.

474
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,543
After eons of harmony, there appeared
among us three rebel elements.

475
00:44:48,712 --> 00:44:51,092
What you would call on Earth "criminals."

476
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:53,756
Criminals. My kind of people.

477
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:57,595
Despite all our efforts, we were
unable to change their evil natures...

478
00:44:57,846 --> 00:44:59,256
...their evil ways.

479
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:01,601
And as you know, we had no death penalty.

480
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:03,386
- Sensible enough.
- Therefore...

481
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,520
...our scientists constructed
the Phantom Zone.

482
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:11,439
In it, we placed these
three arch criminals...

483
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,780
...imprisoning them
there for all eternity.

484
00:45:15,071 --> 00:45:17,201
No possibility for parole?

485
00:45:17,365 --> 00:45:21,865
Your father, Jor-El, thought long
and hard upon that question.

486
00:45:22,037 --> 00:45:24,787
- I asked the right question.
- And there is one danger.

487
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,866
The Phantom Zone might...

488
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:31,964
...just might, be cracked by a
nuclear explosion in space.

489
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:35,545
I wish you had not asked me that.

490
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:37,637
I didn't ask anything.

491
00:45:37,886 --> 00:45:41,556
We do not know what would
happen if they were to escape.

492
00:45:41,723 --> 00:45:45,773
On Krypton, these villains
were uncontrollable.

493
00:45:45,935 --> 00:45:50,725
On Earth, they would have the
same powers, each one of them...

494
00:45:50,899 --> 00:45:52,649
...that you have.

495
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:54,821
- Think of it.
- The first of the three...

496
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:57,146
- Three.
- ...is their leader, General Zod.

497
00:45:57,322 --> 00:46:00,282
- Three super villains.
- Together with Non and Ursa--

498
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,950
Each one with the same power he has.

499
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,500
Each one totally dedicated to
corruption, violence and evil.

500
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:12,336
That explains the three alpha waves
I've been getting on my black box.

501
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:14,004
They'll need a contact on Earth.

502
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:17,972
Someone with the same contempt for life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

503
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:19,304
South, Miss Teschmacher.

504
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:21,598
You know, it's really amazing.

505
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:24,353
I never started to put
it together before now.

506
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:28,476
It's just kind of funny, because a good
reporter doesn't let anything slip by her.

507
00:46:28,645 --> 00:46:30,015
No, of course not.

508
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:32,978
Well, I'm beginning to get the picture.

509
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:38,819
As usual, Lois, I really don't
know what you're talking about.

510
00:46:39,614 --> 00:46:42,164
Tell you what, I'll meet
you back at the hotel.

511
00:46:42,325 --> 00:46:43,985
What's your hurry, Superman?

512
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,329
Sorry?

513
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:53,674
I gotta admit, your
disguise is nearly perfect.

514
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:55,207
You had me fooled.

515
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:57,463
And I am nobody's fool, believe me.

516
00:46:57,632 --> 00:46:59,052
No, of course not, Lois.

517
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:01,387
I mean, you just have
an active imagination.

518
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:03,053
You just get carried away sometimes.

519
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,891
- I understand. Lt can happen to anybody.
- Listen.

520
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:10,517
I'm so sure that you're Superman, that
I'm willing to bet my life on it.

521
00:47:10,979 --> 00:47:12,559
What?

522
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:15,896
Now, if I'm right, you'll
turn into Superman.

523
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:19,025
And if I'm wrong...

524
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:23,315
...you've got yourself
one hell of a story.

525
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:26,241
You think I'm Superman?

526
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:28,913
Boy, you certainly have
some imagination, Lois.

527
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,750
For a minute you almost had me convinced.
For a minute.

528
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,996
Bye-bye, baby.

529
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:40,013
Oh, my God!

530
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:45,507
Excuse me, please.

531
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:58,775
Superman!

532
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,452
Lois, swim. Swim!

533
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:05,115
Help!

534
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,080
Look out for the rocks! Oh, God.

535
00:48:09,746 --> 00:48:11,616
Clark!

536
00:48:34,229 --> 00:48:36,559
Lois, grab the branch!

537
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:38,731
What?

538
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,316
Help!

539
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,180
Lois, you all right?

540
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,440
I gotcha.

541
00:49:18,606 --> 00:49:20,856
Here, here, here!

542
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:26,315
Clark!

543
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:36,042
You're what I thought was Superman?

544
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,787
Sorry.

545
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:40,789
This is really embarrassing.

546
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,530
So this is planet Houston.

547
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:17,079
A very strange surface.

548
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:03,789
A primitive sort of life form.

549
00:51:13,096 --> 00:51:14,216
Hm...

550
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:15,889
Did you see that?

551
00:51:17,225 --> 00:51:19,385
Did you see what I did?

552
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,150
I have powers beyond reason here.

553
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,560
We all have them, my dear.

554
00:51:45,253 --> 00:51:48,173
Boy, I sure must have
looked like an idiot.

555
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:51,799
Jumping in the river, waiting for Mr.
Wonderful...

556
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:54,428
...who obviously had better things to do.

557
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:59,354
Well, I'm sure it must have been
something very important, Lois.

558
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,687
And then thinking that you were...

559
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:06,687
if Perry White could see me now.

560
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:14,868
Where's my comb?

561
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:19,327
God, not only have I lost
my mind, I've lost my comb.

562
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:21,995
Clark, can you pass me that
brush over there, please?

563
00:52:22,165 --> 00:52:23,865
Sure.

564
00:52:31,174 --> 00:52:32,884
Clark!

565
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:36,546
- No, no, no. It's okay.
- Let me see your hand. Give it to me.

566
00:52:36,804 --> 00:52:39,514
- No, no. It's all right, Lois.
- Let me look at it.

567
00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:54,907
- You are Superman.
- Lois, come on. Don't be s--

568
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,930
I'm sorry.

569
00:53:18,096 --> 00:53:20,716
No, you don't have anything
to be sorry about.

570
00:53:24,393 --> 00:53:26,523
I don't know why I did that.

571
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:29,021
Maybe you wanted to.

572
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:30,518
I don't think I did.

573
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,109
Well, maybe you didn't
want to with your mind...

574
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,530
...but maybe you wanted
to with your heart.

575
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:44,616
We'd better talk.

576
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,380
I'm in love with you.

577
00:53:55,883 --> 00:53:57,593
Well, we really better talk.

578
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:00,894
I'm listening.

579
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:06,230
We can't talk here. Perry will call at
about 6 to find out what's happening.

580
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:10,404
"What's happening"? That's the
understatement of the year.

581
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:19,317
Where do you wanna talk?

582
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,160
Lois.

583
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:33,338
Now that you know, I think
you should know it all.

584
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,014
I want to.

585
00:54:37,258 --> 00:54:39,468
Let's go to my place.

586
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,850
Maybe I should change first.

587
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,185
Maybe you should too.

588
00:55:19,175 --> 00:55:23,345
- They have a wide selection.
- I can't eat fish.

589
00:55:23,512 --> 00:55:27,472
You can eat anything you want, Duane.
You can eat meat and potatoes.

590
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:30,522
I couldn't go anywhere where
I was expected to eat fish.

591
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:32,396
They got beans.

592
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,823
I can't eat beans. I'll come
out in a rash if I eat beans.

593
00:55:35,983 --> 00:55:38,033
Look, Duane...

594
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:41,856
...they have a wide selection.

595
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:45,163
I think I'll try the fish.

596
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:57,049
I don't know. From the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

597
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:05,045
Hey, you hippies, get
your butts off the road!

598
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:08,521
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

599
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:11,103
But not this irritating noise.

600
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,599
Make way.

601
00:56:14,522 --> 00:56:16,272
Did I hear right?

602
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,230
That son of a bitch give me an order?

603
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,606
Duane, you take care of it.

604
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:21,948
- But I--
- Duane.

605
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:25,783
You gotta learn to kick ass,
you wanna be a peacemaker.

606
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,961
Ail right. Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

607
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:40,129
What is this symbol?

608
00:56:40,298 --> 00:56:42,128
Do you follow another leader?

609
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,630
Follow the leader?

610
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:48,143
Holy skunk sweat.

611
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:50,556
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

612
00:56:54,228 --> 00:56:55,348
Huh?

613
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:57,226
Wha--? Oh!

614
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:02,651
How the hell did you do that?

615
00:57:10,286 --> 00:57:11,656
Jesus H. Christ.

616
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:16,251
Crude noisemaker.

617
00:57:30,348 --> 00:57:34,018
I'm just checking the tire, you know.

618
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,170
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

619
00:58:41,335 --> 00:58:44,415
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

620
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,220
No, this is a very special place for me.

621
00:58:48,384 --> 00:58:50,684
I wanted you to see it.

622
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,255
Listen, you warm enough?

623
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:56,597
I guess I should be
freezing, but I'm not.

624
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,437
Good.

625
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,772
Come on, let me show you.

626
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:42,312
You see? You only smell strong.

627
00:59:45,483 --> 00:59:47,823
Whoa, baby!

628
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:54,071
It's only because I didn't want to
lose my place in the orchestra.

629
00:59:55,284 --> 00:59:59,664
Oh, my. The circus is in town.

630
01:00:01,123 --> 01:00:05,633
Hey, sweet thing. Set
them buns down here.

631
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:14,088
Let's just hold hands.

632
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:19,635
Let me know if this tickles.

633
01:00:23,395 --> 01:00:24,765
Mm-hm.

634
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:31,650
Your right front tire is flat, Duane.

635
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:40,953
- Sheriff, what happened?
- Willie.

636
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:43,869
I think my arm's broke.

637
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:49,458
Girl or no girl, you're
gonna spit teeth. Get up.

638
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:56,965
What the Sam hill?

639
01:01:02,518 --> 01:01:04,518
Is that you, Boog?

640
01:01:07,648 --> 01:01:09,688
Uh, oh. Uh...

641
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,570
Ail right. Get them up and keep them up!

642
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:19,079
These humans are beginning to bore me.

643
01:01:28,669 --> 01:01:30,419
- Please, mister--
- He's a general.

644
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:33,008
Please, Mr. General.
Please let my daddy down.

645
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,880
Hey-- Hey! Hey, hey!

646
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:40,434
You okay, Jody?

647
01:01:43,684 --> 01:01:46,444
See, when my father died--

648
01:01:46,604 --> 01:01:48,694
That's my Earth father, I mean.

649
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,533
--I found this crystal.

650
01:01:53,027 --> 01:01:55,027
- Huh?
- Uh...

651
01:01:55,362 --> 01:01:58,362
This is kind of hard to
explain, but you see, it, um--

652
01:01:58,532 --> 01:01:59,872
It called to me.

653
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:02,039
Oh.

654
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:04,544
Yeah. And it brought me here.

655
01:02:05,372 --> 01:02:07,042
It helped me to build this place.

656
01:02:07,207 --> 01:02:10,787
Well, actually, it built it, really.

657
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,922
But, um...

658
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:17,759
...that's when I found out who I
really was, and what I had to do.

659
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,143
So, what do you think? You like it?

660
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:27,059
Like it?

661
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:28,944
It's incredible.

662
01:02:29,897 --> 01:02:33,777
I mean, not that it couldn't
use a woman's touch, you know?

663
01:02:33,942 --> 01:02:36,992
- Especially around dinnertime.
- Dinner. Oh.

664
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:39,954
I'm sorry. See, I don't
usually do too much about--

665
01:02:40,115 --> 01:02:42,985
Listen, tonight, sky's the limit.
Anything you want.

666
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:33,205
- I'm home.
- Oh!

667
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:35,711
Should we eat?

668
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:39,049
- Sure.
- Great.

669
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:45,679
Good morning, America. This
is East Houston, Idaho.

670
01:03:45,848 --> 01:03:49,888
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

671
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,520
But today, the population--
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

672
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,070
--Has increased by three.

673
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:59,323
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

674
01:03:59,486 --> 01:04:02,156
As I look west into East
Houston this morning...

675
01:04:02,322 --> 01:04:06,742
...I see a town gripped with fear.

676
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:09,581
Who's the big guy?

677
01:04:10,372 --> 01:04:12,252
Okay, yeah, we've gotta be a--

678
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:15,958
- No.
- We've got a crack...

679
01:04:16,128 --> 01:04:17,168
...in that diode.

680
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,420
- Come in on him if you can.
- Try to wiggle it.

681
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:22,551
Who else is seeing this?

682
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:26,598
Well, with this satellite linkup, just
about everybody. The whole planet.

683
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:28,934
The whole planet Houston?

684
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,849
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

685
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:34,518
Get over to the commentator.

686
01:04:34,688 --> 01:04:36,858
You may continue.

687
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:40,694
As the extraordinary story continues--

688
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:43,782
- As this extraordinary--
- Enough of this man.

689
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:47,367
If the whole planet is watching, let's
show them something interesting.

690
01:04:47,534 --> 01:04:50,244
Throw down your arms and surrender!

691
01:04:50,412 --> 01:04:53,712
This is an order.

692
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:58,882
General Zod does not take orders.
He gives them.

693
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:24,994
Hey, you all right, buddy?

694
01:05:53,767 --> 01:05:56,847
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

695
01:05:57,104 --> 01:05:59,364
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

696
01:06:00,315 --> 01:06:02,015
Yes? Yes.

697
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:06,952
The Newsbeat control room has informed me
that a fleet of helicopter gunships is--

698
01:06:07,114 --> 01:06:10,664
- Mr. President, sir, can't we--?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

699
01:06:10,826 --> 01:06:13,116
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

700
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:14,697
Where's Superman?

701
01:06:14,872 --> 01:06:17,962
Where is he? Why doesn't he do something?

702
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:21,785
General Smythson has said that
nuclear weapon strikes...

703
01:06:21,962 --> 01:06:25,722
...have been ruled out because of the
danger to the civilian population.

704
01:06:34,516 --> 01:06:36,136
Starting fire run now.

705
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:40,729
Stand by, rockets.

706
01:06:40,981 --> 01:06:42,521
Fire one.

707
01:06:44,735 --> 01:06:50,235
Fire again.

708
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:57,581
Locked on target. Gotta take a run now.

709
01:06:57,748 --> 01:06:59,868
The rockets didn't have any effect.

710
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:03,877
Look. They need machines to fly.

711
01:07:06,006 --> 01:07:07,336
What bravery.

712
01:07:07,674 --> 01:07:11,684
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

713
01:07:19,561 --> 01:07:22,271
We're out of control.
We don't understand.

714
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:27,741
We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!

715
01:07:27,903 --> 01:07:29,453
We're coming down.

716
01:07:43,043 --> 01:07:44,963
I win.

717
01:07:46,463 --> 01:07:48,633
I always win.

718
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:53,296
Is there no one on this
planet to even challenge me?

719
01:07:59,226 --> 01:08:03,226
- Mmm. That was good.
- I thought we might, uh...

720
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:07,321
...abandon the orange juice for once.

721
01:08:14,741 --> 01:08:17,491
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

722
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:24,628
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

723
01:08:25,127 --> 01:08:27,837
No. No, I really--

724
01:08:28,005 --> 01:08:30,165
I really like it sometimes.

725
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,680
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

726
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:38,764
But, you know, if it weren't for
him, I never would have met you.

727
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,350
But he is you.

728
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:49,028
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

729
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:55,821
For the first time in my life...

730
01:08:55,991 --> 01:08:57,531
...everything's clear.

731
01:09:21,808 --> 01:09:24,848
I'm gonna go change into
something more comfortable.

732
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,203
Come forward.

733
01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:43,329
Your general wishes to speak.

734
01:09:43,497 --> 01:09:47,747
I am General Zod, your ruler.

735
01:09:49,086 --> 01:09:53,166
Yes, today begins a new order!

736
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:55,841
Your lands, your possessions...

737
01:09:56,009 --> 01:10:01,099
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me, General Zod.

738
01:10:01,515 --> 01:10:03,675
In return for your obedience...

739
01:10:03,892 --> 01:10:06,562
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

740
01:10:06,728 --> 01:10:10,608
In other words, you will
be allowed to live.

741
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:16,110
So you are a general?

742
01:10:17,114 --> 01:10:19,284
And who is your superior?

743
01:10:20,075 --> 01:10:25,195
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

744
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:30,246
Or all of his cities will
end up like this one.

745
01:10:30,585 --> 01:10:34,375
Your father and I have tried to
anticipate your every question, Kal-El.

746
01:10:34,548 --> 01:10:37,218
This is the one we hoped
you would not ask.

747
01:10:37,384 --> 01:10:41,974
But I have to, because she's
everything I want in life.

748
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:45,769
And she, the one you have chosen...

749
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:48,266
...she feels as much for you?

750
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,810
Yes.

751
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,770
Then, if this is what you wish...

752
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:54,982
...if you intend to live
your life with a mortal...

753
01:10:55,152 --> 01:10:58,322
...you must live as a mortal.

754
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:00,488
You must become one of them.

755
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:07,449
This crystal chamber has harnessed
the rays of the red sun of Krypton.

756
01:11:07,622 --> 01:11:09,672
Once exposed to these rays...

757
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:14,503
...all your great powers on
Earth will disappear forever.

758
01:11:19,259 --> 01:11:20,629
But consider.

759
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:23,511
Once it is done, there is no return.

760
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,640
You will become an ordinary man.

761
01:11:26,141 --> 01:11:28,931
You will feel like an ordinary man.

762
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:32,942
You can be hurt like an ordinary man.

763
01:11:42,824 --> 01:11:46,334
Oh, my son, are you sure?

764
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:55,173
Mother...

765
01:11:56,171 --> 01:11:57,711
...I love her.

766
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:50,327
You did all that for me?

767
01:13:51,286 --> 01:13:54,826
Huh. I don't know what to say.

768
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:59,173
- Just say you love me.
- Oh.

769
01:14:49,135 --> 01:14:52,715
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

770
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:56,059
Imagine what they'll do to
the world if we resist.

771
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,077
The whole place is gonna fall!

772
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:05,091
Watch it!

773
01:16:40,288 --> 01:16:42,288
You are the one they call president?

774
01:16:42,957 --> 01:16:44,577
I am.

775
01:16:46,669 --> 01:16:50,629
I see you are practiced in
worshipping things that fly.

776
01:16:51,799 --> 01:16:53,589
Good.

777
01:16:54,469 --> 01:16:56,639
Rise before Zod.

778
01:17:00,517 --> 01:17:03,687
Now, kneel before Zod.

779
01:17:17,784 --> 01:17:19,374
You are not the president.

780
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:24,369
No one who leads so many could
possibly kneel so quickly.

781
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:26,461
I am the man they are protecting.

782
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,550
I am the president.

783
01:17:30,505 --> 01:17:32,795
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

784
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:34,876
It will.

785
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:37,641
Starting with your own.

786
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:51,903
What I do now...

787
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:55,238
...I do for the sake of
the people of the world.

788
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:59,485
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

789
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:03,081
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

790
01:18:03,329 --> 01:18:05,329
I wish I knew.

791
01:18:09,502 --> 01:18:10,922
Oh, God.

792
01:18:11,504 --> 01:18:12,964
Zod.

793
01:18:14,716 --> 01:18:16,126
Hey.

794
01:18:16,384 --> 01:18:20,854
You're awfully quiet over there.
I'm supposed to be the shy one.

795
01:18:21,389 --> 01:18:24,679
Yeah, I was just thinking...

796
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:28,401
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

797
01:18:29,188 --> 01:18:32,728
Are you kidding? I didn't do it
for you, Lois, I did it for us.

798
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:36,399
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

799
01:18:36,571 --> 01:18:40,531
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

800
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,450
Hurry up.

801
01:18:42,619 --> 01:18:44,619
- Come on.
- Okay.

802
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:47,537
My back's stiff.

803
01:18:47,707 --> 01:18:50,037
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

804
01:18:54,047 --> 01:18:56,257
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

805
01:18:57,884 --> 01:19:00,144
Thank you.

806
01:19:02,388 --> 01:19:04,968
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

807
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:07,891
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

808
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:11,312
Hi, what would you folks like?

809
01:19:11,481 --> 01:19:15,071
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

810
01:19:15,234 --> 01:19:18,904
...an order of fries and
a side salad, please.

811
01:19:19,947 --> 01:19:22,657
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

812
01:19:22,909 --> 01:19:24,659
Right. That's one cheeseburger--

813
01:19:24,911 --> 01:19:27,621
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

814
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:29,499
Coming right up.

815
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:33,336
- Sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

816
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:36,422
Can I buy you something to eat?

817
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:38,590
No, thank you.

818
01:19:39,676 --> 01:19:42,006
Excuse me. I think you're
sitting in my seat.

819
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:45,345
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

820
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:52,191
Gee, I think perhaps somebody ought
to teach you some manners, sir.

821
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,856
Yeah? Well, let me know when he comes in.

822
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:58,525
- Look, Clark, we can just--
- Honey.

823
01:19:59,821 --> 01:20:02,201
Excuse me, sir, would you
care to step outside?

824
01:20:02,448 --> 01:20:05,158
I said, excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

825
01:20:08,454 --> 01:20:11,164
Now, listen, Rocky, your
steak's coming right up.

826
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:15,498
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

827
01:20:16,713 --> 01:20:18,303
After you.

828
01:20:18,965 --> 01:20:20,835
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

829
01:20:24,137 --> 01:20:25,217
Clark!

830
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:28,893
You all right, fella?

831
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:31,808
He's gonna be fine, just give me that.

832
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:35,688
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

833
01:20:36,524 --> 01:20:40,744
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

834
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:44,243
I don't want a bodyguard. I want
the man I fell in love with.

835
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,580
I know that, Lois.

836
01:20:46,743 --> 01:20:49,083
I wish he were here.

837
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:56,501
Clark.

838
01:20:57,837 --> 01:21:01,087
Boy, you just don't have enough
sense to stay down, do you?

839
01:21:13,019 --> 01:21:15,189
Settle down!

840
01:21:15,772 --> 01:21:18,192
I don't like your meat anyway.

841
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:22,239
Oh, God.

842
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:32,285
Clark? Clark?

843
01:21:32,455 --> 01:21:34,245
Clark, can you get up?

844
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:38,247
- It's all right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Try and get up in that chair.

845
01:21:40,922 --> 01:21:43,592
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

846
01:21:45,051 --> 01:21:48,641
Okay, everybody, he's all right. Just relax.
We'll have some fresh coffee.

847
01:21:48,805 --> 01:21:51,095
I'll turn the box on.

848
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:54,773
We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...

849
01:21:54,936 --> 01:21:57,806
...from the President
of the United States.

850
01:21:58,064 --> 01:22:00,404
This is your president.

851
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:05,570
On behalf of my country, and in the name
of the other leaders of the world...

852
01:22:05,738 --> 01:22:08,738
...with whom I have today consulted...

853
01:22:09,283 --> 01:22:12,083
...I hereby abdicate...

854
01:22:12,286 --> 01:22:16,576
...all authority and control
over this planet...

855
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:18,673
...to General Zod.

856
01:22:19,126 --> 01:22:20,666
Zod.

857
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:24,337
Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...

858
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:29,144
...will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.

859
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,259
Superman, can you hear me?

860
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:35,180
- Superman, where--?
- Who is this Superman?

861
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:41,441
- You'll find out. And when you do--
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.

862
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:43,187
I defy you.

863
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:46,859
Come! Come and kneel before Zod.

864
01:22:49,282 --> 01:22:50,702
Zod!

865
01:22:52,285 --> 01:22:54,035
- Here? When?
- When?

866
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:58,003
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

867
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:02,211
I have to go back.

868
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:04,378
You can't go back.

869
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:07,130
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

870
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,510
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

871
01:23:10,678 --> 01:23:13,558
It's not your fault.

872
01:23:13,723 --> 01:23:17,143
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

873
01:23:18,352 --> 01:23:20,312
They knew.

874
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:22,729
I heard them.

875
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:25,189
I just didn't listen.

876
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,934
Hey, come on! Please!

877
01:23:58,726 --> 01:24:00,436
God.

878
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,270
Father?

879
01:24:43,437 --> 01:24:44,977
Mother?

880
01:24:47,733 --> 01:24:50,323
Boy, I really wish you could hear me.

881
01:24:51,445 --> 01:24:53,485
Because I need you.

882
01:24:55,616 --> 01:24:57,326
See, I...

883
01:25:00,246 --> 01:25:01,616
I, uh...

884
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:04,750
I failed.

885
01:25:10,089 --> 01:25:13,009
Father!

886
01:26:26,499 --> 01:26:29,079
You're master of all you survey.

887
01:26:29,335 --> 01:26:31,245
And so I was yesterday.

888
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,920
And the day before.

889
01:26:47,853 --> 01:26:49,063
Hello, there.

890
01:26:50,606 --> 01:26:57,066
Lex Luthor.

891
01:26:57,613 --> 01:27:00,453
You've heard the name? The
greatest criminal mind on Earth.

892
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:03,620
I told you this was a puny planet.

893
01:27:03,786 --> 01:27:05,406
Wait just a moment.

894
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:08,709
Wait until you get to know me better.
Will you, please?

895
01:27:08,874 --> 01:27:12,594
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

896
01:27:12,753 --> 01:27:14,753
I can give you the brass ring...

897
01:27:14,922 --> 01:27:19,632
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

898
01:27:20,136 --> 01:27:24,756
Pius, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

899
01:27:24,932 --> 01:27:29,272
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better--

900
01:27:31,147 --> 01:27:33,647
We have all of this without you.

901
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:36,611
You cannot bargain with
what you don't have.

902
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:39,489
Magnificent One...

903
01:27:40,447 --> 01:27:43,827
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

904
01:27:43,993 --> 01:27:45,413
The son of Jor-El.

905
01:27:45,578 --> 01:27:49,248
- The son of Jor-El? On this planet?
- Aye.

906
01:27:49,415 --> 01:27:51,995
Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...

907
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:55,298
...or his name he travels under:

908
01:27:55,462 --> 01:27:57,262
- Superman.
- Oh.

909
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:01,178
So this is Superman.

910
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:03,801
How do you know of Jor-El?

911
01:28:03,971 --> 01:28:08,431
My Fullness, as I explained
to you before...

912
01:28:09,476 --> 01:28:10,976
...I'm about the best there is.

913
01:28:11,145 --> 01:28:12,435
Revenge.

914
01:28:12,605 --> 01:28:14,605
We will kill the son of our jailer.

915
01:28:14,815 --> 01:28:17,775
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

916
01:28:17,985 --> 01:28:19,985
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

917
01:28:20,154 --> 01:28:22,204
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

918
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:26,994
But, uh, Magnificent One...

919
01:28:27,161 --> 01:28:29,701
...he's just one...

920
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:31,332
...where you are three.

921
01:28:33,167 --> 01:28:36,537
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

922
01:28:36,712 --> 01:28:38,502
Wait!

923
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:41,339
First, you must find him.

924
01:28:41,508 --> 01:28:44,968
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

925
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:48,972
What do you want?

926
01:28:49,183 --> 01:28:51,313
Well, general...

927
01:28:51,477 --> 01:28:54,057
...the world is a big place.

928
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:56,650
Thank goodness, uh...

929
01:28:56,815 --> 01:28:58,815
...my needs are small.

930
01:29:00,236 --> 01:29:06,066
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

931
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:09,583
What do you want?

932
01:29:10,496 --> 01:29:11,826
Australia.

933
01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:17,918
I can't understand it.

934
01:29:18,087 --> 01:29:21,257
Where is he? He shows up every
time a cat gets stuck in a tree...

935
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:23,843
...and now he's decided to
pull a disappearing act.

936
01:29:24,009 --> 01:29:26,009
Maybe we haven't figured
out his game plan.

937
01:29:26,178 --> 01:29:29,348
Game plan? It's fourth down, the
two-minute warning has sounded...

938
01:29:29,515 --> 01:29:31,515
...and the ball is deep in our territory.

939
01:29:31,684 --> 01:29:35,274
Just how brilliant do you have to be?
I mean--

940
01:29:37,523 --> 01:29:40,533
Superman's got something up his sleeve.
That's for sure, chief.

941
01:29:40,693 --> 01:29:44,573
- We just haven't figured it out, right?
- He'll be here!

942
01:29:44,863 --> 01:29:47,203
If it's at all possible, he'll be here.

943
01:29:47,366 --> 01:29:51,536
See? Yeah, and she knows his
plays better than anybody.

944
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,460
Yeah, better than anybody.

945
01:29:57,626 --> 01:30:00,206
Maybe he hasn't heard
about it yet, chief.

946
01:30:08,887 --> 01:30:10,307
Sounds like an earthquake.

947
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:56,176
Quick, take a picture.

948
01:31:01,357 --> 01:31:05,607
Get down the back way! Get out!

949
01:31:10,115 --> 01:31:12,155
Oh! Ow!

950
01:31:23,712 --> 01:31:25,882
You all right, chief?

951
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:30,011
Even with all this knowledge when will
these dummies learn to use a doorknob?

952
01:31:30,511 --> 01:31:33,641
Hi.

953
01:31:33,806 --> 01:31:36,806
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

954
01:31:36,975 --> 01:31:38,305
Lex Luthor.

955
01:31:38,477 --> 01:31:41,477
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

956
01:31:43,023 --> 01:31:44,233
Yes, Your Grace.

957
01:31:44,733 --> 01:31:48,323
But what I've given you
is the next best thing.

958
01:31:48,487 --> 01:31:52,317
You just hold on to that little
lady, and he'll be along.

959
01:31:52,491 --> 01:31:54,081
See, they have this relationship.

960
01:31:54,243 --> 01:31:58,503
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

961
01:31:58,664 --> 01:32:01,334
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

962
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:05,037
What an undemanding male
this Superman must be.

963
01:32:05,212 --> 01:32:07,342
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself.

964
01:32:07,756 --> 01:32:09,666
Wait!

965
01:32:09,842 --> 01:32:11,512
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

966
01:32:12,386 --> 01:32:14,716
Kill the rest, starting with him.

967
01:32:15,347 --> 01:32:17,927
Wait. Wait.

968
01:32:18,183 --> 01:32:20,523
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room?

969
01:32:20,686 --> 01:32:22,436
We had a few laughs, right?

970
01:32:41,123 --> 01:32:42,373
General...

971
01:32:43,459 --> 01:32:45,249
...would you care to step outside?

972
01:32:45,419 --> 01:32:46,879
Superman!

973
01:32:47,921 --> 01:32:49,761
Superman, thank God.

974
01:32:49,923 --> 01:32:51,303
I mean, get him!

975
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:54,137
Come to me, son of Jor-El!

976
01:32:54,303 --> 01:32:57,223
Kneel before Zod!

977
01:33:16,617 --> 01:33:18,617
Watch out. You all right?

978
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,130
Wait there.

979
01:33:40,182 --> 01:33:41,642
Son of Jor-El.

980
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,690
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

981
01:33:44,978 --> 01:33:46,478
I'm not a coward, Zod.

982
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:49,516
Let him prove it.

983
01:34:08,627 --> 01:34:11,377
Then die as you deserve to!

984
01:34:21,515 --> 01:34:23,675
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

985
01:34:23,892 --> 01:34:26,062
Man, this is gonna be good.

986
01:34:30,691 --> 01:34:33,151
Take him. He's yours.

987
01:35:00,095 --> 01:35:02,755
Come on! Kill him!

988
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:04,561
Superman.

989
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:16,611
The big one's just as strong as Superman.

990
01:35:43,805 --> 01:35:44,885
Ah!

991
01:35:48,143 --> 01:35:50,443
Hold him.

992
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,560
Wow, home run.

993
01:36:24,012 --> 01:36:26,262
Oh, my God! My baby!

994
01:36:33,021 --> 01:36:34,771
Thank you.

995
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:45,990
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

996
01:36:46,326 --> 01:36:48,946
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

997
01:36:49,121 --> 01:36:50,371
He cares.

998
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:53,829
He actually cares for these Earth people.

999
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,210
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

1000
01:36:57,671 --> 01:37:00,051
Sentimental idiot.

1001
01:37:05,387 --> 01:37:07,807
He's caged Non.

1002
01:37:08,056 --> 01:37:09,966
I'll draw his fire...

1003
01:37:10,142 --> 01:37:12,062
...with some of my own.

1004
01:37:47,763 --> 01:37:50,513
Get out of here! The rig's gonna blow!

1005
01:38:01,568 --> 01:38:03,898
Get away from that truck!

1006
01:38:53,495 --> 01:38:55,905
- Did you see that?
- They went down there.

1007
01:39:37,664 --> 01:39:39,214
Hey, what the--?

1008
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:42,498
Superman, help us!

1009
01:39:49,885 --> 01:39:51,005
Superman.

1010
01:40:43,688 --> 01:40:46,188
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

1011
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:49,943
You people, get back.

1012
01:40:50,111 --> 01:40:52,241
Here, take the end of this.

1013
01:41:06,086 --> 01:41:08,206
No! Don't do it!

1014
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:10,300
The people!

1015
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:16,720
Throw it!

1016
01:41:40,996 --> 01:41:43,496
- This way, please. This way.
- Help me.

1017
01:41:50,296 --> 01:41:54,006
Where's your wife, sir? I got her.
I got her. Don't worry.

1018
01:41:54,509 --> 01:41:56,759
He's dead. He's dead.

1019
01:41:57,429 --> 01:41:59,349
Superman is dead.

1020
01:41:59,848 --> 01:42:01,018
He's not coming out.

1021
01:42:01,349 --> 01:42:03,519
- They've killed Superman.
- Oh, no!

1022
01:42:03,768 --> 01:42:05,848
- What are we gonna do?
- He's dead.

1023
01:42:06,021 --> 01:42:07,311
Let's go get them!

1024
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,020
- Come on, let's go!
- I know judo. Come on, let's go!

1025
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:41,309
Hey, hey, hey!

1026
01:42:43,349 --> 01:42:44,639
What sound?

1027
01:42:44,851 --> 01:42:47,311
You forgot your cha--

1028
01:42:49,522 --> 01:42:50,982
Wait a minute!

1029
01:42:55,904 --> 01:42:58,744
- I'm holding it, I'm holding it!
- I got it.

1030
01:42:59,699 --> 01:43:01,329
I can't see what's happening.

1031
01:43:06,915 --> 01:43:08,745
- My hair!
- Your hair? What about mine?

1032
01:43:09,209 --> 01:43:10,249
Hold on!

1033
01:43:20,678 --> 01:43:22,548
Yeah, yeah, I got your message.

1034
01:43:23,348 --> 01:43:25,098
No, go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah?

1035
01:43:25,266 --> 01:43:27,726
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

1036
01:44:33,293 --> 01:44:35,753
Look, he's alive. He's alive!

1037
01:44:37,672 --> 01:44:39,672
It'll be all right.

1038
01:44:54,606 --> 01:44:56,476
Come back, please!

1039
01:44:56,649 --> 01:44:59,029
Please come back!

1040
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:04,870
So he is a coward after ail.

1041
01:45:05,033 --> 01:45:06,533
Damn it!

1042
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:08,451
Come back, Superman!

1043
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,880
What about us?

1044
01:45:16,044 --> 01:45:19,134
- Don't leave us!
- We can't handle it without you.

1045
01:45:19,297 --> 01:45:22,297
- It's not our fault.
- He chickened out.

1046
01:45:23,218 --> 01:45:24,298
Ah, phony!

1047
01:45:25,553 --> 01:45:27,553
Superman didn't even do nothing.

1048
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:29,892
Come on, let's go.

1049
01:45:31,351 --> 01:45:33,981
Get away from here. Jimmy.

1050
01:45:38,066 --> 01:45:39,976
Our victory is complete.

1051
01:45:40,151 --> 01:45:42,151
The son of Jor-El has fled.

1052
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,200
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

1053
01:45:45,365 --> 01:45:49,155
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

1054
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:51,500
The next time?

1055
01:45:52,247 --> 01:45:54,247
What am I gonna do with you people?

1056
01:45:54,499 --> 01:45:57,209
I held up my end. I
delivered you the blue boy.

1057
01:45:57,377 --> 01:45:59,087
What do I get from my triple threat?

1058
01:45:59,254 --> 01:46:02,764
"Bow, yield, kneel." That kind
of stuff closes out a town.

1059
01:46:03,007 --> 01:46:07,217
Why do you say this to me when
you know I will kill you for it?

1060
01:46:07,387 --> 01:46:11,097
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

1061
01:46:11,516 --> 01:46:14,386
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

1062
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:17,520
- Eradicate the only man on earth with--
- Kill him!

1063
01:46:18,022 --> 01:46:19,692
--Superman's address?

1064
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:23,940
Come.

1065
01:46:24,112 --> 01:46:29,282
The three of us will crush
the son of our jailer.

1066
01:46:29,534 --> 01:46:32,414
Why not increase his handicap?

1067
01:46:32,578 --> 01:46:35,458
Since he cares so much for
these Earth creatures...

1068
01:46:35,748 --> 01:46:38,208
...let us take his favorite.

1069
01:47:32,347 --> 01:47:34,307
Hey, ever heard of parachutes?

1070
01:47:39,312 --> 01:47:41,522
Another small step for mankind.

1071
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,320
Scruffy.

1072
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,490
So morbid.

1073
01:47:47,653 --> 01:47:51,283
A sentimental replica of a
planet long since vanished.

1074
01:47:52,367 --> 01:47:54,157
No style at all.

1075
01:47:54,327 --> 01:47:59,207
I expect better manners
from my guests, Zod.

1076
01:48:13,638 --> 01:48:15,008
We must combine our strength.

1077
01:48:39,414 --> 01:48:42,544
Fools! Take him!

1078
01:49:11,946 --> 01:49:13,026
What?

1079
01:49:17,076 --> 01:49:20,786
We used to play this game at school.
Never was very good at it.

1080
01:49:21,205 --> 01:49:24,535
Superman, I knew that you'd-- Huh?

1081
01:49:28,212 --> 01:49:30,302
Wrong again, Zod.

1082
01:49:33,217 --> 01:49:35,547
No, no!

1083
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:38,720
Release the general or
we'll tear her apart.

1084
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:41,640
Superman, no! No!

1085
01:49:41,809 --> 01:49:43,059
Superman, don't!

1086
01:49:44,145 --> 01:49:45,805
Ail right!

1087
01:49:57,241 --> 01:50:00,331
Did you really think we would
give up our advantage?

1088
01:50:00,495 --> 01:50:05,245
Now, the son of Jor-El
will be my slave. Forever.

1089
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:09,290
If not, the millions of
earthlings you protect...

1090
01:50:09,462 --> 01:50:11,632
...will pay for your defiance.

1091
01:50:11,964 --> 01:50:13,844
Destroy this place.

1092
01:50:14,008 --> 01:50:17,178
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- We have no more use for this one.

1093
01:50:17,345 --> 01:50:20,755
- Kill him.
- Me?

1094
01:50:20,932 --> 01:50:22,182
Lex Luthor?

1095
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:26,350
General, you came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1096
01:50:26,687 --> 01:50:28,017
Silence!

1097
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:29,809
Well, look--

1098
01:50:29,982 --> 01:50:32,612
Watch it. Don't touch me.

1099
01:50:33,861 --> 01:50:35,031
Guy's a clod.

1100
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:39,781
Promises were made, gifts exchanged.

1101
01:50:39,951 --> 01:50:43,501
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1102
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:46,463
A guy always knew where
he stood with you.

1103
01:50:48,793 --> 01:50:52,553
Try to get them all into
this molecule chamber.

1104
01:50:52,713 --> 01:50:55,013
It takes away their powers, see...

1105
01:50:55,174 --> 01:50:57,634
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1106
01:50:57,802 --> 01:50:59,052
Now, if you could...

1107
01:50:59,345 --> 01:51:00,965
Shh, shh!

1108
01:51:02,139 --> 01:51:05,349
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1109
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,060
That's a molecule chamber.

1110
01:51:07,311 --> 01:51:11,021
It makes people like you
into people like me.

1111
01:51:11,357 --> 01:51:12,817
You've done well, Lex Luthor.

1112
01:51:13,693 --> 01:51:18,703
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1113
01:51:18,864 --> 01:51:21,874
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1114
01:51:22,034 --> 01:51:23,704
...activate the machine.

1115
01:51:26,497 --> 01:51:27,867
Thank you.

1116
01:51:30,543 --> 01:51:32,543
With your permission.

1117
01:52:45,826 --> 01:52:48,906
And now, finally...

1118
01:52:59,298 --> 01:53:01,678
Take my hand...

1119
01:53:01,926 --> 01:53:07,506
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1120
01:53:46,721 --> 01:53:48,141
He switched it.

1121
01:53:48,347 --> 01:53:49,557
He did it to them.

1122
01:53:49,724 --> 01:53:52,314
I mean, the lights were on out here...

1123
01:53:52,852 --> 01:53:54,392
...while he was safe in there.

1124
01:53:56,522 --> 01:53:58,692
Hey, you know something?

1125
01:53:58,858 --> 01:54:01,068
You're a real pain in the neck!

1126
01:54:10,703 --> 01:54:12,503
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

1127
01:54:13,664 --> 01:54:17,424
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A
lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1128
01:54:17,877 --> 01:54:19,747
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1129
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,010
Hey, I was with you all the time.
That was beautiful.

1130
01:54:24,175 --> 01:54:26,335
Did you see the way they
fell into our trap?

1131
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:28,600
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1132
01:54:28,763 --> 01:54:32,183
Look. Look, Superman.

1133
01:54:32,349 --> 01:54:34,389
I got a proposition for you.

1134
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,100
Now, don't stop me till
you've heard this...

1135
01:54:37,271 --> 01:54:40,901
...because I know I owe you one, but
we're in the North Pole, right?

1136
01:54:41,275 --> 01:54:43,185
Let's wipe the slate clean.

1137
01:54:43,402 --> 01:54:47,072
If you give me a ride back, I promise
to turn over a whole new leaf...

1138
01:54:51,035 --> 01:54:54,285
It looks so beautiful from up here.

1139
01:54:54,455 --> 01:54:58,075
I guess I'll never get
to fly with you again.

1140
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:01,290
Oh, no. Anywhere you want to go.

1141
01:55:01,462 --> 01:55:03,552
You don't have to worry.

1142
01:55:03,714 --> 01:55:06,554
I'll never tell them who you really are.

1143
01:55:06,717 --> 01:55:09,717
I know, Lois. I know.

1144
01:55:22,983 --> 01:55:24,983
See you later.

1145
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:58,640
- Hi, Leueen.
- Hm.

1146
01:56:17,288 --> 01:56:22,668
Hi.

1147
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:26,500
How'd you sleep? All right?

1148
01:56:29,967 --> 01:56:33,137
No, I didn't close my eyes all night.

1149
01:56:38,058 --> 01:56:42,018
- Look, Lois--
- I understand, I understand.

1150
01:56:43,522 --> 01:56:48,232
I sat up all night listening
to the voices of reason.

1151
01:56:48,569 --> 01:56:51,569
You know how vile it is to hear
the first bird of the morning...

1152
01:56:51,739 --> 01:56:53,569
...when you've been crying all night?

1153
01:56:53,741 --> 01:56:57,581
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

1154
01:56:58,162 --> 01:57:02,752
I guess it's sort of like being
married to a doctor, you know.

1155
01:57:02,917 --> 01:57:05,497
The doctor gets awakened in
the middle of the night...

1156
01:57:05,669 --> 01:57:08,919
...and the wife has to cope
with the fact that he's gone.

1157
01:57:09,256 --> 01:57:11,256
I guess I'm just too selfish.

1158
01:57:12,009 --> 01:57:14,179
No, no. You're not selfish at all.

1159
01:57:14,345 --> 01:57:18,385
Yes, I am selfish when it comes to you.
I am selfish.

1160
01:57:18,766 --> 01:57:22,436
And I'm jealous of the whole world.

1161
01:57:26,106 --> 01:57:30,936
Lois, it may not be easy for you to
hear this now, but someday you'll--

1162
01:57:31,111 --> 01:57:33,241
Clark...

1163
01:57:33,405 --> 01:57:37,735
Look, don't tell me that
I'll meet somebody.

1164
01:57:38,577 --> 01:57:42,707
You're kind of a tough
act to follow, you know.

1165
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:49,300
Now, I'm gonna be fine. You
don't have to worry about me.

1166
01:57:54,051 --> 01:57:56,591
I like worrying about you.

1167
01:57:57,596 --> 01:58:00,136
Would you stop?

1168
01:58:00,307 --> 01:58:03,427
Don't you know that this is killing me?

1169
01:58:03,602 --> 01:58:07,732
Do you know what it's like to have
you come in here every morning...

1170
01:58:07,898 --> 01:58:10,478
...and not be able to talk to you?

1171
01:58:10,651 --> 01:58:14,281
Not be able to show I have
any feelings for you?

1172
01:58:14,446 --> 01:58:18,236
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

1173
01:58:18,409 --> 01:58:21,239
I don't even know what to call you.

1174
01:58:24,999 --> 01:58:27,329
Lois, I don't know what to say.

1175
01:58:30,504 --> 01:58:34,304
I don't know. Just say that you love me.

1176
01:59:20,012 --> 01:59:23,222
Um... Gee, Lois, are you okay?
What happened?

1177
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:25,180
- I just got so dizzy.
- You all right?

1178
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:28,640
- I don't know.
- Get her some water, will you?

1179
01:59:28,812 --> 01:59:31,362
That's what happens when I
don't have orange juice.

1180
01:59:31,523 --> 01:59:34,983
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine!
- Breathe. Breathe, Lois.

1181
01:59:35,152 --> 01:59:38,742
- I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
- Good for you. Good.

1182
01:59:38,906 --> 01:59:40,986
- God.
- Just drink.

1183
01:59:41,158 --> 01:59:43,738
- Okay.
- Just sip it, sip it, sip it.

1184
01:59:43,911 --> 01:59:45,751
- I'm fine.
- Boy...

1185
01:59:48,499 --> 01:59:50,079
What was I talking about before?

1186
01:59:50,334 --> 01:59:52,924
If I know you, it was
probably about Superman.

1187
01:59:53,587 --> 01:59:55,837
- Him again?
- Clark, Clark.

1188
01:59:56,006 --> 01:59:59,546
You've gotta stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

1189
01:59:59,718 --> 02:00:02,178
Nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

1190
02:00:02,346 --> 02:00:03,886
Well, I'll try to remember that.

1191
02:00:04,056 --> 02:00:06,426
You better remember that.
I appreciate you.

1192
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,680
- You do?
- Sure.

1193
02:00:08,852 --> 02:00:11,522
- Especially if you get me a hamburger.
- Uh-huh.

1194
02:00:11,688 --> 02:00:15,018
A hamburger. At 9 a.m.?

1195
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:17,239
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

1196
02:00:17,402 --> 02:00:19,242
Everything on it.

1197
02:00:19,404 --> 02:00:21,784
- Oh, and--
- Orange juice. Sure.

1198
02:00:21,949 --> 02:00:23,869
Freshly squeezed. Okay.

1199
02:00:24,034 --> 02:00:25,914
Isn't he a nice guy?

1200
02:00:26,453 --> 02:00:30,213
Well, let's see what trouble
I can get into today.

1201
02:00:31,792 --> 02:00:33,962
Leueen.

1202
02:00:34,128 --> 02:00:35,798
What's happening in the world?

1203
02:00:38,715 --> 02:00:40,255
Leueen?

1204
02:00:51,728 --> 02:00:54,268
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1205
02:00:54,439 --> 02:00:56,229
Give me another plate of this garbage.

1206
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,150
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1207
02:00:59,403 --> 02:01:02,993
Ail right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1208
02:01:04,324 --> 02:01:08,664
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1209
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:20,590
Excuse me, sir. I think you're
sitting in my favorite seat.

1210
02:01:20,757 --> 02:01:22,087
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1211
02:01:26,597 --> 02:01:28,507
Now cool it, Rocky.

1212
02:01:29,683 --> 02:01:30,813
Take it easy, will you?

1213
02:01:30,976 --> 02:01:34,436
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1214
02:01:50,996 --> 02:01:53,116
Oh, God!

1215
02:02:04,843 --> 02:02:06,973
This order's to go.

1216
02:02:14,478 --> 02:02:18,558
I'm terribly sorry about
all the damage, sir.

1217
02:02:20,984 --> 02:02:24,864
Oh, I've been, uh, working out.

1218
02:02:48,553 --> 02:02:50,513
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

1219
02:02:50,681 --> 02:02:53,221
Sorry I've been away so long.

1220
02:02:54,017 --> 02:02:56,437
I won't let you down again.
