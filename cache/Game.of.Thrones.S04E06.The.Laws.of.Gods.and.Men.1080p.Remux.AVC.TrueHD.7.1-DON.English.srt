DAVOS:
Easterners have a different sense of time.

Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan
here in Braavos.

Welcome to the Iron Bank.

Please, sit.

11
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,627
What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?

12
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,213
This is Stannis of the House Baratheon,

13
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,424
King of the Andals and the First Men,

14

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

15

The Iron Throne is currently occupied
by Tommen of the House Baratheon,

00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,228
King of the Andals and the First Men,

17
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,981
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

18
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,692
He shares no blood with me.

19
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,362
He is a bastard born of incest.

20
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,282
- As was his brother before him.
- Yes.

21

We have heard this story.

22
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,536
It's not a story. It's the truth.

23
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,540
The king's grandfather tells a different story.

24
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,292
A story about a jealous uncle

25
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,961
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

26
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,838
cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly

27

in blood and gold.

28
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,342
Gold you loaned him.

29
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:04,472
And you feel your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

30
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,183
More than any man living.

Across the Narrow Sea, your books are
filled with words like "usurper"

and "madman" and "blood right."

33

Here, our books are filled with numbers.

34

Less open to interpretation.

How many fighting men remain loyal to you?

38
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,501
4,000.

39
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,419
And how many ships do you have?

- DAVOS: Uh...
- The ones still afloat, Ser Davos,

41
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,924
not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

42
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,678
- (CLEARS THROAT) Thirty-two.
- And how much wheat and barley

43
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,640
and beef and pork
do you produce on Dragonstone

44
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:52,478
to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?

45
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,689
None.

46
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,903
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending

47
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,279
from our perspective.

48
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:08,619
I'm afraid
we must respectfully decline your request.

49

But we thank you for
paying us the honour of your visit.

You would not be either here.

52
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,932
In Braavos,

53
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,643
thieves are not rewarded with titles.

54
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,353
I didn't do the thieving.

55
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,063
That would be the pirates.

56
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,316
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

57
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:44,196
This is the payment that was demanded
by King Stannis for my crimes.

58
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,657
I consider it an honest accounting.

59
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,201
He's an honest man and he's your best chance

60
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,036
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

61
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,373
Which is a lot. Wars are expensive.

62
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:58,085
- The war is over.
- As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.

63
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,921
Who's the real power in King's Landing?

64
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,673
- Ser Davos...
- Humour me.

65
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:06,176
- Tywin Lannister.
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

66
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,303
Sixty-seven.

67
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,347
And when he dies, who's in command?

68
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,765
A half-grown boy,

69
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,601
the product of incest?

70
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,729
Cersei Lannister,
a queen whose people despise her?

71
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:17,813
Jaime Lannister,

72
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,817
a man best known for killing the king
he was sworn to protect?

73
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:25,487
When Tywin's gone, who do you back?

74
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,115
That is a problem for another time.

75
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,619
I think it's a problem for now.

76
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,455
There's only one reliable leader left
in Westeros.

77
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,540
Stannis.

78
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,167
He's got the birthright.

79
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,169
He's in his prime.

80
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,296
He's a tried and tested battle commander.

81
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,591
And he doesn't just talk about
paying people back, he does it.

SALLADHOR: The lookout sees a pirate ship
sailing their way.

The captain shouts to his first mate,

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,935
"Bring me my red shirt."

85
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,813
The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

86
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,565
And when the pirates try to board,

87
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,651
the brave captain leads his men to victory.

88
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,571
A few days later, the lookout screams,

00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,490
"Two pirate ships!"

"Bring me my red shirt!"

93
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,375
After the battle, the first mate asks,

94
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,170
"Captain, why do you call for your red shirt
before battle?"

95
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,880
The captain replies,

96
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,634
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

97
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,428
The next morning the lookout screams,

98
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:35,265
"Ten pirate ships! We are surrounded!"

99
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,143
The crew goes silent.

100
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,688
They all look to their brave captain,

101
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,773
waiting for his usual command.

make the common soldier

325

More whispers from the east, my lord.

The Targaryen girl?

330
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,939
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.

331
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,401
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

332

Conquered with what?

333

my queen.

Some 8,000 strong.

335
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,076
She has a company of sellswords,
the Second Sons.

336
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,246
She has two knights advising her,

337
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,541
Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.

338
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,501
And she has three dragons.

339
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,919
Baby dragons.

340
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,338
Larger every year, Your Grace.

341
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,592
Mormont is spying on her for us.

342
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,803
No longer.
He appears to be fully devoted to her.

343
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,388
As for Ser Barristan,

344
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:43,186
it would seem he took his dismissal from
the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.

345
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,937
He's an old man.

346
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,939
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

347
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,692
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

348
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,612
Dismissing him was
as insulting as it was stupid.

349
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:56,073
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

350
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:59,452
A child with
two seasoned warriors counselling her

351

Lord Varys is right.

353

I have been to Essos
and seen the Unsullied firsthand.

354
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,546
They are very impressive on the battlefield.

Less so in the bedroom.

Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.

find their way into Meereen?

Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.

368
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,729
No one is under obligation to call me lord.

369
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,439
And yet everyone does.

370
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,570
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

371
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,530
Did you spend much time in Essos?

372
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,490
Five years.

373
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,951
May I ask why?

374

'Tis a big and beautiful world.

I have an ear for accents.

382
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,270
I've lost my accent entirely.

383

I have an ear for that as well.

384
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,064
Hmm.

385

How did you get here?

386
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,485
It's a long story.

387

One you don't like telling people.

389
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,328
My paramour Ellaria,
she would find you very interesting.

390
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,663
You should come to the brothel and meet her.

391
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,958
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they serve here.

392
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:14,003
We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...

I hope you won't be offended when I say
I never would have guessed.

397
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,268
Not at all.

398
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:32,188
But I was never interested in girls, either.

- Nothing.

Not me.

what it's done to this country,

I am very glad to have no part in it.

Besides, the absence of desire

405

Your own brother said this to you?

491
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:32,691
Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

492
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:36,820
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

493
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:43,369
As it turned out, when the attack came,
Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.

494
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:47,122
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

495
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,876
Tyrion said,

496
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,087
"And you will know the debt is paid."

497
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,255
What debt?

498
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:59,968
I discovered he'd been keeping whores
in the Tower of the Hand.

499
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,763
I asked him to confine his salacious acts

500
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,307
to the brothel where such behaviour belongs.

501
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,142
He wasn't pleased.

502
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:14,233
Thank you, Your Grace,
for the courage of your testimony.

the precise nature of this threat?

VARYS: I'm afraid I do, my lord.

505
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:39,007
He said, "Perhaps you should speak
more softly to me, then.

at a meeting of the Small Council?

After we received word of Robb Stark's death.

511
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,856
He didn't seem gladdened by the news.

512
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,024
Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark

513
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,402
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

Father, may I ask the witness one question?

517
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,546
One.

518
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,926
You once said

519
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,555
that without me,
this city would have faced certain defeat.

520
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,267
You said the histories
would never mention me,

521
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,020
but you would not forget.

522

I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.

531

This isn't a trial. It's a farce.

Cersei has manipulated everything
and you know it.

the Mad King gave me?

To bring him your head.

I saved your life
so you could murder my brother?

- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.

He'll plead for mercy.
I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.

- Oh, you think so?
- And when you are,

you need to enter a formal plea for mercy

That was before he married Sansa.

After that, all he wanted was her.

But she wouldn't let him into her bed.
