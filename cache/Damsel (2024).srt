1
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,980
<i>There are many stories of chivalry

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,400
<i>where the heroic knight
saves the damsel in distress.

3
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,060
<i>This is not one of them.

4
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,150
There it is.

5
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,400
Form up!

6
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,480
Let's kill the beast.

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,980
For glory! Hyah!

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,440
Be on guard.

9
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,360
Form the line!

10
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,900
Hold!

11
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,860
The last I could find.

12
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,020
Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?

13
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,440
This morning.

14
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,650
We should take the furs too,
and the drapes.

15
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,650
Not the drapes!

16
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,020
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

17
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,730
They serve a purpose.

18
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,650
Floria, our people are freezing.

19
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,650
And starving.

20
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,900
Who'd come this far north?

21
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,230
Elodie, why are they leaving?

22
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,440
There's nothing left
for them here, Floria.

23
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,980
I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry.

24
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,520
For food, join the line!

25
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,650
-  Keep to one side.
-  I'm starving.

26
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,110
All right then.

27
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,810
Get off! It's mine!

28
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,940
- Hey! Give me back my food.
- Get off of me, old man!

29
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,110
You've had enough!

30
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,400
Share this
with your sister. Go on.

31
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,860
- Could you see who it was?
-  A stranger, my lady.

32
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,190
They may take
whatever wood they can carry.

33
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,730
- I'll see to it.
- Come on, Flor.

34
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,230
-  Move on.
-  Yes.

35
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,770
-  Get in line.
- Give it to me.

36
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,770
-  I want to meet her first.
- Father?

37
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,360
You must be Elodie.

38
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
I am.

39
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,940
She will do.

40
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,650
-  We await your decision.
- Thank you, Your Holiness.

41
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Please, this way.

42
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,360
Father, what's happening?

43
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,400
Who is that?

44
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,110
Stepmother?

45
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,860
Well, what is it?

46
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,400
From the Queen of Aurea.

47
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,230
A proposal.

48
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,360
- Oh, my goodness.
-  Huh...

49
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,610
- I have made a match.
- May I?

50
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,900
Uh-huh.

51
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,150
He is a prince.

52
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,900
A prince?

53
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,980
I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother.

54
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,230
Go. See the world.

55
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,400
This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold.

56
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,770
That's no reason to marry.

57
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,150
We need this.

58
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,020
Our stores are empty.

59
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,150
We will not make it to the thaw.

60
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,690
Your people need you.

61
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,310
Hey.

62
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,310
This is who we are.

63
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,110
Get to the port side.

64
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,900
Port side.

65
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,730
Elodie, what's the matter?

66
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,650
Nothing.

67
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,520
Father says it's natural to be nervous

68
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,770
about meeting
your new husband and his family.

69
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,900
They're strangers.

70
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,110
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me.

71
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,360
Mind the lines.

72
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,770
Oh!

73
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,440
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?

74
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,150
Come down here.

75
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,270
Come on.

76
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,940
This is how you
want your prince to meet you?

77
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,060
Scared, cold as a corpse.

78
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,310
Nose all drippy and wet.

79
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,770
What have I been
telling you this entire trip?

80
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,690
-  First impressions are everything.
- Hmm.

81
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,110
Come on, lift up.

82
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,230
Look at that.

83
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,860
I have good news, girls.

84
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,190
The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline.

85
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,190
It should be any time now.

86
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,400
Father.

87
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,980
What in the world?

88
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,400
Looks almost... almost like a--

89
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,560
A dragon.

90
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,400
- It's okay.

91
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,810
Oh, my heavens.

92
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,060
It's magnificent.

93
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,610
My lords, my ladies,

94
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,230
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

95
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,060
The royal family is at prayer,

96
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,310
but word has been sent of your arrival.

97
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,150
In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready.

98
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,110
If you will follow me.

99
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,440
 Is this a dream?

100
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,400
If so, can I move in and never wake up?

101
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,020
If you want these people
to think we belong here,

102
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,270
you can't act so easily impressed.

103
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,110
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

104
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,190
I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy.

105
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,560
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

106
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,230
A bath has been drawn

107
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
and supper has been carried hence.

108
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,650
At first light,
I shall return to convey you

109
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,770
to meet His Royal Highness.

110
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

111
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,560
Floria,
stop touching everything.

112
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,900
Is something wrong?

113
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,360
- I just hope he's kind.
- Hmm.

114
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,610
- And well-read.
- Yeah.

115
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,190
Handsome.

116
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,440
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

117
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,810
She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could.

118
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,110
Oh, indeed.

119
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,980
Come.

120
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,480
M'lady.

121
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,770
Everyone's waiting.

122
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,610
Ellie?

123
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,730
I can't sleep.

124
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,480
I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on.

125
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,520
You and me both.

126
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,230
I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,

127
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,690
I could just
talk to her about all of this.

128
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,270
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

129
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,440
She means well, even if she is a bit...

130
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,230
- Exhausting?

131
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
It'll be fine. You'll see.

132
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,480
You're Elodie. You can do anything.

133
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
<i>What is your greatest strength?

134
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,110
I always tell the truth,
Your Majesty.

135
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,810
Some might call that a weakness.

136
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,270
Do you know your heart?

137
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,940
I believe I do, Your Majesty.

138
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,150
And what is it telling you now?

139
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,230
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,730
Arise, Elodie.

141
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,110
I'm Henry.

142
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

143
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,400
We all are.

144
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,150
My son understates our joy.

145
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,230
And if I may say so,

146
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,400
your father has understated your beauty.

147
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,610
I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty.

148
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,770
I see she arrives
with some wit.

149
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,190
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

150
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,730
And you must be Floria.

151
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,770
It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers.

152
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,690
I love your castle.

153
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,150
I mean, I <i>really</i> love it.

154
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,060
Like, a lot...

155
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,980
Your Majesty.

156
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
You are to make yourself at home, child.

157
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,310
We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to.

158
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,310
Yes...

159
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,400
Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars

160
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,520
you wish to discuss in person.

161
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,440
- The two of us can confer in private.
- Yes.

162
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,730
It's nothing to bore
our young people with.

163
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,060
They have a far more
important task at hand.

164
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,060
They must get to know each other.

165
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,230
Do you have any questions of me?

166
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,480
Questions of what subject?

167
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,560
You may choose the subject.

168
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,810
What do you think about me?

169
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,310
Pardon?

170
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,730
Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,

171
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,520
but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying

172
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,980
truly likes me or not.

173
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,650
If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent.

174
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,860
However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything.

175
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,020
The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained.

176
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,230
Harsh and barren.

177
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,190
This union will save us.

178
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,810
I've made my peace with it.

179
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,110
My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people.

180
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,860
Is something wrong?

181
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
It's just...

182
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,860
In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different.

183
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,650
Different. In what way?

184
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,730
Far more, um...

185
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
flowery.

186
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,560
Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it

187
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,060
and my sister's idea was the heart...

188
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,560
- The heart.
- Mmm.

189
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,150
I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia.

190
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,810
You actually drew this?

191
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,190
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

192
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,150
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

193
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,730
That is very clever.

194
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,230
I used to make them
for Floria when she was little.

195
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,690
- May I ask you another question?
- Certainly.

196
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,440
Do they always follow you so closely?

197
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,310
This is them giving me space.

198
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,980
That must be tiring.

199
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,560
It is, actually.

200
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,650
I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables.

201
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,440
Do you ride?

202
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,690
Hyah!

203
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,520
- Where did you learn to ride like that?
- My mother.

204
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,230
Which way now?

205
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,400
Well, depends on what you want to see.

206
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Everything.

207
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,690
Very well.

208
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,860
What happened in there?

209
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,940
Speak already.

210
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,270
- Is the wedding still on?
- Aye.

211
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,690
You settled on a fair bride price?

212
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,230
More gold than I could ever imagine.

213
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,400
Then why do you look so?

214
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,060
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

215
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,610
Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us.

216
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,150
No, I did not.

217
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,060
Because it's very important
that our two families get along.

218
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,360
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

219
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,980
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.

220
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,440
I saw something,
high on the mountain last night.

221
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Torches.

222
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,270
You saw that?

223
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,520
I couldn't sleep.

224
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,230
It was an ancient ceremony.

225
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,110
Or rather, one of three.

226
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,650
They're very significant to my family.

227
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,360
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um...

228
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,730
They honor our ancestors.

229
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,440
That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding.

230
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,810
It is quite beautiful.

231
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,940
Yes, I suppose.

232
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,520
I really don't have
anything else to compare it to.

233
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,230
May I confide in you something?

234
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,150
Yes.

235
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,900
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

236
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,690
Really set out and see it, you know?

237
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,480
I do, actually.

238
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,940
It's my life's dream.

239
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,810
For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands.

240
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,310
The ones you only read about.

241
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,270
Perhaps, one day, we will.

242
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,400
Perhaps.

243
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,560
And the orange in this area.

244
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,110
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

245
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,770
Well, I'm glad you approve.

246
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,230
Very elegant.

247
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,860
You have impeccable taste.

248
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,440
Everything is just so exquisite.

249
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,270
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?

250
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,860
I just thought
we might become better acquainted,

251
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,810
seeing as we're about to be family.

252
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,440
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

253
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

254
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,310
The finest in the city.

255
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,060
And here you are. You've climbed so high.

256
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,110
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

257
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,980
Nor place undue import

258
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,810
on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity.

259
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,110
Uh... "Necessity"?

260
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,310
Well, your family needs money.

261
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,560
My family needs a bride.

262
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,900
What we don't need is more family.

263
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,690
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

264
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,110
- I merely--
- Elodie.

265
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,440
Pardon?

266
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,520
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.

267
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,110
That's what I said.

268
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,400
Good day, Lady Bayford.

269
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,360
It's perfect.

270
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,940
Everything in here is so perfect.

271
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,230
Stepmother.

272
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,360
Is something the matter?

273
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,770
Elodie,

274
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,150
I know we haven't always been close,

275
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,900
but I need you to listen to me now.

276
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,730
This wedding... is a mistake.

277
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,810
What?

278
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,560
I don't understand.

279
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,060
These people, I don't trust them.

280
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,150
It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things.

281
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,360
Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place.

282
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,400
Floria.

283
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,560
I was wrong.

284
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,860
They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people.

285
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,110
Well...

286
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,310
- What does Father think?
- He refuses to talk about it.

287
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,560
And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me.

288
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,360
- Because you're being unreasonable.
- That's enough, Flor.

289
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,110
Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you.

290
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,110
Am I interrupting something?

291
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,860
No.

292
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,610
Just...

293
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,110
girl talk.

294
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,520
Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest.

295
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,230
Think about what I said.
There's still time.

296
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,650
Time for what?

297
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,150
I hope you know
what you're doing.

298
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,020
Good night, my angels.

299
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,810
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Father.

300
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,940
Good night.

301
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,150
Wow.

302
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,690
You may kiss the bride.

303
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,560
I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

304
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,270
Goodbye, Father.

305
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,940
I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today.

306
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,360
Twice as beautiful.

307
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,400
- I love you.
- I love you.

308
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,860
Hey! Hey, hey!

309
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,230
Where are we going?

310
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,520
Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

311
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,440
Yes.

312
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,440
We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors.

313
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,770
Welcome, Princess.

314
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,190
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,

315
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,610
to protect our people.

316
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,190
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

317
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,560
So, tonight,

318
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,150
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.

319
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,060
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,

320
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,310
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.

321
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,560
A creature dwelt here first.

322
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,190
The last of its kind.

323
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,310
With savage bloodlust,

324
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,860
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.

325
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,270
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.

326
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,480
But their steel
was no match for the monster,

327
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,900
and each man met his end.

328
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,150
Each save one.

329
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,610
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.

330
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,270
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.

331
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,730
A cruel torture.

332
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,900
He adored his daughters,

333
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,150
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

334
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,610
And so, a pact was made.

335
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,060
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,

336
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,730
and a kingdom was born.

337
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,020
It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.

338
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,520
A tradition going back centuries.

339
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,190
Your hand, child.

340
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:07,810
A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

341
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,560
Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one.

342
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,480
She is now of royal blood.

343
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,690
To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,

344
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,900
pay your due to the realm.

345
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,310
Toss the coin into the chasm.

346
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,150
The ceremony is now complete.

347
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,020
You may make your return.

348
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,690
I'm supposed to carry you back.

349
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,770
I'm fine with walking, really.

350
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,980
Floria would love this part.

351
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,020
Close your eyes.

352
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,230
I've got you.

353
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm sorry.

354
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,900
No!

355
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,730
Help me!

356
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,400
Help!

357
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,610
Is anyone there?!

358
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,110
That's not mine.

359
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,770
I am the sacrifice.

360
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,690
I am the sacrifice?

361
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,810
You poor thing.

362
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,150
What happened to you?

363
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,610
Give me strength, Mother.

364
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,810
Mother?

365
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,230
Your name, little bird?

366
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,440
Speak your name.

367
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,310
Elodie.

368
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,440
El-o-die.

369
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,480
Exciting.

370
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,520
What do you want?

371
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,440
I want... what is promised.

372
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,980
What is owed.

373
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:07,150
Every generation, your kind must pay.

374
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,860
My kind?

375
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,270
The scent of royalty betrays you.

376
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,360
It's in your blood.

377
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:38,730
Now, my favorite part.

378
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,480
- Run.

379
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,980
Did I hurt you?

380
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,560
Quiet now?

381
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,560
A clever one.

382
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,650
The last one was over so quick.

383
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,150
No.

384
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,060
Mother wanted you to fight.

385
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,980
No. No.

386
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,150
<i>He is a prince.

387
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,060
<i>They must
get to know each other.

388
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,900
<i>My greatest wish
is to go see the world.

389
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,900
<i>Perhaps, one day we will.

390
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,110
One for the dress.

391
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,610
Don't worry.

392
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,400
I won't hurt you.

393
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,560
Almost caught you, little bird.

394
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,770
You hide now, like all the others.

395
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,940
It makes no difference.

396
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,400
This story always ends the same.

397
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,060
V.

398
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,310
Victoria.

399
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,860
Beatrice.

400
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,810
Artemis.

401
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:45,770
Genevive.

402
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,610
Fatima.

403
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,810
Carlotta.

404
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,520
How many?

405
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,230
Did anyone make it out?

406
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,730
Please, don't.

407
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,690
Somebody...

408
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,150
It's a lie.

409
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,230
Get off.

410
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,230
I'm deeply sorry...

411
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,940
for underestimating you.

412
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,730
A map.

413
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,650
Now, where am I?

414
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,190
A tree.

415
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,190
<i>The entrance cave.

416
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:20,770
Following down into the bird cave.

417
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,900
Through the twisted tunnel...

418
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:29,730
reaching water.

419
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,310
<i>The glowworm cave.

420
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:35,980
Keep following down.

421
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,520
I am here.

422
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,520
How do I escape?

423
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,810
Is this it?

424
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,060
Did a princess make it out?

425
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,770
Three ways. Take the middle fork.

426
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,900
Music note.

427
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,400
Crystals.

428
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:07,900
Go on.

429
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:12,150
And then... I am free.

430
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,650
The middle fork.

431
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,480
Music.

432
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,690
Crystals.

433
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,560
This is it.

434
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,400
Wish me luck.

435
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,150
You made it out.

436
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,690
No!

437
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:04,650
Elodie.

438
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,270
Fly, little bird.

439
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,060
Hello.

440
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,230
Hello!

441
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,650
I'm here! Help!

442
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,900
Help!

443
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,610
Hello!

444
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:36,020
There is no way out, Princess.

445
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,690
Not for any of you.

446
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:43,980
Three were taken.

447
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,480
Three must be given.

448
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,810
Elodie!

449
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,270
What's this?

450
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:10,980
Elodie!

451
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,270
Elodie!

452
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:32,110
Move on.

453
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,020
I've done what you paid for, milord.
I'll just wait up top.

454
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,770
You'll do no such thing.

455
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:43,020
I hired you to guide us to her.

456
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:47,440
No one leaves here without my daughter.

457
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,770
Elodie!

458
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,980
Elodie!

459
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,810
<i>A creature dwelt here first.

460
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,610
<i>The last of its kind.

461
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,060
It's a lie.

462
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:56,900
Three taken.

463
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,190
Slay the vile young.

464
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,730
Form the line!

465
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,150
Please, spare me.

466
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,980
Show mercy.

467
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,190
I will give you anything.

468
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,400
Death is not enough for you.

469
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,230
You will know my pain.

470
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,730
Elodie!

471
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,110
Elodie!

472
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,310
Elodie!

473
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,020
Elodie!

474
01:09:46,110 --> 01:09:49,020
Be quiet. She can hear you.

475
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:54,110
I warned you. It's too late.
The beast lurks in its lair.

476
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:58,440
- It's surely taken her there to devour--
- This lair. Where is it?

477
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,150
Sir, your daughter's been
down here nigh on too long.

478
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,310
She's almost certainly been killed.

479
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,020
Elodie!

480
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:11,150
I'm told some have tried
to hunt the beast.

481
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:13,440
For its blood.

482
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:15,900
Nonsense.

483
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:21,060
Why are you here?

484
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,860
I'm here for my daughter.

485
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:26,230
Father.

486
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,860
Father.

487
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:10,810
Please.

488
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,360
I beg of you.

489
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:27,610
It's not my mercy that you should seek.

490
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,360
Call her.

491
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,400
She's alive?

492
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:34,860
Elodie's still alive?

493
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,060
I smell her.

494
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,150
Hiding.

495
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:43,020
Watching.

496
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,190
Call her.

497
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:56,020
No.

498
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:59,310
Call her.

499
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,400
Elodie.

500
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:08,900
Can you hear me?

501
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:19,150
I have... I have made a horrible,
horrible mistake.

502
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,020
To sacrifice the one thing I love most.

503
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,230
To trade your life

504
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,560
for the good of my people.

505
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,520
I thought that I could take the gold.

506
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:38,860
That I could live with myself.

507
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,520
My choice.

508
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,520
But I can't.

509
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:49,690
I can't.

510
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,150
Tell her to come to you.

511
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:07,860
Last chance.

512
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,360
Elodie. Hear me.

513
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:20,310
I am your father. You will obey me.

514
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,270
I order you.

515
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,190
Do not come out!

516
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:30,650
No.

517
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,770
No!

518
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,900
Ellie.

519
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,060
Use the ropes.

520
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,810
Your stepmother and Floria,

521
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:46,730
they wait for you at the ship.

522
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,440
Forgive me.

523
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,110
Go! Go! Go!

524
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,060
Go.

525
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:46,150
That damn girl. I knew she was trouble.

526
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,730
- Where are you going?
- To fix this.

527
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:26,060
-  Stop.
-  Stand back.

528
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,400
Elodie.

529
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:39,610
Open up!

530
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,440
- Get out of the way!

531
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,110
Get out!

532
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,060
Seize her.

533
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:53,400
You can't!

534
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,270
- No! She's just a child!
-  No!

535
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,900
You promised us a daughter.

536
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,190
- Stepmother!
- No!

537
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,690
Floria!

538
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,150
Elodie.

539
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,110
Stepmother.

540
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,400
- Elodie.
- Stepmother.

541
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,860
Oh!

542
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:11,110
Thank God.

543
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,650
Are you all right?

544
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:13,690
I can manage.

545
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:16,060
Where's Floria?

546
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:18,980
They took her to the caves in your place.

547
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,110
I tried to stop them
from taking your sister.

548
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:22,400
I have to save her.

549
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,980
No, I'll go. I can find her.

550
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,190
It may be too late.

551
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,060
No.

552
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,270
Not if I can help it.

553
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,650
Your father...

554
01:21:36,650 --> 01:21:37,900
Go.

555
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:47,440
Please. Let me go!

556
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,650
Please let me go.

557
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,360
No, don't do this.

558
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,730
Mother, enough! She's too young.

559
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:58,940
A prince protects his kingdom,
without hesitation or complaint.

560
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,060
Give me your hand.

561
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:03,190
I cannot do this. She's just a child.

562
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:05,900
You're weak.

563
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:09,520
No! Please don't do this to me!

564
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,730
Get off of me!

565
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:19,020
Let go! Off of me!

566
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:20,270
Throw her in.

567
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,270
Floria!

568
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:48,650
Floria!

569
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:52,020
Floria!

570
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,900
I'm coming for you, Flor.

571
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:47,810
My little ones...

572
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,440
They did not let you live.

573
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:58,060
Nor shall I let Elodie.

574
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:12,690
Your sister will come for you.

575
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,900
There she is now.

576
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:56,900
Hello, Floria. Floria, can you hear me?

577
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:58,690
Wake up!

578
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:00,480
We need to hurry.

579
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,610
Floria!

580
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:03,110
Ellie.

581
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:07,610
Elodie, you're alive.

582
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:11,060
Okay. I'm going to get you out of here.

583
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:18,310
My leg. I hurt it when I fell.

584
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:21,230
We don't have time, Flor.

585
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,810
No, no, no. Not yet.

586
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:34,940
What now?

587
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:36,440
You have to hide quickly.

588
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,690
What about you?

589
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:39,230
I must tell her the truth.

590
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:40,190
Come on.

591
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,230
Where are you hiding?

592
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,650
Dragon.

593
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,270
That won't kill me,

594
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,730
but it will make me angry.

595
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:16,060
Good.

596
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,730
I'm angry too.

597
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,150
We have both been lied to.

598
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:27,730
They said you set upon their village.

599
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,150
That the king came
only to defend his people.

600
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:33,810
He came unprovoked.

601
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:36,400
I know what they did.

602
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:38,610
I know they killed your children.

603
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:41,690
"They"? You!

604
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:44,230
Your kind, your blood.

605
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:45,150
No!

606
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:48,980
My daughters were the last of my line.

607
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:53,190
So, I will take their daughters
until my final breath.

608
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,110
Except you haven't.
We are not their daughters.

609
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:58,860
More lies.

610
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:37,730
Ellie!

611
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:56,900
Now, you will know my daughters' pain.

612
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,610
I am not one of them!

613
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:54,020
I smell it in your blood.

614
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:23,520
El-o-die.

615
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:28,150
Accept your fate...

616
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:36,110
as I have mine.

617
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:43,810
We are to die alone.

618
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:52,440
No.

619
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,980
I have an army with me.

620
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:04,520
Every innocent woman
whose life was stolen down here.

621
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:11,060
Your kind were never innocent.

622
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:19,480
Then go ahead.

623
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:25,310
Show me your fire.

624
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,060
Well?

625
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,860
What are you waiting for?

626
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,060
Burn me.

627
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:41,730
Burn me!

628
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:47,310
My sister had this too.

629
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:49,860
All of us did.

630
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,980
That is how they make us royal.

631
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,560
That is the blood you smell.

632
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,230
They fooled you.

633
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:13,560
You've been killing
innocent daughters just like they did.

634
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:24,650
Then, end it.

635
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:51,980
No.

636
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:59,110
I'm through doing what I'm told.

637
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:19,980
Elodie.

638
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:29,650
You must believe me.
I haven't slept a moment since--

639
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:31,560
Since you tried to kill my sister?

640
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,060
I had no choice.

641
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:37,110
Don't you dare explain yourself to this...

642
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:38,770
this commoner.

643
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,690
Is she to be the third?

644
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:47,150
Princess number three.

645
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:52,360
She's the last,
and then I'll be free to marry whoever I--

646
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,110
That's enough, Henry.

647
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,480
You know nothing of what we've endured.

648
01:36:58,150 --> 01:37:00,400
You know nothing of our story.

649
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:10,110
Take your family

650
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,270
and run.

651
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:16,650
Come. Let's go.

652
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,940
I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same.

653
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,270
No?

654
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,860
You insolent creature.

655
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:37,650
You think we ought to fear you now?

656
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:39,900
Why?

657
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:43,860
Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?

658
01:37:47,650 --> 01:37:49,810
It's not me you should fear.

659
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:54,400
This is the end of your story.

660
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,480
Run!

661
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,520
-  It's the dragon!
-  Run!

662
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:42,940
No!

663
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,230
Someone give me a hand
with this barrel.

664
01:39:31,310 --> 01:39:32,980
Let's be sharp there, lads.

665
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:35,230
You can't be serious.

666
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:36,190
But I am.

667
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,020
We'll run it together.

668
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:39,690
We've got a bounty of supplies.

669
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:42,150
Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next.

670
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:43,270
Oh, Elodie.

671
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,560
You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother.

672
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,610
Can I help too?

673
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,730
Floria.

674
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:02,900
I'm counting on it.

675
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:14,650
Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this.

676
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:16,310
Oh, wide heavens!

677
