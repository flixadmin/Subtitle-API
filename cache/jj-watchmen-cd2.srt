1
00:00:00,645 --> 00:00:02,579
But who'd wanna kill us now?

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:07,009
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

3
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,525
So no word from Jon?

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,087
No.

5
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:19,362
Well, listen...

6
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,559
...why don't you come stay with me?

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,892
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,738
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

9
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:33,908
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

10
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:38,543
Okay.

11
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:47,057
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 21 st, 1985.</i>

12
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:51,321
<i>On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.</i>

13
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:54,658
<i>They didn't know me without my mask.</i>

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,161
<i>An affair?</i>

15
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:01,271
<i>Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile...</i>

16
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,373
<i>...make room for Dreiberg?</i>

17
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:07,372
<i>Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?</i>

18
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,183
<i>Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.</i>

19
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:19,518
<i>At his apartment, I found clues.</i>

20
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:24,422
<i>Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.</i>

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,027
<i>I've seen the logo before...</i>

22
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:29,459
<i>...at Moloch's.</i>

23
00:01:33,704 --> 00:01:36,639
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

24
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:40,273
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

25
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,572
More than a just delivery service,
I take it.

26
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:46,683
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check
written from the same company.

27
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:50,343
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

28
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:54,116
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

29
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,623
Rorschach.

30
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:03,164
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

31
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,199
No. No!

32
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,497
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

33
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:11,608
No. No, no, no!

34
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:16,179
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

35
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:17,974
Never, never surrender.

36
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:21,141
All right.
I hope you're ready, hero.

37
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,343
When you are.

38
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,066
One...

39
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:52,140
...two...

40
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:57,212
...three.

41
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:50,970
Come on.

42
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,219
Son of a bitch.

43
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:06,588
- Christ, he stinks.
- Get that mask off him.

44
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:09,590
- I got it.
- No. No!

45
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,456
My face! Give me back my face!

46
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:15,925
<i>The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...</i>

47
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,934
<i>...and identified
as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.</i>

48
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:23,164
<i>Little's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...</i>

49
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:27,175
<i>...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.</i>

50

<i>Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...</i>

51
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:33,108
<i>...during the violent course
of the capture.</i>

52
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,218
Rorschach!

53
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

54
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:51,701
Come on out, Rorschach!

55
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:54,099
<i>Walter Kovacs.</i>

56
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:57,139
Is that your name? Walter?

57
00:04:57,308 --> 00:05:01,369
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

58
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:03,103
You cooperate with me...

59
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:07,775
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

60
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:11,513
In a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

61
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:17,719
But the authorities wanna put you
with the general population.

62
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:21,656
- Prison's a prison.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

63
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,702
But the difference is, down there...

64
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,635
...you'd be eaten alive.

65
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:32,838
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

66
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:37,380
Tell me what you see.

67
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,214
A pretty butterfly.

68
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:49,856
What about now? What do you see here?

69
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,023
Mom?

70
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,765
Is he hurting you?

71
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:00,802
You got a fucking kid in here.
I get that at home.

72
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:04,498
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

73
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,085
Some nice flowers.

74
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,453
<i>I heard this guy's mom's a whore.</i>

75
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:28,493
Did you catch any diseases from her?

76
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:33,467
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

77
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:38,003
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

78
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:57,753
Clouds.

79
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,430
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

80
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:09,130
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

81
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:14,405
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

82
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:15,943
You're fat.

83
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:19,675
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

84
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,746
You wanna know about Rorschach?

85
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:26,348
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

86
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,659
<i>I was investigating a kidnap case.</i>

87
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:34,261
<i>Blaire Roche.</i>

88
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:37,868
<i>Six-year-old girl. I was young then.</i>

89
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:41,068
<i>Too soft on criminals.</i>

90
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:43,633
<i>I let them live.</i>

91
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:50,643
<i>Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.</i>

92
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:00,689
<i>I knew the girl was here...</i>

93
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:04,385
<i>...but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.</i>

94
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:07,696
<i>And then I found her.</i>

95
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:02,581
<i>It was dark when the murderer got back.</i>

96
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,753
<i>As dark as it gets.</i>

97
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:39,721
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

98
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:42,651
Who is it?

99
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,806
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

100
00:09:56,974 --> 00:10:01,468
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

101
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:11,011
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

102
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,656
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

103
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:24,363
Okay. I confess.

104
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,265
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

105
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,438
Arrest me.

106
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:32,970
What? Arrest me!

107
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:36,546
I did it! I said I did it!

108
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,147
Christ.

109
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:42,615
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

110
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,155
No, don't. Don't do that.
Take me in. Don't! No!

111
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:58,624
Men get arrested.

112
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:02,062
Dogs get put down.

113
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:09,038
<i>Tremors of impact shook my arm.</i>

114
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,779
Warm blood splashed my face.

115
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:18,114
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

116
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,353
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

117
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:25,657
See, doctor,
God didn't kill that little girl.

118
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,294
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

119
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:34,904
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

120
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,638
From then on, I knew:

121
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:42,309
God doesn't make the world this way.

122
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:45,804
We do.

123
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:47,677
<i>Hey, Rorschach.</i>

124
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,277
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

125
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:54,115
Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

126
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,852
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

127
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:00,553
- Ain't that right? That's right.
That's right.

128
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,430
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

129
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:24,212
None of you seem to understand.
I'm not locked in here with you.

130
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:26,481
All right, that's it!

131
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,758
You're locked in here with me.

132
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:32,680
Laurie!

133
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,222
Shit.

134
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,126
Hold on.
- Fuck.

135
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:42,888
I got it, I got it, I got it.

136
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:50,972
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

137
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,574
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

138
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:55,837
- Okay.
- I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

139
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,004
No, don't worry.

140
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:01,481
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

141
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:04,417
Archie survived that.

142
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,186
Archie?

143
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:10,382
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

144
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,085
...Merlin's pet owl.

145
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:14,858
Stupid nickname.

146
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,663
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

147
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:24,365
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

148
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:28,441
...which always surprised me.
I mean, he was...

149
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,740
I think he was disappointed
I went into crime fighting...

150
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:33,610
...instead of following him.

151
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:41,381
Guess I was just more interested in
birds and airplanes, mythology and...

152
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:45,455
Must be nice having a secret identity.

153
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:48,290
A secret place that nobody knows about.

154
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:53,459
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

155
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:57,304
Nobody watching you.

156
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:01,702
Wanna try those on?

157
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,150
There we go.

158
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:19,318
Wow, these rock.

159
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:24,463
They amplify the spectral range.

160
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:26,762
Thermal imaging.

161
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,429
They work even better in the dark.

162
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:37,108
You can see me, right?

163
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,945
I can see everything.

164
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:48,180
I remember, no matter how black it got...

165
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:52,655
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

166
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,297
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

167
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,636
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

168
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:04,966
Put those away when you're done.

169
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:15,743
<i>Soviets are
finding themselves bogged down...</i>

170
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,648
<i>...in bloody house-to-house fighting.</i>

171
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:20,381
<i>Casualties on both sides
are said to be in the hundreds.</i>

172
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:23,617
<i>Civilian deaths are also alarmingly high.</i>

173
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,489
Dan.

174
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,958
Jon sees a lot of things...

175
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,665
...but he doesn't see me.

176
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,334
Well, uh...

177
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,121
Oh.

178
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,296
Sorry.

179
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,632
Come here.

180
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:46,837
What's the matter?

181
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,444
- If you could just move a little...
- Okay.

182
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:50,637
Yeah. There you go.

183
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:52,975
<i>Soviet ambassador to the U.N.
had no comment...</i>

184
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,414
<i>...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's
disappearance...</i>

185
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:58,179
<i>...has fueled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.</i>

186
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,983
Dan, what's wrong?

187
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:03,785
Sorry, I...

188
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,159
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

189
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,358
Oh, hell.

190
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:16,503
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

191
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:18,664
Big Figure.

192
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:20,840
Small world.

193
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:23,669
I like that.

194
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:26,848
But you know, it is a small world in here.

195
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:30,048
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

196
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,347
Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

197
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:34,020
That's right.

198
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:38,517
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

199
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:42,691
So...

200
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,967
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

201
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:53,337
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

202
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,844
I been talking to every one of them
and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

203
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:01,313
This place is gonna explode!

204
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:05,548
Then, you die by inches.

205
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,151
Tall order.

206
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:10,882
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

207
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:14,553
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

208
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:16,729
Come on.

209
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:39,479
Dan?

210
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:47,984
Is everything all right?

211
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:53,262
I'm tired of being afraid.

212
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:56,697
Afraid of war...

213
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,061
...afraid of the mask killer...

214
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:05,869
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

215
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,010
...and how much I need it.

216
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,506
Me too.

217
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:13,312
So to hell with it.

218
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:15,515
Let's take Archie out.

219
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,584
You're serious.

220
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:25,284
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

221
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:28,693
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

222
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:32,525
<i>Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.</i>

223
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:35,256
<i>Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.</i>

224
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:36,763
Let's go.

225
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:43,904
I can see it.
All right, hold on.

226
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:56,182
Dan, there are kids in there.

227
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:58,514
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

228
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,883
<i>We're gonna get you out of there.</i>

229
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:03,218
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

230
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:04,860
I'm gonna get you close.

231
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,985
Let's go.

232
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:07,282
Watch your step.
All right.

233
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:10,650
We're all set.

234
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:13,355
Is that everyone?

235
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:40,219
Bye.
Bye!

236
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:45,385
I can't believe we did that.

237
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:49,831
- They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
- Who cares?

238
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,967
World War llI could start tomorrow.

239
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,401
Right?

240
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:58,404
Right.

241
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,934
Come back here!

242
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,234
He's dead, Rorschach.

243
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:15,605
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

244
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:17,939
Something from the machine shop.

245
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:21,176
Hey, boss, you notice?

246
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:24,377
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

247
00:27:24,554 --> 00:27:27,785
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

248
00:27:28,224 --> 00:27:29,350
Fat chance.

249
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,185
You're dead, Rorschach!

250
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:35,024
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

251
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,401
Your hands, my pleasure.

252
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:44,396
Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

253
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:47,873
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 15 years for this.

254
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:52,379
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

255
00:27:56,085 --> 00:27:57,814
Nothing personal, big guy.

256
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,246
Boss! Wait!

257
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:16,334
Now you find out what the score is.

258
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:19,901
One-nothing. Come and get me.

259
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:27,609
Come on.

260
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:29,411
<i>So I've been thinking.</i>

261
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:34,450
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

262
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,351
- I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
What?

263
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,291
Someone set him up.

264
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,725
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

265
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,835
You didn't get it.

266
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:49,570
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

267
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:53,402
- ...is a little different than putting
out a fire. - Yeah, you're right.

268
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,141
It'll be more fun.

269
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:03,308
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

270
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:10,320
Yes.

271
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:16,088
No.

272
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:34,847
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

273
00:29:35,685 --> 00:29:38,984
Two-nothing. Your move.

274
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,049
Get out of the way!

275
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:18,279
No. No.

276
00:30:18,923 --> 00:30:20,322
Where's my face?

277
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,589
Don't kill me.

278
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,665
Your turn, doctor.

279
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:33,031
Tell me, what do you see?

280
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,919
Don't move!

281
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,963
Rorschach.

282
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:14,267
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

283
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:17,839
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

284
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,344
Oh, for chrissake.

285
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:23,299
Are you all right?

286
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:26,937
Yeah. Just...

287
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:28,640
...heavy, you know?

288
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:31,540
War, jailbreak.

289
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:36,952
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

290
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,985
- Hello, Laurie.
- Jon.

291
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:48,791
- TV said you were on Mars.
- I am on Mars.

292
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,767
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

293
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,403
What are you talking about?

294
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:56,233
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

295
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:05,138
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.

296
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:06,977
I have to go.

297
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,647
Beautiful, isn't it?

298
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:22,432
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

299
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,665
It won't happen again.

300
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:29,329
That's comforting.

301
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,336
Oh, my God.

302
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:35,842
I'm on Mars.

303
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:41,682
We need to hit up
underworld contacts, squeeze people.

304
00:34:41,852 --> 00:34:44,582
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

305
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:46,882
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

306
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:51,517
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

307
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:53,788
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

308
00:34:53,964 --> 00:34:55,989
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

309
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:58,260
You live off people
while insulting them...

310
00:34:58,436 --> 00:35:02,236
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

311
00:35:14,218 --> 00:35:16,049
I'm sorry.

312
00:35:18,722 --> 00:35:20,883
I shouldn't have said that, man.

313
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:24,224
Daniel...

314
00:35:25,729 --> 00:35:28,197
...you are a good friend.

315
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:34,231
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

316
00:35:40,744 --> 00:35:42,234
Forget it.

317
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:45,075
It's okay, man.

318
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,942
Let's do it your way.

319
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,301
Oh, God.

320
00:36:08,472 --> 00:36:12,841
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

321
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:21,807
Oh, you bastards.

322
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:25,080
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

323
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,589
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

324
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:34,230
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

325
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,696
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

326
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:41,361
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

327
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,234
No.

328
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:45,837
Yeah, yeah!

329
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,945
- I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
- You're a felon.

330
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:52,082
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

331
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:55,980
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

332
00:36:56,153 --> 00:36:59,748
- Told by whom?
- My contact, Miss Slater.

333
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:02,518
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

334
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:06,652
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

335
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,527
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

336
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:17,903
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

337
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:20,771
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

338
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:22,378
Follow the money.

339
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:28,011
This is where we hold our conversation.

340
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:33,815
In it, you ask me
to stop the imminent nuclear war.

341
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:37,020
But why would I save a world...

342
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:39,458
...I no longer have any stake in?

343
00:37:41,565 --> 00:37:43,624
Then do it for me.

344
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:45,900
If you really care.

345
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,506
When you left me, I left Earth.

346
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:52,574
Does that not show you that I care?

347
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:58,714
My red world here, now...

348
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:02,618
...means more to me than your blue one.

349
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:05,116
Let me show you.

350
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,175
<i>Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.</i>

351
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,749
It's time, gentlemen.

352
00:38:39,857 --> 00:38:42,257
Take us to DEFCON one.

353
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:50,725
<i>Not in penthouse. Not in office.</i>

354
00:38:50,901 --> 00:38:53,802
<i>What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...</i>

355
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:55,734
<i>...out into the night at this hour?</i>

356
00:38:55,906 --> 00:38:57,669
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

357
00:38:57,841 --> 00:39:00,605
Maybe he keeps on file.

358
00:39:05,282 --> 00:39:07,750
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.

359
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:12,685
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

360
00:39:12,856 --> 00:39:17,486
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

361
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:20,960
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

362
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,599
Setting Manhattan up.

363
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:38,908
Funny.

364
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:42,575
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

365
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:47,781
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

366
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:51,053
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

367
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:52,456
Pharaohs?

368
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,361
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

369
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:04,473
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

370
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,035
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

371
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:14,408
If the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

372
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:18,977
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition".

373
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:24,856
I'm in.

374
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:55,055
No.

375
00:40:57,227 --> 00:41:02,995
Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

376
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:07,035
Your support and your enthusiasm...

377
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:09,502
...is what has led to this triumph.

378
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:13,700
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

379
00:41:13,877 --> 00:41:16,311
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

380
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,210
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

381
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:26,248
This is the new Karnak.

382
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:30,018
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

383
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:36,463
...a dream now assured
because of your unquestioning assistance.

384
00:41:38,602 --> 00:41:40,263
And for this...

385
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:43,436
...I am ashamed...

386
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:48,942
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

387
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:52,605
To the pharaohs...

388
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,542
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

389
00:41:57,187 --> 00:42:01,521
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

390
00:42:02,392 --> 00:42:04,792
Sleep well, gentlemen.

391
00:42:05,462 --> 00:42:08,795
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

392
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:11,692
...to your great sacrifice.

393
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:14,831

<i>Rorschach's journal. Final entry.</i>

396
00:42:25,015 --> 00:42:26,607
<i>Why?</i>

397
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:28,842
<i>What's his endgame?</i>

398
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:32,682
<i>I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.</i>

399
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:36,326
<i>Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.</i>

400
00:42:36,493 --> 00:42:39,394
<i>He could kill us both alone in the snow.</i>

401

<i>Rorschach, November 1 st.</i>

407
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:04,812
<i>Can't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?</i>

408
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,689
It ends with you in tears.

409
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:11,453
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

410
00:43:11,628 --> 00:43:15,064
At some point, yes.

411
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:19,068
The streets are filled with death.

412
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:21,295
Jon, please.

413
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:26,033
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

414
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:30,543
And the universe will not even notice.

415
00:43:32,983 --> 00:43:37,215
In my opinion, the existence of life...

416
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:41,080
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

417
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:45,291
Just look around you.

418
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:52,365
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

419
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:57,565
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

420
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:03,680
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

421
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:06,004
So tell me...

422
00:44:06,183 --> 00:44:10,552
...how would all of this be greatly improved
by an oil pipeline?

423
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,012
By a shopping mall?

424
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:21,661
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

425
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,959
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

426
00:44:24,134 --> 00:44:25,624
Oh, God, Jon!

427
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:30,865
- Only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit.

428
00:44:31,942 --> 00:44:34,467
Land this thing. Now.

429
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:37,204
As you wish.

430
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:43,877
You know what?

431
00:44:44,054 --> 00:44:46,750
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

432
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:49,289
...and all the other worthless humans.

433
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:52,895
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

434
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:57,227
...and look: nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

435
00:44:57,401 --> 00:45:02,668
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

436
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:07,173
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

437
00:45:07,344 --> 00:45:11,747
- You shut out what you're afraid of.
- I'm not afraid.

438
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:16,943
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

439
00:45:24,094 --> 00:45:29,191
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

440
00:45:29,366 --> 00:45:32,426
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

441
00:45:32,602 --> 00:45:34,729
I put food on the table
for you and your child.

442
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:37,703
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

443
00:45:38,442 --> 00:45:41,138
Even the grimy parts of it...

444
00:45:41,511 --> 00:45:43,741
...keep on getting brighter.

445
00:45:44,081 --> 00:45:45,878
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

446
00:45:46,783 --> 00:45:48,580
You're the Comedian, right?

447

<i>You were pretty cool in there.</i>

448
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:55,083
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

449
00:45:55,258 --> 00:45:59,695
- You got her eyes, you know. You got-
- Take your hands off her.

450
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:01,990
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

451
00:46:02,165 --> 00:46:04,929
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

452
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:07,300
Now.

453
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:10,262
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

454
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,274
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

455
00:46:14,978 --> 00:46:16,673
...you know, old friend's daughter?

456
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:20,313
Drive.

457
00:46:26,323 --> 00:46:29,121
<i>It was a mistake. One time.</i>

458
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:32,589
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

459
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:35,525
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

460
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:38,634
Am I ever gonna live this down?

461
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:43,131
Laurie.

462
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:49,342
No.

463
00:46:51,348 --> 00:46:53,839
No, not him.

464
00:46:54,017 --> 00:46:56,110
The Comedian...

465
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,613
...was your father.

466
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,785
No.

467
00:47:05,095 --> 00:47:10,795
No! No! No!

468
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,391
My life is just...

469
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:48,196
...one big joke.

470
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:50,931
I don't think your life is a joke.

471
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:54,567
Yeah, well...

472
00:47:56,413 --> 00:48:00,577
...I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

473
00:48:08,758 --> 00:48:10,419
Will you smile...

474
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:14,563
...if I admit I was wrong?

475
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:19,425
About what?

476
00:48:21,438 --> 00:48:22,928
Miracles.

477
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,771
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

478
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:31,103
...like oxygen turning into gold.

479
00:48:31,281 --> 00:48:36,116
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

480
00:48:36,786 --> 00:48:39,152
...that in human coupling...

481
00:48:39,956 --> 00:48:43,824
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

482
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:47,092
...for generation after generation...

483
00:48:47,964 --> 00:48:51,024
...until finally, your mother...

484
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:52,595
...loves a man...

485
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:56,831
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

486
00:48:57,007 --> 00:49:01,000
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

487
00:49:01,678 --> 00:49:03,578
...it's you...

488
00:49:05,315 --> 00:49:06,646
Only...

489
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:08,807
...you.

490
00:49:09,653 --> 00:49:10,915
...that emerged.

491
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:15,982
To distill so specific a form...

492
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,423
...from all that chaos...

493
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,299
...is like turning air into gold.

494
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:29,662
A miracle.

495
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:34,666
And so...

496
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:37,009
...I was wrong.

497
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:42,849
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

498
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,407
We got a bearing on that artificial
structure. Heat signature's off the charts.

499
00:50:15,385 --> 00:50:18,479
- Veidt.
- I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

500
00:50:26,896 --> 00:50:29,729
- The engines.
- They're icing up. Hold onto something.

501
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,525
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

502
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:38,568
Don't wish to interfere,
but perhaps should pull up sharply...

503
00:50:38,742 --> 00:50:42,678
I know! I'm trying.
I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

504
00:51:09,939 --> 00:51:13,568
I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

505
00:51:13,743 --> 00:51:16,610
...but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

506
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:19,581
You need something warmer.

507
00:51:20,116 --> 00:51:22,277
Fine like this.

508
00:51:51,781 --> 00:51:53,646
What is it, girl?

509
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:57,647
Mm.

510
00:52:23,246 --> 00:52:25,510
Adrian's a pacifist.

511
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:30,345
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.

512
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,919
Hitler was vegetarian.

513
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:36,616
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

514
00:53:47,864 --> 00:53:49,195
Gentlemen.

515
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:53,635
- Welcome.
- Adrian, we know everything.

516
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:55,566
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

517
00:53:55,738 --> 00:53:58,730
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

518
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:00,432
May he rest in peace.

519
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:03,538
Blake figured it out first.

520
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:07,774
<i>Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure we weren't rocking the boat.</i>

521
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:10,982
<i>Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak...</i>

522
00:54:11,154 --> 00:54:15,215
<i>...and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.</i>

523
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:18,656
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one
to have a change of heart.

524
00:54:19,395 --> 00:54:20,919
So...

525
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:23,899
...I had to kill him.

526
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:28,233
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

527
00:54:28,404 --> 00:54:30,872
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

528
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,065
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

529
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:35,506
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

530
00:54:36,012 --> 00:54:37,479
<i>Got him to leave the planet.</i>

531
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:41,048
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

532
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:45,119
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

533
00:54:45,288 --> 00:54:47,119
<i>...he might as well have been sobbing.</i>

534
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,618
<i>All I needed to do was tug on the thread.</i>

535
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:52,693
<i>The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...</i>

536
00:54:52,862 --> 00:54:56,457
<i>...when he came to believe
he'd given cancer to the people he loved...</i>

537
00:54:56,633 --> 00:54:58,760
<i>...was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.</i>

538
00:54:58,935 --> 00:55:02,769
<i>Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.</i>

539
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:07,603
<i>Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.</i>

540
00:55:09,746 --> 00:55:12,840
<i>I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...</i>

541
00:55:13,016 --> 00:55:15,610
<i>...leaving only one loose end:</i>

542
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:19,655
You, and your mask-killer theory...

543
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:22,950
<i>...one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.</i>

544
00:55:23,126 --> 00:55:24,821
<i>I tipped off the police.</i>

545
00:55:24,994 --> 00:55:27,394
Once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

546
00:55:27,563 --> 00:55:30,191
Sorry to disappoint you.

547
00:55:43,379 --> 00:55:45,847
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

548
00:55:46,015 --> 00:55:47,744
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

549
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:49,248
Nuclear war?

550
00:55:49,419 --> 00:55:51,580
Human extinction?

551
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:06,133
Of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

552
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:09,271
A few key regions around the globe...

553
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:14,900
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

554
00:56:15,078 --> 00:56:16,739
...disintegrated in an instant.

555
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,813
Fifteen million people killed...

556
00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:23,042
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

557
00:56:24,253 --> 00:56:27,051
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War III.

558
00:56:27,223 --> 00:56:28,349
Jon wouldn't do that.

559
00:56:28,925 --> 00:56:31,621
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

560
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:36,061
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

561
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:40,659
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

562
00:56:40,837 --> 00:56:43,362
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

563
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:45,530
You see...

564
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:48,842
...the Comedian was right.

565
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:54,539
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

566
00:56:54,717 --> 00:56:57,515
So in order to save this planet...

567
00:56:57,787 --> 00:56:59,846
...I had to trick it...

568
00:57:00,223 --> 00:57:04,250
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

569
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:07,928
- Killing millions.
- To save billions.

570
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:10,432
A necessary crime.

571
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,761
You know we can't let you do that.

572
00:57:14,203 --> 00:57:16,330
"Do that," Rorschach?

573
00:57:16,506 --> 00:57:18,133
I'm not a comic-book villain.

574
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:21,239
Do you think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

575
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:25,574
...if there were even the slightest
possibility you could affect the outcome?

576
00:57:28,317 --> 00:57:31,115
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

577
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:13,578
Jesus Christ, Henry.

578
00:59:13,756 --> 00:59:15,951
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

579
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:22,297
It's not the Soviets, sir.

580
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:26,028
Intel indicates the energy signature...

581
00:59:26,202 --> 00:59:28,636
...was generated by...

582
00:59:29,605 --> 00:59:32,039
...Dr. Manhattan.

583
00:59:34,877 --> 00:59:36,435
Jon.

584
00:59:39,448 --> 00:59:40,574
Interference.

585
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,083
Cataclysmic interference.

586
00:59:52,795 --> 00:59:55,559
I can't believe it happened.

587
00:59:56,565 --> 01:00:00,057
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

588
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,437
It was me.

589
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:09,068
I...

590
01:00:09,645 --> 01:00:10,669
...did this.

591
01:00:11,314 --> 01:00:14,772
- What do you mean, you did this?
- Not directly.

592
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:18,447
It was made to look like I did it.

593
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:22,923
Adrian.

594
01:00:29,198 --> 01:00:31,189
Speak of the devil.

595
01:00:34,337 --> 01:00:35,361
Jon-
I know.

596
01:00:35,538 --> 01:00:37,699
Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

597
01:00:37,873 --> 01:00:39,204
Wait here.

598
01:00:50,353 --> 01:00:52,719
Adrian, stop this.

599
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,055
The tachyons were clever...

600
01:00:57,193 --> 01:01:01,527
...but even if I can't predict where
you are, I can turn the walls to glass.

601
01:01:02,865 --> 01:01:05,333
I should thank you.

602
01:01:06,502 --> 01:01:09,699
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

603
01:01:10,706 --> 01:01:13,698
<i>...the delights of uncertainty.</i>

604
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,541
Forgive me, girl.

605
01:01:42,505 --> 01:01:44,200
You're such an asshole.

606
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,074
Veidt, you bastard.

607
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:22,710
- If you've hurt her, I'Il-
- Dan...

608
01:02:24,447 --> 01:02:29,043
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

609
01:02:29,218 --> 01:02:31,209
Your...

610
01:02:31,387 --> 01:02:36,347
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

611
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,827
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

612
01:02:41,797 --> 01:02:44,197
...is your only triumph.

613
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,300
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

614
01:02:47,103 --> 01:02:50,595
I'm very disappointed.

615
01:03:02,985 --> 01:03:06,148
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

616
01:03:06,822 --> 01:03:09,222
It didn't kill Osterman.

617
01:03:11,827 --> 01:03:14,193
Did you really think it would kill me?

618
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:18,661
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

619
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:22,331
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

620
01:03:22,505 --> 01:03:25,565
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

621
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:29,370
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

622
01:03:30,513 --> 01:03:33,004
The world's smartest man...

623
01:03:33,182 --> 01:03:35,742
...poses no more threat to me...

624
01:03:35,918 --> 01:03:39,046
...than does its smartest termite.

625
01:03:41,323 --> 01:03:42,790
What's that?

626
01:03:43,192 --> 01:03:45,057
Another ultimate weapon?

627
01:03:45,694 --> 01:03:47,423
Yes.

628
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:50,498
You could say that.

629
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:55,970
<i>...came under attack.</i>

630
01:03:56,805 --> 01:04:00,138
<i>Millions of lives were suddenly ended...</i>

631
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:05,675
<i>...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.</i>

632
01:04:07,483 --> 01:04:11,419
<i>Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...</i>

633
01:04:11,587 --> 01:04:14,579
<i>...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.</i>

634
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:17,823
<i>Putting aside our past differences...</i>

635
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,321
<i>...we have both pledged to unite...</i>

636
01:04:20,663 --> 01:04:23,996
<i>...against this common enemy.</i>

637
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,491
<i>With the rest of the world...</i>

638
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:28,961
<i>...we will prevail.</i>

639
01:04:31,507 --> 01:04:34,499
<i>This is a day we shall never forget.</i>

640
01:04:34,677 --> 01:04:38,875
<i>And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...</i>

641
01:04:39,048 --> 01:04:43,678
<i>...and all that is good
and just in our world.</i>

642
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:49,252
<i>Thank you. God bless us all.</i>

643
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:51,422
Do you see?

644
01:04:53,629 --> 01:04:56,097
Two superpowers retreating from war.

645
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,134
I've saved the earth from hell.

646
01:05:00,302 --> 01:05:02,270
We both have.

647
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:04,933
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

648
01:05:09,745 --> 01:05:11,235
Now we can return...

649
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:14,239
...do what we were meant to.

650
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:17,385
We were meant to exact justice.

651
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,053
- Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
- Will they?

652
01:05:21,223 --> 01:05:26,024
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

653
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:29,631
- Peace based on a lie.
- But peace...

654
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:31,993
- ...nonetheless.
- He's right.

655
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:36,527
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

656
01:05:36,705 --> 01:05:39,572
No. We can't do this.

657
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:41,505
On Mars...

658
01:05:43,012 --> 01:05:44,843
...you taught me the value of life.

659
01:05:45,814 --> 01:05:48,248
If we hope to preserve it here...

660
01:05:49,051 --> 01:05:51,076
...we must remain silent.

661
01:05:54,923 --> 01:05:56,857
Keep your own secrets.

662
01:06:03,732 --> 01:06:04,926
Don't even think about it.

663
01:06:07,536 --> 01:06:09,265
Rorschach.

664
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,564
Wait.

665
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:15,702
Never compromise.

666
01:06:16,078 --> 01:06:18,945
Not even in the face of armageddon.

667
01:06:19,348 --> 01:06:22,340
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

668
01:06:33,395 --> 01:06:36,922
I've made myself feel every death...

669
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,305
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

670
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:53,575
- You understand, don't you?
Without condoning...

671
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,150
...or condemning...

672
01:07:01,557 --> 01:07:03,491
...I understand.

673
01:07:10,899 --> 01:07:14,027
Out of my way. People have to be told.

674
01:07:14,903 --> 01:07:16,837
You know I can't let you do that.

675
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:21,065
Suddenly you discover humanity?

676
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:24,342
Convenient.

677
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:37,617
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

678
01:07:41,397 --> 01:07:44,366
I can change almost anything...

679
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:51,269
...but I can't change human nature.

680
01:07:52,608 --> 01:07:56,009
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

681
01:07:57,279 --> 01:08:00,612
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

682
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:08,654
Well, what are you waiting for?

683
01:08:12,127 --> 01:08:13,958
Do it.

684
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:21,092
Do it!

685
01:08:23,806 --> 01:08:27,173
No!

686
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:50,428
<i>I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.</i>

687
01:08:50,599 --> 01:08:53,090
<i>I thought you said you cared
about life again.</i>

688
01:08:53,268 --> 01:08:54,667
<i>I do.</i>

689
01:08:56,004 --> 01:08:58,905
I think maybe I'll create some.

690
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:05,343
Goodbye, Laurie.

691
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:41,742
Come on.

692
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:45,811
Come on!

693
01:09:50,225 --> 01:09:51,556
Dan...

694
01:09:52,027 --> 01:09:54,791
...a world united and at peace.

695
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:56,858
There had to be sacrifice.

696
01:09:57,032 --> 01:10:01,401
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

697
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,333
You've mutilated it.

698
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:05,866
That's your legacy.

699
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:17,214
That's the real practical joke.

700
01:11:09,805 --> 01:11:13,798
<i>We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.</i>

701
01:11:13,976 --> 01:11:17,434
<i>You are about to participate
in a great adventure.</i>

702
01:11:17,613 --> 01:11:20,776
<i>You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...</i>

703
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:26,751
<i>...which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.</i>

704
01:11:27,956 --> 01:11:30,151
Sure you don't want a drink?

705
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,183
I'm okay.

706
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:34,489
Cheers.

707
01:11:35,931 --> 01:11:39,059
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

708
01:11:40,335 --> 01:11:42,826
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

709
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:47,604
Laurel.

710
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,942
What you must think of me.

711
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,305
I'm sorry I never told you.

712
01:11:54,483 --> 01:11:56,280
I should have...

713
01:11:56,451 --> 01:12:00,581
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

714
01:12:00,756 --> 01:12:02,690
It doesn't matter.

715
01:12:03,525 --> 01:12:08,792
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

716
01:12:09,364 --> 01:12:12,299
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

717
01:12:12,467 --> 01:12:14,799
I know how that is...

718
01:12:15,537 --> 01:12:18,131
...but I just want you to know...

719
01:12:18,707 --> 01:12:21,540
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

720
01:12:25,714 --> 01:12:29,980
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

721
01:12:31,553 --> 01:12:34,044
Because he gave me you.

722
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:40,153
Thanks, Mom.

723
01:12:42,898 --> 01:12:44,695
I love you.

724
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:56,438
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

725
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,676
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

726
01:13:13,195 --> 01:13:17,359
- So how's it going up here?
- Good. How's it going down there?

727
01:13:17,532 --> 01:13:21,024
Good. I think I've got everything working.

728
01:13:21,203 --> 01:13:25,833
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

729
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:28,237
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

730
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,470
Well, that sounds like a date.

731
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:45,055
Are we gonna be all right?

732
01:13:47,129 --> 01:13:51,429
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

733
01:13:51,633 --> 01:13:53,498
...in the end.

734
01:13:55,137 --> 01:13:57,298
I know what Jon would say:

735
01:13:57,472 --> 01:13:59,497
Nothing ends.

736
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:04,003
Nothing ever ends.

737
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,125
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

738
01:14:55,297 --> 01:14:56,662
Everyone in the country...

739
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:59,096
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

740
01:14:59,267 --> 01:15:02,532
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

741
01:15:03,038 --> 01:15:05,905
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

742
01:15:06,074 --> 01:15:10,010
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

743
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:12,009
We could run a piece on that.

744
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:15,343
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

745
01:15:15,517 --> 01:15:19,351
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

746
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:24,320
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

747
01:15:24,492 --> 01:15:26,084
Crank file.

748
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:28,252
Whatever. Take some initiative.

749
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:31,058
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.
