Your sister is the dent.

she'll remember who she was.</i>

00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,430
How did you jailbreak
your way out of here?

7

[Constantine] Astra and this whole
bloody mess is on me.

00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,732
She could continue

00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,192
What happened here, John?

12
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,860
That witch is Astra's dead mother.

00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:27,944
She's through there.

Blimey, he's really

19
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,426
How could you let him go in there?

20
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,887
That thing is hurting him.

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,264
Then he probably deserves it.

No. No, no, no, no, no.

Yes.

Sorry. Old Assassin habits die hard.

Babe. Now that you've given me
a heart attack,

47
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,878
I was just about to jump in.
Care to join me?

Whoa, co-showering in
the communal bathroom.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,175
You are getting comfy.

50
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,763
Which is a good thing because
I'm gonna need you to woman the ship.

51
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,306
I've got business in Star City.

[Agent Sharpe] Is everything okay?

53
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,601
[Sara] Yeah, it's just some stuff
I need to take care of,

54
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:09,022
but it might take a few days,
which is why I need an interim captain.

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,358
- Captain?
- Mmm-hmm.

56
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,026
No,no,no,no,no.

57
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,070
I was just starting to find my footing
as a Legend.

58
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,529
Nobody likes the boss, babe.

59
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,156
[Sara] Well, they like me.

60
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,033
Yeah, because you're cool Captain Lance.

61
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,535
I'm just a button-pusher
in a boring pantsuit.

62
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,414
No, babe, just have fun with it.
They are going to love you.

63
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,124
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes.

64
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,876
I miss you already, Captain Pantsuit.

65
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,836
[Agent Sharpe] No, babe. I'm not...

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,306
Raise you two.

67
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,434
Make it ten.

68
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,437
Finally. A real hand.

- Like hell I do.

00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,987
[growls] Like Hell you do.

72
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,367
What the hell are you doing?

73
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,161
Keeping us in the black.
You lost another account.

- Now, Meyers.

76
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,544
Your little resurrection venture
is getting too risky.

77
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,964
You turn the tide,
or you'll lose everything.

78
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,050
I've played nice long enough.

79
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,470
Now, it's time to play naughty.

80
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,646
That's one angry ghost.

81
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,066
Yeah, but now,
she's loose in the bloody house.

82
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,277
- What, that was Astra's mum?
- And her name is Natalie.

83
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,904
What did you do to her, John boy?

84
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,783
[sighs] That was a long time ago.
She was walking home late from work,

85
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,911
and some drunken idiot
blew a red light and...

86
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,832
Her husband Alex begged me
to bring her back.

87
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,961
- You never told me that.
- Yeah, well, I never told anyone.

88
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,839
Now, let's just say that

89
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,467
that night in Newcastle
when we lost Astra,

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,428
it was a little more complicated
than an exorcism.

[spirit howls]

92

Something tells me
that you're not telling the truth.

93
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,060
Look, I'm trying to fix it, Nat,
all right?

94
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,229
I'm trying to save Astra! Now, help me!

95
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,899
[screeches]

96
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,694
Doesn't seem to be
the answer she was looking for.

97
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,114
The demon that I summoned
brought Natalie back.

98
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,116
But if you brought her back,
why.., why is she a ghost?

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,744
Because I botched it, all right?

100
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,412
I thought I had him under control,
but I didn't.

101
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,625
- You can't have her!
- John, get me out of here!

102

<i>[Constantine] He took Astra.</i>

103
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,920
Natalie couldn't live with herself

104
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,048
knowing that the price of her life
was her daughter's.

105
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,258
She killed herself in this room.

106
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,260
That's so sad! [screams]

107
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,896
Doesn't look like Natalie's done
with you yet, John-o.

108
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,856
[children giggle]

109
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,365
No, it looks like Natalie wants to
take me on a trip down memory lane.

110
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,540
All righty-tighty, then. You ready
for the official Waverider tour?

111
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,375
- Hmm.
- What would you like to see first?

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,126
What do you people do
around here for fun?

113
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,795
If you could just follow me this way.

114
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,755
First stop, the galley.

115
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,216
Gideon can whip up any kind of food
you can imagine.

116
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,468
Last week, Nate and I
made cheddar biscuits

117
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,762
and had her fabricate
some squeezable butter.

118
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,057
That tasty treat has been
off the shelf since 2024.

119

She can make anything,

120
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,394
and you went
with a discontinued condiment.

- Wait. Can she make clothes?
- Of course.

122
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,651
Okay, tell the computer I need a dress
for my perfume launch tonight.

123
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,611
- We'll be back in time for that, right?
- Yes.

124
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,405
And yes, Gideon can do anything.

125
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,908
She flies the ship, makes our food,
cleans the toilets, tracks the timeline.

126
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,493
Tracks the time...

127
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,746
Do you mean, "Tells the future"?

128
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,960
Behrad, we can make billions
off future fall trend reports.

[clears throat]

No, no. Rule number one of time travel,

00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,340
never look into the future
for personal gain.

invited me to stay.

138
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,480
Okay. Let's just remember
this is a place of business.

Okay? We get called on a mission,
you need to keep out of our way.

Sad. What a waste
of a good head of hair.

144

Here you go. Hide it.

Can your computer lady
make me some cucumber water?

146

159
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,111
<i>Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.</i>

160
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,906
[sighs]

161
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,908
Mick, are you feeling all right?

162
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,951
My stomach hurts. I can't eat.

163
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,703
I... I can't drink.

164
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,706
I think Ali gave me an STD
back at the reunion.

165
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,957
[Gideon] Initiating scan.

166
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,505
Those are not symptoms.
Those are feelings.

167
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,676
Mick, I think you're developing a crush.

168
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,719
Is that when you whizz and it hurts?

169
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,100
No. It's biology's way of telling you
you care about someone else.

170
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,601
[Gideon] Dr. Palmer is correct.

171
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,772
The results of my body scan indicate
that you do, in fact, like-like her.

172
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,357
[grumbles]

173
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,529
Interim Captain Sharpe here. Team
meeting in the parlor. Over and out.

174
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,866
<i>Okay. That was good. That was fun,
yet to the point. Not too...</i>

175
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,660
Gideon, are you broadcasting this?

176
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,787
[Gideon] Sorry, Ms. Sharpe.
I'll shut it down.

177
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,415
Okay, thank you.
We women have to stick together.

178
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,250
I always thought of you
as one of the guys.

179
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,501
[Agent Sharpe] Okay,
I don't know what that means--

180
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,128
- He means that as a compliment.
- Yeah.

181
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,756
Okay, that's for you. That's for you.

182
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,299
[Behrad] Okay, then.

183
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,176
Okay.

184
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,970
What did I say about phones?

185
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,389
What? I need to tell my boyfriend
I'm not dead.

186
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,474
Uh, boyfriend?

187
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,436
Yep. Internationally renowned DJ
S'More Money.

188
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,564
Ah, okay, we've got Ray.
Uh, where's Mick?

189
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,524
He's sick. Lovesick.

190
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,401
- Aw.
-[chuckles] Oh, lei.

191
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,945
So, while Sara's in Star City,

192
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:31,988
I wanted to introduce you all

193
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,365
to something that I developed
at the Time Bureau.

194
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,825
I know what you're all thinking.

195
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,870
"Time Bureau, hashtag stuffy.
What can we learn from those guys?"

196
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,496
But we really did have
a lot of fun over there.

197
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,914
Do you remember Taco Mondays, Nate?

198
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,459
- Yeah, those were some wild taco times.
-[Agent Sharpe] Yeah.

199
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,918
-"Aloha"?
- Yes!

200
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:51,090
A.L.O.H.A. It stands for assess,
listen, observe, hydrate...

201
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,884
- Attack!
- What the...

202
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,635
- Cool.
- See?

203
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,429
Uh, how many pages is this?

204
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,972
Ava, have you heard the proverb,

205
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,100
"The fox knows many things,
the hedgehog knows one big thing."

206
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,351
I have not.

207
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,021
Well, Legends,
we're a fox kind of organization.

208
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,607
Adaptable, off the cuff.

209
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,109
This is very hedgehog.

210
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,696
Trying to impose one way of doing things
onto every situation.

211
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,991
And not to be rude,
is there, uh, a mission here?

212
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,284
No, I just--

213
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,119
Okay, then, I'm gonna introduce Zari

214
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,205
to the wonders
of Gideon's Austrian toast.

215
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,165
Actually, it's, uh, French toast.

216
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,458
Pretty sure it's Austrian.

217
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,542
[Nate] Nah...

218
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,753
Gideon, Gideon, check the timeline.

219
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,379
[Gideon] It would appear
that there is a disturbance

220
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,132
at the Bastille in Paris, 1793.

221
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,344
While the details are still hazy,
the aftermath is traumatic.

222
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,138
Thousands die
and the French Revolution collapses.

223
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,516
Well, looks like we have a mission.

224
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,851
So, everybody,
stop looking so <i>Les Misérables,</i>

225
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,395
because we are going to France!

226
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651
Behrad, come on, we need to move.
[sighs]

227
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,902
[door opens]

228
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,159
Hey, guys.

229
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,372
I couldn't stop her.
She found the fabrication room.

230
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,374
Great. She's not coming.

231
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,959
We don't do ride-alongs in the field, B.

232
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,919
Ava, I can handle myself in the field.

233
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,005
I once played capture the flag to
raise awareness about feline OCD, so...

234
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,549
This isn't a PR event, all right?

235
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,218
We're walking into a deadly situation,
facing an Encore with unknown powers.

236
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,096
I do not have time to keep my eye
on a party girl.

237
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,682
- I do.
-[Agent Sharpe] What?

238
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,685
I mean, come on, Ava. What's the harm?

239
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,769
It's against protocol

240
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,688
-to bring civilians into the field.
-[sucks teeth]

241
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,314
- Don't... [sucks teeth]
-[sucks teeth]

242
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:35,111
Yeah, but it would be super-cool
if you just let me come anyway.

243
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,864
Uh...

244
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,323
- Okay, fine.
- Yay!

245
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,284
Just, uh, make sure
you stay out of our way.

246
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,743
- Yay!

[gags,coughs]

248
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,707
What the hell was that?

249
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,750
My signature perfume, Dragonesque.

250
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,462
I needed to do something to help
that extremely sad outfit.

251
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,463
[coughs]

252
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,799
Spray, delay, walk away.

253
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,968
Yeah, we're going this way. Jesus.

254
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,429
I was just doing a runway turn.

255

[people clamoring]

256
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,310
[Agent Sharpe] This period in France
was called the Reign of Terror.

257
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,645
Executions were a national pastime.

258
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,939
-[all gasp]
- Oh, yikes.

259
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,817
[Nate] Yeah, we could definitely
be walking into a bloodbath.

260
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,028
And you want us to go in there?

261
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,905
Yeah, that's our job.

262
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,156
[Agent Sharpe clears throat]

263
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,408
Excuse me, sir.
Uh, we need to get in there.

264
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,535
No.

265
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,289
It is of vital importance
that we get in there, sir.

266
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,916
Please? [gasps]

267
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,459
Stand back.

268
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,878
This isn't a club, Zari,
it's an execution.

269
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,880
An event is an event.

270
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,506
Scoot. Out of the way.

271
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,883
Where do you think you're going?

272
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,719
Um, do you know who you're talking to?

273
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,137
What's your name?

274
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,263
- Jean Paul.
<i>- Tres bien.</i>

275
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,390
Now, they'll know who to fire

276
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,602
when they find out you left Zari Tarazi
standing outside.

Not them.

Jean Paul, my purse isn't going to
walk in by itself.

[lively orchestral music playing]

281
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,417
[Zari] Um, didn't you say
this was an execution?

282
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,419
[Ray] Maybe Gideon got it wrong.

283
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,674
Well, if they were miserable,
they certainly aren't anymore.

284
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,970
Stop with the thing.

285
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,730
You know, you can just say the word
and I'll put you in a prime spot uptown.

286
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,984
[laughs] So I can rub shoulders
with all those arrogant soul traders?

287
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,360
No, thank you.

288
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,029
I need some help
with one of the coins you constructed.

289
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,492
Help. When else do you come see me?

290
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,954
I assume this is why you're here.

291
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,041
- How did you--
-[chuckles] John Constantine.

292
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,503
I remember making this.

293
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:04,510
- What do you want for him?
- Oh, I don't want to trade him.

294
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,554
I want 110 kill him.

The night Alex begged me
to save Natalie.

00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,607
He was supposed to pick her up
that night she got hit,

00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,861
but they had a big fight,
so, she walked.

300
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,780
Alex was beside himself, he was torn up.

301
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,782
Astra, she hadn't said a word
since the accident.

How was I supposed to say no?

and I just provided the how, all right?

What's the difference, Nat?

Nat and I, we were best friends.
How could I not try and save her?

00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,126
This place doesn't seem too evil.

316
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,088
Yeah, well, appearances can be
deceiving. Okay, we need to figure out

317
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,507
who this Encore is
and what powers they may have.

318
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,675
We start with
the A.L.O.H.A, method, okay?

319
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,095
Assessment, lay low, don't engage.

320
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,596
We know how to party-sneak.

321
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,224
Listen to me, you see something,
you say something.

322
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,687
- Captain. You're trying too hard.
- Yeah.

323
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,856
[whispers] It's really desperate.

324
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,951
So, this is your job.
Walking around parties.

325
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,246
- Isn't this kind of what you do?
- Touché.

326
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,331
No.

327
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,835
But something definitely feels off.

328
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,129
At this point in the French Revolution,

329
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,798
most of the royals
had been separated from their heads.

330
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,009
Even wearing a nice dress
could get you sent to the guillotine.

331
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,554
Uh, and you let me
come out in this because?

332
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm a sucker for a corset and an updo.

333
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,604
Napoleon?

334
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,232
[Zari] He should be marching on
southern France, not getting freaky.

335
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,944
[scoffs] Guys, steer clear.
Exercise extreme caution.

336
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,364
- Relax, <i>Ava.
- I'm trying.</i>

337
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,247
Nora?

338
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,835
Ava? I think we found our Encore.

339
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,378
<i>She's in the VIP area.</i>

340
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,839
- Nora's our Encore?
- No, Ray.

341
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,965
That's Marie Antoinette.

342
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,800
And she should definitely be
without her head by now.

343
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,928
<i>[Agent Sharpe] Great. On to
phase two of A.L.O.H.A., it's listening.</i>

344
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,348
<i>Now, her powers could be anything.
Teleportation, pyrokinesis.</i>

345
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,058
Fatal attractiveness.

346
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,854
- I mean... Right?
- Right? [chuckles]

347
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,565
Guys? Guys?

348
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,317
They're not usually like this.

349
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,028
- Well, you're not usually captain.
- Thank you.

350
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,698
I just swapped crepe recipes
with a French cooking legend.

351
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,451
This is the best party ever.

352
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,745
Excuse me, since when do you drink?

353
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,788
Whoa.

354
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,749
Where did I even get that?

355
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,420
You know what? You're right,
something is definitely wrong.

356
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,256
Move out of the way.

357
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,761
It is time!

358
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,516
Of course.

359
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,769
The perfect revenge.
A magical guillotine.

360
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,520
Shh.

361
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,565
Guys, be careful.
I think Marie's about to make her move.

362
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,238
Now!

363
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,991
-[reveler gasps]
- Let them eat cake!

364
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,369
[all cheering]

365
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,267
-[in French accent] Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

366
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,851
[both speaking French]

367
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,688
So, it's not a guillotine.

368
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,066
What day is it?

369
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,236
Uh, how long have you been here?

370
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,115
[gasps]

371
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,993
Oh, my God, he's dead.

372
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,578
Ugh. He literally
partied himself to death.

373
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,873
- So tacky.
- Look. No, he's not the only one.

374
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,917
What is happening?

375
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,378
That's why I don't eat carbs.

376
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,881
This woman is next-level popular.

377
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,010
People would rather die than leave.

378
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,679
- Talk about FOMO.
- God, that's it.

379
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,390
Marie Antoinette was beheaded
for partying while France starved,

380
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,225
and now, she is literally
killing the Revolution

381
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,810
with a non-stop party.

382
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,814
Legends, we figured it out.
Charm is her superpower.

383
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,734
Hello? Ray? Nate? Behrad?

384
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,111
It's like she's gotten to everyone
except for us.

385
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,362
So, we have to stop this.

386
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,116
- Wait. I'm on the team?
- Sure.

387
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,576
Okay, what's the plan?

388
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,702
Uh...

389
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,912
We have to find a way
to get Marie Antoinette out of here

390
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,039
without a riot.

391
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,835
The only way to get a celebrity
to leave her own party quietly,

392
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,838
is to make her think
there's a cooler party somewhere else

393
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,214
that she's not at.

394
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,508
- Let's go tell her.
- Uh, girl.

395
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,845
You're not going to get anywhere
in this ensemble.

396
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,472
What are you doing? Stop it.

397
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,182
Hey.

398
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,516
Trust me.

399
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,186
-[sighs]
- Shh.

400
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,645
Come on.

401
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,150
[rock song continues]

402
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,611
That's her. Natalie.

403
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,655
- She's good.
- Yeah.

404
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,867
[both laugh]

405
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,995
You loved her.

406
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,206
It's quite the track record, isn't it?

407
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,667
One lover sent to Hell,
the other one a ghost.

408
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,756
Please, John, it's eating you up.
You have to stop.

409
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,300
Look, Natalie, you're gonna have
to trust me on this one, all right?

410
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,094
I've got it under control.

411
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,013
If Lester hadn't been there,
I would have lost you tonight.

412
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,018
Look, let's just leave all this behind.

413
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,563
We'll go to New York. We'll start clean.

414
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,527
You have to choose. Magic or me.

415
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,619
Screw you, John Constantine!

416
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,162
All right, that's enough, all right?

417
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,040
I don't want you in my head
or in my memories!

418
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,208
No more games!

419
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,460
Look, we're trapped in this house
with a knife-wielding ghost,

420
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,421
and you're still refusing to own up
to your past.

421
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,297
You are a fine one to talk, aren't you?

422
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,676
Why don't we poke around
in your closet for a while, eh?

423
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,261
- Why did you leave, Charlie?
-[Gary] Uh, guys?

424
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,471
- I'm no hero. It was time to go.
- Guys. Guys. Guys!

425
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,141
Yeah? What, you just wandered
into my house looking for a party?

426
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,642
What are you really doing here, eh?

427
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,853
Don't even try and turn this
on me, all right?

428
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,521
It's your lies
that have trapped us here.

429
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,738
[in Natalie's voice] She's right, John.

430
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,992
Natalie, is that really you?

431
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,370
[lively piano music playing]

432
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,046
[Zari] Every level of the party
has its guardians.

433
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,883
Getting past the bouncer, easy.
Getting past the friends...

434
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,844
you need to know someone.

435
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,054
But we don't know anybody.

436
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,681
I know...

437
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,850
that guy.

438
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,185
You know Napoleon?

439
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,853
No, but they don't know that.

440
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>Bonjour, Napoleon.</i>

441
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,152
We're with him.

442
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,991
Oh, she's separated from the pack.
Now's the time.

443
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,701
Oh, good. Work your magic.

444
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,661
Oh, teaching moment.

445
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,372
The big secret to being cool?
Confidence.

446
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,584
It makes people think
you have something they don't.

447
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,170
- You got this, Captain. There you go.
- No, but I don't... Ah--

448
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,215
-[sighs]
-[Marie laughs]

449
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,508
Thank you.

450
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,469
[both squealing]

451
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,513
[both laughing]

452
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,224
I do not know you.

453
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,726
What are you doing here?

454
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,395
-[voice trembles] Uh...
- Hmm?

455
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,273
- Leaving.
- Leaving?

456
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,572
Actually, I am going to the after-party.

457
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,242
What is this <i>après</i> party?

458
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,535
Mmm.

459
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,955
It's a party after the party.
It's the best place to be.

460
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,457
- Where is it?
- Mmm, I can't tell you.

461
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,292
-[gasps]
- But I can take you.

462
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,711
Really? Take me.

463
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,924
Oh, Oh.

464
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,468
Um, this is my bestie, Zari.
She's coming with.

465
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,470
Yas, queen. Mmm.

466
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,556
Guys, I have Marie
and we're taking her to the Waverider.

467
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,433
That's a great idea.
We'll have her all to ourselves.

468
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,770
- Whoo!
- Marie, come back!

469
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,775
There is an <i>après</i> party!

470
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,695
[all clamoring]

471
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,781
Guys, you have company.

472
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,117
The after-party is right this way.

473
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,785
[all cheer]

474
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,253
Corsets are so impractical!

475
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,714
Marie, where's the party?

476
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,635
I do not think this is a good idea.

477
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,804
We're gonna party our faces off.
It's gonna be great.

478
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,150
[screams]

479
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,693
Ew.

480
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,236
Should've seen that coming.

481
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,530
Return me to my body this instant--

482
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,656
Okay, body, Here we go.

483
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,159
This is weird.

484
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,666
This party stinks!

485
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,251
Oh, so true, girl.

486
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,338
But not the point.

487
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,506
- She's annoying. You can just...
- Yeah.

488
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,550
[Marie] Take this thing off of me!

489
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,303
Ugh, I can't believe I tried to drink.

490
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,055
I can't believe I ate
all that gluten-filled cake.

491
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,681
I can't believe how heavy that head is.

492
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,350
Yeah, she really had you
under her spell.

493
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,726
If it weren't for
our interim Legend here,

494
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,019
you guys would've partied to death.

495
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,604
Well, just to play it safe, I'm gonna...

496
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,397
[Marie] Stay away! Don't you touch me!

497
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,567
- Gonna take this into the library.
<i>- I'll</i> bite your finger! [yelps]

498
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,695
- I'll help you.
- Don't get creepy, Ray.

499
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,198
So, my sister, the superhero.

500
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,075
Should I get Gideon to make you a cowl?

501
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,911
Mmm, cowls are for middle-aged women
who wanna hide their necks.

502
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,830
But I do need a dress
for the party tonight.

503
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,958
- The fabricator's all yours.
- Yay! Thank you.

504
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,087
[thunder crashing]

505
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,047
Is that really you, Nat?

506
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,008
[in Natalie's voice]
I need to hear you say it.

507
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,636
Why did you bring me back?

508
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,306
Because I loved you, Nat.

509
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,599
I never stopped.

510
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,604
I'm not here for the John Constantine
broken hero act.

511
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,985
Say it to my face.

512
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,239
I need to hear the truth.

513
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,575
I brought you back...

514
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,204
to prove to you that I was right.

515
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,750
To show you that I was right
to choose magic over us.

516
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,881
Thank you.

517
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,262
I needed you to admit
to yourself what you did.

518
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,389
Because if you're going to save Astra,

519
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,559
you need to do it for her,
not for your ego.

520
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,310
Oh, I have tried to save her, Nat.

521
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,106
I have tried, but I don't know how.

522
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,483
I think I found away.

523
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,869
Uh, yoo-hoo. [flaps lips]

524
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,246
Hello? Excuse me?

525
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,541
Can you help me? Where is my body?

526
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,294
You were throwing a party
intended to kill people,

527
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,588
so, no, not gonna help you.

528
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,845
When I was 14,
I was forced to leave my family.

529
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,267
People saw the dresses,
the parties, the hair...

530
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:47,314
and they assumed I was a spoiled brat.

531
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:53,862
Really, I was just
a lonely Viennese girl

532
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,740
trying to fit into French society.

533
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,243
I've been famous
since I was six years old.

534
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,955
I don't know if people love me
or love to hate me.

535
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:08,251
What they don't understand is how hard
I work to create a fantasy for them.

536
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:13,673
The secret is
to never let the party stop.

537
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,718
If I had known then what I know now...

538
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:22,098
Gidget, is there anything
I need to worry about?

539
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,517
[Gideon] Interim Captain Sharpe

540
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,811
instructed you
not to look at your future.

541
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,064
[sighs] Just a peek,
little lady computer.

542

As you wish. October 7th, 2045...

<i>Zari Tarazi faces major backlash
from her fans,</i>

<i>known as Z-Nation, after the FDA
banned her perfume Dragonesque</i>

545
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,662

546
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,163
Oh, no.

<i>Meow!</i> [chuckles]

554
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:08,019
But I didn't know there was anything
wrong with the perfume.

555
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,522
This is so unfair.

556
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,025
Okay, I have to
get out in front of this.

557
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,737
Maybe Gidget can make me a new perfume.

558
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,366
Or I can just take yours.

559
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,743
No, you cannot have it.

560
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,496
I mean, it's not like you're using it.
You have half a neck.

561

Why do you care so much
about a bottle of...

563
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:39,217
Oh! You're not super-charming.

564
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,679
You used magical popularity perfume.

565
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,724
Honestly, that makes me feel
better about myself.

566
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,227
What are you doing?

567
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,437
[muffled protests]

568
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,772
Can't have you ratting me out.

569
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,517
Oh, there you are. Thank God. Thank God.

570
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,938
I have been so worried,
but don't.., don't worry,

571
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,106
I've... I've totally been keeping up
your Cat-Chat account.

572
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,234
Yesterday, I posted a picture
of a cat licking

573
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,903
a tube of Dragonesque lipstick.

574
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,406
Gross, Les-Lay, I would never post that.

575
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,993
I am so sorry, I will delete it.

576
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:51,289
And here is the hero bottle
for the photoshoot.

577
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,917
Actually, change of plans.

578
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,961
- Oh, so retro. [laughs]
- Take this.

579
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,505
Oh!

580
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,048
- Hey, Z... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hi!

581
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,509
- Watch the s'more. What are you doing?
- Sorry, babe.

582
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,719
So, have you decided where
you want to do the proposal yet?

583
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,597
- The what?
- Didn't my agent call you?

584
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,517
Yeah, I haven't had a chance
to tell you yet, Z,

585
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,062
but S'More's team came up with
the most epic idea.

586
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,858
He should propose to you
at next week's MTV Movie Awards

587
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,821
in advance of your DJ and Z
co-branded sunglasses launch.

588
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,739
We're getting married?

589
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,866
Yo, we could do it
somewhere more chill, you know,

590
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,119
like at the DJ S'More Money
Spring Break House Party live cast,

591
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,245
something like that?

592
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,330
- How romantic.
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

593
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,375
-[S'More] Okay, let's do this. Hey!
- You're ready for this. Let's go.

594
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:40,296
Okay, one spritz should be safe.
Spray, delay, walk away.

595
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,801
You have to do a 23andMe.
I mean, she must be related to you.

596
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,762
Here, doesn't she look exactly like you?

597

Can you taste the cardamom?

602
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,114
I can't. I can't taste anything
because your sister's perfume

603
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,200
clogged up my entire olfactory system.
Everything tastes like--

604
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,662
Zari... [panting] Zari stole
Marie Antoinette's perfume.

605
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,956
You should see what Mick
stole from Mexico, it's disgusting.

606
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,874
Consider ourselves lucky.

607
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,834
At least she didn't do something
to screw up history.

608
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,337
Oh, my God, the perfume!
That's how Marie did it.

609
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,547
Zari and I weren't affected

610
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,716
'cause we couldn't smell
because of the Dragonesque.

611
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,052
Who knows what kind of damage
she could do with that?

612
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,138
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let her stay.

613
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,724
I knew it was too early
to pat myself on the back.

614
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,185
Ah. Look, it wouldn't be a true Legends'
mission unless something went wrong.

00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,604
till the fall launch
of our sunglasses in October

627
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,815
to begin my life with you.

628
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,026
Hey, listen up. S'More Money
has an announcement to make.

629
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,488
Zari Tarazi, will you marry me?

630
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,572
Oh, S'More--

631
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,407
[gasps]

632
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,206
[all sniffing]

633
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,171
I think I just got a little too popular.

634
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,924
Oh, God.

635
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,891
Here, body, body, body, body.

636
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,560
Oh.

637
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,273
- Okay, body. No one wants to hurt you.
-[clanking]

638
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,649
Speak for yourself.

639
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,277
Hey, come on, Mick. She's harmless.

640
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,113
It's just a headless body.

641
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,781
[gasps]

642
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,285
Mick, a little help here.
Just target the right arm.

643
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,788
No, Mick, don't...

644
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,561
Okay, we need to protect ourselves.
Zari's deployed Marie's perfume.

645
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,478
Ahh!

646
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:43,980
[groans]

647
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,191
[all coughing and gagging]

648
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,235
Okay, team, A.L.O.H.A, time.

649
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,114
Run! Run!

650
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,243
Nate, what do you got?

651
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,287
I'm assessing Zari used too much
of the perfume

652
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,664
'cause this crowd is bananas.

653
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,416
- Behrad?
- I'm listening

654
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,168
and I hear another mob coming.

655
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,338
Okay, I'm observing and there are way
too many people for us to stop.

656
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,340
We need to get that perfume
off of her to stop this.

657
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,343
- How?
- I have an idea. I need your help.

658
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,775
[Agent Sharpe] Behrad, now!

659
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,111
[crowd gasping]

660
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,491
- You guys came back for me.
- A Legend never gets left behind,

661
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,867
even an interim one. Follow me.

662
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,536
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

663
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,456
<i>[Behrad] There's too many of them.
I can't stop them all.</i>

664
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,126
- Come on!
- Okay.

665
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,841
Well, we've tried the A.L.O.H.A, method.
The A.L.O, haven't got us anywhere.

666
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,260
What does the "H" stand for?

667
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,427
Hydrate!

668
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,939
- S'Mores.
- Yeah.

669
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:08,982
- Zari's boyfriend?
- That's me.

670
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
- Okay, guys.
- Oh, God.

671
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,612
Party's over.

672
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,491
Did Zari just jump into the fountain?

673
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,827
[scoffs] Talk about desperate stunts.

674
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,746
I'm calling my agent
to schedule a divorce!

675
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,833
Wait, what does that last "A" stand for?

676
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,001
Attack!

677
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,255
[both panting]

678
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,561
[Natalie] Look at us.

679
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,689
We thought we could change the world
with our little loom.

680
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,233
This one's to bring me mum back.

681
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,739
The Loom of Fate.
It's not just a story, it's real.

682
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,491
Three old Greek birds cutting threads,

683
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:05,413
hunkering down over a loom to weave
together the fate of humankind.

684
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,375
No, if it's real,
how come I haven't heard of it, eh?

685
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,669
You're asking the wrong person.

686
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,630
Why do you think I brought her here?

687
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,301
[gasps]

688
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,927
What the bloody hell was that?

689
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,804
What do you know about the Loom of Fate?

690
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,640
- I know bugger all.
- How'd you find this place, Charlie?

691
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,850
You told me about it.

692
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,143
Oh, bollocks,
I've never told anyone about it.

693
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,772
Natalie brought you here to help me
save Astra and stop those Encores.

694
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,690
So tell me, what do you know
about the Loom of Fate?

695
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,608
Fate's a load of crap.

696
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,109
You haven't answered
my question, Charlie.

697
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,819
- You wanna know what I'm hiding from?
- Yes, I do!

698
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,363
It's that bloody Loom!

699
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,577
- So, it is real.
- It was.

700
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,622
Until I destroyed it.

701
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,213
"Lady in Cheap Pantsuit Ruins Party."

702
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,799
Ava was right
about no phones on the ship.

703
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,676
I had Gideon whip you up
some new clothes. Hope you like flannel.

704
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,678
I do not. Ew.

705
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,766
Listen, I know you're gonna tell me
how selfish I was

706
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,435
for stealing the perfume
and burning the team.

707
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,105
You guys toil away in obscurity
to save humanity

708
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,899
from unknown baddies
and I just go and spray evil perfume

709
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,860
all over New York City
without a second thought.

710
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,405
I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.

711
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,281
I was gonna ask if you wanted a donut.

712
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:28,830
I haven't had a donut in 1,743 days.

713
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,168
What is this donut?

714
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,795
-[both] Shut up, Marie.
- Ah... [grumbles]

715
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,797
Getting healthier...

716
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,132
[Behrad] Hey.

717
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,427
Wow. Nice shirt.

718
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,638
Hmm. You would be into lumberjack chic.

719
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,932
[Gideon] There's an incoming hologram
from Captain Lance.

720
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,642
Captain.

721
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,018
How'd the mission go?

722
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,520
Oh, um...

723
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,774
- Well, I--
- Killed it.

724
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,901
She was a foxy hedgehog out there.
[hisses]

725
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,195
Okay.

726
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,572
We got our Encore, Captain.

727
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,657
Oh, good, I'm glad to hear it.

728
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,577
Ava, call me later,
so I can thank you properly.

729
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,415
O captain, my captain.

730
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,292
[Nate] "Call me later, so I can
properly congratulate you..."

731
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,460
[Ray] Guys, come on.

732
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,627
[Agent Sharpe]
She doesn't sound like that.

733
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,315
Zari! [whistles]

734
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,609
Hey, are you okay?

735
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:44,197
Yeah, I was...
I was just, uh, enjoying this donut.

736
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,782
And thinking...

737
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:52,788
You locked Marie Antoinette up,
but you let me off the hook.

738
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,334
I mean, she killed people, Zari.

739
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,961
You screwed up.
You know, everybody screws up.

740
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,672
- Not you.
- Me? [chuckles]

741
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,299
I feel like I'm
screwing up all the time.

742
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,426
You were so on-mission.

743
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,887
You crashed an A-list party
in a pantsuit

744
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,805
and threw yourself into a fountain.

745
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,725
Ugh, see? It's a perfect example.

746
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,895
No, it was amazing.
You didn't care what anyone thought.

747
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,897
You were just being you.

748
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,986
I've been trying to get people
to like me for so long, that...

749
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,367
I've forgotten who I really am.

750
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,622
I have millions of followers,
but zero friends.

751
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,584
You got one.

752
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,129
Really?

753
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,678
Come on.

754
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,101
Hmm. Well, as your friend,
I have to tell you,

755
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,229
no more pantsuits.
You're better than that.

756
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,230
Deal.

757
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,987
He still has ten years before
the lung cancer catches up to him.

758
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,863
Can you make it zero?

759
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,034
That's a nasty way to go,
especially all at once.

760
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,661
You sure that's who you wanna be?

761
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,789
Why is it so hard for people
to let little girls grow up?

762
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,502
John may be the villain in your story,

763
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,214
but in mine, he's just
cocktail party conversation.

764
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,800
I have a few enemies of my own.

765
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,804
One day, I'm going to call you

766
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:35,433
and you are going to do me a favor.

767
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,852
You make "favor" sound like "sin."

768
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,480
This is Hell, sweetie.

769
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,026
Do it.

770
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,537
You broke the Loom of Fate?
How old are you?

771
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,622
Old.

772
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,832
If you broke it,
why are you still running?

773
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,505
I scattered those damn pieces
all across the multi-verse.

774
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,258
Just put an end to it all.

775
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,388
But recently, I sensed that
something had changed.

776
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,101
It's like my past
was catching up with me. So...

777
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,562
[coughing violently]

778
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,480
John, are you okay?

779
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,899
Yeah. I just got a...

780
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,699
Bye-bye, Johnny.

781
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:39,914
[rapid ticking]

782
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,208
[inaudible]

783
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,273
[theme music playing]
