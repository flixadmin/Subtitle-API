1
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:04,208
- Previously on Gotham...
- I set a bomb.

2
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:05,844
- Thousands of people could die.
- Yes.

3
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,876
But paying that price will be better

4
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:10,355
than releasing what's down there.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,664
Are you ready to play?!

6
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,334
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,

7
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:19,606
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

8
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:20,965
There's a secret council in Gotham.

9
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,446
It's them that wanted me dead.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,567
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

11
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:30,791
Strange, you did a very bad thing to me.

12
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,077
And now, you're going to...

13
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:35,479
Impossible.

14
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:38,540
Nothing is impossible.

15
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:44,265
Thank you.

16
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,172
Bruce, I might not see you for a while.

17
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,427
- Where are you going?
- I have to find Lee.

18
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:54,469
Hello?

19
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,774
We're closed.

20
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,504
If you leave now,

21
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:07,606
I won't call the cops.

22
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,319
Hey.

23
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,508
Any chance you want to come quietly?

24
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,128
At 8:15 this evening,

25
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:50,549
an individual robbed a pharmacy
and attacked its owner.

26
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,918
While we don't have an I.D. as yet,

27
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:56,555
we believe this individual is
another escapee from Indian Hill.

28
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,394
Are these monsters dangerous?

29
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:03,996
Captain Barnes! Captain Barnes!

30
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:05,531
Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.

31
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:07,666
Why can't we see the escapee?

32
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,635
Because crews are still
picking up the pieces.

33
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:10,936
This isn't the first time

34
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,605
that a bounty hunter has
apprehended an escapee.

35
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:14,840
Is the GCPD incapable

36
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:16,775
of handling this threat themselves?

37
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:19,545
Whoa, only a handful of these
escapees have been brought in

38
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,113
by bounty hunters.

39
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:23,415
The vast majority were
apprehended by GCPD.

40
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:25,684
Excuse me. Excuse me.

41
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:27,986
I take issue with the word "threat."

42
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:31,356
These escapees are themselves

43
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:33,358
victims of Hugo Strange.

44
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,694
Now, if any ordinary
hard-working citizen

45
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:38,530
wants to help get these
poor souls off the street

46
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,933
so that they may receive
proper treatment,

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,635
well, these citizens should be lauded

48
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:44,870
and rewarded financially.

49
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:47,105
Mr. James, before they
were taken to Indian Hill,

50
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:49,408
these "poor souls" were all
criminally insane inmates

51
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:52,211
at Arkham Asylum, were they not?

52
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:54,780
Next question.

53
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:57,649
Hear that? You should be lauded.

54
00:04:57,717 --> 00:04:59,084
I'll settle for the cash.

55
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:00,686
How many escapees you brought in now?

56
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:02,955
- Hmm? Six?
- Five grand a pop?

57
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:04,389
That's not too bad.

58
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,692
What happens when there aren't any more?

59
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,827
I don't think Gotham's running
out of monsters anytime soon.

60
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,630
I really can't get
you to come back, huh?

61
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,565
Look, whatever happened
when you went to see Lee,

62
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,968
and you know I don't like to pry...

63
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:17,436
Sure you don't.

64
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:18,804
That's because you
won't tell me anything.

65
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,340
The whole point is man's
not supposed to be alone.

66
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:23,909
- You have a family here.
- Can't do it, Harv.

67
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:26,687
But you got no problem
chasing down Strange's freaks?

68
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,875
Yeah, it pays the rent.

69
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,649
You are a cop in everything but name.

70
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:32,851
Yeah, except I don't
have to listen to Barnes.

71
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,621
I get to go home when I
want, get drunk when I want.

72
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:38,023
And at the end of the day, I sleep.

73
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,959
'Cause saving Gotham's
not my job anymore.

74
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:42,527
Jim, I love you like a brother,

75
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,863
but you've got to stop blaming the job

76
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,232
for what happened between you and Lee.

77
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,167
And do you really

78
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,336
think I don't get drunk when I want?

79
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:54,973
Detective Bullock?

80
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,508
I looked into the drug
the escapee was after.

81
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:58,810
It's a powerful immune suppressant.

82
00:05:58,878 --> 00:05:59,978
Gordon.

83
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,179
See, look at Lucius here.

84
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:04,182
Our new resident expert
on all things scientific.

85
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,218
He said sayonara to
the Wayne Enterprises

86
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,720
robots, hmm, and he loves it here.

87
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,958
Wayne Enterprises revealed
itself as morally corrupt.

88
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:16,094
Here, despite the primitive facilities,

89
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:18,830
casual violence, fascistic
meathead culture...

90
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:20,065
Lucius?

91
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,533
I love it.

92
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:22,834
Anyway,

93
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:25,103
that drug is only sold at
three pharmacies in the city,

94
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:27,673
and the other two pharmacies were
both robbed in the last month.

95
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,074
The question is

96
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:31,576
why are Indian Hill escapees
now robbing pharmacies?

97
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:32,878
Good question.

98
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:35,213
So, what do you say just
like the old days you

99
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,948
and me run it together... Huh, partner?

100
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,051
You get a hard lead on an escapee

101
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:41,887
and the price is right,
I'll bring him in.

102
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:43,755
Thanks for the drink.

103
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:46,158
Lucius.

104
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:48,226
"Fascistic meathead culture"?

105
00:06:48,294 --> 00:06:50,896
I mean, you couldn't try to be
just a little bit more positive?

106
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:53,148
- I was very positive.
- Uh-huh.

107
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:56,390
Why is Hugo Strange the only
one that's been arrested?

108
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,958
- The situation...
- And what about the rumors

109
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,359
that Indian Hill is a
Wayne Enterprises facility?

110
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,895
And how many more of these
escapees are at large?

111
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,797
- Are we talking 20? 30?
- Excuse me, excuse me...

112
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:04,865
Just give me a blink if I'm close.

113
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,935
The situation is firmly in hand.

114
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,269
Liar!

115
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,340
Oh, no.

116
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:16,677
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

117
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:19,079
We know who you are, Penguin.

118
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,414
What do you want?

119
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,916
What do I want?

120
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,486
I want you to tell the truth
to the people of Gotham.

121
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:28,989
They would have us believe
that there is no danger.

122
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,558
But I was there the night

123
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,660
those creatures broke
out of Indian Hill.

124
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,662
I saw them.

125
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,498
And I saw who's leading them.

126
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,033
Are saying the escapees are organized?

127
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,736
Hello! That is what I am saying.

128
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,472
There is absolutely
nothing to support that.

129
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,940
I told the police who to look for.

130
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,443
I begged them time and again.

131
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,112
And they have done

132
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,914
nothing.

133
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:56,750
And so I am here

134
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,853
to speak directly to the good people

135
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,489
of Gotham.

136
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:06,226
The enemy's name is Fish Mooney.

137
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:08,829
"Fish Mooney"? She hasn't been spotted

138
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,564
for over six months.

139
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:13,533
She's either long gone or she's dead.

140
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:17,137
I wish I shared your simple belief.

141
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:20,173
She is a criminal.

142
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,010
She is a murderer.

143
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:24,678
And now God knows what kind of monster

144
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,647
Hugo Strange has turned her into.

145
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,083
I implore every citizen of Gotham,

146
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,085
if you love your family,

147
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:34,988
if you love your children,

148
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,125
find Fish Mooney.

149
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:41,795
Until then, no one is safe.

150
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:54,741
Hello, Jim.

151
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,810
Oswald.

152
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,313
I'm surprised you haven't found Mooney.

153
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,382
I hear you're quite the
bounty hunter these days.

154
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,688
You haven't made it worth my while.

155
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,955
Oh.

156
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:10,624
Tough guy now.

157
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,026
But he makes a point.

158
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:45,492
Ozzy.

159
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,127
Butch.

160
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,863
What a nice surprise.

161
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:52,199
Forgive me for not coming sooner.

162
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,601
The place looks marvelous!

163
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:58,839
- Wouldn't you say so, Butch?
- Yeah, place looks great.

164
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:00,340
I imagine you're here about your offer.

165
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:03,009
To let us shelter under your umbrella?

166
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:04,678
I only want what's best for you.

167
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:05,979
I appreciate the thought.

168
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:08,582
But... we're big girls.

169
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,750
We can handle ourselves.

170
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,052
Can't we?

171
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,321
Sure we can.

172
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,056
Hey, Butch.

173
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,393
Hey, h-h-how you doing?

174
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,294
You taking care of yourself?

175
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:23,096
Y-Yeah, yeah.

176
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,699
So, uh, so how you doing?

177
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,634
You already asked her that.

178
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,002
Listen.

179
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,104
You guys should take
him up on his offer.

180
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,106
Gotham's full of rough characters.

181
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,809
You look great by the way.

182
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:38,612
Wait over there.

183
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,713
Please.

184
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,949
Poor bunny.

185
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,163
Break-ups are hard.

186
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:47,387
I offered to kill you.

187
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:50,023
I thought it would raise his spirits.

188
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:53,093
It would be my pleasure seeing
as how you murdered my mother!

189
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,828
But he is nursing

190
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,898
some foolish hope that you
two will get back together.

191
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,967
Love.

192
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,669
You can take your offer
and stick it up...

193
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,137
We'll think about it, Ozzy.

194
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,407
Fine.

195
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,176
But that's not the only reason I'm here.

196
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:10,944
Spread the word.

197
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:13,180
I want Fish Mooney.

198
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,315
And I will give a million dollars...

199
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:18,351
to whoever can bring her to me.

200
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,420
Dead...

201
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,155
or alive.

202
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,090
Chopped into pieces.

203
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:28,228
I want her.

204
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:35,735
You okay, Butch?

205
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,371
World getting you down?

206
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,807
Yeah, I'm fine, kid.

207
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,476
And you're too young to be in here.

208
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,611
- Scram.
- Jeesh.

209
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,013
Just trying to be nice.

210
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,751
Just seeing her kills me, you know?

211
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:55,856
Get over it.

212
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,225
And that child just stole your wallet.

213
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,266
Hey, Barbara and that whip lady

214
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,568
are gonna get angry you
stealing from their customers.

215
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:11,404
Let them. I got other things going.

216
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,640
- Like what?
- Top secret.

217
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,141
Let's eat; I'm starving.

218
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,643
Hey, kid.

219
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:19,646
Take it. It's yours.

220
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:22,449
Keep feeding strays, one's
gonna follow you home.

221
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:24,351
Like you?

222
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:34,983
Well, that should be the last of it.

223
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:36,985
I'll put the kettle on.

224
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,820
There's nothing like a sweet cup of tea

225
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:41,556
to make home feel like home
after a long trip away.

226
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:43,491
Hey, Master Bruce?

227
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:47,696
You all right?

228
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:54,903
Were we right to leave, Alfred?

229
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,571
Stay away all this time?

230
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,673
Well, considering the
appalling sight of the topiary,

231
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,408
I should say absolutely bloody not.

232
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:02,444
Alfred, you know what I mean.

233
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,181
I know you know why we left.

234
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:09,451
We had to leave.

235
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,553
You're nervous about
tomorrow, aren't you?

236
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,288
- Yes.
- Well, you wouldn't

237
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:14,956
be human if you weren't.

238
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,624
So, why don't you go
through there, take a pew.

239
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,793
Pop your feet up,

240
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,995
and I'll see about
that lovely cup of tea.

241
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:22,497
All right?

242
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,984
Saving that for someone special?

243
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:50,658
Coffee, please.

244
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:55,163
"Search continues for new
Arkham Asylum director."

245
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,731
Right.

246
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,967
Good luck finding
anyone to take that job.

247
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,769
I'm Valerie Vale.

248
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:03,204
- Reporter for The Gazette.
- I know who you are.

249
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,706
And you're James Gordon.

250
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:06,608
Son of a respected Gotham D.A.

251
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:08,977
Former war hero. Former
white knight cop.

252
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,945
Now bounty hunter.

253
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:12,480
You know, someone should
do a story on you.

254
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:16,918
- Eh, not interested.
- Yeah, me neither, actually.

255
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,520
You were there that
night, at Indian Hill.

256
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,588
- I got nothing to say.
- What about the fact

257
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,191
that besides Hugo Strange
and his assistant,

258
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:24,759
no one else has been arrested?

259
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,721
Or that despite everything
pointing to Wayne Enterprises,

260
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,161
there seems to be zero investigation.

261
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:31,662
You're new to Gotham, aren't you?

262
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,763
Okay, this is where

263
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,265
you tell me things
work differently here?

264
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm not from Gotham, but my dad's a cop.

265
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:37,234
My brothers are cops.

266
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,036
And things work the same everywhere.

267
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:41,706
I was going to say it's
hard to find a quiet bar

268
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:42,873
in the city.

269
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:44,175
I like coming here.

270
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,310
Please don't make me find another.

271
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,846
Now, do you think Cobblepot's right?

272
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:50,848
That Fish Mooney's
organizing the escapees?

273
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,150
Penguin is a liar and a murderer.

274
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:55,786
Hmm... but...

275
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,689
But based on the escapees,

276
00:14:58,757 --> 00:15:00,057
and knowing Fish...

277
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,494
I hope not.

278
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,698
Well...

279
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:10,634
he's offering a million dollars
to whoever brings her in.

280
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,970
You're welcome.

281
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:37,795
It's a puzzle.

282
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,885
The trick is opening it.

283
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:42,291
The man at the store said

284
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,435
it's one of the most
difficult ever made.

285
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:46,437
People pass it down unsolved

286
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:47,738
for generations.

287
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,309
A mathematician once went mad trying...

288
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,815
Yes.

289
00:15:57,883 --> 00:15:59,083
Well,

290
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,518
there you go.

291
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,653
It was a lovely thought.

292
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,050
And did you got the biscuits?

293
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,058
A-And the sweater?

294
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,293
I-I know how drafty these rooms are.

295
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:10,648
- Mr. Penguin.
- Oswald.

296
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,596
When I think of how I
treated you... Stop.

297
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:15,211
Why are you being so kind?

298
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:20,140
Talking to you these past months,

299
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,474
I don't know how I would've
gotten by otherwise.

300
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,678
With Fish out there
planning who knows what...

301
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,407
Me being surrounded by
morons and lunatics.

302
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:34,096
I know the feeling.

303
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,356
Why didn't she kill me
when she had the chance?

304
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,429
I was powerless.

305
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,496
She must have a larger goal.

306
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:47,865
I-I need to know what she is doing.

307
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:49,733
Do you?

308
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:00,244
When Alexander encountered
the Gordian knot,

309
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:03,347
a knot so complex no one had
ever been able to untangle it...

310
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,909
he just removed his
sword and cut it in two.

311
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,357
Details can be distracting.

312
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:14,625
Sometimes...

313
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,249
a simple solution is best.

314
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,699
See, no matter what she is planning,

315
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,167
just remember...

316
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,807
penguins...

317
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,808
eat...

318
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:33,077
fish.

319
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,401
You know why we're here.

320
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:19,429
- What are you doing here?
- Stop.

321
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:20,509
Stop...

322
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:33,345
So what are we after?

323
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,721
It's not like they keep cash around.

324
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:39,017
For now, survival. GUARD: Don't move!

325
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:41,946
Hands.

326
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:44,494
Hands.

327
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:49,072
Of course.

328
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:57,528
Drop the gun.

329
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,666
Now knock yourself out.

330
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,645
That was awesome. How did you...

331
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:13,944
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, Fish.

332
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,579
I'm fine.

333
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,314
Watch the door.

334
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:23,887
Yeah, that's the only
company that makes the drug.

335
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,990
Gray Pharma.

336
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:27,358
They actually have a
warehouse here in Gotham.

337
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:28,826
You think they could be a target?

338
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,228
Well, they're the only
pharmacy that carries the drug.

339
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,630
If somebody wants it, they'll
have to go to the source.

340
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:35,405
Let me find the address.

341
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,757
That's all right.

342
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,717
James Gordon.

343
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,275
Hands where I can see them.

344
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,827
So, what?

345
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:09,132
You're here to collect the
bounty Penguin has over my head?

346
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:12,302
What is it, a million dollars?

347
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,139
And to think I let that punk live.

348
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,774
Well, then,

349
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,310
I think you better cuff me.

350
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:22,312
Cuff yourself.

351
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,033
How many others you have with you?

352
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,674
They're all with me.

353
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:29,036
Every wretched soul

354
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,496
that Hugo Strange experimented on.

355
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,721
But tonight,

356
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:34,146
just him.

357
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:23,579
Did you hear them rats last night?

358
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:26,024
Scurrying around in the attic,
driving me bloody bonkers.

359
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:27,772
I'm gonna ask you,

360
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:29,146
what's the point of having a caretaker,

361
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:31,306
if they can't take care of nothing, aye?

362
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:34,928
You all right, Master B?

363
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:36,836
Hungry.

364
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:40,840
- I should've eaten.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

365
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,973
I do this, there's no turning back.

366
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:51,784
No.

367
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,248
You say your piece.

368
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:59,578
We'll see about getting you a
proper breakfast, all right?

369
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:16,550
I'd like to thank the board
for giving me this time.

370
00:22:17,618 --> 00:22:19,025
It will come as no surprise

371
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,248
I'd like to talk about Indian Hill.

372
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:24,157
I know preliminary
investigations have concluded

373
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:25,547
Hugo Strange acted alone.

374
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,469
I reject this conclusion.

375
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:32,405
While trapped in Indian
Hill, I was led to believe

376
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:35,374
an unnamed group had taken
control of my company,

377
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:37,943
and it was they who hired Hugo Strange.

378
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:39,592
I left Gotham

379
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:41,080
both for my own safety and so that

380
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:42,882
I might have the time to
discover hard evidence

381
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,480
of their existence.

382
00:22:45,683 --> 00:22:49,288
A conspiracy theory?
That's why we're all here?

383
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:50,923
Excuse me, Master Bruce.

384
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:54,026
Pardon me, sir, might I
have your name, please?

385
00:22:54,094 --> 00:22:57,697
- What?
- Your name... please, sir.

386
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:00,575
Crowley.

387
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:04,236
Mr. Crowley, did your parents
ever teach you any manners?

388
00:23:04,304 --> 00:23:06,639
I don't have to listen to this.

389
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:08,674
Oh, but you do, sir!

390
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:12,011
That is precisely the
point that I am making.

391
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:15,050
I know how it sounds.

392
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,052
But I now have proof they exist.

393
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,516
And I can tell you that they're here.

394
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:27,593
In this room.

395
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,566
I want to talk face to face.

396
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:36,068
You have 24 hours to contact
me, or the information

397
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:38,104
that I've gathered will
be sent to every newspaper

398
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:39,505
and television station in Gotham.

399
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:43,609
Thank you for your time.

400
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:50,416
Pancakes?

401
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:52,218
Pancakes.

402
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:00,159
And how did the board react?

403
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,629
Then he leaves us no choice.

404
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:11,370
Bruce Wayne.

405
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:14,407
Do it quietly.

406
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,837
- You Barbara Kean?
- We're closed.

407
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:49,542
What?

408
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:52,344
You built this club on our territory.

409
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:55,948
We let you, 'cause we heard
Penguin had your back.

410
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,484
- And now we hear that ain't so.
- Oh.

411
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,087
Bad for you; good for us.

412
00:25:03,824 --> 00:25:04,957
Get the hell out.

413
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:08,527
This place is ours now.

414
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:09,929
Do you understand?

415
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:11,096
You can't just come...

416
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:13,532
Don't hit me, okay? Please.

417
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:50,069
Hey. Hey.

418
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:52,438
You still paying for stuff
about the Indian Hill freaks?

419
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:54,073
Depends.

420
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,608
If it's good.

421
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:58,244
Is Fish Mooney good?

422
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:11,790
- Guess I'm finding a new bar.
- I heard you ran into

423
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:13,158
Fish Mooney yesterday.

424
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:14,860
- So?
- So...

425
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,595
are you still interested in finding her?

426
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:19,064
Every cop in the city's
looking for her now.

427
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:22,234
But I know where she's gonna be next.

428
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:24,737
- Why are you telling me?
- You see,

429
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:26,472
I need something from the cops.

430
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,074
They're not gonna tell me,
but Bullock still trusts you.

431
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:31,210
And you want me to lie to him.

432
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:33,579
A million dollars covers a lot of sins.

433
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,148
And obviously, I get to come along.

434
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:38,384
Aw. Don't tell me you have a conscience.

435
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:39,585
Yeah, all right.

436
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:48,928
Jimmy, hey. So...

437
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:51,196
after your run-in with Fish,

438
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,198
Barnes had us up all night,
rousting her old hideouts.

439
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:55,167
- Yeah. Did you find anything?
- Nada.

440
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:57,570
But I did get what you asked for.

441
00:26:57,637 --> 00:26:59,738
Want to tell me what this is about?

442
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,674
It's a hunch. Probably nothing.

443
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:03,442
Well, if you got a hot lead
you don't want to share

444
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,877
so you can collect Penguin's money,

445
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:06,211
I got no problem with that.

446
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,681
Just don't get yourself
killed or me fired, okay?

447
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,716
I'll do my best. Hey,
get some rest, huh?

448
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:16,722
Hey.

449
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:25,364
When'd you get back?

450
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:26,899
A couple days ago.

451
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:30,169
I tried to find you before I left.

452
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:31,637
No worries.

453
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:35,407
You remember what I discovered
that night at Indian Hill?

454
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:37,509
That there was a secret group
that infiltrated my company.

455
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:39,745
I wasn't paying attention.

456
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:42,247
I needed time to research
them. I couldn't do it here.

457
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:43,782
Okay.

458
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,250
I have a plan, but these
people are powerful.

459
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:47,653
We need to assume they
know you and I are friends.

460
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:48,821
You need to be careful.

461
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:49,888
- Got it.
- I'm serious.

462
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:51,890
I can see that!

463
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:57,896
I'm sorry I was gone for so long.

464
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:59,598
Don't apologize.

465
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,567
Shoot, if I could fly to Italy

466
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:03,869
and eat pizza all day, I would, too.

467
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:06,105
- Switzerland.
- Italy's better.

468
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:08,874
- Selina...
- Bruce, seriously...

469
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:10,743
don't sweat it.

470
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,911
I got to go.

471
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:15,881
I'll see you around.

472
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,785
Good to see you, Selina.

473
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,714
- Hey, did you get it?
- Yeah.

474
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,159
She's under guard in a
building on Douglas and 80th.

475
00:28:39,223 --> 00:28:40,890
There's one thing, though.

476
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:43,092
Hey. Hey!

477
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,594
What the hell are you doing?!

478
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:45,928
You're 100 yards from a police station.

479
00:28:45,996 --> 00:28:47,663
I'll be back in an hour or two.

480
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:48,931
We had a deal.

481
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,933
If there's a story, I'll
make sure you get it.

482
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,502
Oh, you're a son of a bitch.

483
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:53,903
Also, you could scream,
but then you'd have

484
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:54,971
to tell the cops everything.

485
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:57,206
And you'd lose the story entirely.

486
00:28:57,274 --> 00:28:58,274
Gordon.

487
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:00,009
Gordon!

488
00:29:00,077 --> 00:29:02,745
Son of a bitch!

489
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,527
47... this is dispatch.

490
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:18,728
This is 47.

491
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:20,029
Report to Captain Barnes immediately.

492
00:29:20,097 --> 00:29:22,398
Relief team will take
your place. Over and out.

493
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:25,735
You got it. We're out of here.

494
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:57,033
I knocked.

495
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,868
I didn't answer.

496
00:29:58,936 --> 00:30:00,670
You alone?

497
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:02,438
All day, every day.

498
00:30:02,506 --> 00:30:06,042
I wasn't expecting
Jim Gordon to stop by.

499
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:09,345
You aren't supposed to be here, are you?

500
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,647
How come you're not in jail?

501
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:15,101
I agreed to testify
against Professor Strange.

502
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:16,986
In case you're about to ask,

503
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:19,689
I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.

504
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:22,625
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.

505
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,660
Then why are you here?

506
00:30:27,064 --> 00:30:28,531
Fish Mooney.

507
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,235
And why would I know
how to find Fish Mooney?

508
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:33,903
No reason you would.

509
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:36,105
But it's clear whatever
you and Strange did to her

510
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:37,506
is making her sick.

511
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:40,509
Her people are stealing drugs.

512
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:41,744
But I don't think they're working.

513
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:43,446
She's gonna come after you.

514
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:45,648
Or her goons will.

515
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:47,750
And they'll lead me to her.

516
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,018
And how will they find me?

517
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:51,120
Only the police are supposed to know.

518
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:54,323
My guess... she'll have someone
get the information for her.

519
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:57,126
Someone who wouldn't suspect being used.

520
00:30:57,194 --> 00:30:59,762
Maybe a reporter.

521
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:06,736
She'll follow that person or whoever

522
00:31:06,803 --> 00:31:08,638
she goes to for help.

523
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:10,506
In this case, a bounty hunter.

524
00:31:10,574 --> 00:31:11,807
Right...

525
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,576
to you.

526
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:18,014
You led them to me on purpose.

527
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:20,483
You're using me as bait.

528
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,418
I don't like being played.

529
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:24,387
Plus she's worth a million dollars.

530
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:50,112
No! Gordon! Help!

531
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,881
Somebody help!

532
00:32:41,104 --> 00:32:42,638
I don't know, which one of you

533
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,873
I want to bat over the
head with this cane more.

534
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:47,442
I get it.

535
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,678
Life disappointed you.

536
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:52,281
So what? Does that make you special?

537
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:53,916
I'm done with you.

538
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:56,706
You cross me again, I will
have you skinned alive

539
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,720
and your head put on a pike.

540
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:01,123
And you,

541
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,063
when I came back,

542
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:06,495
and saw the way you handled
things while I was away,

543
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:08,789
I swear, I had this feeling right here.

544
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:11,300
I thought I was having a heart attack.

545
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,635
But it was pride, Bullock.

546
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:15,103
In you.

547
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:17,164
The next time I have that feeling,

548
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:20,342
I'll know it was just gas.

549
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:24,680
You both better pray that we find her.

550
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,237
Get out of my sight.

551
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:37,693
I'd say that went well.

552
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,325
He was right though.
About me being Captain.

553
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:42,551
I did a good job. I even liked it.

554
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,220
Yeah. Hey, look, I'm sorry, Harvey.

555
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,122
I'll do my best to find Peabody.

556
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,957
Honestly, Jim,

557
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:50,893
for the time being, I think

558
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,295
it might be better if you just...

559
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:54,596
stayed away.

560
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:57,633
Hey. Hey!

561
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:03,405
- Ow.
- Just tell me, did you know?

562
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:04,973
Did I know what?

563
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,341
That Mooney was using
us to find Peabody.

564
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:08,076
You mean using you?

565
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:09,745
Yeah, it's her kind of play.

566
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:11,280
You should've told me.

567
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:13,873
Sure. Why don't you tell
me who your source was?

568
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:15,918
That's it?

569
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:18,012
You're not gonna try and find Mooney?

570
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:20,889
Barnes is on it. I've had a long day.

571
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:22,257
I'm gonna get a drink.

572
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:24,326
Gordon...

573
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,032
Nothing.

574
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:38,440
- Come on.
- I said no.

575
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:40,809
- Who are they?
- Just people.

576
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,411
They need me to do things for them.

577
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:43,679
Well, I can do stuff.

578
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:47,182
These are scary people, okay?

579
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,291
- It's for your own good.
- You just don't want to share.

580
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,555
Just stay here, all right?

581
00:35:00,363 --> 00:35:01,964
Hello?

582
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:03,899
What do you want?

583
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,468
I want to talk to her.

584
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,538
I was following her.

585
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:11,234
She was kind to me.

586
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:14,876
But then she met him. That boy.

587
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:16,645
What happened to you?

588
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,776
- You know me?
- Uh, yeah. I know Bruce Wayne.

589
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,451
Who is he? Who is he?

590
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:23,752
What's wrong with you? Let go of me!

591
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,853
Bruce Wayne!

592
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,788
Bruce Wayne.

593
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,724
Who is he?

594
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:33,295
Really do not have time for this!

595
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:34,496
He started it.

596
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:35,731
It's a lie!

597
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:37,199
They cwub is in our territory

598
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,167
"Cwub?" What's a "cwub?"

599
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:40,902
Cwub.

600
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,305
What's a "cwub?" I mean,
can anyone understand him?

601
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,107
- Do you know what a "cwub" is?
- Cwub.

602
00:35:45,174 --> 00:35:47,042
Enough.

603
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,877
We will work something out.

604
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:51,546
Now, this is his territory.

605
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:53,348
What are you willing to give him?

606
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,526
Boop.

607
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:07,129
That is not helpful.

608
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:09,898
Are you telling me you don't
see what's going on here?

609
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,483
He is behind this.

610
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:14,236
What are you talking about?

611
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,738
He sent this ding dong to squeeze us,

612
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:18,106
hoping it would send us back to you,

613
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:20,609
so that he could lord it over Tabby.

614
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:21,843
Ain't that right?

615
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:24,546
That's c... that's just... that's crazy.

616
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:26,181
She's crazy.

617
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:27,949
She was in Arkham. Hello?

618
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:29,551
"Hello?" So was I.

619
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,987
Is that true, Butch?

620
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:37,292
Unbelievable.

621
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,237
Fine. Run your club.

622
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:51,306
Just so we're clear,

623
00:36:51,374 --> 00:36:53,308
the only reason you are alive

624
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,776
is Butch.

625
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:58,677
The moment he gives
the word, you're mine.

626
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:17,733
Hello again.

627
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,435
I know why you brought me here.

628
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:22,037
Your body is beginning to reject

629
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:24,773
the changes we made to your DNA.

630
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:28,443
You feel it every time you use...

631
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:29,711
your ability.

632
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:32,214
How do I fix it?

633
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,316
Stop using the power.

634
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:36,251
Every time you use it,

635
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,386
new cells are activated,
and your body rejects them.

636
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:42,357
Stop, and you will recover.

637
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,003
It's that simple.

638
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:45,976
It's just...

639
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:49,097
I like the new me.

640
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:51,299
I can't fix you.

641
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,268
I can't re-order your DNA...

642
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:59,633
There's... always a way.

643
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,911
Strange. He can.

644
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:05,447
He's the only one.

645
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:12,187
- Where is Strange?
- I don't know.

646
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:14,623
They've hidden him somewhere secret.

647
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,826
Him fixing me is just the beginning.

648
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:20,462
I want an army.

649
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,832
I want an army like me!

650
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,334
And he is going to give it to me.

651
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:29,849
- He can't.
- Oh, he will.

652
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:33,074
Or he will die.

653
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:37,378
You remember Marv.

654
00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:39,261
He's one of yours.

655
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,584
Sort of a... fountain of youth

656
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:44,552
in reverse.

657
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:52,894
Good night, Ethel.

658
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:54,996
No!

659
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:20,509
We caught a spy.

660
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:21,979
Ivy?

661
00:39:22,017 --> 00:39:24,185
Selina, tell this creep

662
00:39:24,252 --> 00:39:25,419
to let go of me.

663
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:26,620
She's my friend.

664
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:30,324
- I don't like spies.
- She's not a spy.

665
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,793
Ivy, what are you doing here?

666
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,829
I followed you the other day,
so I knew where you went.

667
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:36,464
Bruce Wayne came looking for you,

668
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:37,932
but he was acting all weird...

669
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,234
Who else have you told about us?

670
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:41,702
- No one.
- I asked her.

671
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,504
- Selina...
- Ivy, shut up!

672
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:45,339
They're those monsters everyone's
talking about, aren't they?

673
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:46,974
You better tell your friend

674
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:48,709
to be careful who she calls a monster.

675
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,444
You better stay away from me.

676
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:51,746
All of you! I'll tell!

677
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:57,873
Marv?

678
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:02,223
No!

679
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,591
Leave her alone!

680
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:05,593
Stay away from me!

681
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:10,498
Ivy!

682
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:11,899
Ivy!

683
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:18,072
Ivy!

684
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:20,708
Watch out!

685
00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:24,311
Help!

686
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,583
Ivy?

687
00:41:31,546 --> 00:41:33,380
Right, once this alarm
is set, Master Bruce,

688
00:41:33,448 --> 00:41:36,150
no coming downstairs till
the morning, is that clear?

689
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:38,185
Yes, but was a new alarm
system really necessary?

690
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:39,687
I don't know. Was it really necessary

691
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:42,923
offering a challenge to a shadowy cabal?

692
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:47,561
Yes, it was necessary, Master Bruce.

693
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:58,525
Alfred?

694
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:01,517
Alf...

695
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:03,211
Alfred!

696
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:07,190
Alfred, wake up.

697
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:08,440
Alfred!
