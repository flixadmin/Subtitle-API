1
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:32,488
Aah!

2
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:37,248
Aah!

3
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,329
- Whoo!
- Ha ha ha!

4
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:41,807
Aah!

5
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:44,003
Oh, man!

6
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,169
- Did you see that?
- Woo!

7
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:49,886
Oh, my God. Ha ha!

8
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,810
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

9
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,127
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

10
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,242
Oh, babe. You missed out.

11
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,282
Yes!

12
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,563
I want to get off.

13
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:10,404
Whoo! Ow!

14
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:11,488
Ha ha ha!

15
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,886
That was intense, man.

16
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,844
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

17
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:16,008
Yeah, yeah. Maybe for you...

18
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,725
but our lives are
actually goin' somewhere.

19
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,684
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

20
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,564
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

21
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:22,887
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line...

22
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,127
for, like, a day and a half
and that's gonna kill me.

23
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:26,084
- OK!
- All right? So let's go.

24
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,408
They're totally
gonna dig this, man!

25
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:29,442
OK. Come on, it won't kill us...

26
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:31,165
to get a deep-fried
Snickers and a Coke.

27
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,202
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?

28
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,402
Yeah, that might kill me.

29
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:36,490
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

30
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,682
Ha ha ha!

31
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:54,253
- Unh!
- Ha ha!

32
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:55,402
Oh, I'll take that.

33
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:57,091
No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

34
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,327
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

35
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,362
Ha ha!

36
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:00,926
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

37
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:01,962
Oh, my God,
you're such an idiot.

38
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,731
Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

39
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:05,525
Ha ha!

40
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:06,688
- Ow!
- Nice.

41
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,372
Um, could you, like, please
delete that one of Stacy?

42
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:10,687
Ha ha!

43
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,485
These are
for the yearbook.

44
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,886
And I have to
turn them in tomorrow...

45
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,332
to make a deadline
and, like, I doubt it...

46
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,489
if a shot of Stacy
Kobayashi's camel toe...

47
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,602
is gonna make it in there.

48
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:19,847
Whew. I'd buy 2.

49
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,008
Ha ha ha!

50
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,327
Number 38, your order's ready.

51
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:24,250
That's us.

52
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:25,806
I am so sorry.

53
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:27,252
Kevin can get so out of control.

54
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:30,091
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

55
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,488
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak...

56
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,127
like I couldn't handle that.

57
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:39,892
I'm breaking up with him.

58
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,845
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.

59
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:44,121
I've been wanting to for a while.

60
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:46,687
But don't tell anybody, OK?

61
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:47,961
Whoa. Ha ha!

62
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:50,652
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

63
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,086
I love it. I love it.

64
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:57,285
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

65
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,652
Come on, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

66
00:04:58,693 --> 00:04:59,728
Oh, my God, Ashley,
you're winning.

67
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:01,092
You're totally winning.

68
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,043
Am I winning?

69
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,082
Yeah, come on, hurry!

70
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,885
OK, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

71
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:07,281
Am I winning? Look around,
I don't want to look.

72
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,607
You're totally winning.

73
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,642
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

74
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:10,648
Don't look!

75
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:11,887
Oh, my God! Come on!

76
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:12,922
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,201
I'm winning!
I'm winning!

78
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,005
Aah!

79
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:16,929
Aah!

80
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,884
- I won!
- I knew you would.

81
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,412
Oh, my God!
Gimme my prize.

82
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,522
Good job.

83
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,052
That was
so awesome, Ashley.

84
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,082
Ashley.

85
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,924
Woo! Ha ha!

86
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:32,249
How ya doin', my brother?
You havin' a good time, huh?

87
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,889
- You like that?
- Ha ha!

88
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,686
Yeah! You like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

89
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,212
Whoo-ooh!

90
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:41,732
Damn!

91
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,486
Excuse me.

92
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:51,852
You're not a senior.

93
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,246
And what are you
gonna do about it...

94
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:56,365
Miss "Cutest Couple",
rah rah? Ha ha!

95
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,051
Mom know you're here?

96
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,643
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

97
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,524
Proof where you were.

98
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,131
Take a shot of this.

99
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:06,322
Ha ha ha!

100
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,122
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about.

101
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,083
That's three.

102
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,452
* That is three, number three *

103
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,404
* Oh I'm the man, I'm the man *

104
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:19,886
Man, I am hot.
Man, gimme some right here, man.

105
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:20,922
Right here, right here.

00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,612
Here we go. Here we go.

00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:35,802
Big prize. Watch out. Come on.

114
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,888
Unh!

115
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:41,245
Ho ho ho!

116
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,170
* That's what I'm talkin' 'bout *

117
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:44,771
We gonna get that one.
You want that blue one?

118
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:45,802
That's the one we gonna get.

119
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,727
Ha ha ha!

120
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:57,644
Ha ha ha ha!

121
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:02,972
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

122
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:03,923
- Yes!
- Whoo!

123
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:04,962
Here we are, baby.

124
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:06,890
- Yes!
- Whoo! There it is.

125
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:07,922
Awesome.

126
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,725
Here, get a pic of this. Ahhh!

127
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:12,333
This is the beginning of the end.

128
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:15,603
Ha ha ha!

129
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:17,530
Hey, guys, get in line.

130
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:24,009
Let's go on again!

131
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,042
What's wrong?

132
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,330
I'm...

133
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:30,443
I was having that feeling
like déjà vu, you know?

134
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,724
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

135
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:34,808
Hey, J.

136
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:35,968
Come on, man, let's go.

137
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:37,890
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

138
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,412
What, are you
weirded out by the ride?

139
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:43,965
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe...

140
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,605
you're nervous about
this roller coaster...

141
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,167
because they say the real
fear with these rides...

142
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:51,364
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

143
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:54,291
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

144
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,052
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

145
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,412
Never.

146
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:00,842
OK.

147
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:04,408
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

148
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:05,772
Oh! Where you guys
are right now...

149
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:06,962
if you raise
your hands and just...

150
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,890
Ha! Cup them slightly...

151
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:11,322
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

152
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,091
And we'd wanna do that why?

153
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,363
When else you ever gonna
see a dick that big?

154
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,528
I'm lookin' at one right now.

155
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:21,010
Ha ha! Man,
you guys are smokin' hot.

156
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:22,008
Get out, Frankie.

157
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,122
Yeah, why are you even here?

158
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:24,970
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.

159
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:27,208
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

160
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,005
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

161
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:31,044
- Let's do it. Let's do it.
- Come on. Come on.

162
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,086
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

163
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,327
Ha ha ha ha!

164
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:38,409
You're totally sad.

165
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,807
Try not to scream!

166
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:46,651
Ha ha ha ha ha!

167
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:51,805
That was totally awesome!

168
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:53,172
Yeah! Sweet!

169
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:17,962
You all right?

170
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:20,288
There's nothing to worry about.

171
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,449
A roller coaster is
just elemental physics.

172
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:25,405
A conversion of potential
energy to kinetic energy.

173
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:27,364
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million...

174
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:28,766
of dying in a roller coaster.

175
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,088
Yeah, yeah, thanks
for that, McKinley.

176
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,203
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park...

177
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,164
than dying at one.

178
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:37,883
Whoo!

179
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,452
Here we go.

180
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,850
Whoo!

181
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,526
You like this?

182
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,087
Won it on the wacky ladder.

183
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,523
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

184
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:03,212
I like this. It's old school...

185
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:06,086
Frankie Cheeks
is old school, ladies.

186
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:09,728
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honour.

187
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:10,808
Ew.

188
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,605
Oh! Let's go.

189
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,291
Hey... Baby.

190
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,210
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

191
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:17,402
- 4.
- Yeah.

192
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:18,772
Uh, gate one.

193
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,087
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

194
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,122
Wait... no. No, please.

195
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,242
I'm sorry, I don't
wanna be a hassle...

196
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:23,442
I just... I can't sit in the front.

197
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:25,643
I cannot see the tracks.
I'll freak.

198
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,968
OK. Take it easy.

199
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,924
Uh, well, Carrie will sit...

200
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,042
in the back with you.
Right, babe?

201
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:32,685
Uh! Why me?

202
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,882
What? 'Cause we're girls?

203
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,332
Fuck that.
I'm going to Berkeley...

204
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:36,886
and I won't get to do
this for a while.

205
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,048
I'm sitting in the front.

206
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,406
J, just go, OK? I'll live.

207
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:41,886
You're not gonna
sit by yourself.

208
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:42,843
All right, you know what?

209
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:43,803
We'll just settle
this like real men,

210
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,445
How about that? Hmm? Call it.

211
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:46,448
Heads.

212
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:50,843
Shit! Damn it.

213
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,121
All right, fine, what the fuck.

214
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,208
It's the same ride, right?

215
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,971
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

216
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:57,481
Hey, uh, just do me a favour.

217
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,205
Keep an eye on her, OK?
She's kinda freaked out.

218
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,242
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

219
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,249
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

220
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:15,133
Aaah!

221
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:36,846
Here we go. Hey!

222
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:38,849
J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

223
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:41,123
I'm serious. You know,
payback's a bitch, OK?

224
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:42,891
You know, she might
need some comforting...

225
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,525
and I'll be there for her. OK?

226
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,643
Hey, no! No. Get out. Get out.

227
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,092
Hey! Find another
cockpit, Top Gun.

228
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,771
No. Get...

229
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:51,690
Let's just get in the back, OK?

230
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:54,806
Ha ha ha!

231
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:56,844
Ahem.

232
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,721
Guess who's back?

233
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:02,286
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

234
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,608
Hey!

235
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:06,530
I'll meet you at the end.

236
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:09,772
Here! All right!

237
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,928
Cool!

238
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:14,283
Hey. How'd you guys
get in here?

239
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,971
What? I'm 55 inches.

240
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,332
Sure. Come on out. Oh, man.

241
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:18,647
You too. Out.

242
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:19,887
- Ready?
- Ohh!

243
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:22,208
I told you we wouldn't
get away with it.

244
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:23,242
You OK?

245
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:24,726
Let's go on
the bumper cars.

246
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,650
Come on. Here we go.

247
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,046
Yeah!

248
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:36,762
What's up, man? I'm good.

249
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,807
Dare you to, uh, flash me
them sweet, sweet titties...

250
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,047
when we go through the loop.

251
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,049
- All right.
- Ha ha!

252
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,207
Yo! What, you can't read?

253
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,281
Oh. Well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man?

254
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,322
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

255
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,204
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

256
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,006
Oh!

257
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:17,771
Aw, shit!

258
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,128
Here you go!

259
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,889
Whoo! Win, baby!
Yes, baby! Win!

260
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,571
Come on!

261
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:39,331
Come on. Get hyped.

262
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:40,692
The first hill's so high.

263
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:41,961
Yeah.

264
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:44,811
This is what we need!

265
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:47,492
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

266
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,727
Whoo!

267
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:51,241
Whoo-hoo!

268
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:53,090
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

269
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,202
Ow!

270
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,610
Whoo!

271
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,931
Aw, yeah!

272
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,452
Whoo!

273
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:32,005
Whoo! Shit!

274
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:37,723
Ha ha!

275
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,926
Aah!

276
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,691
Oh, man.

277
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,610
Oh, my God!

278
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:45,529
Here we go!

279
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,165
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

280
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:48,441
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

281
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:49,892
Aah!

282
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,651
Yeah! Whoo!

283
00:14:56,933 --> 00:15:00,005
Aah!

284
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,530
Ha ha!

285
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,692
- Aah! Aah!
- Ha ha ha!

286
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:13,603
Whoo!

287
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:16,524
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

288
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:18,882
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

289
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:26,330
Aah! Aah!

290
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:34,606
Whoo!

291
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:41,572
Yeah! Show me your titties!

292
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:42,682
- Fuck off, Frankie!
- Oh!

293
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,927
Aah!

294
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:58,490
Aah!

295
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:02,921
Unh!

296
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,526
Oh, shit!

297
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,131
- Aah!
- Aah!

298
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:09,447
Aah!

299
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:13,684
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

300
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,166
Aah!

301
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:19,652
No!

302
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,166
Aah!

303
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:38,966
Aah!

304
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:41,687
Oh! Oh!

305
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,525
Shit!

306
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,412
Unh!

307
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:55,204
Oh!

308
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:56,766
- Yow!
- Kevin!

309
00:16:57,613 --> 00:16:58,728
No!

310
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:00,047
Aah!

311
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,608
Aah!

312
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,928
No! Aah!

313
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:25,928
Aah!

314
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:27,725
Erin, hang on!

315
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:30,003
Erin!

316
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:31,532
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

317
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:32,449
I can't.

318
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:33,687
Aah!

319
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,091
Aah!

320
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,566
No!

321
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,688
Aah!

322
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,371
Oh, God!

323
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,926
Hang on, Wen.

324
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:45,726
Hang on! Help me rock it!

325
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,092
Unh!

326
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,531
Unh!

327
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:59,042
Almost got it! Gently.

328
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:10,245
Aaaah!

329
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:14,726
No!

330
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:17,241
Unh! Aah!

331
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:20,091
Aah!

332
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:24,285
Yo. What, you can't read?

333
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,925
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

334
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:28,566
Thanks, bro.

335
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:29,807
All right.
Let's do this, Wen...

336
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,650
- Oh!
- What're you...?

337
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,206
Here you go!

338
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,483
Yeah! Let's do it, baby! Whoo!

339
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,364
We have to get off of here.

340
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:38,482
No, don't push the button!

341
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,761
Don't! Don't push the button!

342
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:42,327
Unh! Let me off! Let me off!

343
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:43,692
Wen, Wen! It's all right.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

344
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,371
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

345
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,368
Wendy?

346
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:49,849
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

347
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,292
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

348
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,561
Chick's on somethin'.

349
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:53,648
It's all right!
You'll be OK!

350
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,682
OK let 'em out. Just the back.

351
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,882
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

352
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:58,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

353
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,203
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

354
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,483
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

355
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,808
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

356
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,525
No, she was just
a little upset before.

357
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,484
Man, please, can you
please control that bitch?

358
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,730
Damn. "It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

359
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:14,650
Man, she's just trying to
get some fuckin' attention.

360
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,365
Know what? You're a real
piece of shit, Lewis.

361
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,812
- Fuck you.
- Fuck moi?

362
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,172
- No, man, fuck you!
- Don't touch me.

363
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,123
Ow!

364
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,128
Hey, hey!

365
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,447
Unh!

366
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:23,369
Just relax!

367
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,528
Fight, man!

368
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:25,562
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

369
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,171
Nobody else gets off this ride!

370
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,044
Dude, let me off.

371
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:30,287
So high school.

372
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,448
Let's out.

373
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:32,482
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

374
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:33,522
- Relax!
- Lan!

375
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,292
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

376
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,209
Get him out of here!

377
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,721
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

378
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:42,128
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's OK.

379
00:19:42,173 --> 00:19:43,322
- Relax! Calm down!
- Hey! Ho!

380
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:43,964
Get outta here! Go!

381
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:44,843
Get your big ass off me, man!

382
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:45,882
* Hey, ho, let's go! *

383
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:46,968
Let me out!

384
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:48,287
* Hey, ho, let's go!
Hey, ho, let's go! *

385
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,402
Dude!

386
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,206
* Hey, ho, let's go!
Hey, ho, let's go! *

387
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,845
- Here we go!
- Let me off!

388
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,167
* Hey, ho *

389
00:19:57,773 --> 00:19:59,126
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

390
00:19:59,173 --> 00:20:00,083
Oh, my God!

391
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,364
Stop it! No! Stop it!

392
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:07,212
Stop it! Please!
Please, the tracks are broken.

393
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:10,131
Stop! Stop! Please!

394
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,606
Jason!

395
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:13,405
Hey, just relax, OK?

396
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,772
- Please!
- Ease up, man.

397
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,723
She's all right. OK?

398
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:16,888
Just let her
settle down.

399
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,252
She can settle down
at home! Now listen...

400
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,931
what is your
home phone number?

401
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:21,406
OK, we're gonna
call your mother, OK?

402
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,806
Everything will be
taken care of...

403
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,688
Oh, my God! Jason!

404
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,005
Hey, Wendy!

405
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:04,645
Hey!

406
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:07,253
Wait! Wendy!

407
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,851
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

408
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:10,531
I need... I need to talk
to you about something.

409
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:12,291
Just here to pick up my diploma.

410
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,686
You're not going to graduation?

411
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:14,643
No.

412
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:15,682
Look, you're not the only one...

413
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,327
in a fucked up place, OK?

414
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,841
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe...

415
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:21,962
it'd be good for you
to be somewhere...

416
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,002
where other people
feel the same way.

417
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:23,963
At graduation?

418
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,685
No. Thanks. I've had
enough funerals.

419
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,961
Then do it for J and Carrie.

420
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,765
Do what? If you die and
then there's nothing...

421
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:31,088
then they're just dead
and they don't know.

422
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,361
And if they are up in heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi...

423
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:33,562
do you think
they really care about...

424
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:34,682
our high-school graduation? No.

425
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:37,167
I am alive and I don't care.

426
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,362
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot...

427
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,643
I am so out of McKinley.

428
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,046
Without J, what's here for me?

429
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:45,324
I'm here. OK?
I made a promise to J...

430
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:47,250
that I would take care of you.

431
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:49,966
On the ride. For 3 minutes.

432
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:52,049
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

433
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:53,970
Kevin...

434
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:55,651
if it wasn't for
you and j being friends...

435
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:57,285
and me and Carrie
being friends...

436
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,847
we wouldn't have
even hung out.

437
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,533
We don't even like each other.

438
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,128
"Lan McKinley."

439
00:23:15,173 --> 00:23:17,562
How pathetic
is it that my last name...

440
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,171
is the same
as my high school?

441
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:21,932
Julie, look who I got
to sign my yearbook.

442
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,487
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

443
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:34,050
I think we should invite her.

444
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:35,526
- You think?
- Yeah.

445
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,245
Wen? Um...

446
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:43,727
So we're ready for
graduation tonight...

447
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:46,082
we're going to the tanning
salon after this...

448
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,442
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

449
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,528
Totally.

450
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:51,564
And just like, talk if you want.

451
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:55,003
Here's my cell.

452
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,169
I already have your number.

453
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,324
That was so nice of us.

454
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:12,252
You're not alone.

455
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:14,011
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

456
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,281
OK? I really do.

457
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,925
No, it's happened before.

458
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:19,851
OK? I went online looking
for an explanation about...

459
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:22,043
Wendy, just... just
listen to me, all right?

460
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,890
All right, look, I went online...

461
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:24,922
Iooking for an explanation...

462
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:26,406
about what happened,
and I found out...

463
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:27,806
about this high-school
French class...

464
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:28,808
from New York.

465
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:31,731
6 years ago they went
on a trip to Paris.

466
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:34,162
When they were boarding,
a kid had a vision...

467
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:35,407
that the plane
was gonna explode.

468
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:38,411
Just like you did.

469
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:39,966
He freaked out...

470
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:42,243
and 7 people got off the plane.

471
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:45,967
Just like us.

472
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:51,522
And on takeoff,
Flight 180 blew up.

473
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,723
And over the next
several months...

474
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:55,286
everyone who got off
that plane...

475
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,801
started dying
in weird accidents.

476
00:24:57,853 --> 00:24:59,491
They died in the order
they would've...

477
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,171
if they'd have stayed
on the plane.

478
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:04,444
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

479
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:07,007
Fuck you, Kevin.

480
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:09,851
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

481
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:35,532
Ohh, every time we come here.

482
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:36,847
I was thinking of going...

483
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:38,724
for 20 minutes in the Müller.

484
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,047
We did that for
all the funerals...

485
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:41,321
and it turned out amazing.

486
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,692
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

487
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,246
I mean, we're still
pretty bronzed.

488
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,124
I was just thinking we could
go for, like, a tune-up.

489
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:48,448
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

490
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:49,642
Yeah.

491
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:51,649
You know, for all those kids
that died that night...

492
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,570
who will never get a graduation.

493
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:56,726
You know what?
You're totally right.

494
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:58,968
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

495
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,086
This is my...
my good guy luck bracelet...

496
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,010
that Grandma left me
in her will.

497
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,242
Ohh!

498
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,249
Julie?

499
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,765
I need...

500
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:38,685
I could use some help.

501
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:44,206
I have such...
Such guilt over Jason.

502
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:47,051
I should never have
let that ride go.

503
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:50,369
God. I'm usually
such a control freak...

504
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:51,892
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.

505
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,412
I should've done
everything I could...

506
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:55,444
to stop it.

507
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,006
And I would give anything...

508
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:01,089
to have a second chance.

509
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:05,286
But I never can.

510
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:10,842
I don't want to someday...

511
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:12,485
feel that way about you, Julie.

512
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,172
I mean, I can't talk
to Mom and Dad.

513
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,445
You're all I have left.

514
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:22,767
You think when I find a place...

515
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,963
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?

516
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,129
You know I will.

517
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,651
You...

518
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,972
keep this now...

519
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:38,481
and I'll get it
when I come see you.

520
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:43,284
Oh. And... hey,
how 'bout on your end?

521
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,405
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

522
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:49,126
Yeah. As long as you bring it
back to school on Monday.

523
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:50,572
Done.

524
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,648
Oh. Um...

525
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:54,092
actually, the battery
is pretty low...

526
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:57,284
so why don't you go get ready
and I'll recharge it a bit.

527
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,846
Cool.

528
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:14,442
In a hurry, Yuri.

529
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,404
Sorry, sorry. Cellphone
signal is shit in here.

530
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:18,364
I think tanning beds
mess with signal.

531
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,812
I must go outside.

532
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:22,526
Why don't you just
use that phone?

533
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:24,052
I would, but
she talks forever...

534
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,367
then my boss
gives me shit.

535
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,406
Shit. That's her.

536
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,330
Ohh!

537
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:31,442
You know what?
Just go outside.

538
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,642
We can deal with this ourselves.

539
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,251
OK.

540
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:39,927
Hey. No drinks in
the room this time, OK?

541
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:40,962
Good.

542
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:53,642
What are you doing?

543
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:56,082
Nobody is walking in here
and seein' me naked.

544
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:31,046
Oh, my God.

545
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:43,682
Dude, he said no drinks.
If you spill that shit...

546
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:45,405
we're gonna have to
clean it up like last time.

547
00:30:45,453 --> 00:30:47,523
Mmm!

548
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:49,928
Happy, biyatch?
Nothing to spill.

549
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:54,367
Why does Yuri keep it
so cold in here?

550
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:55,687
Maybe it's supposed
to be colder...

551
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:56,802
for the machines or whatever.

552
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:58,923
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

553
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,044
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

554
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,970
Sucks, bitch.

555
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:29,083
They got CDs.

556
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:34,249
Ew. Céline?

557
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,692
Britney?

558
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:36,848
Dude, are we like
the only cool people...

559
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:37,882
that come here or what?

560
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:40,686
Uh, yeah.

561
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,293
Ugh. Whatever.

562
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:59,970
Why are you
wearing underwear?

563
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:02,083
Steinmetz says he gets
off on tan lines.

564
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,522
All right.

565
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:48,046
* Roller coaster *

566
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,412

00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:50,772

00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:43,804
* I'm gonna ride, girl *

583
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:45,332
* Yeah *

584
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:48,366
* Wow, yeah *

585
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:49,448
* Huh huh *

586
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:52,008
* Ow *

587
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:53,771
* Oh, oh *

588
00:33:58,093 --> 00:33:59,845
Whoo.

589
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:02,805
* Roller coaster of love *

590
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:03,922
* Love roller coaster, girl *

591
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:05,645
* Roller coaster *

592
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:08,526
* Lovin' you is
a freak-out world, child *

593
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,326
* Roller coaster of love *

594
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:20,570
Camera charged?

595
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:23,411
Oh, um, sorry,
the battery's totally dead.

596
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:25,205
Camera's not working. Sorry.

597
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:31,485
Look, Julie,
I need a minute, OK?

598
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,444
Like private.

599
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,566
* That feels nice,
roller coaster *

600
00:34:40,613 --> 00:34:42,763

00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:46,044

* Roller coaster *

603
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:54,243
* Roller coaster of love *

604
00:34:56,773 --> 00:34:58,650
Ugh.

605
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:01,082
It's way too warm
in here now, huh?

606
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,966
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

607
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:10,446
Huh?

608
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,732
Ow! Aah!

609
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:28,442
Hello?

610
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,482
Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...

611
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:31,364
Psych!
Leave a message.

612
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:34,002
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

613
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:35,008
Gimme a call whenever
you guys are done...

614
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:35,963
Aah!

615
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:37,844
And thanks again for the invite.

616
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:39,849
- Someone help!
- Aah!

617
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,604
Sorry I was too late.

618
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,049
Aah!

619
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:52,651
Aah! Aah!

620
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:55,048
Aah! Aah! Aah!

621
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:04,085
Aah! Aah!

622
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,930
Oh! Oh!

623
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:07,326
Oh! Aah!

624
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:09,369
Aaah! Aaah!

625
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:14,362
Hey, open the door!

626
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:24,963
Help me!

627
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,721
Aah!

628
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:35,803
- Aah!
- Aah!

629
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:40,373
We may feel that
our lives are not our own.

630
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:44,525
We may feel that
our lives are not our own.

631
00:36:44,573 --> 00:36:48,407
That death controls,
frames our lives.

632
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:51,729
Our births nothing
but death begun.

633
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,968
Yet, whether it is
with this tragic loss...

634
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:56,129
of young lives...

635
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,483
which we have
suffered much of late...

636
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:04,209
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

637
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:08,644
we are all equal
in death's eyes.

638
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,253
"Equal in death's eyes?"

639
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:13,124
All of us?
How can you say that?

640
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,401
Shut up, McKinley.

641
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:16,921
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

642
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:18,964
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

643
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:20,924
Pimps, vice presidents
walking around.

644
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:22,326
Let's just go. Come on.

645
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,284
All the atrocities
they've committed...

646
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:25,482
they're alive and well.

647
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:29,321
These two girls, who've never
done shit to anybody...

648
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,328
Shh!

649
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,567
They don't get to make it to 18?

650
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:33,126
Where's the fucking
equality in that?

651
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:35,402
- What?
- Come on, man.

652
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,011
I can... Yeah. Fine.

653
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:38,645
Fine. All right.
All right.

654
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:40,684
I'm fine. All right.

655
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,052
That's crazy.

656
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:46,605
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

657
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:49,645
please step forward
at this time.

658
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:59,005
I so feel this is so my fault.

659
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:01,408
How could it possibly
be your fault?

660
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:04,445
Seein' women as
nothin' but fun bags.

661
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:08,327
I mean...
If I'd've seen their...

662
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:11,012
whatever... humanity...

663
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:14,011
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

664
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:18,205
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorise.

665
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:21,450
Stretch. Tan.

666
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:23,812
Don't be down, Frankie.

667
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:25,605
Be proud of your ability
to make everything...

668
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,928
that happens somehow
a story about you.

669
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:33,802
God!

670
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:46,247
Yo, man. These things
really suck, man.

671
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:48,284
Fucking boring.

672
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,006
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

673
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,771
man, bring me
a PSP or somethin'.

674
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,451
'Least I have
somethin' to do then.

675
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:03,482
Hello?

676
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,171
I'm with J.

677
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:33,233
What are you doing up
here in the nosebleeds?

678
00:39:34,754 --> 00:39:36,585
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

679
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:39,785
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

680
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:43,792
And I wondered if maybe
here I could feel J's...

681
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:47,583
spirit or presence or...

682
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:49,511
whatever.

683
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,193
But now that I'm here...

684
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:53,713
if there's any place
that makes me feel...

685
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:55,710
like there's
no life after death...

686
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:59,145
it's a cemetery.

687
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:03,952
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

688
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:06,586
And I've tried.

689
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:09,346
Real hard. Heh.

690
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,906
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

691
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:20,867
That night... before
I got on the ride...

692
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:22,711
Jason said...

693
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,187
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride...

694
00:40:24,234 --> 00:40:25,986
he said...

695
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:30,471
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."

696
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:33,028
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

697
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:36,828
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination...

698
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:41,346
but this fear is more
than just being scared.

699
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:43,828
It's like a presence.

700
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,549
Like a living thing
always with me.

701
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:50,666
You think it's J?

702
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,113
No, I know it's not.

703
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:56,750
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

704
00:40:56,794 --> 00:41:00,992
It's cold and terrifying.

705
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:37,800
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

706
00:41:37,852 --> 00:41:39,251
The photographic plate
was broken...

707
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,567
causing a line
that can't be removed.

708
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:43,364
Exactly where he was shot.

709
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:47,250
Look.
See the shadow?

710
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:51,326
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

711
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:54,364
Look. This occurred
one year to the day...

712
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,607
of the Flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.

713
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:58,563
Look, I guess you came
to me with this...

714
00:41:58,612 --> 00:42:00,887
because I'm responsible for
putting this in your head...

715
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,047
with the Flight 180 thing.

716
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:04,003
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here...

717
00:42:04,052 --> 00:42:05,770
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there...

718
00:42:05,812 --> 00:42:06,881
because you're desperate
for an answer.

719
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:08,809
I took these.

720
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:10,649
That night.

721
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:19,046
These?

722
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:23,681
Are these it?

723
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:30,926
Oh, shit.

724
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:34,602
Oh, shit.

725
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:41,248
Whoa, whoa, hey.
You all right?

726
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,805
I'm feeling a little woozy.

727
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:46,283
When was
the last time you ate?

728
00:42:47,372 --> 00:42:48,964
I don't remember.

729
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:50,761
All right,
come on. I'll drive.

730
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,519
OK, those kids on
Flight 180 died in accidents...

731
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,525
in the order
they would've died...

732
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,639
if they'd have
stayed on the plane.

733
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,284
OK? So if this is that, then...

734
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,446
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

735
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,805
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture...

736
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,886
I felt this instinct.

737
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,648
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even...

738
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,999
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

739
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,199
Well, what's Frankie's
picture look like?

740
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,239
It's right here.

741
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,599
- You got it?
- Yeah.

742
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,843
- Wait! Watch out!
- Oh!

743
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,846
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

744
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,801
Sorry!

745
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,968
All right,
let's just eat over there.

746
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,999
And go through
the drive-thru.

747
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,369
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

748
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,128
Well, it's nice to see that
things haven't made you...

749
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,364
any less of a control freak.

750
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,043
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

751
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,079
Here's Frank's picture.

752
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,563
All right.

753
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,919
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

754
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,723
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

755
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,163
Look, or maybe
it's not that literal.

756
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,199
All right, what's...

757
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,478
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

758
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,599
Oh, what, like
he's gonna get crushed...

759
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,083
by a giant SpongeBob?

760
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,320
Hey, SpongeBob
lives underwater.

761
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,159
It's so sad that
you know that.

762
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,519
All right. He won that
tacky Mudflap Girl chain...

763
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,798
on this game, though, so...

764
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,761
Aren't those usually
on those big 18-wheelers?

765
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,845
Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,642
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere, though.

767
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,720
All right! God.

768
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,078
All right.

769
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,845
Uh, can I take
your order?

770
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,642
Yeah. What do you want?

771
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,758
Wen, you OK?

772
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,078
Please tell me there's
a short in your wiring.

773
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,283
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

774
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,321
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

775
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,849
Hey!

776
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,482
* There is someone *

777
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,009
Stop! Stop!

778
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,005
* Walking behind you *

779
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,483
Watch out! Shit!

780
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,605
- What the fuck?
- * Turn around *

781
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,686
- Oh, my God!
- * Look at me *

782
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,686
Get out! Get out!
What? What?

783
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,322
Behind us!

784
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,769
There's no one in that truck!

785
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,368
* Watching your footsteps *

786
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,482
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

787
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,999
- * Look at me *
- Unh! Shit!

788
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,880
- * There is someone *
- Back up!

789
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:28,919
Back up!

790
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,807
* Who really loves you *

791
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,320
* Here's my heart *

792
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,519
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

793
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,640
* In my hand *

794
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,887
* Turn around *

795
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,682
- * Look at me *
- Come on. Let's go!

796
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,845
Come on, come on, come on.

797
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,759
Unh!

798
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,169
- Oh!
- Unh!

799
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,280
We're all done here.
You need a ride?

800
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,560
Um, we can walk
to my house...

801
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:46,285
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

802
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,365
No, thanks, we'll be OK.

803
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,245
Will we?

804
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,964
Yeah. We'll be all right.

805
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,524
I mean...

806
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,288
how Frank...

807
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,922
God, it... it's
not only horrible...

808
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,528
but can you feel...

809
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,367
can you feel
how vicious it was?

810
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,729
Easy.

811
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,601
OK? Easy.

812
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,848
Let's just...

813
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,608
let's just take a step back.

814
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,041
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

815
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,126
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

816
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,730
Nothing in that picture
pointed to this.

817
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,408
We were wrong about the photos.

818
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,724
I should've left town.

819
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,169
It's better not knowing.

820
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,088
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

821
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,041
Wilful ignorance is
surrendering control.

822
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,728
What, did you read
that somewhere...

823
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,681
in Mrs Brooks'
English class?

824
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,241
No. L... You know, I'm not...

825
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,804
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

826
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,170
OK, that's
Lewis after Frank...

827
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,126
then lan and Erin.

828
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,398
There's a couple of
kids behind them...

829
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,168
but I can't make them out
because this guy's arm's in the way.

830
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,279
Can you?

831
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,319
No.

832
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,883
All right,
you know what?

833
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,364
We'll ask Lewis, lan,
and Erin if they remember.

834
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,002
OK?

835
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,405
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

836
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,720
I guess...

837
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,408
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us...

838
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:19,485
for the rest of our lives.

839
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,122
Yeah.

840
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,999
You know, I was gonna...

841
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,768
I was gonna ask her
to marry me.

842
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,320
Right after graduation.

843
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,928
Heh.

844
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:44,920
Oh.

845
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,647
No, wait.

846
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,043
Look, behind Stacy.

847
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,164
That's Frank.

848
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,808
This picture shows
how he died.

849
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,049
All right, go back to Lewis.

850
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,209
OK, he's got
that hammer.

851
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,969
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

852
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,762
on his head.

853
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,765
No, no, no, but check this out.

854
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,209
Right now Lewis
is down at State...

855
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,729
for football training camp.

856
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,000
State's team is
called the Sultans.

857
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,688
That's it. That's the clue.

858
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,563
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

859
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:29,645
Wouldn't you want to know?

860
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,438
Wait, there's pictures
of us in there?

861
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,208
Yeah.

862
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,365
Yeah, of course.

863
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,241
Huh. No.

864
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,043
No. I don't want
to see mine. No. Huh.

865
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,239
What about wilful ignorance?

866
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,884
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?

867
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,522
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

868
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,764
before it happened, Wendy.

869
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,966
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

870
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,843
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

871
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,118
I gotta stay focused...

872
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,001
and if I look at that picture
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

873
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,484
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

874
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,560
I mean, unless we have to.

875
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,248
You mean until we have to.

876
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,442
One more thing.

877
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,367
Is it bad?

878
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,527
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

879
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,959
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

880
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,523
I'll see you tomorrow.

881
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,802
You on crack. Both of you.

882
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:29,839
Just listen, OK?

883
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,005
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

884
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,688
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

885
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,163
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

886
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,723
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

887
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,759
And there were
2 people in front of us.

888
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,687
- Do you remember who they were?
- Fuck no, and I don't care.

889
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,799
And you shouldn't
care either, man...

890
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:40,839
'cause what you're
tellin' me right now...

891
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,243
is straight bullshit.

892
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,325
Just listen, Lewis.

893
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,486
Kevin,
it's like those stories...

894
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,239
like this guy was killed by
a car he sold 10 years ago.

895
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,087
2 sisters, right,
were killed when they were...

896
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,449
driving to visit each other.

897
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,526
You know, shit like that, man.

898
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,923
Fuck the Bruins!

899
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,120
- Oh, yeah!
- Fuck the Bruins!

900
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,842
Bruin faggots!

901
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,528
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

902
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,888
Man, you're reading
into this shit...

903
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,488
like them damn urban legends.

904
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,407
3 people have died, Lewis.

905
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:10,769
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

906
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,687
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

907
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,448
you're in serious denial.

908
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,969
Unh! What about you two, huh?

909
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,125
What?

910
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:18,649
You both lost people
real close to you...

911
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,203
in a fucked-up way.

912
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,081
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

913
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,802
seeing signs
and patterns, man.

914
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,562
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

915
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,840
Unh! It's wrong.

916
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,968
That's denial.

917
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,602
Unh!

918
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,766
- Unh!
- You got it!

919
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:40,199
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

920
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,968
- Wendy saw it.
- Man, she got a hunch.

921
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,966
Fuckin' intense,
but she got a hunch.

922
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,284
Man, I'm here because
I get good hunches...

923
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:46,319
before every down.

924
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,281
No, you know they're
either gonna run or pass.

925
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,843
Hers came to her
from nowhere.

926
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,562
You're here and alive
because of her.

927
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,168
No, I'm alive because of me.

928
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,723
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

929
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,919
Does that
make sense to you?

930
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,642
There's nothing to get,
Kevin! It's bullshit.

931
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,328
No, just...
hear me out, all right?

932
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,809
* Yeah *

933
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,679
Talk about a vision.

934
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,766
Man, I seen
my whole life played out...

935
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,960
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now. Unh!

936
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,159
It's going just as I saw it.

937
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:16,247
35 high-school games
without an injury.

938
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,564
USA Today All-American.

939
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,599
Second team.

940
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,003
Free ride to play
for the Sultans!

941
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,165
The Bruins passed on you.

942
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,199
Man, fuck the Bruins!

943
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,444
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

944
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,446
What the fuck
is a Bruin anyway?

945
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,003
Aah!

946
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:30,843
4 years from now...

947
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,358
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

948
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,086
He's gonna romp and stomp.

949
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,884
15 seasons, with 4 Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

950
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:43,046
Lewis ain't afraid of
no death. Fuck death!

951
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,365
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

952
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,048
Death wear blue and orange.

953
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,081
Real men wear black.

954
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,129
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.

955
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,161
Death is afraid of me!

956
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,609
Death fears me!

957
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,969
Kevin.

958
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,841
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

959
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,599
That's all I know how to do!
I just win! Unh!

960
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:02,878
Fuck death!

961
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,807
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

962
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,647
Aah!

963
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,009
- Look out!
- Lewis!

964
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,478
Man, that was close, Lewis.

965
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,486
Hey, did you see that?

966
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,804
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

967
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,647
Fuck death! I just win!

968
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,089
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

969
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,165
Baby, I just win!

970
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,323
Aaaaah!

971
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,644
- Ooooh!
- God!

972
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,285
Did I do something...

973
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,008
to bring this on everybody?

974
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,041
Don't, Wendy.

975
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,968
But why me?

976
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:46,999
All those people out there...

977
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,199
wanting to have
a premonition...

978
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,923
or see a ghost or
whatever and I don't.

979
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,524
I just want it to stop.

980
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,322
Just stop.

981
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,089
I don't know why, Wendy...

982
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,439
but you didn't do anything.

983
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,879
All right? This is just...

984
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,841
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

985
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,609
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

986
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,641
to make you feel OK, but...

987
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,288
You know, I can't.

988
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,929
Yeah.

989
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,403
There's nothing I can do.

990
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,009
Can you drive?

991
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,838
Yeah.

992
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,922
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

993
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,244
My, uh...

994
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,928
My head's not, like,
through the windshield...

995
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,039
or anything?

996
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,320
You know, crushed by
a steering wheel?

997
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,122
Impaled by a gear shift?

998
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:52,484
Right?

999
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,402
Zip, it's Pip.

1000
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,599
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

1001
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,163
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

1002
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,484
Osama Bin Supervisor...

1003
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,441
wants me to get rid
of these pigeons first.

1004
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,003
They keep settin' off the alarms.

1005
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,521
Hello, babies.

1006
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,845
Ha ha ha!

1007
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,607
Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.

1008
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:50,287
Hey. After I, uh,
restock this stuff...

1009
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,241
that these pinhead
customers can't manage...

1010
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,121
to return to the shelves
themselves...

1011
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:55,569
we can blow
out of here, OK?

1012
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,282
Righty-o, babe.

1013
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,404
Aah!

1014
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,122
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

1015
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,762
Shit!

1016
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,562
You scared
the shit out of me!

1017
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,805
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

1018
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,728
Zip, it's Pip.
Come over here.

1019
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,364
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

1020
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,482
Well, paint me intrigued,
Pip, I'm on my way.

1021
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,724
So let me get this straight.

1022
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,840
I'm gonna OD on nail polish...

1023
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,563
and lan is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

1024
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,328
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

1025
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,359
What's happened to the others?

1026
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,128
I mean, you just saw
their pictures.

1027
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,599
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

1028
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,767
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

1029
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,641
Ha ha!

1030
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,884
We need to know who
was sitting behind you...

1031
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,204
on the roller coaster.

1032
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,560
OK, who was sitting behind
us on the roller coaster?

1033
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,363
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

1034
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:07,083
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

1035
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,358
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

1036
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:09,729
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

1037
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,488
I didn't see his face,
but, um...

1038
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,646
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

1039
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,921
before the ride started,
if that's helpful in any way.

1040
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,767
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

1041
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,209
This is our lives, OK?

1042
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,445
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

1043
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,162
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

1044
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,438
OK, wait, are you guys saying...

1045
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:26,843
that death is, like, a person?

1046
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,529
No. It's like... like a force.

1047
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,245
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

1048
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,565
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

1049
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:39,000
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

1050
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,563
But there is
awareness, McKinley.

1051
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,805
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

1052
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,080
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

1053
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,848
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

1054
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,923
Ha ha!

1055
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,485
- Top shelf.
- OK.

1056
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,804
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

1057
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,843
Lan, watch those boxes!

1058
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,523
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

1059
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,242
No, I said watch the boxes.

1060
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,848
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

1061
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:22,688
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

1062
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:26,439
You haven't seen or been
through what we have... yet.

1063
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,003
Oh. Yet.

1064
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,324
OK, so who's next...

1065
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,122
in this theory you have,
me or lan?

1066
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,159
Well, we know the order...

1067
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,359
of how we were sitting
on the roller coaster...

1068
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,719
but not how it works with
people who sat together.

1069
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,603
OK, we don't know if Ashley
or Ashlyn died first.

1070
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,118
Hmm. Death is
fucking complicated.

1071
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,444
Ha ha!

1072
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,526
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

1073
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,959
It's simple. People die.

1074
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:48,409
That's just part of life.

1075
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,089
150,000 people
a day, actually.

1076
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,007
You know? I mean...

1077
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,927
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

1078
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:55,880
Top shelf.

1079
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,158
- The end of
biological function.

1080
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,165
It's as simple as that.

1081
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,165
How can you explain what
happened to us as simple?

1082
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,802
I mean, if Wendy never
had that premonition...

1083
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,078
and none of us
had gotten off that ride...

1084
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,358
we'd all be dead right now.

1085
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,559
Does that not
make sense to you?

1086
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,645
Oh, yeah.

1087
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:17,399
Kevin, how come when a guy
dies of a plain heart attack...

1088
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:18,963
no one goes, like...

1089
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:22,047
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

1090
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,762
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

1091
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,882
"and then he saw her funeral
on TV, and now he's dead"?

1092
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,363
You know why? Because
they'd sound crazy...

1093
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:31,766
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

1094
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,649
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting...

1095
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:34,884
those orders so
we can get out of here.

1096
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,363
OK!

1097
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:23,403
Unh!

1098
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,719
Heh heh!

1099
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,325
Ugh!

1100
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,769
Sick.

1101
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,647
Let's go with what
you guys are saying.

1102
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:19,918
Let's just say, you know...

1103
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:22,245
that death does have
a conscious plan...

1104
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:24,565
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

1105
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,521
So, Newton's
third law of motion...

1106
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:27,559
and, well, look...

1107
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,328
I'm just guessing that
it goes for death too...

1108
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,247
when he's working
in our world.

1109
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,246
Newton says
that every action...

1110
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,326
has an equal
and opposite reaction.

1111
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,088
So, that means that...

1112
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:41,804
if death has taken action,
so can we.

1113
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,761
And that that action
we take might have...

1114
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,449
an opposite reaction that
thwarts death's intent.

1115
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,048
You're being a fucker,
but go on.

1116
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,809
OK. OK.

1117
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:54,001
What if, for example...

1118
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,563
the last in line...

1119
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,679
were to make
the utilitarian choice...

1120
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,085
kill themselves.

1121
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,638
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

1122
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,124
that death's put in motion.
And even better...

1123
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,924
hey, it's gonna save
5 skipped lives.

1124
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,283
Any takers?

1125
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,681
Nah, I didn't think so.

1126
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,689
There! Those!

1127
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,722
Ugh!

1128
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,044
Aah!

1129
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,129
Ooh!

1130
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,165
Aah!

1131
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,998
Unh! Unh!

1132
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,288
Unh!

1133
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:13,087
Aah!

1134
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,007
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

1135
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,529
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

1136
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,481
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

1137
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:37,724
What'd you tell 'em?

1138
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,000
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

1139
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,961
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

1140
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:42,920
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

1141
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:45,325
and why we went to see
lan and Erin and...

1142
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,644
Did they believe you?

1143
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,646
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

1144
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,158
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

1145
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,440
10 hours they
had us in there.

1146
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:54,605
For all we know...

1147
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:56,641
whoever was sitting behind
Erin is already dead.

1148
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:58,362
And we're next.

1149
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:59,729
Now.

1150
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:06,369
Lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

1151
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,763
So it skipped lan.
That's...

1152
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,687
that's how we regain control.

1153
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:10,719
If someone intercedes...

1154
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,681
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

1155
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,719
All right, wait, wait, wait.

1156
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,443
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

1157
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,601
well, I'm next...

1158
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:20,878
and then you.

1159
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:24,160
We can beat this.

1160
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,644
We're so close.
We can't give up.

1161
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,203
All right, my dad's here.

1162
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,808
He's gonna give me a ride back.

1163
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:33,683
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

1164
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:35,641
It's just for a couple of hours.

1165
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:36,566
All right? A couple of hours.

1166
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,759
Go back, look at the pictures...

1167
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,243
see if you can find
any more clues...

1168
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,359
and I'll ask everybody I see...

1169
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,561
if they know if anyone else
got off the ride.

1170
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,123
OK?

1171
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,566
Was there something
I should know about going?

1172
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,321
No, it's just...

1173
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,759
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

1174
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,721
hoping you're OK.

1175
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,647
Why?

1176
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,766
I mean, we don't even
like each other.

1177
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,324
Heh.

1178
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,769
Come here.

1179
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,758
OK?

1180
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,402
All right, I got my cell.

1181
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,769
OK.

1182
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:35,199
Hey, Wen?

1183
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,081
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

1184
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:41,123
and I could really use
my good luck... bracelet.

1185
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,199
Mmm.

1186
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:10,519
Huh.

1187
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:43,239
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

1188
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,087
Call me on my cell
right away.

1189
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:51,558
Hello?

1190
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,441
Do you remember Julie being
on the roller coaster?

1191
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,208
What, your sister? No.

1192
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,569
No, she would've said
something by now.

1193
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,043
The person sitting
behind lan and Erin...

1194
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,603
was wearing the exact
same charm bracelet...

1195
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,402
our grandmother gave her.

1196
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,168
Amber or Perry were
probably with her...

1197
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,007
so... they're next.

1198
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,039
I gotta find Julie.

1199
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,364
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

1200
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:09,446
Well, l... I'm here now,
working security.

1201
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,048
I'll start looking for her.

1202
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:12,921
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

1203
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:14,562
Look, after them,
we're next.

1204
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,601
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

1205
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,368
before we meet up...

1206
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,048
remember that time
we talked about?

1207
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,808
When to look
at our pictures?

1208
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,488
It's now.

1209
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:33,958
Great. Mine has no clue.

1210
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,047
It's just me standing in front
of a blank background...

1211
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,320
with Jason at
the amusement park.

1212
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,203
Wait. McKinley.

1213
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:45,242
Lan? Is he in the picture?

1214
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,726
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

1215
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:52,121
And yours is the picture
that I took...

1216
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,808
when I flashed
the camera in your face.

1217
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:57,729
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

1218
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,728
Like a firework
went off in my face?

1219
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:32,167
* There is someone *

1220
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:35,282
* Walking behind you *

1221
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:41,368
* Look at me *

1222
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,321
* There is someone *

1223
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:47,048
* Watching your footsteps *

1224
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,527
* Look at me *

1225
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:56,286
* There is someone *

1226
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,480
* Who really loves you *

1227
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:00,566
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

1228
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:04,563
Get 'em while they're hot!

1229
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:11,167
Take it to those redcoats!

1230
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,405
Column, advance!

1231
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,761
The kite is aloft.

1232
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,889
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

1233
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,367
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

1234
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:44,287
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

1235
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,441
This is awesome, dude!

1236
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:49,559
Heh heh.

1237
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,043
Whoa. Hey!

1238
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,409
Ha ha! Come on!

1239
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:53,360
Hey, get out of here
with those, man!

1240
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,399
You're gonna set these off!

1241
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:55,849
Hurry, dude.

1242
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:57,209
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

1243
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,089
Ladies and gentlemen...

1244
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,121
to celebrate
McKinley's tricentennial...

1245
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,889
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

1246
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,289
Oh, my God. Julie.

1247
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:12,240
- What?
- Look.

1248
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,121
There's Kahlil.

1249
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:15,569
Should we?

1250
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,328
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

1251
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:18,359
The viewing site is over there.

1252
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:19,445
You too, sir. Come on.

1253
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:21,208
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

1254
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,922
I don't fucking believe them.

1255
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,245
- OK, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

1256
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,083
Excuse me.

1257
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,643
- Ladies.
- Boys.

1258
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:59,645
What's going on?

1259
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:02,562
Hey, Julie.

1260
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,123
You 3 need to
come with me.

1261
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:04,966
What did we do?

1262
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,886
Look, it's for
your own safety, Julie.

1263
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,409
All right?
I'll tell you about it...

1264
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:08,246
as soon as we get away
from here OK?

1265
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,167
Let go of me!

1266
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:11,245
Julie.

1267
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:12,564
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1268
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:13,565
Julie!

1269
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:37,328
Ooh!

1270
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,199
Heh heh heh!

1271
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:43,964
- Sweet.
- Ha ha!

1272
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:48,558
Yeah!

1273
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:52,564
- Light it! Light it!
- Go, go, go, man!

1274
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:59,808
Julie!

1275
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:04,849
Uh! Oh!

1276
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,609
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

1277
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,718
- Aah!
- Unh!

1278
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,000
Unh! Hey!

1279
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:32,447
Julie! No, wait, wait.

1280
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,879
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

1281
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:37,524
Let me explain this to you.

1282
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,643
Julie, look out!

1283
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,688
- Aah!
- Unh!

1284
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,882
Aah!

1285
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,079
Julie!

1286
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,403
Unh!

1287
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,281
Aah! Unh!

1288
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:57,522
Cut him off!

1289
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,438
Unh!

1290
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,608
Aah!

1291
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,045
Aah!

1292
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,723
Aah!

1293
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,164
OK, OK!

1294
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,842
Stay back!
He's dangerous!

1295
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,199
I got him.

1296
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,286
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

1297
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:33,399
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

1298
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,519
Tell me who was
sitting next to you...

1299
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:35,685
on the roller coaster!

1300
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,561
Oh, my God, Julie,
are you all right?

1301
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,529
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

1302
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:42,288
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1303
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,605
Who? She's next!

1304
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,602
Aah!

1305
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,719
Kevin.

1306
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,448
Fire!

1307
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:18,526
Kevin.

1308
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:22,040
You saved my life.

1309
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,485
Thanks for that, McKinley.

1310
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,805
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

1311
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:32,249
We have to get
out of here now.

1312
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,086
What's the deal?

1313
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:35,928
Lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

1314
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,006
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad-night shirt.

1315
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,722
- He's the clue.
- What?

1316
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:41,681
There's a first-aid tent,
there should be security.

1317
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,647
Get the fuck
outta here, McKinley!

1318
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:49,569
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

1319
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:53,559
You followed me!

1320
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:55,407
Oh! You are paranoid.

1321
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,406
But, hey, I saw what happened.

1322
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:58,439
You're next, right?

1323
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,048
You're the end of it, aren't you?

1324
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,318
Man, I would be paranoid too.

1325
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:03,247
You didn't even believe me!

1326
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,202
Yeah, well,
seeing is believing.

1327
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,888
Then you have to
stay away from me!

1328
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:11,002
"Have to"? Wow, that's extreme.

1329
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,567
Oh, no way.

1330
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,809
Do I cause your death?

1331
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,241
Just like you caused Erin's?

1332
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,161
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what? What?

1333
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,929
You have a vision? Was I in it?

1334
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,801
Was I in a picture?

1335
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:36,240
Just tell me how to start it off!

1336
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,884
Let's get this over with!

1337
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:41,569
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

1338
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:42,838
Then it'll all be over!

1339
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:45,723
What do I care? It skipped me.

1340
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:48,603
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

1341
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,242
I'm not dying!

1342
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,360
Ha ha ha!

1343
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:03,968
You see?

1344
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,238
I'm not gonna die!

1345
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,804
It's you, Wendy!
You're dead!

1346
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:46,203
- * Will get ya deeper *
- Hi!

1347
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,239
* And make you right *

1348
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,279
Thank you.

1349
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:51,208
* Bruno's drops
threaten her... *

1350
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,478
Wait, what about
that great curry place?

1351
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:53,849
Don't we get off at Booth?

1352
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,209
Oh, you mean Gupta's.
You get off at Oswald.

1353
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,239
Oh, that's right.

1354
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,765
You know, if I can't be
home for Thanksgiving...

1355
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:03,449
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

1356
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,685
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

1357
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,129
If you don't have
turkey for one Thanksgiving...

1358
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:08,683
is that really gonna kill you?

1359
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:12,687
* There is someone *

1360
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:15,961
* Walking behind you *

1361
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:19,241
* Turn around *

1362
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:22,805
* Look at me *

1363
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:26,081
* There is someone *

1364
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:29,805
* Watching your footsteps *

1365
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,044
* Turn around *

1366
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:41,447
* There is someone *

1367
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,449
* Who really needs you *

1368
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:48,243
* Here's my heart *

1369
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,689
This is Booth Street.

1370
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:27,008
Next stop is Oswald.
End of the line.

1371
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,884
The next stop
is the end of the line.

1372
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,603
Wendy! Next stop after this.

1373
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:35,639
Let's just walk.

1374
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,759
It's freezing out.

1375
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:38,368
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

1376
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:41,208
I could use some air.

1377
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,962
Yeah!

1378
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,409
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah, man!

1379
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:48,439
All right, man. See ya.

1380
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:49,479
Let's go, Bruins!

1381
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:50,519
Bruins, yeah!

1382
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:07,249
Hey, man, peace out!

1383
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:08,723
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

1384
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:11,079
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

1385
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:13,041
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

1386
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,159
This is it!

1387
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:17,646
- Yo, comin' through.
- Excuse me.

1388
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:21,481
Oh, my God.

1389
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:26,045
I can't believe this. Here.

1390
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:30,568
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1391
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:33,170
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

1392
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:35,440
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

1393
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:37,287
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

1394
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:38,604
so instead of sitting
around for a few hours...

1395
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:40,481
I lucked out and
caught an early train.

1396
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,168
I hope I'm not
messing you up or...

1397
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,326
No, no, it's just, um...

1398
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:47,885
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

1399
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:54,319
I was just...

1400
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,282
I was feeling like
I did that night.

1401
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,127
No. No, it's over.

1402
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,968
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

1403
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:04,125
Lan was gonna
cause your death...

1404
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,001
you intervened
and it skipped us.

1405
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:14,970
Look, I'm not worried.

1406
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,808
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

1407
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,124
And, if I were you...

1408
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:21,286
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

1409
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,968
you've got nothing
to worry about.

1410
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:26,047
You're right.

1411
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:29,886
Hey, l... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

1412
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:30,999
Yeah.

1413
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:34,209
Hey, guys.
This is Julie, my...

1414
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,601
What are you
doing here?

1415
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,800
Wendy! Julie!

1416
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,647
What are the chances?

1417
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:52,964
How long have you
been on this train?

1418
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,523
Uh, since home.

1419
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,322
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

1420
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:57,849
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

1421
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,559
You OK?

1422
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:03,248
Is something wrong?

1423
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:24,918
Aah!

1424
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,119
Aah!

1425
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,560
- Julie, stay down!
- Aah!

1426
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,441
Julie!

1427
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:44,726
Aah!

1428
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,043
- Kevin!
- Unh!

1429
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,599
Aaaaaah!

1430
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:56,362
Oh, God!

1431
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:57,638
Aah!

1432
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:59,969
Aah!

1433
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:47,566
Aah! Unh!

1434
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:08,043
No!

1435
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,999
I was gonna look you up
afterwards, but...

1436
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:14,365
You OK?

1437
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,688
Is somethin' wrong?

1438
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:20,125
The train...

1439
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:22,889
Oh, shit. Not again.

1440
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:24,409
We gotta get out!

1441
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,487
It's not working.
Somebody stop the train!

1442
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:43,535
THE END
