1
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,605
Five, four, three...

2
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,400
...two, one.

3
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,901
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,603
Hey, Dad?

5
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,814
Dad!

6
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,296
You'll stay with Aunt May...

7
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,131
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

8
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,466
-I wanna go with you.
-No.

9
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,098
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

10
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,517
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

11
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,686
-Mary. Come on, come on.
-Oh, God.

12
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,400
Dad.

13
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,944
Be good.

14
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,546
Sorry.

15
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,548
Morning, Flash.

16
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,595
Good morning, Parker.

17
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,937
Hey. It's Peter, right?

18
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,315
I really like your photos.

19
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,983
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

20
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,235
Listen...

21
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,611
...are you busy Friday night?

22
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,245
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

23
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,413
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

24
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,665
...for his birthday.

25
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,793
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

26
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,420
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old....

27
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,214
-The old schedule.
-Okay.

28
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,633
Parker.

29
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,844
-Yes, sir?
-You want to keep that skateboard?

30
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,512
-Yeah.
-Keep it off the ground.

31
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,013
-Sure. Yeah.
-Wheels up.

32
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,306
Like that?

33
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,058
-That's it.
-Okay.

34
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,711
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

35
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,254
Eat it! Eat it!

36
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,965
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

37
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,551
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

38
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,178
Come on!

39
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,512
Hey, Parker, come on.

40
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,055
Get a picture of this.

41
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,392
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

42
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,519
-Come on.
-Gordon, don't eat it.

43
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,729
Take the picture.

44
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,355
Put him down, Flash.

45
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,107
Take the picture.

46
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,735
Put him down, Eugene!

47
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,114
Hey, man.

48
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,742
Come on!

49
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,451
Get up, Parker!

50
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:10,996
Get up!

51
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,789
Come on! Come on!

52
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,498
Get up!

53
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,794
Still not taking the picture.

54
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,630
Stay down, Parker!

55
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,757
Who wants one more?

56
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,383
-One more!
-Flash!

57
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,385
Flash...

58
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,429
...we still on for after school today?

59
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,722
My house, 3:30?

60
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,098
I hope you did homework.

61
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,642
Last time, I was...

62
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,560
...disappointed in you.

63
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,812
-Okay, move.
-No, how about we go to class?

64
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,064
How about it?

65
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,443
Whatever.

66
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,428
I thought that was great
what you did.

67
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,430
It was stupid...

68
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,182
...but it was great.

69
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,184
You should go to...

70
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,978
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

71
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,022
What's your name?

72
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,691
You don't know my name?

73
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,026
No, I know your name.

74
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,736
I want to know
if you know your name.

75
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
Peter.

76
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,285
-Parker. Peter Parker.
-Okay. Okay, good.

77
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,669
I'd still go to the nurse though.

78
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,087
You're Gwen, right?

79
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,338
Gwen Stacy.

80
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,340
All right.

81
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,385
Hey.

82
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm making...

83
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,221
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

84
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,183
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

85
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,936
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

86
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,272
-Oh, my God.
-What's up?

87
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,982
What happened to your face?

88
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm all right. Just-- I fell, skating.

89
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,153
It's all right.

90
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,989
Ben Parker, don't you even...

91
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,117
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

92
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,327
My bowling trophies.

93
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,037
Oh, well, then, by all means...

94
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,705
...leave that box in my kitchen.

95
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,332
-What happened to you?
-He fell.

96
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,499
Why you kids...

97
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,293
...ride those things, I'll never know.

98
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,045
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

99
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,838
Remember when we were stupid?

100
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,006
No.

101
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,300
-Trust me, we were.
-All right. Good to know.

102
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,384
Where's the flood?

103
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,053
Follow me. I'll show you.

104
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,304
-You serious?
-Yes.

105
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,097
All right.

106
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:36,933
It's the condenser tray.

107
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,812
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

108
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,898
This has got to be the fill line.

109
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,442
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

110
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,818
Can you fix it?

111
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,364
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

112
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,824
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

113
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,537
How's the other guy look?

114
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,250
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

115
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,212
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

116
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,797
No, no.

117
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,048
All right.

118
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,175
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

119
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,637
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

120
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,015
Before you come up, see if...

121
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,476
-...there's anything else worth saving.
-Okay.

122
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,745
-Plumbers don't fix appliances.
-Yes, they do.

123
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,497
They fix pipes and pump things.

124
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,374
If you ask them to--

125
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,464
I forgot all about that thing.

126
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,507
It was your dad's.

127
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,384
-Yeah.
-He asked us to keep it safe.

128
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,808
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

129
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,645
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

130
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,731
And guess who sold it to him.

131
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,566
-I don't know.
-Your mother.

132
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,692
That's how they met.

133
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,777
He asked you to...

134
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,905
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

135
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,823
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

136
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,992
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

137
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,661
Yeah, I know.

138
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,793
Who's that?

139
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,504
Do you know who that is?

140
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,005
Some guy who worked with...

141
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,173
...your dad, I guess.

142
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,096
Just take this off the table, all right?

143
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,308
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

144
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,352
-Now.
-All right.

145
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,394
Go on.

146
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,765
I need you to be a good boy.

147
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,058
Where are you going?

148
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,393
There's something...

149
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,436
...your mom and I have to do.

150
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,828
What is this?

151
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,958
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

152
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,379
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

153
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,181
Come in.

154
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,807
You okay?

155
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,310
-Yeah. What's up?
-Oh, my God.

156
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,645
You look just like him.

157
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,606
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

158
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,071
Listen...

159
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,697
...I don't have much education.

160
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,199
You know that, Peter.

161
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:06,036
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

162
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,789
What I'm trying to say is...

163
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,708
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

164
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,169
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

165
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,255
-Yeah, it's all right.
-No, it is not...

166
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,673
...all right.

167
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,343
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

168
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,596
Curt Connors.

169
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,141
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

170
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,644
They worked together for years
and they were close.

171
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,063
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

172
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,315
He never even called.

173
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,567
Not once.

174
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,696
Go figure.

175
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,284
She's pretty.

176
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,874
Uncle Ben.

177
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,166
What?

178
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,252
You're a pretty great dad.

179
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,726
Excuse me.

180
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,685
What?

181
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,437
Can I help you?

182
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,272
I don't know. I'm here to see...

183
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,899
-...Dr. Connors.
-Right.

184
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,817
You'll find yourself to the left.

185
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,404
You are here for the internship?

186
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,782
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,033
Okay.

188
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,952
You'll find your badge to the left.

189
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,834
Having trouble finding yourself?

190
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,502
No. Yeah, I got it.

191
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:21,964
Okay...

192
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,882
...Mr. Guevara.

193
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,263
Welcome to Oscorp.

194
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,266
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...

195
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,978
...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.

196
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:41,275
Our scientific minds are pushing
the boundaries of defence, biomedical...

197
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,111
...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.

198
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,696
Welcome to Oscorp.

199
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,155
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

200
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,198
...at Midtown Science...

201
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,783
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

202
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,994
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

203
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,954
Where I go, you go.

204
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,831
That's the rule. Remember that...

205
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,457
-...all will be fine.
-Come on!

206
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,001
-If you forget that--
-Listen!

207
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,085
Look, listen.

208
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,837
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

209
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,088
Just tell them...

210
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,298
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

211
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,632
My name's Rodrigo!

212
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,510
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

213
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,053
Shall we?

214
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,688
Come around this way.

215
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,194
Good afternoon, Gwen.

216
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,195
Dr. Connors.

217
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,238
Welcome.

218
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,200
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

219
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,619
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

220
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,037
I'm not a cripple...

221
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,540
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

222
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,460
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

223
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,086
Like the Parkinson's patient...

224
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,964
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

225
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,551
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

226
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:53,555
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

227
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,559
I want to create a world
without weakness.

228
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,562
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

229
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,064
Yes.

230
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,190
Stem cells?

231
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,942
Promising. But the solution...

232
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,778
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

233
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,615
-No one?
-Cross-species genetics.

234
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,208
Person gets Parkinson's...

235
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,752
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

236
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,921
...start to disappear.

237
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,756
But a zebra fish has the ability...

238
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,008
...to regenerate cells on command.

239
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,219
If you could give this ability...

240
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,138
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's....

241
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,516
She's curing herself.

242
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,561
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

243
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,315
And you are...?

244
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,486
He's one of Midtown Science's...

245
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,154
-...best and brightest.
-Really?

246
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,197
Second in his class.

247
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,284
-Second?
-Yeah.

248
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,285
Sure about that?

249
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,786
I'm pretty sure.

250
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,169
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

251
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,212
Nice meeting you all.

252
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,967
If you'd like to gather round.

253
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,011
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

254
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,598
Our planet's tree of life is immense.

255
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,433
At Oscorp's...

256
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,310
-...Cross-Species Division...
-Hi.

257
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,354
...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods....

258
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,982
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

259
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,403
Oh, yeah.

260
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,821
What are you doing here?

261
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,156
I work here. I don't.

262
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,908
I was gonna say I work here...

263
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,286
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

264
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,329
You following me?

265
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,624
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

266
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,000
Why would you be here?

267
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,002
I just snuck in because....

268
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,587
I love science.

269
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,547
-You love it.
-I'm passionate about it.

270
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,341
So you snuck in--?

271
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,676
-I have to lead this tour group.
-I know.

272
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,763
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

273
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,057
-I promise you I won't.
-Stay with the group.

274
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:04,186
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

275
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,483
Sorry. Yo.

276
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,985
Sorry.

277
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:39,132
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

278
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,969
They were disappointing.

279
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,017
Define "disappointing."

280
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,519
Another dead end.

281
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,229
It's the decay rate algorithm.

282
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:55,023
-And this is to be expected.
-Expected?

283
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,525
You said you were close.

284
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,861
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

285
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,237
He doesn't have time.

286
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,573
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

287
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,324
Save him.

288
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,537
Or we'll both lose our heads.

289
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,390
All right, give me the badge.

290
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:31,935
Give it to me.

291
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:36,982
Sorry.

292
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,254
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

293
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,131
I didn't mean to do that.

294
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,716
I didn't mean to....

295
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,510
I didn't-- I didn't--

296
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,137
Get your hand off her!

297
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,848
I'm trying to get my....

298
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,561
Are you kidding?

299
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,520
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,771
Are you kidding me?

301
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,065
-Hey, get him, Rudy!
-Hey!

302
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,653
Man, I'm sorry!

303
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:05,779
Man, are you all right?

304
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,242
-Take him down!
-Come on.

305
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,454
Get him, man! Get him!

306
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,625
No, man, no. Not my board.

307
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,960
Please, dude, don't--

308
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:22,963
Sorry!

309
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,051
Sorry. Sorry.

310
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,386
I'm so sorry.

311
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,018
Coney Island, next stop.

312
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,020
Next and final stop, Coney Island.

313
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:50,699
Hey.

314
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,327
Hey. Hey.

315
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,703
Sorry. I'm late.

316
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,538
-I got--
-We've been so worried.

317
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,831
I know. I'm sorry.

318
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,208
Watch out!

319
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,466
That's a fly, Peter.

320
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,180
Yeah.

321
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:19,770
I'm so sorry...

322
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,104
...I kept you guys up.

323
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,483
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

324
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,443
...and I'm hungry.

325
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,533
Meat loaf.

326
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,411
Drinking?

327
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,621
What's this?

328
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,164
I don't think so.

329
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,874
This is your meat loaf.

330
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,128
This beats all other meat loafs.

331
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,423
Something is very wrong.

332
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:50,217
Yeah.

333
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,302
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

334
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,977
I got it.

335
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,816
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

336
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,818
I noticed that.

337
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,613
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meat loaf?

338
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:14,199
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

339
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,910
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

340
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:08,832
Peter.

341
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:11,460
What are you doing?

342
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,003
I'm....

343
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,214
Homework.

344
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,924
Be careful.

345
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,550
Sure.

346
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,186
Dr. Connors.

347
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,814
You don't remember me. I--

348
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,107
The intern from the other day.

349
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,485
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

350
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,946
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

351
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,448
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

352
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,866
I'm Richard Parker's son.

353
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,333
Peter?

354
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:54,753
I'm afraid...

355
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,215
...I can't help you much. I don't
know why they left or where they...

356
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,007
...were going.

357
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,387
Good reflexes.

358
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:04,805
Thank you.

359
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,020
-Thank you.
-I read your book.

360
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,647
Yeah.

361
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:14,982
It's something, you know.

362
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,942
So you really think...

363
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,820
-...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
-Yes, of course.

364
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,447
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

365
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,367
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

366
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,536
They called us mad scientists.

367
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:31,164
And then your father
bred the spiders...

368
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,708
...and everything changed.

369
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,543
The results were
beyond encouraging.

370
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,545
They were spectacular.

371
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:41,800
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

372
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,802
Including my own.

373
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,888
Then it was over.

374
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,683
He was gone.

375
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,352
Took his research with him.

376
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:56,023
And I knew without him, I....

377
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:05,199
I....

378
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,952
I was angry.

379
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,332
So I stayed away from you...

380
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,417
...and your family.

381
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,377
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

382
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,387
Say....

383
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,264
Say it worked.

384
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,475
Say you got it to work.

385
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:35,938
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

386
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,982
What could the side effects be?

387
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:45,781
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

388
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,699
The problem was always--

389
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,159
The decay rate algorithm?

390
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,622
-Right.
-Right.

391
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,291
Can I...?

392
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,001
Of course.

393
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,859
Extraordinary.

394
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,319
How did you come up with this?

395
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,745
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

396
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,706
-...one day after school?
-Yeah.

397
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,668
Thank you.

398
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,440
Number one, Reggie.

399
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:02,524
Run it, buddy.

400
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,109
Let's go, Reggie.

401
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:08,280
Rejected!

402
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,784
You did that on purpose, Flash!

403
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,912
I should've.
You better watch your back.

404
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,542
Hey.

405
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,378
All right?

406
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:30,928
Give it up.

407
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,518
Come on, man.

408
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,437
One sec.

409
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:46,235
-Come on, man.
-Why don't you take it from me?

410
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,657
That's right. Take it.

411
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,450
Go ahead. Take it.

412
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,264
Just take it.

413
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,810
All right, how about this?

414
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:21,770
All right?

415
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:22,728
How about that?

416
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,235
-Come on, Flash.
-Flash, stop playing, man.

417
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,530
-Take it from him!
-Come on, Flash. Take it.

418
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:33,031
Yo, Flash, let's go.

419
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,699
-Let's go!
-Do it, Flash.

420
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,618
-Stop playing, man.
-Let's go, Flash.

421
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,328
-What are you doing?
-What's up?

422
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,873
What you doing?

423
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,003
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

424
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,310
Peter's behaviour is just...

425
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,269
...unacceptable.

426
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,312
They won't make us pay...

427
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:06,315
-...for the backboard.
-I don't care about the backboard.

428
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,192
-Was that true?
-What?

429
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,152
What I heard in there just now.

430
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:13,155
Did you humiliate that boy?

431
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,199
Yeah, I did.

432
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,492
-But--
-But what?

433
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,119
-This guy deserved it.
-Did he?

434
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,871
-Yeah.
-Is he the kid that hit you?

435
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,583
Is he?

436
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,585
Yeah, yeah, but....

437
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,712
So all this is about getting even.

438
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:32,841
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

439
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:33,884
Am I right or wrong?

440
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,471
Yeah, I thought so.

441
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,557
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

442
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,684
...I had to change shifts at work...

443
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:46,396
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

444
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:48,482
-Is that understood?
-Yeah.

445
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,234
Okay, good.

446
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,695
She looks familiar.

447
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,699
The girl on your computer.

448
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,660
Yeah.

449
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,663
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

450
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,082
Don't forget Aunt May.

451
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,587
Okay.

452
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:16,301
He's a character.

453
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:17,469
That's my uncle.

454
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,680
He's a pathological liar.

455
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,223
He thought you were someone else.

456
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,892
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

457
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:27,187
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

458
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,064
-Right.
-So...

459
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:31,441
...he must have seen--
I was touching up stuff.

460
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,777
-Touching up stuff?
-Come on.

461
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,613
I was.... I'm not gonna answer that.

462
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,326
-Did you get expelled?
-No, no.

463
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,579
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

464
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,835
So you want to-- I don't know...?

465
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:52,129
Want to what?

466
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,131
I don't know.

467
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,883
Just....

468
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,599
I don't know-- We could....

469
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:06,685
We could do something else,
or we could--

470
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,313
-If you don't feel like, we could--
-Yeah.

471
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,898
-Yeah?
-Yeah, either one.

472
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,443
-Really?
-Sure.

473
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:16,278
Okay.

474
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,779
All right, good. Sounds good.

475
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:18,780
Cool.

476
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,991
Okay.

477
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,452
-I can't right now, I can't right now.
-Yeah, no.

478
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,662
-I'm so busy right now.
-I know, me too.

479
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,959
But maybe....

480
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,295
-Yeah, just, you know....
-Some other....

481
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,130
-Time, all right.
-Okay.

482
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,840
-Bye.
-All right.

483
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,598
We have protein structure, rDNA...

484
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,850
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

485
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:13,145
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have....

486
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,231
-Human line testing over--
-I remember that.

487
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,066
I've seen that before.

488
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,526
The Ganali device.

489
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:22,404
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

490
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,073
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

491
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,743
It creates a cloud which can be
dispersed over a neighbourhood...

492
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:28,702
...even a city.

493
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:32,122
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

494
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:34,416
That's incredible.

495
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,836
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

496
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:40,005
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

497
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,467
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

498
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,054
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

499
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:50,432
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

500
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:53,101
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

501
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,103
You can imagine my envy.

502
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,189
We're trying to harness
this capability...

503
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,608
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

504
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,902
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

505
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:05,113
Enter the algorithm now.

506
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,284
Need to take that?

507
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,208
System ready...

508
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,960
...for gene insertion.

509
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,628
Okay.

510
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,547
Check.

511
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:24,758
See what I'm trying to do?

512
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,802
-Preempt the proteins.
-The immune response.

513
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:28,136
Beginning trials.

514
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,889

00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,599

521

Peptide algorithm accepted.

522
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,361
Regrowth complete.

523
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,904
-Hey.
-Vitals normal.

524
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:48,657
Blood pressure normal.

525
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,702
Limb regeneration successful.

526
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,662
Extraordinary.

527
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,710
And thank you.

528
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:01,753
Meet Fred and Wilma...

529
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,172
...our three-legged...

530
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,339
...mice.

531
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:08,468
Here you go.

532
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,972
Hey, buddy, I got you.

533
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:14,725
Okay.

534
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,977
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

535
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,896
Human trials aren't until next week.

536
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:22,691
There.

537
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:31,825
Hey.

538
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,494
Hey, I thought you....

539
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,455
Didn't you forget something?

540
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:38,498
What?

541
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,377
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

542
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,341
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

543
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,469
Be a man.

544
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:52,221
Get in there and apologise.

545
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,309
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I....

546
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,769
Honestly, you don't have...

547
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,521
...to apologise to me. It's your--

548
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,356
-The hell he doesn't.
-Ben.

549
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,234
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

550
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:07,319
-Oh, he got distracted.
-Yeah.

551
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:10,614
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

552
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:14,243
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

553
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:15,661
...because you got distracted.

554
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,496
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

555
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,706
...I am completely capable
of walking home--

556
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:21,917
You will not defend this boy!

557
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,377
-I'm not defending--
-You are!

558
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:26,046
-Listen to me, son.
-Yeah, go ahead.

559
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,756
You're a lot like your father.

560
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,425
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

561
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:33,720
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

562
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:37,224
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

563
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,852
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

564
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:41,603
That's what's at stake here.

565
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:42,771
Not choice.

566
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:44,815
Responsibility.

567
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:49,486
That is nice. That's great.

568
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,614
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

569
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,701
-What?
-Where is he?

570
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:57,953
Where's my dad?

571
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:01,623
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

572
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:03,125
Oh, come on, how dare you?

573
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,877
How dare I? How dare you?

574
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:10,632
Where you going?

575
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,467
Peter, come back here, please.

576
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:25,147
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

577
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,161
Peter!

578
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,373
Peter?

579
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,380
Peter!

580
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:56,428
It's $2.07.

581
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,058
It's $2.07.

582
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,559
Yeah. No, I know.

583
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,562
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

584
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:07,898
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

585
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:10,400
-What?
-You can leave...

586
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,195
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

587
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:15,280
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

588
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,866
-You're holding up my line.
-I don't have 2 cents.

589
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,701
You can't afford milk, step aside.

590
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:22,120
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

591
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:23,622
We're talking about 2 cents.

592
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:24,706
Just step aside, kid.

593
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:32,631
Really?

594
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,396
Yo, not cool, bro.

595
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,400
Hey, man, stop!

596
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,026
Somebody stop that guy!

597
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:54,570
Hey, kid, little help?

598
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:55,988
Not my policy.

599
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:57,614
Somebody stop that dude!

600
00:44:58,615 --> 00:44:59,408
Hey!

601
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:00,742
Hey, stop!

602
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,537
Somebody stop that dude!

603
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:13,088
Hey!

604
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,621
Oh, God, oh, God.

605
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,206
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

606
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,583
Call an ambulance!

607
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,044
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

608
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:54,338
Oh, God, oh, my God.

609
00:45:58,008 --> 00:45:59,718
Oh, God.

610
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,473
No.

611
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,602
Oh, Jesus.

612
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:16,485
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

613
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:22,699
No, I don't know him.

614
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:26,537
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

615
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:28,664
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

616
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,374
Okay.

617
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,464
Can I have that?

618
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:38,882
Sure.

619
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:43,303
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

620
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:44,221
...tattooed...

621
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:45,514
...on his left hand.

622
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,504
Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...

623
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,798
...and I'm sorry about that.

624
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,593
I think I know what you're feeling.

625
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,402
Hey, Parker.

626
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,530
-Not today.
-Come on, I just want to talk.

627
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,621
It feels better, right?

628
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:53,123
Look, your uncle died.

629
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,375
I'm sorry.

630
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:56,877
I get it.

631
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:58,837
I'm sorry.

632
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,797
Okay?

633
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:08,347
Peter.

634
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,141
Stay away from him.

635
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,309
-You understand?
-Hey!

636
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:55,769
-Stay away from Joey.
-Hey!

637
00:48:58,021 --> 00:48:59,314
You like beating on girls?

638
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:01,149
You like beating on old men?

639
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:01,984
Hey, pal...

640
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:02,943
...keep walking.

641
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:05,404
-You're in the wrong place.
-When were you in Queens?

642
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:07,364
I asked you a question.

643
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:08,448
Nicky, no!

644
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,324
That the gun?

645
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,450
You gonna kill me too?

646
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:13,579
Hey! Stop it!

647
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:15,414
Hey, get off!

648
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,958
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

649
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,209
Back up!

650
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,004
This guy is crazy!

651
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:23,881
Get him!

652
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,637
Get back here, man! Get him!

653
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:38,228
Follow him!

654
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,609
-Go around, man!
-I'll follow you!

655
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:53,744
Go, go, go!

656
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:56,413
There he is!

657
00:49:56,455 --> 00:49:57,289
Can't get away!

658
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,766
He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.

659
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:28,654
Oh, yeah?

660
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:29,696
Come on!

661
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,789
I know what you look like!

662
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,624
You hear me?

663
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,418
I've seen your face!

664
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:22,833
Is that all you got?

665
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,003
Just take it, take it.

666
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:34,303
Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...

667
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:38,891
...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...

668
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:42,811
...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.

669
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:46,481
A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...

670
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,358
...of the lightweight cable.

671
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:58,118
Mother....

672
00:52:55,634 --> 00:53:00,430
Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...

673
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:02,891
...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.

674
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:05,811
Assailant is Caucasian male,
mid-30s...

675
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,897
...170 to 180 pounds...

676
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:10,440
...shoulder-length blond hair.

677
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,110
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.

678
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:33,005
Hey.

679
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:42,931
You got a description?

680
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,183
Well, no, he wears a mask.

681
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:46,101
A mask?

682
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:47,436
Most of his victims...

683
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:50,981
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

684
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:53,525
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

685
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:56,320
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

686
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:57,487
Get me out of here.

687
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,240
Hey, look!

688
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:13,337
Spandex. Spandex.

689
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:15,255
Everything...

690
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:16,173
...spandex.

691
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:18,800
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

692
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:20,802
...of both mass and acceleration.

693
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:22,763
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

694
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:25,390
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

695
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:29,186
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

696
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:07,015
Hey, Aunt May.

697
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:09,643
Yeah. Eggs?

698
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:10,853
Organic, got it.

699
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:45,804
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

700
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,931
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

701
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:49,516
What are you? You a cop?

702
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:54,730
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

703
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,273
You know, you're....

704
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,567
You've got a mind...

705
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,194
...of the true scholar, sir.

706
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:02,613
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

707
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,406
Good thinking.

708
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,116
Get out the window.

709
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:07,451
There you go. You got it.

710
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,294
Crotch!

711
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,591
-Just let me go.
-Is that a real knife?

712
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:23,926
Yes, it's a real knife.

713
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,594
My weakness, it's small knives.

714
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:27,346
-Just let me go.
-Anything but...

715
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,431
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

716
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,058
-That was cool.
-What is this?

717
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:33,810
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

718
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:34,520
Let me go!

719
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,273
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

720
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:39,441
Knock it off, man. No!

721
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:42,986
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

722
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,988
That isn't funny.

723
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,490
-It is kind of funny.
-Help!

724
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:58,961
This could've gone a lot worse.

725
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,963
Now hold still.

726
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,970
Boys in blue here.

727
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,639
-Yo, I got him.
-Freeze!

728
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:12,641
-He's not going anywhere.
-Don't move.

729
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:13,809
You serious?

730
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,018
Who are you?

731
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,271
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

732
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:18,105
Freeze!

733
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,693
I just did 80 percent of your job.

734
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:24,111
And that?

735
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:25,070
That's how you repay me?

736
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:29,867
Hold it right there!

737
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:51,930
Well, that was fun.

738
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,017
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

739
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,105
What are you doing?

740
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:05,903
Hey, watch out.

741
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,196
I'm swinging here.

742
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:08,739
I'm swinging here.

743
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,757
So 38 of New York's finest...

744
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,968
...versus one guy in a unitard.

745
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:32,095
Am I correct?

746
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,778
You don't have to wait up for me.

747
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:49,238
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

748
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,405
Yes, I do.

749
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,907
-Okay.
-Where were you?

750
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,116
I was out.

751
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,118
Did you get the eggs?

752
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:58,288
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

753
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,665
I'm gonna get them now.

754
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,416
No, you most certainly will not.

755
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,460
Not at this hour.

756
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,172
Look at me, Peter.

757
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:11,510
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

758
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:22,437
Peter. Where do you go?

759
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,064
Who does this to you?

760
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:26,024
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

761
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:28,193
-Please tell me.
-Aunt May, please...

762
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:30,404
...please, please go to sleep.

763
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,490
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

764
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:47,504
Peter, listen to me.

765
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:49,548
Secrets have a cost.

766
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,258
They're not for free.

767
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,510
Not now, not ever.

768
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:03,187
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

769
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,815
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

770
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:08,567
It's a miracle.

771
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:10,319
No, it's hard work and promise.

772
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,487
It's a step closer to the primate lab.

773
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:14,406
He doesn't have time
for every little step.

774
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:15,490
Little?

775
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:17,201
I just mean he can't wait.

776
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:18,911
Well, he'll have to.

777
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:21,121
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

778
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:22,164
That's not what...

779
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:23,165
...I'm saying.

780
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:24,374
So, what are you saying?

781
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:27,336
You have to start human trials.

782
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:28,921
Now.

783
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,256
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

784
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:33,258
-Well, then he's going to die.
-People die.

785
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,595
Even Norman Osborn.

786
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:37,763
We are not finished.

787
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,515
Human trials?

788
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,267
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

789
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,020
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

790
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:48,065
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

791
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,441
You've gotta be kidding me.

792
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:51,652
I don't think I am.

793
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:00,536
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

794
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:01,870
About 15 years late.

795
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:03,872
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

796
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,541
Richard Parker wore it well.

797
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:08,544
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

798
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:10,170
I had nothing to do with that.

799
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:11,755
Is that what you told his son?

800
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:18,846
I don't know what you're saying.

801
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,431
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

802
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,394
I'll remind you what happened.

803
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:28,897
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

804
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:34,444
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

805
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,197
I....

806
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,456
I won't.

807
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,294
Fine.

808
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:57,593
The formula is ours now anyway.

809
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,680
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

810
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,390
I'm shutting you down.

811
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:06,476
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

812
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:10,022
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

813
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,233
Right, Freddy?

814
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:29,625
-Hey.
-Hi.

815
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:30,584
How's it going?

816
01:02:30,626 --> 01:02:31,835
Where you headed?

817
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,380
-Monday, B track.
-Oh, it's Thursday.

818
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,633
-It's Thursday?
-What happened?

819
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:39,468
-What?
-Your eye, it looks bruised.

820
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,886
Oh, yeah, no, I don't....

821
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:42,679
Maybe I got a rash or....

822
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,515
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

823
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:48,477
Do you like branzino?

824
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,979
Like, a fish.

825
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:52,981
No, no. I know. I know.

826
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:55,359
Well, if you want...

827
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,905
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

828
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:02,366
My mom's making branzino.

829
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,451
So....

830
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:05,452
It's apartment...

831
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:07,955
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

832
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,456
I don't know why I....

833
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:11,458
-I'll remember it.
-Oh, okay.

834
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,876
2016.

835
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:22,279
Hi.

836
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:24,865
How did you get out there?

837
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,284
The fire escape.

838
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:29,953
Your doorman's intimidating.

839
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,497
It's 20 storeys.

840
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:34,291
Yeah. It's all right.

841
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:40,589
-This is your room.
-Yes, this is my room.

842
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:42,466
Books.

843
01:04:42,508 --> 01:04:43,967
Shoes.

844
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:46,094
Oh, hey....

845
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:48,639
I got your mom...

846
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,057
...these.

847
01:04:50,307 --> 01:04:51,433
Oh, lovely.

848
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:53,268
-Beautiful, right?
-Beautiful.

849
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,811
They were nice.

850
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:56,772
-No, they're beautiful.
-I'm sorry.

851
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:59,691
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

852
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,276
I'm gonna keep these.

853
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,487
You have your suit in there?

854
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:08,325
My suit?

855
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:10,869
It's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

856
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,162
Are you gonna wear that?

857
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:13,205
-That's--
-Hey, hon.

858
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:19,878
You must be Peter.

859
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,755
Dad, this is Peter.

860
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:25,634
Nice to meet you, sir.

861
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:28,095
Nice to meet you.

862
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:29,721
Dinner's ready.

863
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:31,974
Hope you like branzino.

864
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,559
Who doesn't?

865
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,411
Emma, it's Curt.

866
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,497
-Is he there?
-I'm afraid not, doctor.

867
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:40,501
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

868
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:41,877
No. He can't, Emma.

869
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:44,338
You have to stop him. He--

870
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,924
I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.

871
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:49,927
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call
as soon as possible.

872
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:03,398
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

873
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,609
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

874
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:07,027
Bridge! Take the bridge.

875
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:08,529
All right, we'll do that.

876
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:09,780
Hey, you all right...

877
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:10,572
...back there?

878
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:12,282
You tweaking...

879
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:13,534
...man?

880
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,286
Just drive.

881
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,080
Okay.

882
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:25,963
You're having trouble there?

883
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:27,798
The head goes on the other--

884
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,508
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

885
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,884
Oh, I....

886
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:32,135
I got no idea.

887
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,846
First time.

888
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:35,597
-Branzino.
-George.

889
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:38,517
-Tell us about your day.
-Did you catch that spider guy yet?

890
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,269
No, we didn't catch him yet.

891
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:42,312
But we will. He's an amateur...

892
01:07:42,354 --> 01:07:45,190
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

893
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:47,234
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

894
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:48,652
...but he's still dangerous.

895
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:50,988
He's assaulting people?

896
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:53,949
I'm not sure.

897
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:55,576
I mean, I saw that video...

898
01:07:55,617 --> 01:07:57,703
...with him and the car thief, and....

899
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,873
I think most people
would say that he was...

900
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:03,000
...providing a public service.

901
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:05,669
Most people would be wrong.

902
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:10,549
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

903
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:11,842
So why wasn't he then?

904
01:08:15,846 --> 01:08:17,014
Let me illuminate you.

905
01:08:17,055 --> 01:08:19,808
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

906
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,185
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

907
01:08:22,227 --> 01:08:25,354
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

908
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:28,024
-You've heard about that in school?
-Yeah.

909
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:29,067
Good.

910
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:30,484
I know.

911
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:33,322
-He didn't know you had a plan.
-You seem to know...

912
01:08:33,363 --> 01:08:35,240
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

913
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,701
-Whose side are you on?
-I'm not on anyone's side.

914
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:39,243
I saw a video on the Internet--

915
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:40,953
You saw the video on the Internet.

916
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:43,332
-Well, then the case is closed.
-Well, no.

917
01:08:43,372 --> 01:08:44,457
If you watch the video--

918
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,084
Maybe send you a link?

919
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:47,920
It looks like he's trying to help.

920
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,964
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

921
01:08:51,006 --> 01:08:51,798
No, no.

922
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,675
I'm not saying he's a hero.

923
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:56,178
-What are you trying to say?
-He's trying to help.

924
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,679
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

925
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,223
Something the police can't?

926
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:00,933
-I don't know.
-What do you think we do?

927
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,643
Sit around eating doughnuts...

928
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,603
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

929
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:06,854
-George. George.
-Daddy.

930
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:07,731
-Up your what?
-Howard.

931
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:09,733
He stands for what you stand for.

932
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:11,443
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

933
01:09:11,484 --> 01:09:13,694
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

934
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:15,447
Okay? I wear a badge.

935
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:18,658
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

936
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,370
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

937
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:23,705
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

938
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:26,875
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

939
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,752
Let's get some air, Peter.

940
01:09:29,377 --> 01:09:31,546
-Dad, we need to talk.
-Yes, we do.

941
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:35,884
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

942
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:38,345
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

943
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:41,807
-You're welcome.
-Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

944
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:43,934
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

945
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:48,188
-Dad.
-Yeah?

946
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:56,864
Well, that was something.

947
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:01,535
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

948
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:04,204
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you.

949
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:11,670
-What happened to your face?
-I wanna tell you something.

950
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:14,798
Okay.

951
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:21,221
I've been bitten....

952
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:26,435
So have I.

953
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:33,317
Okay.

954
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:37,446
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

955
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:39,364
I gotta tell you this one thing about...

956
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:42,367
-...the vigilante and the car thief.
-Oh, okay.

957
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,203
What?

958
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:46,622
-No, no, no.
-I don't want to talk about that.

959
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:48,457
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

960
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:50,876
-I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
-What about you?

961
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:54,880
It's impo-- I wish I could just--

962
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:56,298
I can't. It's hard to say.

963
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,466
Just say it.

964
01:10:57,508 --> 01:10:59,635
-I don't know.
-Say it.

965
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:03,764
What? What?

966
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:08,936
What?

967
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:14,858
Okay, then forget it.

968
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:24,451
You...?

969
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:35,212
-You're Spider-Man.
-Shut up.

970
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:41,718
Gwen?

971
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,304
Gwen....

972
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:47,266
Your father wants you to come inside.

973
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,017
Okay.

974
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,060
-Okay?
-Yeah.

975
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,022
Gwen.

976
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:55,732
I'm coming.

977
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:28,849
Oh, I'm in trouble.

978
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:53,540
Will you please...

979
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:55,459
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

980
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:03,759
Excellent.

981
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:08,055
Hey!

982
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,309
Hey! What is that?

983
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:14,353
-Oh, my God!
-I don't know!

984
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:15,812
Get back in the car!

985
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:22,277
Help!

986
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:24,863
Help!

987
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:07,197
Incoming!

988
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:28,886
Somebody help!

989
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,388
Help me! My kid is trapped!

990
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:42,316
I want my dad!

991
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:43,817
Dad!

992
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:45,360
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Help!

993
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:46,195
Hey, buddy.

994
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:47,404
-It's okay.
-Get away.

995
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:49,489
-Help!
-Hey, look.

996
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:52,910
Just a normal guy, all right?

997
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,495
Wanna hold this?

998
01:14:57,206 --> 01:14:57,998
Hold my mask.

999
01:14:58,624 --> 01:14:59,541
All right.

1000
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:02,669
What's your name?

1001
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:03,504
Jack?

1002
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:06,089
-Yes.
-Let's get you out of here.

1003
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:09,343
Okay, stay very still.

1004
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:10,344
All right.

1005
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:11,637
Okay, I got you.

1006
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:16,850
Okay, look.

1007
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:18,644
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1008
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:20,729
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1009
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:23,649
-All right.
-Okay, one, two, three.

1010
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:28,070
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1011
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:29,821
All right, okay.

1012
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,920
Jack, climb now.

1013
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:46,588
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

1014
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:54,096
Put it on, the mask.

1015
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:55,556
It's gonna make you strong.

1016
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,599
Jack, trust me.

1017
01:15:57,641 --> 01:15:58,600
Put it on.

1018
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:02,145
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1019
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:03,438
Okay, now, climb.

1020
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,481
Come on, Jack.

1021
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,027
Do me a favour.

1022
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:10,571
A little faster, okay, bud?

1023
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:13,282
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1024
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,533
That's it. Keep coming.

1025
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:16,118
Keep it coming.

1026
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,202
Keep coming.

1027
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,454
No!

1028
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:35,929
Jack. Oh, God.

1029
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:37,472
Thank God.

1030
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:40,517
You okay?

1031
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,022
My son. My son.

1032
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:47,107
Oh, my son.

1033
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:48,901
My son.

1034
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:54,448
Who are you?

1035
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:58,368
Spider-Man.

1036
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:47,417
Beautiful.

1037
01:17:55,592 --> 01:17:56,635
Settle down, guys.

1038
01:17:57,636 --> 01:17:59,388
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1039
01:17:59,429 --> 01:18:01,723
-Come on.
-Listen. At approximately...

1040
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:05,227
...9 p.m. last night, an incident took
place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1041
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:07,729
Much of what occurred
is speculation...

1042
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:10,691
...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...

1043
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:14,278
...to the crime, as well
as our own preliminary findings, have...

1044
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:15,571
...positively placed...

1045
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:17,406
...one individual at the scene.

1046
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:19,032
Which is why, this morning...

1047
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:20,617
...I am issuing a warrant...

1048
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:23,996
...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.

1049
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:33,755
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...

1050
01:18:33,797 --> 01:18:35,465
...in the first of four meetings....

1051
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:44,266
It's so beautiful.

1052
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:46,268
Knows how to bite though.

1053
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:48,187
Who else knows about this?

1054
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:49,229
Just you.

1055
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:50,522
Really?

1056
01:18:52,983 --> 01:18:54,902
Hey, you don't....

1057
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:58,238
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1058
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:00,616
Of course not.

1059
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:04,119
Does it scare you?

1060
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:05,996
What you can do?

1061
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:09,833
No.

1062
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:12,044
No.

1063
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:15,130
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1064
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:18,133
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1065
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:20,052
You gotta lay low.

1066
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:22,387
No, can't do that.

1067
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:23,972
You've got to.

1068
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:26,308
I mean, why...?

1069
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:29,228
Because of last night.

1070
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:31,396
Those people on the bridge.

1071
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:35,442
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1072
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,903
So...

1073
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:39,613
...I gotta go after it.

1074
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:42,157
That's not your job.

1075
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:45,160
Maybe it is.

1076
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:51,625
I really liked kissing you.

1077
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:55,754
You're an amazing kisser.

1078
01:19:58,549 --> 01:19:59,842
Well, you know, it was--

1079
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:01,885
It was good for me too.

1080
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:06,181
Yeah?

1081
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:16,733
Who did that?

1082
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:39,464
Hello!

1083
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:51,310
It's not nice to snoop.

1084
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:56,106
I gave everyone the week off.

1085
01:20:58,358 --> 01:20:59,026
Yeah.

1086
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:01,612
Shouldn't you be at school?

1087
01:21:03,363 --> 01:21:05,532
No, I got a free track.

1088
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:07,576
I wanted to ask you a question.

1089
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:09,453
How would a predator...

1090
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:10,913
...track a reptile?

1091
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:13,916
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1092
01:21:13,957 --> 01:21:15,334
...of their food chain.

1093
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:17,002
Kings of their domain.

1094
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,670
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1095
01:21:18,712 --> 01:21:21,298
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1096
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:26,220
Just asking a question.

1097
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:29,223
I got school stuff.

1098
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,266
Biology profiles to do.

1099
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:34,061
So because of the cold blood...

1100
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,146
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1101
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:37,564
You'd have to catch one first.

1102
01:21:38,482 --> 01:21:41,902
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1103
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:43,445
Beautiful and quite large.

1104
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:46,698
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1105
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,742
No, it's not yet classified.

1106
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:53,705
But it can be aggressive...

1107
01:21:54,665 --> 01:21:55,541
...if threatened.

1108
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:04,675
Doc, you all right?

1109
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:07,469
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1110
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:09,179
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1111
01:22:09,221 --> 01:22:12,099
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1112
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,560
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1113
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:17,479
Good. Good, good.

1114
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:19,857
Good.

1115
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,151
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1116
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:26,488
Wonderful things are coming.

1117
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:29,533
Wonderful things.

1118
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,382
Fred?

1119
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:52,514
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1120
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:55,184
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1121
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:57,895
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1122
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:00,105
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1123
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,482
Okay. Bye-bye.

1124
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:04,526
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1125
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:06,528
-...not in school?
-Got a free track.

1126
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:07,946
Okay, well, I do not.

1127
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:09,364
So make your point quickly.

1128
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:11,909
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1129
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:14,369
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1130
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:16,121
-You know who?
-Dr. Curtis Connors.

1131
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:17,664
-He's a biochemist.
-Of Oscorp?

1132
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:19,333
-That's right.
-Dr. Connors...

1133
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,502
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1134
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:22,878
-That's the one.
-Okay.

1135
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,340
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1136
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,550
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1137
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:30,886
You would have me believe
that he...

1138
01:23:30,928 --> 01:23:33,263
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1139
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:36,975
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1140
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:41,897
Let me ask you a question.

1141
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:45,192
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1142
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:47,819
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1143
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:51,031
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1144
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:54,743
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1145
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:57,371
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1146
01:23:57,412 --> 01:24:01,250
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1147
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:03,752
Okay. All right, I get it.

1148
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:05,671
Here's what we'll do.

1149
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:09,049
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1150
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,426
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1151
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:13,637
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1152
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,056
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1153
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:19,184
-...back to school.
-Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1154
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:22,396
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1155
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:24,189
He is a danger to everybody.

1156
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:26,483
-Just, please, listen to me.
-Let's go.

1157
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:32,155
Jimmy.

1158
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:36,368
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1159
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,745
-Okay? Right away.
-Yeah.

1160
01:25:04,354 --> 01:25:06,440
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1161
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:08,150
Current temperature: 89.7.

1162
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:09,776
Steady for 48 hours.

1163
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:12,446
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1164
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:14,156
...consistent with subject's past.

1165
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:21,705
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1166
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:23,373
Marked enhancement...

1167
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:24,875
...in muscle response...

1168
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:26,293
...strength and elasticity.

1169
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:36,345
Eyesight similarly improved.

1170
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:38,889
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1171
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:46,146
This is no longer about curing ills.

1172
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:48,190
This is about...

1173
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:49,316
...finding perfection.

1174
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:00,786
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1175
01:26:00,827 --> 01:26:04,581
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1176
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:41,136
You stopped me once.

1177
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:44,348
You won't stop me again.

1178
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:49,353
I'm getting stronger every day!

1179
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,643
Oh, that sucked.

1180
01:28:41,071 --> 01:28:42,739
Peter Parker.

1181
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:01,967
Come in.

1182
01:29:04,428 --> 01:29:05,888
You should maybe...

1183
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:07,764
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1184
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:12,561
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1185
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:15,439
-...that you require psychiatric attention.
-Oh, really?

1186
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:17,274
Peter.

1187
01:29:17,816 --> 01:29:18,942
What happened?

1188
01:29:18,984 --> 01:29:20,319
You should see the other guy.

1189
01:29:22,154 --> 01:29:26,700
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1190
01:29:26,742 --> 01:29:27,868
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1191
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:28,952
Do you want cocoa?

1192
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:30,120
Howard's making some.

1193
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:36,251
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1194
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:38,086
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1195
01:29:38,128 --> 01:29:39,087
Okay.

1196
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:43,300
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1197
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:44,927
Well, that's impractical.

1198
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:46,386
And fattening.

1199
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,724
Chocolate house.

1200
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:55,521
-Sorry, Dad.
-It's good.

1201
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:58,482
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work--

1202
01:29:58,524 --> 01:30:01,735
I'm doing this....

1203
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:03,403
I have cramps.

1204
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:06,448
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of....

1205
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:08,909
-Like, emotional. I keep crying.
-It's okay. Good.

1206
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:10,661
-Good.
-It's brutal.

1207
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:12,996
You don't want to know.

1208
01:30:13,038 --> 01:30:14,331
-It's, like, bad.
-Got it.

1209
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:16,333
-Thanks, Daddy.
-All right.

1210
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:43,861
Easy, Bug Boy.

1211
01:30:44,611 --> 01:30:46,029
What'd you call me?

1212
01:30:51,118 --> 01:30:53,078
I'm going to be all right.

1213
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,831
-No. No.
-Yes. Yes.

1214
01:30:57,207 --> 01:30:59,835
I know what this is.

1215
01:30:59,877 --> 01:31:01,211
What is it?

1216
01:31:02,171 --> 01:31:05,424
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1217
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:07,050
...has left every morning...

1218
01:31:07,092 --> 01:31:09,887
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1219
01:31:09,928 --> 01:31:12,222
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1220
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:17,394
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1221
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:19,897
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1222
01:31:29,448 --> 01:31:31,283
I got you.

1223
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:33,702
Okay?

1224
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:37,414
Okay?

1225
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:41,084
I gotta stop him, though.

1226
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:44,671
I have to, because I created him.

1227
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:49,426
What do you mean?

1228
01:31:50,844 --> 01:31:52,930
I gave him an equation...

1229
01:31:55,474 --> 01:31:57,601
...that made all of this possible.

1230
01:32:05,234 --> 01:32:08,237
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1231
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:11,281
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1232
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:16,537
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1233
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:22,042
I have to fix it.

1234
01:32:25,128 --> 01:32:26,797
Peter.

1235
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,550
Hey.

1236
01:32:32,845 --> 01:32:35,097
Let's get out of here.

1237
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:37,057
Let's just get out of here.

1238
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:38,809
Just for a minute. Can we?

1239
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:41,603
-No. No.
-Yeah. Yes.

1240
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:42,938
-Yes.
-No.

1241
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,273
Yes.

1242
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:46,817
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1243
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:53,490
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

1244
01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:08,589
Peter Parker.

1245
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:10,299
Spider-Man.

1246
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:12,551
I'm not the one who needs...

1247
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:14,052
...help.

1248
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,888
There will be no more loneliness...

1249
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:17,514
...no more outcasts.

1250
01:33:17,556 --> 01:33:21,435
Species-wide distribution
could enhance...

1251
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:23,854
...humanity on an evolutionary scale.

1252
01:33:24,313 --> 01:33:26,648
One has to adapt to survive.

1253
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:32,863
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1254
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:36,658
...to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1255
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,995
Would you give it all up
after all you know...

1256
01:33:40,037 --> 01:33:41,121
...you can do?

1257
01:33:41,163 --> 01:33:43,790
All the power you feel.

1258
01:33:47,294 --> 01:33:48,670
I can save...

1259
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:49,630
...them!

1260
01:33:56,345 --> 01:33:57,471
You won't get in...

1261
01:33:57,513 --> 01:33:58,805
...the way of my plan...

1262
01:33:58,847 --> 01:34:00,474
...Peter Parker!

1263
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:28,126
Go. Go!

1264
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:06,498
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1265
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,184
All these souls...

1266
01:35:25,225 --> 01:35:26,602
...lost and alone.

1267
01:35:26,643 --> 01:35:27,644
I can save them.

1268
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:29,438
I can cure them.

1269
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:31,190
There's no need to stop me...

1270
01:35:31,231 --> 01:35:32,149
...Peter.

1271
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:43,785
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1272
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:49,124
Stop this. This isn't you.

1273
01:35:54,296 --> 01:35:55,255
Let's talk this out.

1274
01:35:56,381 --> 01:35:57,132
Doc!

1275
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:04,264
Oh, boy.

1276
01:36:09,853 --> 01:36:10,896
You don't want to talk?

1277
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,273
There you go.

1278
01:36:16,902 --> 01:36:18,111
Don't...

1279
01:36:18,904 --> 01:36:20,280
...make me...

1280
01:36:20,656 --> 01:36:21,657
...have to...

1281
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:23,116
...hurt you!

1282
01:36:30,999 --> 01:36:32,334
That is disgusting.

1283
01:36:42,386 --> 01:36:43,762
Gwen.

1284
01:37:07,703 --> 01:37:09,913
-I'm gonna throw you out the window.
-What?

1285
01:37:23,135 --> 01:37:24,303
Somebody's been...

1286
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:26,013
...a bad lizard.

1287
01:38:12,893 --> 01:38:15,103
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1288
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:18,607
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1289
01:38:27,783 --> 01:38:29,576
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1290
01:38:41,421 --> 01:38:42,840
-Hey.
-Where are you?

1291
01:38:42,881 --> 01:38:43,924
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1292
01:38:43,966 --> 01:38:47,469
I'm in the sewer, tracking him.
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1293
01:38:47,511 --> 01:38:48,762
But we need an antidote.

1294
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:51,515
-Do you know how to run a serum?
-I do it all the time.

1295
01:38:51,557 --> 01:38:54,101
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1296
01:38:54,142 --> 01:38:57,271
I need you to access
the cross-species file. It's a blue serum.

1297
01:38:57,312 --> 01:38:59,565
File 12389.

1298
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:00,816
Okay, got it.

1299
01:39:00,858 --> 01:39:02,609
On my way.

1300
01:39:34,099 --> 01:39:37,853
I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...

1301
01:39:37,895 --> 01:39:40,189
...without outcasts.

1302
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:42,900
I sought to create
a stronger human being...

1303
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:44,985
...but there's no such thing.

1304
01:39:45,027 --> 01:39:48,405
Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feeble-minded...

1305
01:39:48,447 --> 01:39:50,240
...creatures.

1306
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:51,867
Why be human at all...

1307
01:39:51,909 --> 01:39:53,285
...when we can be so...

1308
01:39:53,327 --> 01:39:54,286
...much more?

1309
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:56,747
Faster. Stronger.

1310
01:39:56,788 --> 01:39:58,332
Smarter.

1311
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:01,210
This is my gift to you.

1312
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:11,386
Oscorp.

1313
01:40:13,639 --> 01:40:14,890
-Captain Stacy!
-What?

1314
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:17,518
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1315
01:40:17,559 --> 01:40:19,895
-...toward Canal Street.
-What about Spider-Man?

1316
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:21,271
Inside the high school.

1317
01:40:21,313 --> 01:40:23,232
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1318
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:12,841
The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.

1319
01:42:12,883 --> 01:42:14,801
All efforts to stop him have failed...

1320
01:42:14,843 --> 01:42:18,055
...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.

1321
01:42:22,059 --> 01:42:23,060
-Hi.
-Where are you?

1322
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:24,520
Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.

1323
01:42:24,561 --> 01:42:26,438
You have to get out of there now.

1324
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,982
-The antidote is cooking.
-No, no, no.

1325
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:31,610
Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.

1326
01:42:31,652 --> 01:42:34,321
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1327
01:42:34,363 --> 01:42:35,656
Eight minutes left.

1328
01:42:35,697 --> 01:42:38,367
You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?

1329
01:42:38,408 --> 01:42:39,868
You leave right now.

1330
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:41,078
That is an order, okay?

1331
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,329
I'll get everybody out.

1332
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:43,997
Did you hear wh--?

1333
01:42:44,039 --> 01:42:47,084
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1334
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,768
He's heading south.

1335
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:17,656
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1336
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:19,575
You are surrounded. There is...

1337
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:20,951
...no escape.

1338
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:22,828
Go, go!

1339
01:44:24,765 --> 01:44:26,266
Clear!

1340
01:44:26,308 --> 01:44:27,434
Clear up top!

1341
01:44:29,269 --> 01:44:30,646
Clear, sir!

1342
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:31,855
All clear here, sir!

1343
01:44:57,339 --> 01:44:58,882
Freeze!

1344
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:00,843
Down on the ground.

1345
01:45:00,884 --> 01:45:02,469
Your hands behind your head.

1346
01:45:02,511 --> 01:45:04,137
Now!

1347
01:45:07,516 --> 01:45:08,976
Parker.

1348
01:45:10,853 --> 01:45:11,979
It's headed to Oscorp!

1349
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:14,398
And your daughter's there right now.

1350
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,453
You gotta let me go.

1351
01:45:43,051 --> 01:45:43,802
Hold your fire!

1352
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:53,520
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1353
01:45:53,562 --> 01:45:56,106
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1354
01:45:56,148 --> 01:45:58,192
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1355
01:45:58,233 --> 01:46:01,486
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1356
01:46:17,794 --> 01:46:19,796
Time remaining: one minute.

1357
01:47:32,744 --> 01:47:34,830
Antidote complete.

1358
01:47:47,676 --> 01:47:49,511
Oh, man.

1359
01:47:49,553 --> 01:47:52,347
We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.

1360
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:54,183
The New York Police Department...

1361
01:47:54,224 --> 01:47:56,351
...has called for
a city-wide evacuation...

1362
01:47:56,393 --> 01:47:58,353
...everything south of 54th Street.

1363
01:47:59,188 --> 01:48:01,106
If you are south of 54th Street...

1364
01:48:01,148 --> 01:48:03,609
...you have to move out
of the area immediately.

1365
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:15,787
Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.

1366
01:48:15,829 --> 01:48:16,997
He looks injured...

1367
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:19,833
...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.

1368
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,084
That's the guy who...

1369
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:22,628
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1370
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:24,171
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1371
01:48:24,213 --> 01:48:26,757
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1372
01:48:26,798 --> 01:48:29,510
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1373
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:31,595
-Yeah.
-Get him on the phone for me.

1374
01:48:31,637 --> 01:48:33,847
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1375
01:48:33,889 --> 01:48:36,099
Get him on the phone for me.

1376
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:56,453
Hey, Charlie, get me Enriquez
on 54th Street!

1377
01:48:56,495 --> 01:48:58,705
-You got it.
-Angelo, get your mug over here.

1378
01:48:58,747 --> 01:49:01,083
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1379
01:49:02,459 --> 01:49:04,545
All tower cranes on 6th...

1380
01:49:04,586 --> 01:49:08,423
...swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1381
01:49:08,465 --> 01:49:10,926
Spider-Man needs those big boys
high and lined up.

1382
01:49:10,968 --> 01:49:13,011
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.

1383
01:49:46,753 --> 01:49:48,422
Come on, Parker.

1384
01:51:44,162 --> 01:51:44,872
Hey.

1385
01:51:45,163 --> 01:51:46,373
Dad!

1386
01:51:46,415 --> 01:51:48,709
-I have to get this to Spider-Man.
-Get in.

1387
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,711
-It can stop the Lizard.
-Get in the car.

1388
01:51:50,752 --> 01:51:53,755
-You don't understand!
-Yes, I do.

1389
01:51:53,797 --> 01:51:56,175
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1390
01:51:56,216 --> 01:51:57,509
I get it.

1391
01:51:57,551 --> 01:51:58,760
Give me this.

1392
01:51:58,802 --> 01:52:00,637
Get in the car.

1393
01:52:04,224 --> 01:52:06,310
Please make sure he's okay.

1394
01:52:18,822 --> 01:52:21,950
Initializing Ganali device.

1395
01:52:21,992 --> 01:52:24,995
Detonation in T-minus two minutes.

1396
01:53:47,286 --> 01:53:49,830
Poor Peter Parker.

1397
01:53:50,956 --> 01:53:54,751
No mother, no father...

1398
01:53:55,878 --> 01:53:57,629
...no uncle.

1399
01:53:58,797 --> 01:54:00,674
All alone.

1400
01:54:01,925 --> 01:54:02,926
He's not alone.

1401
01:54:21,987 --> 01:54:24,573
Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.

1402
01:54:33,457 --> 01:54:34,374
Hey!

1403
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:35,167
Gift from Gwen.

1404
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:39,129
I got this, Peter! Go!

1405
01:54:45,052 --> 01:54:46,929
T-minus...

1406
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:48,138
...30 seconds.

1407
01:55:05,906 --> 01:55:07,491
Detonation in T-minus...

1408
01:55:07,533 --> 01:55:09,243
...10 seconds.

1409
01:55:09,701 --> 01:55:10,702
Nine.

1410
01:55:11,912 --> 01:55:13,580
Eight.

1411
01:55:13,622 --> 01:55:14,998
Seven.

1412
01:55:15,499 --> 01:55:16,792
Six.

1413
01:55:17,584 --> 01:55:18,877
Five.

1414
01:55:19,586 --> 01:55:20,295
Four.

1415
01:55:21,255 --> 01:55:22,256
Three.

1416
01:55:24,007 --> 01:55:24,675
Two.

1417
01:55:26,426 --> 01:55:27,094
One.

1418
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:54,538
No.

1419
01:55:56,039 --> 01:55:58,041
No!

1420
01:57:09,112 --> 01:57:10,239
The captain.

1421
01:57:11,782 --> 01:57:13,283
Captain!

1422
01:57:15,953 --> 01:57:17,496
The Lizard.

1423
01:57:17,538 --> 01:57:18,372
It's okay.

1424
01:57:18,413 --> 01:57:19,623
We stopped him.

1425
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:21,291
Okay.

1426
01:57:21,333 --> 01:57:23,502
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

1427
01:57:24,837 --> 01:57:26,296
Okay, okay, okay.

1428
01:57:26,338 --> 01:57:27,923
Look at me. Stay with me.

1429
01:57:27,965 --> 01:57:30,175
-Help's on the way, okay?
-You need to....

1430
01:57:30,217 --> 01:57:33,846
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1431
01:57:33,887 --> 01:57:35,347
Okay?

1432
01:57:35,389 --> 01:57:36,682
I'm not going anywhere.

1433
01:57:37,266 --> 01:57:39,685
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1434
01:57:40,394 --> 01:57:41,937
This city needs you.

1435
01:57:43,939 --> 01:57:45,649
Here.

1436
01:57:45,691 --> 01:57:46,859
You're gonna need this.

1437
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,240
You're gonna make enemies.

1438
01:57:55,659 --> 01:57:57,494
People will get hurt.

1439
01:57:59,079 --> 01:58:00,998
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1440
01:58:04,918 --> 01:58:06,920
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1441
01:58:08,839 --> 01:58:12,634
Leave Gwen out of it.

1442
01:58:15,179 --> 01:58:16,805
Promise me that.

1443
01:58:22,436 --> 01:58:24,104
You promise me.

1444
01:59:37,803 --> 01:59:39,179
An eerie calm...

1445
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:41,390
...has set in over New York City.

1446
01:59:41,431 --> 01:59:42,850
Apparently, some sort of...

1447
01:59:42,891 --> 01:59:46,019
...aerosolized antidote
was launched from...

1448
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:49,398
...Oscorp Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.

1449
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:52,526
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...

1450
01:59:52,568 --> 01:59:54,695
...knowing that
the alleged mastermind...

1451
01:59:54,736 --> 01:59:58,490
...of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.

1452
01:59:58,532 --> 02:00:00,033
We've got John Niles...

1453
02:00:00,075 --> 02:00:02,619
...on the street for a report
in Lower Manhattan.

1454
02:00:02,661 --> 02:00:04,705
John, what do you see?

1455
02:00:37,571 --> 02:00:39,615
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1456
02:00:41,783 --> 02:00:43,660
It's all right.

1457
02:00:44,745 --> 02:00:46,163
It's all right.

1458
02:00:46,663 --> 02:00:47,623
Rough night.

1459
02:00:49,708 --> 02:00:51,376
It's gonna be all right.

1460
02:01:45,138 --> 02:01:46,849
Where have you been?

1461
02:01:49,852 --> 02:01:51,436
Hi.

1462
02:01:56,275 --> 02:01:57,901
My father died.

1463
02:02:01,864 --> 02:02:03,615
There was a funeral.

1464
02:02:05,075 --> 02:02:06,410
They shot off...

1465
02:02:08,412 --> 02:02:11,164
...rifles and they made speeches.

1466
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:16,670
Two of my teachers showed up.

1467
02:02:18,088 --> 02:02:19,464
And Flash showed up.

1468
02:02:24,386 --> 02:02:27,014
Everyone was there but you.

1469
02:02:41,612 --> 02:02:43,739
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1470
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:48,160
I'm sorry. I can't....

1471
02:02:48,202 --> 02:02:49,745
What are you saying?

1472
02:02:49,786 --> 02:02:51,622
I can't see you anymore.

1473
02:02:53,582 --> 02:02:55,042
I can't.

1474
02:03:20,651 --> 02:03:22,653
He made you promise, didn't he?

1475
02:03:26,657 --> 02:03:30,536
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1476
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:57,980
What a pretty...

1477
02:03:58,021 --> 02:03:59,022
...girl.

1478
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:00,357
Yeah.

1479
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:02,192
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1480
02:04:03,235 --> 02:04:04,903
Did you ask her out?

1481
02:04:08,657 --> 02:04:09,992
Why?

1482
02:04:11,076 --> 02:04:12,536
Can't.

1483
02:04:13,829 --> 02:04:15,205
Why?

1484
02:04:17,791 --> 02:04:19,501
I'm just no good for her.

1485
02:04:22,671 --> 02:04:26,133
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1486
02:04:27,176 --> 02:04:28,468
Anyone has a problem...

1487
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:30,220
...with that can talk to me.

1488
02:04:47,946 --> 02:04:51,116
Peter, I know things have been...

1489
02:04:51,158 --> 02:04:52,492
...difficult lately...

1490
02:04:52,534 --> 02:04:54,620
...and I'm sorry about that.

1491
02:04:55,037 --> 02:04:58,123
I think I know what you're feeling.

1492
02:04:58,165 --> 02:05:00,876
Ever since you were a little boy...

1493
02:05:00,918 --> 02:05:05,339
...you've been living with
so many unresolved things.

1494
02:05:06,548 --> 02:05:08,842
Well, take it from an old man:

1495
02:05:09,426 --> 02:05:12,638
Those things send us
down a road.

1496
02:05:12,679 --> 02:05:13,889
They make us...

1497
02:05:13,931 --> 02:05:15,015
...who we are.

1498
02:05:15,265 --> 02:05:20,521
And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.

1499
02:05:21,104 --> 02:05:23,524
You owe the world your gifts.

1500
02:05:24,107 --> 02:05:26,985
You just have to figure out
how to use them.

1501
02:05:27,528 --> 02:05:30,989
And know that wherever
they take you...

1502
02:05:31,031 --> 02:05:33,325
...we'll always be here.

1503
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:36,745
So come on home, Peter.

1504
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:39,581
You're my hero.

1505
02:05:39,623 --> 02:05:41,124
And I love you.

1506
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:51,385
-What's up, Parker?
-What's up?

1507
02:05:51,426 --> 02:05:52,886
Hey. How's it going?

1508
02:05:53,846 --> 02:05:55,222
You coming along, man?

1509
02:05:56,807 --> 02:05:57,641
Cool shirt.

1510
02:05:59,518 --> 02:06:00,769
Yeah.

1511
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:02,437
Dude's crazy.

1512
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:03,856
But chicks dig him.

1513
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:09,361
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1514
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:21,832
I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...

1515
02:06:21,874 --> 02:06:25,127
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1516
02:06:26,086 --> 02:06:28,297
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1517
02:06:28,338 --> 02:06:29,756
There is only one:

1518
02:06:30,674 --> 02:06:32,176
"Who am I"?

1519
02:06:32,885 --> 02:06:34,928
Mr. Parker.

1520
02:06:34,970 --> 02:06:35,971
Tardy again.

1521
02:06:37,931 --> 02:06:39,892
At least we can always count on you.

1522
02:06:39,933 --> 02:06:42,811
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1523
02:06:42,853 --> 02:06:44,938
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1524
02:06:47,191 --> 02:06:49,484
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1525
02:06:49,526 --> 02:06:51,486
Okay, class, open your books.

1526
02:06:51,528 --> 02:06:53,530
Let's begin on page one.

1527
02:09:48,789 --> 02:09:51,500
Hello, doctor.

1528
02:09:51,542 --> 02:09:53,001
Did you tell the boy?

1529
02:09:53,043 --> 02:09:54,211
Tell him what?

1530
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:58,006
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1531
02:09:59,675 --> 02:10:00,676
No.

1532
02:10:00,717 --> 02:10:02,302
Well, that's very good.

1533
02:10:02,636 --> 02:10:03,846
So we'll let him be...

1534
02:10:03,887 --> 02:10:04,847
...for now.

1535
02:10:05,889 --> 02:10:07,975
You should leave him alone!
