1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,080
I'm assuming the captaincy
of Gotham Central.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,960
You just better hope you can
pay up when your bill's due.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,400
And it will come due.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,560
Let me know how I can help you.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,000
Stop trying to be my father.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,400
Master Bruce, I'm so sorry.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,560
Alfred, you're fired!

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,920
This is your turf now.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
You're the new leader of the Narrows.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,000
I am in control!

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,400
You're in love with Lee Thompkins,
you pathetic loser.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,760
Shut up!

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,280
- Where are they?
- That's powerful stuff!

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,000
It can get into DNA.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,720
You're gonna remember me, Butch.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm sorry, I tried.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,440
What the hell happened to me?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,240
That was you.
You sent this monster in my city.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Heard you got the Pyg.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,480
Turned out well.
You didn't even need me.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,160
They... they believe in you.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,200
Don't let them down.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,760
Listen...

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
How can I help you, Captain Gordon?

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,280
I assure you,
this is a respectable establishment.

27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,560
Relax, I'm not here to shut you down.
I'm looking for someone.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,520
We are trusted for our discretion.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,320
Was he here?
Who did he spend the night with?

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,880
He specifically requested
Tallulah and the peep.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,560
That's him. That's Bullock.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,320
If he comes back, please.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,560
Tell him to call me.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
It was an old Chinese guy's place
filled with rare drugs and stuff.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,120
He's split town,
the place is empty now.

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Where are the drugs?
You said there'd be drugs.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,880
Holy crap.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
What the...?

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't touch it, dude.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,440
You just woke it up.

41
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,040
Hey, Tiffany.

42
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,800
- Who's that stiff at the counter?
- New customer. Nice guy, polite.

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
Leave him alone, okay?

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Hey, new guy.

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,400
- Do I know you?
- No, mate.

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
Most definitely not.

47
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,640
Not from around here?

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
And what gave you that idea?

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,960
Here, miss. Thank you very much.

50
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Keep the change.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,280
That stiff's shoes are worth
more than my car.

52
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,800
I understand times are tough.

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,280
I understand you need
to make a living.

54
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah.

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
But it's time to stop
punishing each other

56
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,160
for the situation
the city has put you in.

57
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,600
Instead of stealing from those
hurting as much as you,

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,400
this community needs to start
protecting one another.

59
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,360
- We do what we do to survive!
- Yeah.

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,840
And is that all you want? All of you?

61
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,200
Just to survive everyday
one day at a time?

62
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,560
Listen, Doc, down here,
it's every man for himself!

63
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,160
That's the way it's always been.

64
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,760
- That's right.
- It's like shit.

65
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,920
How many of you have kids?

66
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,040
I've been running a clinic down here
for the last nine months.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
And I have been treating your kids

68
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,040
for things like TB, hepatitis,
ketosis, pneumonia,

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,000
diseases that don't belong
in a modern city.

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,600
There are no functioning
hospitals down here.

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,480
And the doctors
are too afraid to visit.

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,920
You're not stealing from the rich,
you're stealing from each other.

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,560
You are fighting each other.

74
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,920
And you are living in a prison
of your own construction.

75
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,560
Well, hello, beautiful.
What's your name?

76
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Ivy.

77
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
My name was Ivy.

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,680
Well, Ivy...

79
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,960
what's a nice girl like you doing
in a place like this?

80
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
That's a hell of a thing.

81
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,760
Let's go.

82
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,960
Extraordinary.

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,760
Hey, Little Lord Fuddy-duddy.

84
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,520
It's Fauntleroy.

85
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
What?

86
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,160
Little Lord Fauntleroy,
by Frances Hodgson Burnett.

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,320
- A tad saccharine for my taste.
- Shut up.

88
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,680
Wallet, watch, jewelry.

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,880
Absolutely not, I mean,
you're a big man,

90
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
but you're out of shape.

91
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,720
And what?
You're three beers in already?

92
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
That's enough!

93
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Get out of here.

94
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,320
Not who I was expecting to see here.

95
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Likewise.

96
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Is Bruce with you?

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
No.

98
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
What are you doing here?

99
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,800
It's not too bad down here really.

100
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,520
I'll make you rent
a lovely space for who?

101
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,400
Next to nothing if you put her around
and you're patient.

102
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
You live here?

103
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Nearby.

104
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
It's a long story.

105
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,600
Give me the chance to prove to you

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
that I can turn the Narrows
into a place

107
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,680
where you don't have to steal
from one another to live.

108
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
Yes.

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,960
- Yeah!
- Yes!

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,560
Let's go. Come on. Go. Come on.

111
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
Go. Go. Go.

112
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,240
Come. Come on, come on.

113
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,400
Everyone, move away
from the building.

114
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
{\an5}- There's your mummy. There.
- Mummy!

115
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,160
{\an5}That's the last one,
building's clear.

116
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,000
- Thank you, sir.
- Oxygen.

117
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,880
- Please.
- Over here, over here.

118
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Listen up!

119
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,600
{\an5}We need to set up a parameter
and start interviewing witnesses.

120
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,720
{\an5}Let's go.

121
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
{\an5}Place him on it.

122
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,480
{\an5}Appears like you turned around
the GCPD, Captain Gordon.

123
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
{\an5}Gordon?

124
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Quite a mess.
Thought you might need help.

125
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,160
{\an5}Thank you, we need to find
the source of the blast.

126
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
{\an5}Alfred, I do wanna talk to you
but I have to deal with this first.

127
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
{\an5}- Oh, you have my number, call me.
- All right. Let's go.

128
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,640
{\an5}I'll ask you one more time.
Why were you here?

129
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,880
{\an5}There was a wine and cheese mixer.

130
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
{\an5}Laugh all you want,
they were trying to kill you.

131
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
{\an5}This is the Narrows, bud.
That's everyday around here.

132
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,960
{\an5}Yeah, just another beautiful day
in the Narrows, Captain.

133
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
{\an5}Gordon.

134
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
{\an5}Get him out of here.

135
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,160
{\an5}What you got?

136
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,480
{\an5}Well, it seems like a piece of a toy
plane and yet, if I'm not mistaken,

137
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,280
{\an5}it's covered in plastic
explosive residue.

138
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,600
{\an5}There's also the remnants
of what seem like trigger wire.

139
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,800
{\an5}Whoever built it,

140
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,000
{\an5}takes pride in their work
and has considerable talent,

141
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,360
{\an5}historical knowledge,
even look at the detail.

142
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,400
{\an5}Pretty elaborate.

143
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
{\an5}I can think of easier ways

144
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
{\an5}to kill a room full of criminals
than with a toy plane.

145
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
{\an5}Perhaps, it was intended
to fly to someone specific

146
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,800
{\an5}and not destroy the whole room.

147
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,120
{\an5}Like an assassination attempt.

148
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,960
{\an5}If so who is the target?

149
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,200
{\an5}Whoever this was needs
to be made an example of.

150
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,920
{\an5}I mean, can't they tell
you were trying to help?

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,840
- Maybe it wasn't one of them.
- Oh, of course, it was.

152
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,840
I just think that maybe the best
thing for The Narrows

153
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,280
{\an5}is to burn it to the ground,
start over.

154
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,320
{\an5}Well, that would certainly suit
everyone, wouldn't this?

155
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm just saying,
someone tried to blow you to bits

156
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,720
and I bet they're gonna try it again.

157
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
So I'm gonna find them.

158
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,320
And when I do, Grundy's gonna
pull them apart, limb by limb.

159
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,800
Isn't that right, big fella?

160
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,280
Hey, Grundy.

161
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
You okay?

162
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Yeah, okay.

163
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,840
My name is Butch.

164
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,160
Butch Gilzean.

165
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,040
- There he is.
- Nice

166
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
That was so brave, sir.

167
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,120
It's Alfred, please.

168
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
It's the good stuff.

169
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,400
My manager hides it in his drawer.

170
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Thank you.

171
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
On the house.

172
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,000
What you did out there...

173
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,160
running into a burning building.

174
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,840
Well, I wouldn't have done it.

175
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,840
No hard feelings?

176
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
No.

177
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Good man.

178
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Thanks.

179
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,480
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

180
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,840
Cheers.

181
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,760
- What happened there?
- I fell. No big deal.

182
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,720
There are a few places in this city
that collect and sell antique toys,

183
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,440
but only this one
also manufactures its own.

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,480
- Can I help you, gentlemen?
- Yes.

185
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,880
We were wondering
if you recognize this plane.

186
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
One of yours?

187
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,320
- Where did you find it?
- Yours or not?

188
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,280
It's a pine and lead 1944
Mustang replica.

189
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,640
We have these, yes.
But it's been altered.

190
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
To carry a bomb, yeah.

191
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
How many people work here?

192
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,400
There's me and my father.

193
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
And where is he?

194
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Upstairs.

195
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Go get him.

196
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,760
Got a hunch you'd like to share?

197
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,480
No, just a bad feeling.

198
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,960
Of course, I'd happily be wrong.

199
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,760
Who buys these things?

200
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Not sure any of it's for sale,
I don't see price tags on anything.

201
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,720
- Any word from Harvey?
- Not yet.

202
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
Think he'll return to the GCPD?

203
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,400
To be honest, I'm not sure.

204
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,400
- Gordon?
- Get down!

205
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,560
<i>Seek and destroy, seek and destroy,
seek and destroy.</i>

206
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,040
<i>Seek and destroy, seek and destroy.</i>

207
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,520
<i>Seek and destroy. Seek and destroy.</i>

208
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,800
You've got to be kidding me.

209
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,720
Wait, wait, no, no, wait, wait!
Let him go, let him go, please!

210
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
He's my father.

211
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,160
I can't let you hurt him.

212
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,840
I swear to God, I had no idea
what my father was up to.

213
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
There's a machine gun built

214
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,640
into the wooden hand
of this nutcracker here.

215
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
Excuse me if I find that hard
to believe.

216
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,240
I didn't know, okay?

217
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,080
My father, he hates to be disturbed.

218
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,080
He also built a bomb that almost
blew up a building this morning.

219
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
We need to know why.
Who is the target?

220
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I don't know.

221
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,800
Has anyone suspicious been here
recently asking for specialty toys?

222
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,800
No, no one comes in here.
This is just his workshop.

223
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,840
He mostly works at nights.

224
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,360
He boxes the things
he makes and ships them.

225
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
What?

226
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,520
Look, three days ago,

227
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,400
I thought I heard him talking
to someone behind his door.

228
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,200
His voice was low like
he didn't want me to hear him.

229
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,520
Did you hear a name?

230
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,760
I heard my father repeat something
like he was confirming a name.

231
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,200
He said, "The Doc."

232
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,560
"The Doc?" Who's that?

233
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,840
I have no idea.

234
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,640
All right, can you deal with this?

235
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,880
I'm gonna talk to somebody
who might know who The Doc is.

236
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,520
This place is killing you.

237
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,360
The taxi is here.

238
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,840
- Okay, what's the time though?
- Maybe like five minutes is good.

239
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,480
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.

240
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,560
<i>On freeway, the truck overturned
spilling its load of gasoline</i>

241
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,200
<i>into Gotham's Nature Park.</i>

242
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,640
<i>The GCPD is warning all citizens
to remain clear of the...</i>

243
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,760
<i>Causing gas to leak into the water
supply which then ignited,</i>

244
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
<i>setting fire
to the resident's kitchen,</i>

245
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,840
<i>which set off a twenty-four
acre blaze.</i>

246
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,520
<i>Wayne Enterprises can't...</i>

247
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,840
<i>Now, there's no reason to ever
be alone in this city again.</i>

248
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,960
<i>The Sirens Club is back
with a passion.</i>

249
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,000
<i>Ladies drink for free
whilst men don't.</i>

250
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,880
<i>You'll like it, it's nice.</i>

251
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,520
I know you.

252
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,080
All of you.

253
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
And I'm pretty sure I hated you.

254
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,960
You're funny, Alfred.

255
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,840
I honestly haven't laughed
this much in a very long time.

256
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,040
Oh, I'm glad I'm able to amuse you,
Miss Gale.

257
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,560
Your accent, I love it.

258
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Where are you from?

259
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,800
A charming place called Whitechapel.
In East End, London.

260
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,600
Go back often?

261
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
No. Sadly, no.

262
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,320
Well, perhaps you should.

263
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,880
Why did you leave?

264
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,520
Well, I was in the military.

265
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
I was very proud
of serving my country,

266
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,760
not so proud of some of the things
we had to do though.

267
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,480
And when I left, I found myself...

268
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,800
lost.

269
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,000
You know, it's a tough transition.

270
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,680
Then I met this man.

271
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,960
He changed my life.

272
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,320
Brought me to America, gave me a job.

273
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
And where is that man now?

274
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
He's dead.

275
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
And I miss him.

276
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,080
I miss him very much.

277
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
Is that your boyfriend?

278
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,040
Hey, you didn't call me back.

279
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,600
I was heading to the diner
to pick you up.

280
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,040
Oh, that wasn't necessary.

281
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
Alfred was kind enough
to walk me home.

282
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,000
Thank you, sir.

283
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,800
I'd hate to think of Tiff alone
on these streets after dark.

284
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Drop the accent, son! I see the face!

285
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,720
It was your idea, was it?

286
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,160
Wear her hair down,
to cover the bruisy.

287
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Oh, my, what a little tattletales
you've been.

288
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
What am I to do with her?

289
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,840
Stop it! Don't make things worse.

290
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,600
- I can handle this!
- Listen to me! Listen! Listen to me.

291
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,080
You stay away from him.
He's dangerous.

292
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,400
- Let me walk you home.
- I'll be fine.

293
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,760
Oh, Tiffany, what did I tell you
about talking to strange men?

294
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,960
It's time to go.

295
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,240
We have so much to discuss.

296
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,760
You be careful.

297
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,480
There was a fatality
at the bomb site.

298
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Young man found at the room
below the impact site

299
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,120
and well, perhaps
I should just show you.

300
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,440
- Of course.
- Yeah.

301
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,840
The cause of death
was ingested poison.

302
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,840
See that discoloration
around the mouth?

303
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,640
The poison entered directly
into the bloodstream.

304
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,800
Yeah, but see that's not
what's unusual.

305
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,800
There seems to be something emanating
from within the victim's body.

306
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,680
The time of death
was several hours ago.

307
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,920
But this foreign organic
material's not only alive,

308
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,760
but growing.

309
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,520
- Seems like moss.
- Toxicodendron radicans.

310
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,840
Poison ivy.

311
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,920
It's microscopic at first
but multiplying, growing.

312
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,160
Living off the victim's dead tissue.

313
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,240
Fascinating.

314
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
So the commercial worked.

315
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,360
We're back and busier than ever.

316
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,040
Good. Because that's the last time
you're getting me on camera.

317
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
Who is that?

318
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Who's who?

319
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,680
Selina, will you tell those brats
over there to keep it down?

320
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,080
Why me?

321
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,040
Because you're a partner now,

322
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,240
and also the one paying,
is a friend of yours.

323
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,480
One, three. Coming up.

324
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,640
Bruce.

325
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
What's up?

326
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,320
- Champagne?
- No.

327
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,880
Why? They don't guard you here.
And even if they did...

328
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,400
this is Gotham.

329
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,640
By "they" you mean me.

330
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,560
This is my place too.

331
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

332
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,600
So you wanna tell
your little brat pack here

333
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,800
to reel it in a little
or should I call your keeper?

334
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,360
Go ahead, call Alfred.
He won't answer.

335
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,560
- Why?
- Because I fired him.

336
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,520
And it's time to move on,
you know what I'm saying?

337
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,920
You sure about that?

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,280
- I'm not buying it.
- Not buying what?

339
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
This.

340
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,520
You.

341
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,920
Firing Alfred?
What are you trying to prove?

342
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,880
- No, I saw her first.
- The lady was speaking to me.

343
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Hey.

344
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,240
Hey, hey.

345
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,760
Silly boys.

346
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm really not sure
what got into them.

347
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,160
You should leave.

348
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,320
Well, that's awfully rude.

349
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,800
But you always were.

350
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
Who is that woman?

351
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,480
She seems to know you.

352
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Who cares?

353
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Redheads.
They're all crazy, am I right?

354
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Ivy.

355
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,760
I like what you've done
with the place.

356
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Thank you.

357
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,320
Though, it's hardly a challenge
after what that crazy bird

358
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,880
passed for as taste?

359
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,440
What brings you here, my love?

360
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,800
Actually, you know,
I'm so proud to say that

361
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,360
I seem to maintain a very good
relationship with all my exes.

362
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,480
- You...
- Leave me off that list.

363
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,120
What can I do you for, Jimmy?

364
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,120
The Doc. You know him?

365
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,680
The Doc.

366
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,360
I believe he was the target
of an assassination attempt

367
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,920
in The Narrows this morning.

368
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,600
Do you now?
And you wanna protect the Doc?

369
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,600
I wanna know who wanted
to kill him and why.

370
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,840
You know him or not?

371
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,120
Oh, I know the Doc.

372
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,800
Dangerous character.

373
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,200
Someone like that,
you might wanna shoot first,

374
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,640
then ask questions later.

375
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,040
Something you're good at.

376
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,680
- Where is he?
- With Ed Nygma. They're partners.

377
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,480
- Where?
- The Narrows. Place called Cherry's.

378
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,400
Careful, Jim.

379
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,400
Sometimes, we search for things
we don't wish to find.

380
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Harper, what's up?

381
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,480
<i>I'm at a murder scene at The Narrows.</i>

382
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm busy. Can you handle it?

383
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,440
<i>You're gonna want to check this out
in person.</i>

384
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,880
<i>I have the suspect in custody,
Alfred Pennyworth.</i>

385
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,800
Beaten to death. Local girl.

386
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,440
Garbage collectors found her
about an hour ago.

387
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,680
She lived with her boyfriend
who was at work all night.

388
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,440
He told us that him and Pennyworth
got into it earlier.

389
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,080
Says that he was trying to keep
him separate from his girlfriend.

390
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,640
Says that he made advances
towards the victim.

391
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,000
According to him,
Pennyworth got rough.

392
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,880
Rough? That doesn't sound like him.

393
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,880
Come on, you and I both have seen
Alfred lose his temper.

394
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
There's more.

395
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
This was found next to the body.
It's an SAS signet ring.

396
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,040
Impressions of it
on the victim's face.

397
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
My God.

398
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
Thanks.

399
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,680
Give us a minute.

400
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,320
Is this yours?

401
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,480
Yes, but I...

402
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,840
- You hit this girl?
- No.

403
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,360
How can you even ask that?
It was the boyfriend.

404
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,760
I mean, he beat her before.
Now he's gone and finally killed her.

405
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,640
- He says you were fighting with him.
- Because he beat her!

406
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
I swear, he's a liar.

407
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,880
All right, calm down.
You're in enough trouble as it is.

408
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
The last thing you need to do
is lose your temper.

409
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,320
Who was this girl to you?

410
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
She is a friend.

411
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Just a friend.

412
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
- What? You just met her?
- Well, no.

413
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,760
You might find this hard to believe,
Gordon but we connected.

414
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,360
She was a beautiful, kind soul.

415
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,480
Her murderer's name is Rooney, right?
Gil Rooney.

416
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,920
He has an alibi.

417
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,040
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

418
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,840
Calm down.

419
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,680
Take a breath.

420
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,160
Go with Harper to the precinct.

421
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
Make a statement.

422
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
I'll find you later, yeah?

423
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
And you're gonna arrest
Rooney as well, yeah?

424
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,600
He will make a statement. Yes.

425
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Cap.

426
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,120
We got a witness who saw Pennyworth
and her boyfriend getting into it.

427
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,360
She saw the whole thing.

428
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,000
All right,
take Alfred back to the precinct.

429
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,880
Come by after my last stop.

430
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
Okay. Where is he?

431
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Damn it.

432
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Tabitha.

433
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Butch?

434
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,800
Oh, my God. It worked.

435
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,600
It hurt, I'll tell you that.

436
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,560
What happened to you?

437
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,240
- And who turned you into this thing?
- I don't remember much.

438
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,680
I remember Barbara
shooting me in the head.

439
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,440
Something in that swamp
brought me back.

440
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm a monster.

441
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,360
I came here...

442
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,440
Butch, tell me.

443
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,280
I came here because the one thing
that is still very clear

444
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,080
in this thick head of mine
is my feelings for you.

445
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,800
I still love you, Tabby.

446
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Okay.

447
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Goodbye, Tabby.

448
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,920
Thank you for waiting.

449
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
It's worth it, you'll see.

450
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,360
Believe in her passion
and your champion shall be.

451
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,360
Bombs can't stop her,
nor bullets too,

452
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,400
because she's here to speak out
and fight for you.

453
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,720
Ready to battle, ready to rock!

454
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,960
People of the Narrows,
here's the Doc!

455
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,120
Doc! Doc! Doc!

456
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,240
Doc! Doc! Doc!

457
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,200
Doc! Doc! Doc!

458
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,720
Doc! Doc! Doc!

459
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,640
Doc! Doc! Doc!

460
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
This morning,
someone tried to kill me.

461
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,280
Maybe it was someone
from the outside,

462
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,160
maybe it was one of you.

463
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,480
No. No way.

464
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,880
You know what, I don't know
and I don't care.

465
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,720
But what I do know...

466
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,240
is that someone did not like
what I was saying.

467
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,280
Now, why would the idea
of a united Narrows scare people?

468
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,080
I'll tell you why.

469
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,480
Because a united Narrows
is a strong Narrows.

470
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,920
Yeah.

471
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,520
- And guess what?
- What?

472
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,080
- They should be scared.
- Yeah!

473
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,720
Magnificent, isn't she?

474
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,160
- It's been forever, right?
- I should bust you right now.

475
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,640
Oh, come on, Jim. Don't be grumpy.
Your ex has my full support.

476
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,520
She's really gonna change
things around here.

477
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,920
Someone hired Griffin Krank
to kill her this morning.

478
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,520
You really think
they won't do it again?

479
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,520
- Krank?
- A toymaker but also an assassin.

480
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,680
That is so Gotham.

481
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,480
Because together, we have
the power to change our lives.

482
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,160
Yeah! Right!

483
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,440
Imagine a hospital,
imagine schools...

484
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Yes!

485
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,160
imagine these slums torn down.

486
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,400
Yeah!

487
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,040
Your children deserve better.

488
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,760
Your children deserve life!

489
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,480
Yeah!

490
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

491
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,840
- Yeah, all right.
- Thank you.

492
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Jim.

493
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Doc.

494
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,560
I'd like to think of that
as a sign of respect,

495
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,480
not just a lack of imagination.

496
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,360
How long you've been back?

497
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,120
A while.

498
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,280
I wish you would have contacted me.

499
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,720
I've been busy.

500
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,280
I could see that.

501
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,240
You look great.

502
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,680
You look the same.

503
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,360
Are you here to arrest someone? Me?

504
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,080
I'm here because someone
wants you dead.

505
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,400
The assassin is still on the loose.

506
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,800
As is the person who hired him.
You're not safe.

507
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,760
It's Gotham. Is anyone ever safe?

508
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,200
So you're partners with Ed?

509
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Why?

510
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
- I'm right here.
- Why not?

511
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,400
Wouldn't have been my first choice

512
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,120
but the universe has many ways.

513
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,560
Still here.

514
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,160
I'll see you around, Jim.

515
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm gonna take a look around.

516
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
That's...

517
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Oh, boy.

518
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,000
I've been trying to get to you.

519
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,600
You shouldn't be here,
you're a wanted man.

520
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,400
Better stay cool,
I mean, I got friends.

521
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,480
That's for Tiffany!

522
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,760
- And that's for me!
- Help me!

523
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,440
This man killed my girlfriend.
He's a maniac!

524
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Oh, you're making this too easy.

525
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,160
I'll just tell the cops
this was self-defense.

526
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,360
Sorry, it took me so long.
I was in the John.

527
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,240
I liked you better
when you were making tea.

528
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,040
Harvey, what the bloody hell
are you doing here?

529
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,240
I work here.

530
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,680
Don't say it like that,
this place has history.

531
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
I love bartending.

532
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,640
It involves two
of my favorite things.

533
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,280
Drinking and ignoring people.

534
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,720
Who are these jokers?

535
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,920
He's a bloody murderer.

536
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
Then call a cop, I'm a bartender.

537
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
No, he is the murderer.
I have an alibi.

538
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,480
Oh, yeah?

539
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,000
Let me guess,
one of these guys is your alibi.

540
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,240
- What do you say now, pal?
- Oh, I'm not an alibi.

541
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,360
I'll call it in.

542
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,480
Hi, Kitty Cat.

543
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,120
You suck at following people,
by the way.

544
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Ivy?

545
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
In the flesh.

546
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,320
Just different flesh.

547
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,400
What happened to you?

548
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,000
Something wonderful.

549
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,280
Can you feel that

550
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,240
coursing through your veins?

551
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,920
It's my essence.

552
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,960
Is your head swimming?

553
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,240
Your mouth drying up...

554
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,080
it lives within me now.

555
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,840
It's power.

556
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,440
Drink.

557
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,840
It'll counteract the toxin.

558
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,080
It took me a few trials but...

559
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
it'll work.

560
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
See?

561
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,240
You have to trust me.

562
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,560
- You've gone crazy.
- No.

563
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,400
I haven't.

564
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,880
I have been reborn.

565
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,960
And I will never be underestimated
or ignored ever again.

566
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,840
You always looked after me, Selina.

567
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,800
Now let me help you.

568
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,720
Let's make Gotham my bitch.

569
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,040
Please, don't hurt me.

570
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,080
Why would I do that?

571
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,000
You tried to kill me.

572
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, because you paid me to.

573
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
What?

574
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,400
You paid me good money
to kill the Doc, used your alias.

575
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
The Riddler?

576
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,600
You want me to finish the job or not?

577
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,760
I came to you?

578
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,240
Paid in cash.

579
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Said the Doc was holding you back.

580
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,360
She has to die or you can't be free.

581
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,640
- Oh, God.
- I put myself at great risk for you.

582
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,680
Cops came to my workshop.
I can't go back there.

583
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,560
- My son...
- Let go of him!

584
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Get down, Ed!

585
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,560
What the hell were you thinking
going after him alone?

586
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,560
Well, clearly I wasn't thinking.

587
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,360
Damn it.

588
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,320
Did he say anything
about who hired him?

589
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,440
It was him. All him.

590
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,120
He was a lone wolf.
That's what he said.

591
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,480
He was... he was afraid of what Lee
was gonna do to the Narrows.

592
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,440
Are you sure? His son said
he was talking to somebody

593
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,800
on the phone about the Doc.

594
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,520
He said that he was calling
around trying to get support

595
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,080
but no one helped him,
so he went in alone.

596
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,440
Crazy, crazy loon.

597
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,680
He told you all that?

598
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,920
I see I'm not much of a threat.

599
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,040
I'm so lucky that you came out here.

600
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,160
I don't know what I would've done...

601
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,600
This is Captain Gordon.

602
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,520
I have a suspect down outside

603
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,160
Cherry's Place on State
Street the Narrows.

604
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,440
Send all available units.

605
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Nice job, Ed. I guess.

606
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm back.

607
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Move.

608
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,040
Of all the beer halls in the city?

609
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,840
Who was that, that jerk killed?

610
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,920
A lady.

611
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,040
Very beautiful,

612
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,960
kind, nice lady.

613
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,200
Then I drink to her.

614
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,160
I heard the call on the radio.

615
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,160
Don't worry, we'll get him to talk.

616
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,720
How you've been?

617
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Awesome.

618
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
I missed you.

619
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Is that so?

620
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,440
Well, I haven't missed you.

621
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,240
I haven't missed begging you
not to do something

622
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,240
just to watch you go ahead
and do it anyway.

623
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,360
Haven't missed watching you
bang Falcone's daughter

624
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,560
while she uses you
to get rid of Penguin.

625
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,080
Something's eating at you, Jim.

626
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
I don't know what it is

627
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,840
but you're no good
at keeping secrets.

628
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,960
And you're not gonna feel clean
until you get it off your chest.

629
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,360
You didn't come down here
because you missed me as a cop.

630
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
You came here to confess.

631
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,840
You want me to be your priest,
well, sorry pal.

632
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,240
I'm not interested.

633
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,440
So hit the bricks.

634
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,680
Take that with you.
