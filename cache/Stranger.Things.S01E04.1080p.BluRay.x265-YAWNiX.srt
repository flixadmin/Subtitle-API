1
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,036
This the wall she was
talking about, Chief?

2
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,214
A trooper found
something in the, uh...

3
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,088
water that's at the quarry.

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,421
Our working theory right now
is that Will...

5
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:01,055
crashed his bike, he...
made his way over the quarry and, uh...

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,101
accidentally fell in.

7
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,557
The earth must have given way.

8
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,736
Joyce?

9
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,189
Joyce?

10
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,946
Do you understand what I'm saying?

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,242
No.

12
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,447
Whoever you found...

13
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,032
is not my boy.

14
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,958
- It's not Will.
- Joyce.

15
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,206
No, you don't understand.

16
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,040
I talked to him...

17
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,544
a half hour ago.

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,714
He was...
He was here.

19
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,091
He was...
He was talking with these.

20
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,797
- Talking?
- Uh-huh.

21
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,224
One blink for yes, two for no.

22
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,806
And... And, uh...

23
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:49,766
And then I made this
so he could talk to me.

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,193
'Cause he was hiding...

25
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,362
from that... that thing.

26
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,814
The thing that came out of the wall?

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,114
- The thing that chased you?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,408
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.

29
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,531
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's...

30
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,908
It's after him!

31
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,457
- He's in danger. We have to find him! We...
- What exactly was this thing?

32
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,909
It was some kind of animal, you said?

33
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:08,993
Uh, no, it was...

34
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,330
It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

35
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,464
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,461
It didn't have a face?

37
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,965
- Joyce.
- It didn't have a face...

38
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,345
Joyce, listen to me.

39
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,892
Listen to me.

40
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,059
After Sarah...

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,067
I saw her, too.

42
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,234
And I heard her.

43
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,111
I didn't know what was real.

44
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,363
And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

45
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,490
And I had to pack all that away.

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,789
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...

47
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,662
that I couldn't get out of.

48
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,587
No, you're...
you're talking about grief.

49
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,914
This is different.

50
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,467
- I'm just saying that you...
- No, I know what you're saying, Hop.

51
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,763
I swear to you,
I know what I saw.

52
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,091
And I'm not crazy.

53
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,017
I'm not saying that you're crazy.

54
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,016
No...
You are.

55
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,723
And I understand, but...

56
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,233
God, I...

57
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,902
I need you to believe me.

58
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,031
Please.

59
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,983
Please.

60
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,067
Listen...

61
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,456
I think you should go down to the morgue
tomorrow and see him for yourself.

62
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,408
It'll give you the answers that you need.

63
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,868
- But tonight...
- Oh, God...

64
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,625
I want you to try to get some sleep,
if you can.

65
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,994
<i>Byers's body was found
in the water of this quarry</i>

66
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,170
<i>by state police earlier this evening.</i>

67
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>It was discovered by state trooper
David O'Bannon, just after dark.</i>

68
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,005
<i>The state police
are mounting an investigation</i>

69
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,961
<i>to determine Byers' cause of death,</i>

70
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,421
<i>but an initial inquiry...</i>

71
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,053
Should I go down and talk to Michael?

72
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,307
Give him time.

73
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,138
He'll come to us when he's ready.

74
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,658
Can you please stop that?

75
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,422
Are you deaf?

76
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,675
I thought we were friends, you know?

77
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,593
But friends tell each other the truth.

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,296
And they definitely don't lie
to each other.

79
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,224
You made me think Will was okay,
that he was still out there,

80
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,267
but he wasn't.
He wasn't!

81
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,355
Maybe you thought you were helping,
but you weren't.

82
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,650
You hurt me.
Do you understand?

83
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,985
What you did sucks.

84
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,731
Lucas was right about you.

85
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,741
All along.

86
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,020
Will, is that you? It's Mike!
Do you copy?

87
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,225
Over.

88
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,816
Will, are you there?

89
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,772
Will!

90
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,742
Was that...

91
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,868
Was it...

92
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,836
Will.

93
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,367
Mom...

94
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,666
Mom!

95
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,168
Mom! Wake up.

96
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,295
What... what time is it?

97
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,048
It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.

98
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,471
Go where? Where?

99
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,719
To see Will.

100
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,808
Michael?

101
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,020
Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?

102
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,689
I, uh...

103
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,651
I don't think I can go to school today.

104
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,448
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.

105
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,777
I need to drop off Nance,
then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.

106
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,204
Why don't you grab a book
or something and come with me?

107
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,327
We can stop by the video store
on the way back,

108
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,750
pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.

109
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,579
I think I just want to stay home today.

110
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,129
I mean, if that's okay?

111
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,505
Well, are you sure you're gonna be
all right here by yourself?

112
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,051
I think so.

113
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,005
Okay.

114
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,432
But if you need anything,
call Dad at work.

115
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,384
- Okay.
- Okay.

116
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,350
Bye.

117
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,931
Bye, sweetie.

118
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,779
Lucas, do you copy?

119
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,070
<i>Lucas, come on, I know you're there!</i>

120
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,867
This is urgent.
I'm serious.

121
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,286
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.

122
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,787
Lucas.

123
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,334
Lucas!

124
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,207
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas...

125
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,584
<i>Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas...</i>

126
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,132
Go away, Mike.

127
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,211
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Over and out.

128
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,670
<i>No, not "out."</i>

129
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,222
I'm not messing around, okay?
This is about Will.

130
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,220
<i>- Over.</i>
- What about Will?

131
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,764
You mean about his funeral?
Over.

132
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,971
No, not his funeral.

133
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,555
- Screw his funeral!
- What?

134
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,936
Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.

135
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,312
Over and out.

136
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,443
What's taking so long?

137
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,610
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic
around here without Gary.

138
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,574
Without Gary?

139
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,744
- Where's Gary?
- Well, I thought you knew.

140
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,202
Those men from State, they...
they sent Gary home last night.

141
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,667
So who did the autopsy?

142
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,840
Someone from State.

143
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,820
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

144
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,621
Can you show that to me, please?

145
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,328
How's your mom doing?

146
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know.

147
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,463
How long's this stuff been going on?
With the lights and, uh...

148
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,764
Will and the thing in the wall?

149
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,727
Since the first phone call, I guess.

150
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,393
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

151
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,694
in the past.

152
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,692
But this...

153
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,400
I don't know.

154
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,206
I'm worried it could be...

155
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,205
Ugh, I don't know.

156
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,086
She'll be okay.

157
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,509
We'll be okay.

158
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,259
My mom...

159
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,010
she's tough.

160
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,562
Yeah, she is.

161
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,475
Hey.

162
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,269
She is.

163
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,485
Ma'am!

164
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,111
- Ma'am, I need you to sign!
- I don't...

165
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,991
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

166
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,822
- Joyce, wait a second.
- No!

167
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,033
- Mom!
- Ma'am, I... Ma'am!

168
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,332
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

169
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,792
To look for Barb.

170
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,968
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

171
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,670
That's crazy.

172
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,598
I don't know, I... I was scared.

173
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,301
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

174
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,057
just hanging out in my yard?

175
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,888
I don't think it was a mask.

176
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,769
But he had no face?

177
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,775
I don't know!

178
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,728
I don't know, I just...

179
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,405
I have a terrible feeling about this.

180
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,527
Oh, this is bad.

181
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,153
This is really bad.

182
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,280
What?

183
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,240
The cops...

184
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,077
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

185
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,664
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

186
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,711
- So?
- My parents are gonna murder me!

187
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,752
Are you serious right now?

188
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,925
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

189
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,504
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

190
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,932
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

191
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,930
don't mention the beers.

192
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,807
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

193
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,014
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

194
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,066
I can't believe you right now.

195
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,145
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.

196
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,148
Nancy, wait!

197
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,075
Nancy!

198
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,036
- Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

199
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,535
I need to think.
Just go on home.

200
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,582
Mom, will you just get in, please?

201
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,874
Mom.

202
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,714
Mom!

203
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,172
Mom.

204
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,629
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.

205
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,466
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

206
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,017
- Shut down? What...
- We have to deal with this, Mom.

207
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,766
We have to deal with the funeral!

208
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,312
The funeral?

209
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,312
- For... for who?
- For that thing back there?

210
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,439
Okay, let me get this straight.

211
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,693
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

212
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,614
And there's a monster in the wall?

213
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,191
Do you even hear yourself?

214
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,198
I know it sounds crazy.

215
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,620
I sound crazy!

216
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,493
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

217
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,744
It is crazy!

218
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,667
But I heard him, Jonathan.

219
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,415
He talked to me!

220
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,339
Will is... is calling to me!

221
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,294
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

222
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,344
I don't care if anyone believes me!

223
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:36,017
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

224
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,186
I am going to bring him home!

225
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,060
Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

226
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,642
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

227
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,773
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

228
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,196
All right, show's over.

229
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,240
What?

230
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,337
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

231
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,843
Yeah, I heard a baby.

232
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,968
What?

233
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,892
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

234
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,560
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

235
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,387
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

236
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,768
- That was Will!
- Mike...

237
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,066
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

238
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,359
Words!

239
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,188
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

240
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,489
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess...

241
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,816
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

242
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,900
I don't think it's about that.

243
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,658
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

244
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,410
- Like... like Professor X.
- Yeah.

245
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,163
Are you actually believing this crap?

246
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,122
I don't know, I mean...

247
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,047
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

248
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,340
He sounded a lot like that.

249
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,468
Did you guys not see what I saw?

250
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,796
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

251
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,426
He's dead!

252
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,227
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

253
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,975
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that?

254
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,727
- I just do!
- Then what was in that water?

255
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,897
I don't know!

256
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,192
All I know is Will is alive.

257
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,735
Will is alive!

258
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,153
He's out there somewhere.

259
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,856
All we have to do is find him.

260
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,992
This isn't gonna work.

261
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,949
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

262
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,043
- Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.

263
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,165
The Heathkit's at school.

264
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,500
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

265
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,461
I mean... look at her.

266
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,552
Wow.

267
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,679
- She looks...
- Pretty.

268
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,099
Good.

269
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,475
You look pretty good.

270
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,990
Pretty.

271
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,959
Good.

272
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,838
Clear.

273
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,470
- You boys hear me all right in there?
- Loud and clear, Shepard.

274
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,256
Good luck in there, son.

275
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,321
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,"

276
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,406
bearing us down towards the sea

277
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,242
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

278
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,004
"And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too..."

279
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,543
Nancy Wheeler?

280
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,499
If you'll come with me, please?

281
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,929
This argument
you and Barbara had?

282
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,681
What exactly was it about?

283
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,855
It wasn't really an argument.

284
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,813
Barb just wanted to leave.

285
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,020
I didn't, so, I...

286
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,655
I told her to just go home.

287
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,866
Then what?

288
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,659
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

289
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,617
And the next day, you went back and...

290
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,121
saw a bear, you're thinking?

291
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,835
I don't know what it was, but...

292
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,132
I think...

293
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,219
I think maybe it took Barb.

294
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,592
- You need to check behind Steve's house...
- We did.

295
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,014
There's nothing there.

296
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,808
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.

297
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,056
- What?
- Look.

298
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,354
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

299
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,557
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

300
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,813
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

301
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,360
Leaving town, maybe?

302
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,562
No.

303
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,864
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

304
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,318
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

305
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,619
Uh, Steve Harrington?

306
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,321
What? No!

307
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,579
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

308
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,750
It wasn't like that.

309
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,953
Like what?

310
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,914
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

311
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,748
We... we just talked.

312
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,883
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

313
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,892
So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

314
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,141
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

315
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,472
They're all Staties?

316
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,556
Yes, sir.

317
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,688
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

318
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,566
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

319
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,568
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

320
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,651
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

321
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,576
Considering what?

322
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,781
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

323
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,416
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.

324
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,048
<i>Let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty</i>

325
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,677
<i>and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.</i>

326
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,258
<i>State trooper David O'Bannon,
thank you so much for your help.</i>

327
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,968
<i>- Thank you, sir.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

328
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,833
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

329
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,582
<i>Attention students,</i>

330
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:47,336
<i>there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.</i>

331
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,258
<i>Do not go to fourth period.</i>

332
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,506
It's locked.

333
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,758
- What?
- Hey, do you think you can open it?

334
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,555
With your powers?

335
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,099
Boys?

336
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,221
Hey.

337
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,802
Assembly's about to start.

338
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,604
We know.
We're just, you know...

339
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,477
Upset.

340
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,853
Yeah, definitely upset.

341
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,401
We need some alone time.

342
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,649
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen...

343
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,980
I get it. I do.

344
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,067
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

345
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,567
And then...

346
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,580
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

347
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,078
What do you say?

348
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,660
I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

349
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,421
- Eleven...
- Eleanor! She's my, uh...

350
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,589
- Cousin.
- Second cousin.

351
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,884
She's here for Will's funeral.

352
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,212
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

353
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,342
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

354
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,468
Thank you.

355
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,134
Uh, where are you from exactly?

356
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,595
Bad place...

357
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,396
- Sweden!
- I have a lot of Swedish family.

358
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,893
- She hates it there.
- Cold!

359
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,567
Subzero.

360
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,110
- Shall we?
- Yep!

361
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,905
<i>At times like these...</i>

362
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,827
it is important that we come together
as a community.

363
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,120
We come...

364
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,620
Abort.

365
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,205
We come together to heal...

366
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,836
we come together to grieve...

367
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,882
- You lied to the police!
- I didn't lie!

368
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,214
How naive do you think I am?

369
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,424
You and Steve were just talking?

370
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,804
We slept together!

371
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,102
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

372
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,522
- It does matter!
- No! It is all bullshit!

373
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,816
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

374
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,768
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

375
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,775
I know it!

376
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,902
And no one is listening to me!

377
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,528
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

378
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,326
- I'm listening to you...
- No! You're not!

379
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,405
Nancy... Nancy!

380
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,205
Just leave me alone!

381
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,229
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

382
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,837
Try him again.

383
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,548
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

384
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,220
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

385
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,645
<i>This is Shepard.
Confirming, over.</i>

386
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,518
Shepard.
Where are you?

387
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,026
Can you describe to us
what it is you see? Over.

388
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,984
<i>It's low visibility.
I'm about one click south of the rift.</i>

389
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,570
<i>Everything's still here,
but it's all eroded. Covered in blood...</i>

390
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,077
Shepard? Do you copy?

391
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,328
Shepard?
Can you hear me?

392
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,039
<i>There's something else...
There's something else in here!</i>

393
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,918
Reel him in.

394
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,050
- Reel him back in!
- Get him in.

395
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,506
Come on, come on!
Faster!

396
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,091
<i>There's something else in here!</i>

397
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,268
<i>Pull me out!
Pull me out, pull me out!</i>

398
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,515
<i>Pull me out! Pull me out!</i>

399
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,081
- Shepard, come in. Over.
- Comms are down, sir.

400
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,753
Shepard, come in!
Over.

401
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,120
<i>Will Byers' death
is an unimaginable tragedy.</i>

402
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:14,668
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

403
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:20,249
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

404
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,634
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

405
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,383
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

406
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,090
But before she comes up here,

407
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,848
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

408
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,599
Look at these fakers.

409
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,436
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

410
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,142
What?

411
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,944
Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

412
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,488
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

413
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,736
Oh,
he was such a great student.

414
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:51,117
Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

415
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,788
Mouth breather.

416
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,973
Hey! Hey!

417
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,597
Hey, Troy!

418
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,604
You... you think this is funny?

419
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,102
What'd you say, Wheeler?

420
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,730
I saw you guys
laughing over there.

421
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,937
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

422
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,068
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

423
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,774
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

424
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,861
Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

425
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,912
Will's in fairyland now, right?

426
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,958
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

427
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,535
All happy and gay!

428
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,141
You're dead, Wheeler!

429
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:55,976
Dead!

430
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,652
Dude, Troy peed himself.

431
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,491
Holy shit!

432
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,172
Hey! What's going on here?

433
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,426
Mike! Let's go!

434
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,480
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

435
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,976
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

436
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,734
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

437
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,447
Can you just give me a second?

438
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,577
Of course.

439
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,624
Hey.

440
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,418
Hey.

441
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,960
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

442
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,596
I just...

443
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,177
Can we talk for a second?

444
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,398
It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

445
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,521
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

446
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,149
I don't know.

447
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,446
It's weird.

448
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,156
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

449
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,033
No.

450
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,581
And she was there one second
and then, um...

451
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,204
gone.

452
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,911
I figured she bolted.

453
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,338
The cops think that she ran away.

454
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,334
But they don't know Barb.

455
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,011
And I went back to Steve's...

456
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,761
and I thought I...

457
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,683
saw something.

458
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,055
Some...

459
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,271
weird man or...

460
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,767
I don't know what it was.

461
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,153
I'm sorry.

462
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,156
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

463
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,079
I'm so sorry.

464
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,531
What'd he look like?

465
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,247
What?

466
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,579
This man you saw in the woods.

467
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,622
What'd he look like?

468
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,627
I don't know.

469
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,426
It was almost like he...

470
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,553
he didn't have...

471
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,509
Didn't have a face?

472
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,563
How did you know that?

473
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,245
Aw, come on!

474
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,665
Another, please.

475
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,708
And another for my, uh, friend here.

476
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,753
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

477
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,422
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

478
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,377
My daughter,
she won the spelling bee today.

479
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,711
Is that right?

480
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,297
Yeah, that's right.

481
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,678
"Odontalgia."

482
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:24,681
That was the word.

483
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,558
You know what it means?

484
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,106
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

485
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,067
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.

486
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,443
I've been tryin'
to figure that out for years.

487
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,234
Your daughter, she got a name?

488
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,118
What?

489
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,746
Your daughter?
What's her name?

490
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,502
Sarah.

491
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,997
Her name's Sarah.

492
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,504
To Sarah.

493
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,679
I recognize you.

494
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,014
Are you famous or somethin'?

495
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,401
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh...
I found that Byers boy.

496
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,572
So, you on that case or what?

497
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,320
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

498
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,526
Dumb luck.

499
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,408
So that quarry, that's, uh...

500
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,911
that's state-run,
where they found the boy, huh?

501
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,330
Yeah.

502
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,715
Yeah, well, that's funny.

503
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,044
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact
that it's run by the Sattler Company.

504
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,973
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got
a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

505
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,425
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

506
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,594
That's right.

507
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,813
So why are you lying to me, man?

508
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,234
What's your problem, bud?

509
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,936
I don't have a problem.

510
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,480
I'm just a concerned citizen.

511
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,735
Yeah?

512
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,488
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

513
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,864
The kid is dead.

514
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,115
End of story.

515
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,083
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.

516
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,633
Okay...

517
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,677
Let's try this one more time.

518
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,756
Who told you to be out there?

519
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,590
What were you doing out there?

520
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,144
I don't know!
I don't know. They...

521
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,440
they just told me to call it in
and not let anybody get too close.

522
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,142
Get close to what?

523
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,477
The body.

524
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,150
Who do you work for?

525
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,698
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?

526
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,776
Who is that?

527
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,570
- You're gonna get us both killed.
- Who is that?

528
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,077
Hey! Hey!

529
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,726
Come on!
Come on!

530
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,522
Talk to me!

531
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,895
I know you're here!

532
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,775
Come on.

533
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,783
- Now what?
- She'll find him.

534
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,989
Right, El?

535
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,134
Eleven?

536
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,758
Are you listening?

537
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,677
That man before you...

538
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,395
I need you to find him.

539
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,148
- Hurt him?
- No.

540
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,825
No, I don't want you to hurt him.

541
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,450
I want you to listen to him.

542
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,827
- Listen?
- Yes.

543
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,333
I want you to listen to what he says
and repeat his words back to me.

544
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,920
Just like we used to
with those old nursery rhymes.

545
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,425
Do you remember?

546
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,219
Hmm?

547
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,427
Do you think you can do that for me?

548
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,143
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

549
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,081
<i>Begin.</i>

550
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:58,992
Amulet.

551
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,911
Frigid.

Evolve.

553

Airplane.

554
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,293
Eleven?

555
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,045
Repeat the words.

00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,851

She's doing it.

563
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,407
- She's finding him!
- This is crazy.

564
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,280
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.

565
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,697
Holy...

566
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,831

581
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,376
Can you hear us?
We're here!

582
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,462
<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

583
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,591
Why can't he hear us?

584
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,888
I don't know!

585
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,808
Baby...

How do I get to you?

but it's so dark...</i>

Listen to me!
I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?

598
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,835
But right now, I need you to hide.

599
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,288
Mom, please!

600
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,965
No, no, listen! Listen, I...

601
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,010
I will find you, but you have to run now!

00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,429
Run! Run!

603
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,581
- El, are you okay?
- Oh!

604
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,708
Can you move?

605
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,122
Here, help her up.

606
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,291
This way!

607
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,253
And you're...

608
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,676
Brightening.
Enlarging.

609
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,879
Hmm.

610
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,054
Did your mom say anything else?

611
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:47,138
Like, um,
where it might have gone to, or...

612
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,645
No, just that it came out of the wall.

613
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,032
How long does this take?

614
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,201
Not long.

615
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,081
Have you been...

616
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,999
doing this a while?

617
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,668
What?

618
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:10,995
Photography?

619
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,709
Yeah.

620
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:18,799
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

621
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,929
Talk to them.

622
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,972
I know.
It's weird.

623
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,095
No!

624
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,302
No, it is.

625
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,852
It's just, sometimes...

626
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,564
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

627
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,397
But you capture the right moment...

628
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,653
it says more.

629
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,105
What was I saying?

630
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,740
What?

631
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,113
When you took my picture.

632
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,453
I shouldn't have taken that.

633
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,658
I'm, uh...

634
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,287
I'm sorry.

635
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,670
It's just...

636
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,292
That's it.

637
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,333
That's what I saw.

638
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,804
My mom...

639
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,847
I thought she was crazy

640
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,721
'cause she said...

641
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,519
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

642
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,268
- And if he's alive...
- Then Barbara.

643
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,327
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

644
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,913
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.

645
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,714
I'll just be a minute.

646
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,882
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

647
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,011
Hey, you can't be back here.

648
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,717
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

649
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,723
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

650
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,896
- It's some emergency...
- What the hell are you talking about?

651
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,098
I don't work with O'Bannon.

652
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,979
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

653
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,986
Okay.

654
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,797
