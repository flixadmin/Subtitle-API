00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,487
Nah, john moans on bloody principle.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,650
But if you saw his missus...

168
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,207
Ah...

169
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,769
You have a girl yourself, son?

170
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,690
Perhaps when it suits, Tommy, eh?

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,081
Yeah, well.

172
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,330

173
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,848
- You know, since the war.
-Yeah, well...

174
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,489
A war can change a man.

175
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,049
Speaking for myself, anyways.

176
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,201
Where did you fight, Dad?

177
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,084
Ah, all over, son.

178
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,887
- All over.
-Yeah, all over.

179
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,361
And the salvation of Jesus Christ

180
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,442
spread his light over me.

181
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,121
And as a pilgrim,

182
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,849
I come to visit a new world.

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,441

184
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,088

- Look at that. It's all there.
-Show me.

191
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,481
There's a fortune to be made here.

192
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,771
I'm an old man and my
heart's a battered vessel.

there still beats a fluttering
pulse of a dream.

200

Where I can stand proudly with
my dear children by my side.

201
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,850
And the women there?

202
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,529
Like fresh peaches.

203
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,525
Thou could have a dozen.

204

I don't want to cause any discord

210
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,481
between the brothers. So please,
why don't you talk to Tommy first?

211
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,882
No, now, I'm sick of taking
orders from him.

212
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,689
Tommy's not the only one in the
family with a head for business.

213
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,881

Who's asking?

245
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,761
My name's Burn.

246
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,251
I had word from your man in Camden town
you wanted a parley.

247
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,645
Then parley it is.

248
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,161
Few months ago,

249
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,250
a man named Ryan came to this place with
a view to buying some goods from you.

250
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,529
Mr Ryan met with an accident,
he was shot.

251
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,401
TOMMY: I heard.

252
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,251
BURN: He was a man with a quick mouth.
I know that.

253
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,162
Wondered if he made
any enemies in here?

254
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,526
None that I know of.

255
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,128
Not the kind of place to make enemies.

256
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,726
- All are welcome here, Mr Burn.
-Including Irish?

257
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,209
Oh, especially Irish.

258
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,010
Ryan told you he was a member
of the Irish Republican Army.

259
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,203
Was he still welcome?

260
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,965
Like I say. Any man who buys
beer is welcome.

261
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,849
Perhaps you didn't believe him?

262
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,084
In pubs, sometimes people say things.

263
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,969
Sometimes it's the whisky talking.

264
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,322
It's hard to tell which is which.

265
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,041
As a teetotal man, I find that amusing.

266
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,286
Except when it ends in tragedy.

267
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,169
Would you like some water
and cordial, Mr Bum?

You see, Mr Shelby,

269
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,445
Ryan, for all his quick mouth,
was indeed connected.

270
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,008
Very well connected to our brotherhood.

271
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,411
By membership in blood.

272
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,326

Cordial and water will
be grand, Mr Shelby.

276
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,642
Grace, bring some water and cordial.
Come this way.

277
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,801
Yes, Mr Shelby.

278
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,283

do have the guns,

brought from the factory down the road.

283
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,568
He boasted about a stack
of Lewis machine guns,

284
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,086
and enough belts of ammunition
to hold up God's trousers.

He says only your brothers
know where the guns are kept.

289
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,691
Well, Danny also says he sees German
infantrymen on the back of mill carts.

290
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,362
And he shoots them with his broomstick.

become a burden to me.

was far deeper than your average,

You are one of three shareholders.

652
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,444
Me, you, john.

653
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,450
And according to the law,
we are equal partners.

654
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,689
And it is written in
the paperwork in black and white.

655
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,089
A third, a third, a third.

(TOMMY EXHALES)

657
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,731
But the thing is, uh...

658
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,009
Well, me and john, we quite fancy
splitting your share, so...

659
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,090
just next time, use a gun, man.

660
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,567
(LAUGHS)

661
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,843
Our men at the station tell me
that copper is leaving town.

662
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,565
We're in the clear.

663
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,888
We are on our way
up in the world, brother.

664
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,926
Believe me.
