1
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,265
They've broken through the front lines!

2
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,808
I've lost contact with the capital!

3
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,310
There's too many of them!

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,813
Stand fast!

5
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:06,984
DECEPTICON 1: Finish them!

6
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,206
Where's B-127?

7
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,638
BUMBLEBEE: Sorry I'm late.
I hit a little traffic.

8
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,765
AUTOBOT 1: Get down! Incoming!

9
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:38,849
BUMBLEBEE: Uh, Optimus.

10
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:44,563
DECEPTICON 2: Decepticons, attack!

11
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,901
Autobots, fall back! Get to the tower!

12
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,823
DECEPTICON 3: Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,624
OPTIMUS: Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.

14
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,711
There are other Autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

15
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,297
We must reach them
if we hope to survive.

16
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,799
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

17
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,434
We will fight on.
But we must find refuge first.

18
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,104
I found a planet
that's well hidden. Earth.

19
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,024
You will travel there
and establish a base for us.

20
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,693
Once we've gathered the others,
we'll join you.

21
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,695
You must protect the planet.

22
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:37,533
If the Decepticons find it,
then our people are truly finished.

23
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,076
Now go!

24
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,803
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.

25
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,159
No!

26
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,244
Ow! Ow! Ow!

27
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,537
Okay, okay!

28
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,372
I'm dead already, man!

29
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,875
Oh, not just you.

30
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,293
Being the overachiever that you are,

31
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,170
you managed to get
your whole squad killed, Danny.

32
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,463
Bravo.

33
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:15,756
Come on, man. Those things sting.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,591
- What things? These things?
- Ow!

35
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:18,676
You know, I wouldn't know.

36
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,885
I haven't been hit yet.

37
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,262
Ow! Okay, you know what?

38
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,346
That's too close, man.

39
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,764
You could've taken out an eye.

40
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,808
I got a date tonight, man.
This ain't sexy!

41
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,144
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Ow!

42
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,687
That one was on me.

43
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,564
That's a malfunctioning trigger.

44
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,567
This weapon is just faulty.
Someone is going to get a talking to...

45
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,693
Man, would you stop?

46
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,653
All right, just stop.

47
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,906
I should've
let you die in Grenada.

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,867
If you did, we wouldn't be able
to come to the forest,

49
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,577
run around and play these awesome games.

50
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,911
DANNY: Exactly.

51
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,831
Oh, I hate you.

52
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,168
Wow, man, that hurts. 'Cause I love you.

53
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,004
But you refuse to let it in
'cause you got intimacy issues.

54
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,672
A therapist will probably tell you
you weren't hugged enough as a kid.

55
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,508
- Look, man.
- Danny, I know I look stupid, but...

56
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,553
Hey, yo, take cover!

57
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,859
Danny.

58
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,694
You okay?

59
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,613
Uh, yeah, man.

60
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,909
This is Agent Jack Burns.

61
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,036
I need medical up here now.

62
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,329
We have a projectile strike

63
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,039
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

64
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,999
Multiple injuries.

65
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:37,087
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

66
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,256
SOLDIER: <i>Negative.
There are no live fire drills</i>

67
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,424
<i>in the northwest sector.</i>

68
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,510
What the hell hit us, then?

69
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,899
SOLDIER 1: Target on your right!

70
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:16,085
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

71
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,256
Drive!

72
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,930
There!

73
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,434
What the hell?

74
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,894
Take it down!

75
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,442
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

76
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,611
SOLDIER 2: There it is!

77
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,539
SOLDIER 2:
<i>Target has been located, sir.</i>

78
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,125
Light it up!

79
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,928
Damn it!

80
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,274
Oh, no.

81
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,829
It's going for the mine! Cut it off!

82
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,889
SOLDIER: Move, move!

83
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,736
BUMBLEBEE: Please.

84
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,404
This is a mistake.

85
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,908
Stay cool. Hold your fire.

86
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,993
I don't want to hurt anyone.

87
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,919
Who called in the Air Force?

88
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,966
That's not the Air Force.

89
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,515
Run.

90
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,748
Did you think you could hide?

91
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,468
Now you'll die screaming.

92
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,762
Like your friends!

93
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,467
Tell me where your friends are hiding.

94
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,218
I'll never talk.

95
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,053
Is that right?

96
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,766
Then let's make it official.

97
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,671
B-127...

98
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,966
As a member of the Autobot resistance,

99
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,385
you are a traitor to Cybertron

100
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,805
and are hereby sentenced

101
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,014
to death.

102
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,022
No!

103
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,107
No!

104
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,327
CHARLIE: Ugh.

105
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,537
Shut up.

106
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,967
<i>Sweetness, sweetness
I was only joking</i>

107
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:42,512
<i>When I said by rights
You should be</i>

108
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,891
<i>Bludgeoned in your bed</i>

109
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,187
<i>And now I know how Joan of Arc felt</i>

110
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,191
<i>Now I know how Joan of Arc felt</i>

111
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,652
Morning, Dad.

112
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,195
<i>As the flames rose to her Roman nose</i>

113
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,157
<i>And her Walkman started to melt</i>

114
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,435
<i>Bigmouth, la-da-da da-da</i>

115
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,188
<i>Bigmouth, la-da-da da-da</i>

116
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,773
<i>Bigmouth...</i>

117
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,985
SALLY: No! Don't tickle.

118
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,070
Ow!

119
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:43,699
RON: Uh-oh!

120
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,325
Caught.

121
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,744
Gross, Ron.

122
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,162
Excuse me.

123
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,375
Are those your diving trophies?

124
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,210
Taking up too much space in my room.

125
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,045
You're gonna regret doing that.

126
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,423
Where's breakfast?

127
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,218
Breakfast is conveniently located
in the cupboards and the fridge.

128
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,845
- Ah.
- SALLY: Try to help out...

129
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,971
- Yeah.
- ...a little.

130
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,558
Since I'm such a big kid now, making
my own breakfast and what have you,

131
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,145
you know how I could be
an even bigger help around here, Mom?

132
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,646
If I had a car.

133
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,897
Charlie.

134
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,733
What do you know,
it's my birthday tomorrow,

135
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,985
perfect timing for a large cash gift.

136
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,779
You know, $500 is really
all I need to finish the Corvette.

137
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,199
I don't have $500.
You know how much nurses make.

138
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,536
"Half as much as doctors
for twice the work," right?

139
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,912
Tell you what, kiddo...

140
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,497
I got another job interview tomorrow.

141
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,791
If all goes well,
I'll have you swimming in car parts.

142
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,501
I prefer cash, Ron.

143
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,545
Don't be rude. Feed the dog.

144
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,839
Conan is Otis's dog. Make him do it.

145
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:41,923
OTIS: What?

146
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,969
SALLY: Aw! You look so grown up
in your karate suit.

147
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,764
My baby boy is becoming a man.

148
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,266
Oh, shoot, I'm gonna be late.

149
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,728
Can you drop your brother
at karate on your way to work, please?

150
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,064
Um, I could if I had a car.

151
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,442
Just let him follow you on your bike
So nobody abducts him.

152
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,779
Abducts him?
You just said he's a grown man now.

153
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:07,199
If anyone tries anything,
I will rupture their freaking spleen.

154
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:27,302
<i>And do you feel scared?
I do</i>

155
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,597
<i>But I won't stop and falter</i>

156
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,391
<i>And if we threw it all away</i>

157
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,064
<i>Things can only get better...</i>

158
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,776
- That's two for you guys.
- MAN: Thanks, bro.

159
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,945
All right. Have a good one.

160
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,696
Eat safe.

161
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,956
Excuse me. Hi.
We've never actually met...

162
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,374
Sorry, I can't right now.

163
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,376
Yeah. Oh, okay.

164
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,170
- GIRL: Whoo!
- BOY: Hey, hot dog girl!

165
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,172
CHARLIE: Oh, my God!

166
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,592
I'm so sorry. Oh, God.

167
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,929
Someone's getting fired.

168
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,099
If I had to wear that,
I would pray to be fired.

169
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,308
Good one, Tina.

170
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,355
Let's go.

171
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,358
Oops.

172
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,442
Ooh.

173
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,327
<i>On the street where you live</i>

174
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,080
<i>Girls talk about their social lives</i>

175
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,876
<i>They're made of lipstick
Plastic and paint</i>

176
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,461
<i>A touch of sable in their eyes</i>

177
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,257
<i>All your life
All you asked</i>

178
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,551
<i>When is your Daddy
Gonna talk to you</i>

179
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,513
<i>But we're living
In another world</i>

180
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,765
<i>Tryin' to get
Your message through...</i>

181
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,644
Come on.

182
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,104
CHARLIE: Hey, Uncle Hank.

183
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,523
Are you still working on that damn car?

184
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,609
You still working
on that damn personality?

185
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,696
- What have you got for me?
- Whatever you want.

186
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,449
Russians are gonna
blow us all to hell anyway.

187
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,909
That's the spirit.

188
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,660
BILL: Hey, kid.

189
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,913
Hand me the three-eighths, would you?

190
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,290
- You working on the carburetor?
- BILL: Mmm-hmm.

191
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,546
- You need the half-inch.
- BILL: I said the three...

192
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,089
Huh.

193
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,885
- Thanks, kid.
- Yep.

194
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,854
<i>You saw me standing</i>

195
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:48,401
<i>By the wall corner
Of a main street</i>

196
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,363
<i>Take a chance</i>

197
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:58,036
<i>Like all dreamers
Can't find another way</i>

198
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,414
<i>You don't have
To dream it all</i>

199
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,209
<i>Just live a day...</i>

200
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,798
<i>Don't save a prayer for me now</i>

201
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,335
SHATTER: Where is Optimus Prime?

202
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,587
He survived the fall of Cybertron.

203
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,466
And no rebellion is truly dead
until the leader is vanquished.

204
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,218
So where is he?

205
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:41,222
My name is Cliffjumper,
lieutenant in the Autobot resistance.

206
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,808
My safe return
will be considered...

207
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,643
Wrong answer.

208
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,520
SHATTER: We know he's planning

209
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,064
to establish a base.

210
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,941
Tell us where it is
and we'll let you live.

211
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,694
My name is Cliffjumper,
lieutenant...

212
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,031
<i>Sometimes you wanna go...</i>

213
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,575
CLIFFJUMPER: No.

214
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,203
SHATTER: That's B-127's signal.

215
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,039
- Can you trace it?
- Already did.

216
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:11,252
If you won't tell us where Prime is,
perhaps your young friend will.

217
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,587
Never.

218
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,508
You're a brave warrior.
You deserve a better death.

219
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,010
But then again...

220
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,268
Set course for Earth.

221
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,865
I'll give you thirty bucks
for all of it.

222
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,077
I can get twice that much
for the coil alone.

223
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,162
From who? I'm the only one
that comes in here.

224
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,872
I don't even know how you're still open.

225
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,250
Just take it. Go. My show is on.

226
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,421
Hey, where did you get that Beetle?

227
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,216
I swear to God, ever since they put up
that dumbass tower,

228
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,802
I can't get a signal to watch my shows.

229
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,762
I've got to see what happens
to Alf this week.

230
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,483
CHARLIE: Come on!

231
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,416
Are you kidding me?

232
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,630
Damn it.

233
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,762
I give up.

234
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,892
I can't do this without you.

235
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,686
ALF: <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

236
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,105
<i>Interested in a new Buick?</i>

237
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,732
- KATE: <i>Nice try.</i>
- ALF: <i>All right, I touched.</i>

238
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,025
<i>But I didn't eat.</i>

239
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,486
KATE: <i>And I'm supposed to believe
one of these steaks</i>

240
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,529
<i>just got up and walked away on its own?</i>

241
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,531
ALF: <i>I've seen stranger.</i>

242
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,617
KATE: <i>No dinner for you tonight.</i>

243
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,787
ALF: <i>But I'm starved!
I've been fasting since lunch!</i>

244
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,458
ALF: <i>Well, I did eat that pumpkin.</i>

245
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,355
Happy birthday.

246
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,869
I miss you, Dad.

247
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,122
I think it's too low, honey.

248
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,290
No.

249
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,417
No, I think it goes to that button.

250
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,502
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

251
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,129
I don't know about... Fix it.

252
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,297
Hey.

253
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,716
- Good morning, birthday girl!
- Hi.

254
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,218
You look...

255
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,179
Nice.

256
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,640
SALLY: Happy birthday, baby.

257
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,768
I love you. Come on, open your present.
I'm gonna be late for work.

258
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,854
Thanks, Mom.

259
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,069
Helmet. With...

260
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,737
Daffodils.

261
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,656
So, I keep hearing

262
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,660
about people on mopeds getting run over
and their brains smashed in.

263
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,412
You got to wear this from now on.

264
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,331
I don't care if it's not the law.
It's our law.

265
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,375
Plus, look how cute it is.

266
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,795
Yeah.

267
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,422
SALLY: Happy birthday.

268
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,340
I actually got you
a little gift, too, Charlie.

269
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,802
I mean, it's small,
but, it's from the heart.

270
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,311
A smile is a powerful thing.

271
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,896
It releases endorphins.

272
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,233
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."

273
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,904
You know,
there's a whole chapter in here

274
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,698
about how people who smile more often

275
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,283
actually have more friends.

276
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,285
That's unbelievable.

277
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,579
I really think it's gonna
change your whole outlook

278
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,788
if you smile more often.

279
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,641
I want the Beetle.

280
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,852
- What?
- The yellow Beetle, I want it.

281
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,229
I'll make you a deal.
If I get that thing started, it's mine.

282
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,149
That's no deal.
That's just you taking my car.

283
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,986
If I get it started, I keep it
and I work here every day for a year!

284
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,322
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

285
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,283
I will pick up and organize
every scrap of paper in this place.

286
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,953
I'll even detail your horrible,
disgusting toilets.

287
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,166
Please. It's my birthday.

288
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,293
Sorry, no deal.

289
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,338
'Cause we ain't hiring.

290
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,008
It's yours, kid. Happy birthday.

291
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,137
Thank you.

292
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,183
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

293
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,435
And my toilets are gorgeous.

294
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:37,245
<i>Think about it
There must be higher love</i>

295
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:41,249
<i>Down in the heart or hidden
In the stars above</i>

296
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:46,087
<i>Without it
Life is a wasted time...</i>

297
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,967
CHARLIE: Oh, God, please.

298
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,304
Come on.

299
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,727
Oh, my...

300
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,311
Oh, my God!

301
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,690
Oh, my God, thank you so much!
I love you!

302
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,700
- That thing ain't even safe to drive.
- It's a deathtrap.

303
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,205
She's happy, though.

304
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,043
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

305
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,798
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

306
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,595
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

307
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,851
<i>Where's that higher love
I keep thinking of?</i>

308
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:43,853
Man.

309
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,813
Looks amazing.

310
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,410
What?

311
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,426
Oh, my God.

312
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,035
SALLY: Charlie, what was that noise?

313
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,413
Nothing! I'm fine. Mom, you should
go back to bed. Everything's fine.

314
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,332
- What the hell is that?
- Um, it's...

315
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,294
What is that car doing in our garage?

316
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,503
Car?

317
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,215
Oh, that, uh, car

318
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,759
is my car.

319
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,636
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

320
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,055
It runs. Yeah.

321
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,432
Those aren't safe.

322
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:47,226
I wish you would've told me
before you brought it home.

323
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,978
Okay. Sorry.

324
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,480
Um, I'm in the middle
of some stuff, Mom.

325
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:54,025
Okay, I'll get out of your hair, but...

326
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,278
Tell me things sometime.

327
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,863
- I'm your mother.
- Okay.

328
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,573
Okay.

329
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:01,949
Good night.

330
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,911
- It really runs?
- Yeah, it really runs.

331
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:05,995
SALLY: Cool.

332
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,674
CHARLIE: You still in there?

333
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,596
Okay.

334
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,681
A little jumpy. I'm sorry.

335
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,193
Okay.

336
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,803
Hi.

337
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,359
Oh, God, are you...

338
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,738
Do you speak?

339
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,669
I won't hurt you.

340
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,321
Can you understand me?

341
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,162
What are you?

342
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,540
Where did you come from?

343
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,334
Okay. It's okay.

344
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,887
You like my shirt?

345
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:30,056
You a metal fan?

346
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:31,932
No, wait...

347
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,518
Oh, who? Me?

348
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,812
Who am I?

349
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:39,815
Oh, I'm...

350
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,443
Charlie.

351
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,945
Charlie Watson.

352
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,947
I'm 18.

353
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:48,866
Today.

354
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,160
Actually, it's my birthday today.

355
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,455
What's your name?

356
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,294
You don't know or you don't have a name?

357
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,343
You sound like a little bumblebee.

358
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,389
I'm gonna call you that from now on.

359
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,435
Bumblebee.

360
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,022
Matches your outfit, too.

361
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,175
AMBER: I want a divorce, Roy!

362
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,469
Come on, Amber. Give me one good reason.

363
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,388
You tried to sleep with my sister!

364
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,889
Unsuccessfully!

365
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,392
Yeah, you're unsuccessful at everything.

366
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,061
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

367
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,648
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

368
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:06,068
Now, just settle down
for one second and hear me out.

369
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,739
- What the hell is that?
- What?

370
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,662
Oh, God, Roy, that thing
is coming right for us!

371
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,414
No, no, no, no, no...

372
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,416
Not my car. Not my car.

373
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,668
Please, God, no, not my car!

374
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,639
Oh, thank God, my car.

375
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,725
Yeah, I'm okay.

376
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:41,020
Oh, that's good, baby. That's good.

377
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,772
BOTH: Run. Run!

378
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:56,869
ROY: Oh...

379
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,665
God!

380
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,543
Is that my car?

381
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,589
Hello...

382
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,104
ROY: Jeez!

383
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,522
SHATTER: Earth.

384
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,066
- AMBER: Roy!
- ROY: Oh!

385
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,193
How underwhelming.

386
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,446
The indigenous life
is even more primitive than I expected.

387
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,199
Hey...

388
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,788
Hmm. I like the way they pop.

389
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,248
Focus, comrade.

390
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:47,544
B-127's distress signal came from
the western coast of this continent.

391
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,547
For now, we head west.

392
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:07,106
RON: When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

393
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,691
OTIS: I don't know, but I hope soon.

394
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,277
- Morning! See you guys later.
- Where you off to so fast?

395
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,363
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

396
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,866
Morning...

397
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,453
Bee?

398
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,791
Bee, where are you?

399
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,005
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

400
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,089
Bee!

401
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,757
Where did you go?

402
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,514
Otis!

403
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,183
Have you seen my car?

404
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,435
Unfortunately, yes.

405
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,562
No, have you seen my car today?

406
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,689
It was in the garage. Someone stole it!

407
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,524
No, idiot. Mom took it.

408
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,109
She had to bring Conan to the vet

409
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,986
because he swallowed, like,
a rubber glove or something

410
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,738
and Ron needed the station wagon.

411
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,197
Thank God.

412
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,035
Wait.

413
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,792
Hi. Excuse me. It's me again.

414
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,961
- We never officially met, but...
- I can't right now. Sorry.

415
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,296
Nope. Yep.

416
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,922
Okay.

417
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,636
SALLY: I know, buddy. Hang in there.

418
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,141
You can't eat everything you see.

419
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:27,394
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

420
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,232
Oh, my God. Stop it! Don't do that!

421
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,821
Bee, no!

422
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,536
- Mom?
- Whoa!

423
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,915
Jesus! Charlie, what are you doing?

424
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,333
Mom, you gotta pull over.

425
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,294
- What the hell is going on?
- Just pull the car over.

426
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:55,047
SALLY: Okay, okay. All right.

427
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:01,678
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?

428
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,389
SALLY: You almost gave me
a heart attack.

429
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,765
I thought I was being carjacked.

430
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,600
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

431
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,852
I can't believe you would
take him without me.

432
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,604
Mom, I'm so worried about him!

433
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,314
He's my dog, too, you know.

434
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:14,942
What happened to Conan being Otis's dog?

435
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,944
Mom,
you're being hysterical, okay?

436
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,071
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

437
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,948
I know how you get during emergencies.

438
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:22,950
I'm a nurse.

439
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,120
Not of animals.

440
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:33,836
Oh, okay. I'm happy for you to drive.

441
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,088
You weren't wearing your helmet,
by the way.

442
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,631
- I saw that.
- Oh, shoot.

443
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,177
Keep it together, Bee.

444
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,811
Sir?

445
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,063
Sir.

446
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,566
I thought you'd want
to see this immediately.

447
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,322
- They sure?
- SIMMONS: Yes, sir.

448
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,241
Two of them just made contact in Texas.

449
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,577
Intel says they're heading west fast.

450
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,287
Saddle up, Simmons.

451
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,789
We're going to Texas.

452
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,502
CHARLIE: Okay, Bee,
we need to go over a few things.

453
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,218
Okay. We're all clear.

454
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,849
All right.
I'm re-thinking the beach.

455
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:29,933
Ugh.

456
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:32,936
Oh, I'm good.

457
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,980
No, I'm good, thanks.

458
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,903
People can be terrible about
things they don't understand.

459
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,697
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

460
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,157
and cut you into tiny little pieces.

461
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:48,243
It'll be bad, trust me.

462
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,542
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

463
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,671
So let's practice. You ready?

464
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,965
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

465
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,471
Great. Perfect.
Come back now.

466
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,476
Okay, so let's say
we're driving and all of a sudden...

467
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:15,062
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, Bee, hide!

468
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,909
You serious?

469
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,249
Bee, it's too late. You're already dead.

470
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:40,671
It's all right.

471
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,757
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.

472
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:48,262
PILOT: <i>Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i>

473
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,699
The goal, sir, should be
to communicate with them.

474
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,785
First contact with an alien species.

475
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,372
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

476
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,625
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

477
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,227
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.

478
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:40,897
Not yet. B-127's signal has gone silent.

479
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,734
I have an idea.

480
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,530
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns
and this is Dr. Powell.

481
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,367
We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

482
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,036
So state your business.

483
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,246
SHATTER: People of Earth,

484
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,334
we are Decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

485
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,918
DROPKICK: What are you doing?

486
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,087
This is humiliating.

487
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,674
We believe a dangerous criminal
from our world

488
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:10,844
is hiding somewhere on yours.

489
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,512
How is it you think we can help?

490
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,433
We need your eyes.

491
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,352
Wait.

492
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,812
You want access to our satellites?

493
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:23,273
SHATTER: Our scanners' range is limited.

494
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,693
Your infrastructure is primitive.

495
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:30,530
But combined,
they could be quite powerful.

496
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,240
No way! Out of the question!

497
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,202
We have a common enemy, Agent Burns.

498
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,704
There's a war raging on our planet.

499
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:42,459
If B-127 isn't found,
that war may find its way here.

500
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,877
Perhaps...

501
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,214
We can find a way to help one another.

502
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,758
We'll talk it over with our superiors.

503
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,636
In the meantime, if you could follow us.

504
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,263
Very well, friend Powell.

505
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,265
Take us to your leader.

506
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,821
CHARLIE: Must suck being cooped up
in a VW all day, huh?

507
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,825
Is there anyone that can help you?

508
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,368
Do you have a family?

509
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,496
You know, like a mom, dad, siblings?

510
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,831
You all love each other?

511
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,793
Or drive each other crazy

512
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,587
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

513
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,595
Do you want me to see if I can fix it?

514
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,516
I'll be gentle, I promise.

515
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,777
Whoa.

516
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:55,907
You lay down, okay?

517
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,746
Hold still.

518
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,333
I think maybe there's something...

519
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,683
OPTIMUS:
<i>B-127, I pray this message finds you.</i>

520
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:25,854
<i>Our war rages on.</i>

521
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:27,522
<i>...planet Earth...</i>

522
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:29,983
<i>...survival...</i>

523
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,594
DECEPTICON: Ravage, eject!

524
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,947
OPTIMUS: <i>...your mission...</i>

525
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,365
<i>...soldier...</i>

526
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:19,616
<i>I..</i>

527
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,413
Are you okay?

528
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,835
Who was that?

529
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,046
That voice said something about a war.

530
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:35,966
Do you remember anything?

531
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:43,473
Is the VW Beetle some kind of disguise?

532
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,726
Are you hiding from something?

533
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,189
Are you scared?

534
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,120
CHARLIE: It's broken.

535
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,415
It's okay.

536
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,417
I think I can help.

537
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,628
Let's go home.

538
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,926
ALLISON: <i>...and a basket case,</i>

539
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:22,262
CLAIRE: <i>a princess...</i>

540
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:23,597
- JOHN: <i>And a criminal.</i>
- CHARLIE: All right, I'm almost done.

541
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,473
BRIAN:
<i>Does that answer your question?</i>

542
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,267
CHARLIE: No way.

543
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,476
Are you actually watching it?

544
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,228
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

545
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:32,772
<i>Don't, don't, don't...</i>

546
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:34,691
You can pop in another one if you want.

547
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,328
CHARLIE'S DAD:
<i>Whoo! Come on, sweetie!</i>

548
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,164
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

549
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,586
<i>All right, Charlie girl!</i>

550
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,505
<i>Hello, Brighton Falls.</i>

551
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,382
<i>This is Charlie Watson,
future Olympic gold medalist.</i>

552
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:00,967
<i>That was so perfect.</i>

553
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,969
- <i>Thanks, Dad.</i>
- CHARLIE'S DAD: <i>How do you feel?</i>

554
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:04,804
CHARLIE: No, no,
why would you play this?

555
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,185
Sorry. I just...

556
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,354
I finished.

557
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,902
Let's see if we got something.

558
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:23,239
Okay.

559
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:33,917
Okay.

560
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,169
All right.

561
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:43,802
Oh, my God, yes!

562
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,595
It worked!

563
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,889
Look at you go.

564
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,058
You got some moves.

565
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:00,568
CHARLIE: You know, Bee, music can
help you say what you're feeling.

566
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:07,409
You're gonna love this. It's brand new.

567
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:16,084
<i>Girlfriend in a coma, I know</i>

568
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:19,212
<i>I know, it's serious</i>

569
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:22,841
Not a Smiths fan.

570
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,385
Okay, um...

571
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,846
Here.

572
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:29,848
Try this.

573
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,392
<i>Never gonna give you up...</i>

574
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,064
Fine.

575
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,235
Okay, where's my Stevie Nicks?

576
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,781
Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.

577
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,075
Stones.

578
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,662
Hey, hey,
please don't touch those. Please.

579
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,336
They belonged to my dad.

580
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:20,440
Do you want to hear it?

581
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,507
We used to listen to this
while we'd work on the Corvette.

582
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:50,178
<i>Oh, my love,
My darling...</i>

583
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,597
It was his favorite.

584
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,518
<i>I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time</i>

585
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,270
He used to say
it would make the car feel better.

586
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:04,943
<i>Time...</i>

587
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,403
<i>...goes by so slowly</i>

588
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,284
We used to work on this car
every weekend together.

589
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:16,538
<i>And time can do so much</i>

590
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:19,624
It was our thing.

591
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,210
<i>Are you still mine?</i>

592
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,005
That tape...

593
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:28,591
<i>I need your love</i>

594
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,053
That was the last time I saw him.

595
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:34,472
<i>I need your love</i>

596
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,017
He died of a heart attack.

597
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,811
<i>God speed your love to me</i>

598
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,230
I never got to say goodbye.

599
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,611
You know,
I always thought if I could just

600
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,073
finish fixing this car...

601
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:55,201
<i>Lonely rivers flow
to the sea, to the sea</i>

602
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,830
If I could just get it
to start up again,

603
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,958
he would hear me.

604
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,087
He would hear me.

605
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,344
<i>Oh, my love...</i>

606
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:46,336
I say this with all due respect.

607
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,213
Have you lost your damn mind?

608
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,839
That was with all due respect?

609
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:51,257
GENERAL WHALEN:
The man's got a point, Doctor.

610
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:54,928
Our satellite network is at
the forefront of our national defense.

611
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:58,514
Sir, please. It could be
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

612
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,350
Can you imagine the advances

613
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,435
an alliance with these creatures
might bring?

614
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,563
I imagine the advances.
An advance on Washington.

615
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,608
- New York. An advance on Chicago!
- That's not gonna happen.

616
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,361
They literally
call themselves "Decepticons."

617
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,904
That doesn't set off any red flags?

618
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,406
Enough! From both of you.

619
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:16,783
DR. POWELL: Sir,

620
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:21,287
we're talking about the most advanced
robotic system ever seen.

621
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,498
If we tell them no,

622
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:26,960
they'll just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

623
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,215
Do you really want to go down in history
as the man who cost us the Cold War?

624
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,885
Fine.

625
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,389
We'll help them find their fugitive.

626
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,724
And when it's done,

627
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,810
you can do all
the experiments you want. Hmm?

628
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,981
Yes, sir.

629
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,151
DR. POWELL: Gentle... Uh, Robots.

630
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,738
Welcome to Sector 7.

631
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:59,450
DROPKICK: How kind of you
to finally allow us in.

632
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:02,412
We're very happy
to have you here as friends.

633
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,455
Thank you, friend Powell.

634
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:08,501
My superior has agreed to grant you
limited access to our satellites.

635
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:13,840
In addition, you're welcome to use
all of our technology here.

636
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:16,926
It's the largest super-array
of Crays on Earth.

637
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,262
We thank you for your hospitality.

638
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:24,225
Tell me, those vocal
communication devices you use,

639
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,269
do they function worldwide?

640
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:29,105
The telephones? Yes, why?

641
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:36,654
You got to pick a station, man.

642
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:38,197
I know there's a lot of choices.

643
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:39,824
"You want to go
on a date with me, maybe?"

644
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:42,785
Okay, uh...

645
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,247
What are you trying to do?

646
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,623
Here we go. Here we go.

647
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,668
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.

648
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:53,254
Okay, you're a nerd, but just don't
let her see that you're nerdy.

649
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,298
Excuse me. Sorry to barge in. I just...

650
00:52:58,176 --> 00:52:59,469
CHARLIE: Um...

651
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,095
Do you, just...

652
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,097
CHARLIE: No, no, it's fine! Just...

653
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:06,225
Just sit down, please?
Shh, don't scream, okay?

654
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:08,102
What is that?

655
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:09,896
It's okay, okay? Just breathe. Breathe.

656
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,857
- First of all, hi.
- Hi.

657
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,068
I'm Charlie.

658
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,652
I'm Memo, hi.

659
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,654
Hi, Memo. Um...

660
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,324
It's nice to meet you.

661
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,117
Pleasure... Pleasure...

662
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:26,621
Look, I know what you saw
was a little crazy. I can explain.

663
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,375
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

664
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,126
If you tell anyone what you just saw,

665
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,045
I'm gonna have to
run you over with my car.

666
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:37,548
Jeez.

667
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,758
That was...

668
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,301
I don't mean that in a mean way.

669
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:41,969
Okay? What I'm saying

670
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,598
is no one can know
what you just saw, okay?

671
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:48,810
You promise?

672
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,396
Yeah.

673
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,605
Okay.

674
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,315
Okay.

675
00:53:57,652 --> 00:54:00,029
Bumblebee, you can come out now.

676
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,996
What?

677
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,456
It's, uh...

678
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,125
He.

679
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:13,334
Wow.

680
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:22,093
He's been going up and down on that dial
all day today and I don't know why.

681
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,639
- Hey, check out his reflexes.
- What?

682
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,351
Oh! Oh, God!

683
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:31,811
- Yo, give me your shirt.
- Huh?

684
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,187
Give me your shirt.

685
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,564
You mean the shirt that I'm wearing?

686
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,190
Yes, yes! Come on.
I'll give it back to you.

687
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:37,483
Okay.

688
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,819
Come on! Give me your shirt!

689
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:46,909
All right.

690
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:55,168
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, no, no!
You don't need to do this.

691
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,670
- Yes, I do.
- No, but...

692
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:00,173
- Come here. Come on!
- No, I get it. I get it!

693
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:02,049
Whoo-hoo!

694
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:03,926
Oh.

695
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,095
<i>There's a room
where the light won't find you</i>

696
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:08,931
Sorry.

697
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,393
I know I promised you,
but, yeah, you're not getting that back.

698
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,108
<i>So glad we've almost made it</i>

699
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:24,113
<i>So sad they had to fade it</i>

700
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:28,367
<i>Everybody wants
to rule the world...</i>

701
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,624
DR. POWELL: It's incredible!

702
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,628
They're combining
our technology seamlessly.

703
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,130
Satellites, phones, computers.

704
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,760
<i>They're creating
an interconnected web of information.</i>

705
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,471
Volumes of data at their fingertips.

706
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,556
It's revolutionary.

707
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,934
He's a weird guy.
You ever notice that about Powell?

708
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:56,437
DR. POWELL: They're
tracking fluctuations in Energon levels.

709
00:55:56,521 --> 00:56:00,024
It's like a heat signature
specific to their species.

710
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,526
<i>It's astonishing.</i>

711
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,694
<i>It's beautiful. It's...</i>

712
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:05,738
Hello? Hello?

713
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:10,076
You've given them our satellites,
our comms, God knows what else.

714
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,287
Yet in the space of a day
they've given us a way

715
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:17,833
to not only hunt down B-127,
but all of them.

716
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,922
Let them finish what they're doing.
Let them find B-127.

717
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,384
And then I'll give you permission
to destroy them all.

718
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,553
Use them for spare parts.

719
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,222
Sir, yes, sir.

720
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,059
MEMO: So you have no idea
where he came from?

721
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,310
CHARLIE: No idea.

722
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,646
You thought about calling the cops?

723
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,274
What are they gonna do, Memo?

724
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,276
They're just gonna
send him away to a lab

725
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,361
and do weird science experiments on him.

726
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,696
<i>Weird Science!</i>

727
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,448
<i>Plastic tubes and pots and pans...</i>

728
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:51,242
You're getting pretty good

729
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,493
with that radio dial, Bee.

730
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:55,037
Yeah, D.J. Bumble in the house!

731
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,248
<i>I can't live without my radio</i>

732
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,961
Is that why you're always
messing with the dial?

733
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,630
You're trying to teach
yourself how to talk, aren't you?

734
00:57:04,714 --> 00:57:07,925
<i>Walk like a man
Talk like a man...</i>

735
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:09,594
No way.

736
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:12,138
Oh, my God, Bee, you're a genius!
You're an actual genius!

737
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,776
- What is going on here?
- MEMO: That's Jim from sixth period.

738
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,112
He said
he was busy this week.

739
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,573
You want to check it out?

740
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:35,911
- This is pretty cool.
- Okay.

741
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:37,788
Bee, we'll be right back.

742
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:39,874
Don't do anything crazy.

743
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,793
MAN 1: Hey, everybody, come watch!
Tripp's gonna jump!

744
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:43,961
WOMAN 1: You're off your nut.

745
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,046
MEMO: What's going on over there?

746
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,130
WOMAN 1: Don't do it, dude,
you're crazy.

747
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,590
TRIPP: Come on,
it's not that big a jump.

748
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,592
CHARLIE: God, is that Tripp Summers?

749
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,177
Oh, you know Tripp?

750
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:54,096
I mean, yeah. I spilled a gallon
of lemonade on him once.

751
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,433
Doesn't anyone have the balls
to jump off this thing with me?

752
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:00,603
Ah!

753
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,230
A brave volunteer.

754
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,650
Yeah, I... See, I didn't...
I didn't do that. I didn't actually...

755
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,360
<i>You got the touch</i>

756
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:13,699
<i>You got the power</i>

757
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,534
<i>Yeah</i>

758
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:18,204
Hey, I know you.

759
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,873
Uh... No, sorry about that. It...

760
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,042
You were on the dive team
with my little sister.

761
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,211
I saw you win state a couple years ago.

762
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,881
- Oh. Uh, yeah.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

763
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:30,758
This just got
a whole lot more interesting.

764
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:34,053
We have a championship
high-diver on our hands!

765
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,308
Yeah, I actually, I don't, I don't...

766
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,559
I don't do it anymore.

767
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,978
Oh, don't worry.
I won't make you go first.

768
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:49,527
MAN 2: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Watch it!

769
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,736
Yeah, Tripp!

770
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,740
- WOMAN 2: Yeah!
- MAN 3: Yeah!

771
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:00,579
Dive Girl!
You better not back out on me.

772
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:09,004
TRIPP: You guys, she's gonna do it!
She's gonna do it!

773
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:13,217
ALL: Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

774
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,261
Come on!

775
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:19,390
ALL: Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

776
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,852
CHARLIE'S DAD:
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

777
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:35,072
- MAN 1: Where you going?
- WOMAN 1: What, are you scared?

778
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:36,532
- You okay?
- CHARLIE: Let's just go.

779
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,075
WOMAN 1: What a loser!

780
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:39,702
MAN 1: Thought you said
you were on the diving team.

781
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,163
WOMAN 1: I think she's
gonna cry in her car.

782
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:46,125
Where you going, sweetie?

783
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,093
What happened out there?

784
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:58,387
That was your big moment to look cool.

785
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,930
What's your damage, Tina?

786
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,390
Is that the churro guy?

787
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:02,975
Where's your hairnet, dude?

788
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:06,061
It's in the garbage, Einstein.
You throw them away after each use.

789
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:09,315
For sanitary purposes, obviously, but...

790
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,318
TINA: This car is an embarrassment.

791
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,696
You should have your dad
buy you a better one.

792
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:20,743
Oh, wait...

793
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,078
Sorry.

794
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,597
You okay?

795
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,265
I'm fine.

796
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:44,934
They're idiots.

797
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:48,729
But I think I know something
that'll make you feel better.

798
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:50,815
What?

799
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:52,983
Revenge.

800
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:55,653
I don't want revenge.

801
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,112
I do.

802
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:59,448
What about you, Bee? Want some revenge?

803
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:00,866
<i>I just want...</i>

804
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,286
<i>Revenge!</i>

805
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:06,205
<i>I'm mad</i>

806
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,916
Come on. I got an idea.

807
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:12,670
CHARLIE: This is Tina's house.

808
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:16,549
CHARLIE: And this, it's toilet paper.

809
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:18,300
You use it for when you...

810
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,886
Here, just take a roll.

811
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:28,352
No, no, no, no. You've got...

812
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,521
You got to throw it.

813
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:33,440
Like this.

814
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,362
Not bad.

815
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,751
Not... Yeah, um...

816
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,504
Okay, look, Bee, you be our egg man.

817
01:01:55,588 --> 01:01:57,548
- Right? Yeah. So...
- Love that.

818
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,301
- You see these right here?
- Mmm-hmm.

819
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,639
You grab one of these, like so.

820
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,766
And that right there,

821
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,101
- that's your target.
- That's right.

822
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,312
MEMO: All right?
Just throw it like this.

823
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:14,648
CHARLIE: I think we could
just hand it to him...

824
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:15,900
He could maybe, yeah, and then...

825
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,360
CHARLIE: Uh...

826
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,532
- Bee, what are...
- What, um...

827
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,083
Don't hurt me.

828
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:35,252
Oh, my God...

829
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,384
Oh, shit!

830
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,807
- Hide, hide, hide.
- Hide!

831
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,686
- Stay...
- MEMO: Oh, okay!

832
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,021
Okay. Okay.

833
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,439
Hide, Bee!

834
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,786
CHARLIE: Go, go, go!

835
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,551
Mom!

836
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,944
That was insane!

837
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,779
My heart right now

838
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:44,863
is going crazy.

839
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:46,323
Uh-oh!

840
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,867
- Oh, God.
- Stop the car, please.

841
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,162
Bee, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

842
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:56,750
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

843
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,298
Bumblebee!

844
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,261
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

845
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:14,727
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

846
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:21,900
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

847
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,235
CHARLIE: Oh, my God!

848
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:30,159
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

849
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,914
Oh, my God, we're committing a felony!

850
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:39,835
<i>When I drive that slow, you know
it's hard to steer</i>

851
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:44,548
We got a yellow vehicle

852
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:47,051
driving its damn self
through the Pico Tunnel.

853
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,641
<i>"We're gonna throw your ass
in the city joint"</i>

854
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,352
<i>Looked me in the eye
Said, "You get my point?”</i>

855
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:58,812
Uh...

856
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,981
<i>I said yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

857
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,470
Good night.

858
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:36,809
Good night.

859
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:47,986
Good night, Bee.

860
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,919
Morning, buddy.
I got to go to work, okay?

861
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:08,507
Bee. Listen to me.
You need to stay in this garage, okay?

862
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,800
After what happened last night,

863
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,802
I'm pretty sure the cops
are looking for you,

864
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,513
and, uh, you don't exactly blend in.

865
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:17,266
I'll be back, all right?

866
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,062
Here.

867
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,691
You can have my Pop-Tart.

868
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:41,290
I need you to go to the frozen
banana stand and steal some sticks.

869
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,750
We're out of sticks.

870
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,211
Can't we just sell the
hot dogs without the sticks?

871
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:47,838
No.

872
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:29,082
- What's happening here?
- We got a hit, I think.

873
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,167
Where's that location?

874
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,503
Near San Francisco.
A coastal town named Brighton Falls.

875
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:54,358
You have a personal call.

876
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,989
- Hello?
- <i>Charlie, hey, it's Memo.</i>

877
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,575
You got to come home right now.

878
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,168
It's bad. It's really, really bad.

879
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,925
Where's Bumblebee?

880
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:29,184
Bumblebee, what have you done?

881
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,144
What were you thinking? What...

882
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,231
I told you to hide in the garage!

883
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:37,401
Great.

884
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:39,486
Helpful shame spiral, Bee.

885
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,866
I'm not mad, okay? This is all my fault.

886
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,952
I never should have left you.

887
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,625
MEMO: Hey, okay,
maybe don't transform all the way?

888
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,877
We've still got
to get you through the door.

889
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:58,505
Come on, buddy.

890
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,841
It's okay.

891
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,445
I am so screwed.

892
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,586
And now you're crippled for life.

893
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:39,212
Honey, watch the hair.

894
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:48,013
Go. Now. But be quiet.

895
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:49,389
Mom, wait!

896
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,059
Oh, my God!

897
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,731
- CHARLIE: Mom...
- SALLY: What happened?

898
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,774
CHARLIE: I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

899
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:01,359
What'd you do to my TV?

900
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:02,986
Look, Mom, I can explain.

901
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:04,988
We will talk about this later,
all right?

902
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:06,948
- Now, I have to go.
- SALLY: Are you kidding me?

903
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:08,658
No. You're not going anywhere.

904
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,577
It's about my car.
It's really important.

905
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,703
About your car?

906
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:15,832
That you spend all day and night shut in
that garage, doing God-knows-what with?

907
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,959
Mom, I can't. I really can't right now.

908
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:20,253
Oh, no, you really can, Charlie.

909
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:22,297
You really can.

910
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,381
I have had it!

911
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:26,218
Your attitude,
your always sulking around.

912
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:29,763
You brought home that piece of crap
without even asking me!

913
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,807
Everyone in this family
is trying to be happy,

914
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,310
and all you want to do
is make things harder.

915
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,312
You know, Mom,
just because you've moved on

916
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,148
and you're happy with your
new life doesn't mean I have!

917
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,485
You've found a replacement
for my dad and I haven't,

918
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:44,653
okay, and I never will!

919
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,863
So I'm sorry if that
makes things harder,

920
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:48,573
but in ten months from now

921
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,534
you won't even have to deal with me!

922
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,703
Charlie!

923
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,131
Hey, you okay?

924
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,968
Yeah.

925
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,806
I just feel like ever since my dad died,

926
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,850
I've become this drain on everyone,
and I hate it.

927
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,853
It's like everybody expects me

928
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:20,981
to act like nothing ever happened,

929
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,358
and it's impossible to do that.

930
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:28,780
About your dad, I'm really sorry.

931
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:30,490
Thanks.

932
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,077
You know,
there's this quote that I like.

933
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,165
"The darkest nights
produce the brightest stars."

934
01:13:43,545 --> 01:13:44,879
That's nice.

935
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,674
My mom got it from Weight Watchers.

936
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,191
Get out and move away from the vehicle.

937
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:07,986
Stay cool, Bee.

938
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:18,413
What's going on?

939
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:20,874
Hey!

940
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,459
- Come on!
- CHARLIE: Stop it!

941
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:24,461
Let go of me!

942
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,006
- Weapons now! Take it down!
- Run!

943
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:29,924
No, don't run. Do not run!

944
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:34,846
She ran.

945
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,080
Please tell me they're on our side.

946
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:14,761
SHATTER: No more running.

947
01:15:15,095 --> 01:15:16,805
No more hiding.

948
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:25,355
B-127, you're a traitor and a coward.

949
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,816
Tell us where Optimus Prime is hiding.

950
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:32,904
Bee, look out!

951
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:36,282
DROPKICK: Why isn't he fighting back?

952
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,284
DROPKICK: Why don't you fight?

953
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,161
Leave him alone! Please!

954
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,166
Again.

955
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,921
Hit it again!

956
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:52,966
Stop! Stop it!

957
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,458
AGENT BURNS: Your daughter
stole government property, Mrs. Watson.

958
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,835
SALLY: She's been
having trouble adjusting,

959
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,463
but we had no idea it was this serious.

960
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:32,756
I...

961
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:34,174
Charlie. Honey.

962
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,968
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

963
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:38,720
- "He?"
- AGENT BURNS: Ma'am.

964
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,222
I can assure you that it is an "it".

965
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:43,391
And "it" is a highly dangerous
war machine.

966
01:16:43,475 --> 01:16:46,561
No, he isn't, okay, Mom?
He's not some "war machine."

967
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,606
I don't know what he is, but...

968
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,274
He's my friend.

969
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,319
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic experience today.

970
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,738
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she's seen.

971
01:16:56,905 --> 01:16:58,198
She's disoriented.

972
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,784
No, I'm fine, Mom.
I'm completely fine, okay?

973
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,620
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

974
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:05,872
Stop! Just go to your room.

975
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,964
RON: When I was going through puberty,

976
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:17,967
I stole things, too.

977
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:21,179
- Stole a box of Mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

978
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:05,890
OTIS: Boom.

979
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:08,393
Caught you.

980
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:10,478
Oh, Mom's gonna love this.

981
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:12,272
Look, Otis, you need to go home and...

982
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,898
Mom!

983
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:15,525
No, Otis, stop it!

984
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:16,776
Why would you do that?

985
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,861
Let go of me!

986
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:19,445
You're touching my buttocks!

987
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:22,323
I will tell you a secret if you shut up.

988
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:27,328
Okay, so, um, this is my room.

989
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:29,163
Just make yourself at home.

990
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:31,291
These are actually my sister's stuff.

991
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,168
She likes playing pranks,
like putting her stuff over here.

992
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,504
- CHARLIE: Can I, uh, sit down?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

993
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:38,089
REPORTER: <i>Residents of
Brighton Falls have been witness</i>

994
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,592
<i>to an unusual sight this evening.</i>

995
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:43,970
<i>Armed Forces pouring into town
as part of what we are told</i>

996
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,848
<i>is a routine military exercise</i>

997
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:49,767
<i>setting up camp
at our own McKinnon Air Base.</i>

998
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:52,520
If Bumblebee's still alive,
that's where they're keeping him.

999
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:54,981
We have to go.
We have to try and save him.

1000
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,691
Count me in. I'll take point.

1001
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,444
- No, you won't.
- Come on.

1002
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:00,612
No, Otis.

1003
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:03,239
- But I can help. Master Larry says I...
- I need someone here.

1004
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,533
I need someone reliable to make sure

1005
01:19:05,617 --> 01:19:07,076
that Mom and Ron
don't know that I'm gone.

1006
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:08,953
I'm someone reliable.

1007
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:12,081
Hell, yeah, you are.

1008
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:18,254
Good luck.

1009
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:20,006
You, too.

1010
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,758
Get over here.

1011
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:27,931
Oh.

1012
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:29,223
Let's do this.

1013
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:32,936
SHATTER: Tell us where

1014
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,938
Optimus Prime and the rebels are hiding,

1015
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:37,732
and we can end this war.

1016
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:41,027
Talk!

1017
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,321
DR. POWELL: Who is Optimus Prime?

1018
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:45,657
SHATTER: This doesn't
concern you, human Powell.

1019
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,242
Last chance.

1020
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,292
MEMO: Are you sure this is a good idea?

1021
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,504
CHARLIE: It's a terrible idea,
but I've got to try it.

1022
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,714
MEMO: You can't get... Well,
why don't you... Stop, stop, wait...

1023
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:05,093
- How'd you know the power was off?
- CHARLIE: I didn't. Let's go.

1024
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,058
DROPKICK: Can I?

1025
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,227
SHATTER: His memory cells are fried.

1026
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,104
Finish him.

1027
01:20:22,944 --> 01:20:27,824
OPTIMUS: <i>We will fight on.
Regroup, rebuild, and retake our home.</i>

1028
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:30,118
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

1029
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,120
<i>You will travel to Earth.</i>

1030
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:34,747
<i>Once we've gathered the others,
we'll join you.</i>

1031
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,250
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

1032
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:42,463
<i>If the Decepticons find it,
then our people are truly finished.</i>

1033
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,549
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

1034
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,135
<i>I am coming.</i>

1035
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,222
Prime is coming here?

1036
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,599
They're all coming here.

1037
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:57,979
This is our chance to wipe out
the Autobot resistance for good.

1038
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:01,149
We'll burn the whole planet to cinders.

1039
01:21:01,816 --> 01:21:04,027
SHATTER: We must get word
to Cybertron immediately.

1040
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,194
<i>This is Burns.</i>

1041
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:07,155
Tell them to bring an army.

1042
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,074
Burns, we made
a terrible mistake.

1043
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:11,451
Powell?

1044
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,245
And thanks to our human allies,

1045
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:16,622
I know just how to get the message home.

1046
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:18,458
They're using our satellites.

1047
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,460
<i>They're calling an army.</i>

1048
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,003
They're gonna kill us all.

1049
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:27,550
Thank you for your hospitality,
friend Powell.

1050
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,302
He's all yours.

1051
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,721
- No.
- AGENT BURNS: <i>Powell?</i>

1052
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,347
- DR. POWELL: <i>You have to stop them!</i>
- Powell!

1053
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,479
RON: Where's the Krazy Glue?

1054
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,856
What, did she cut the wire to the TV?

1055
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:43,566
Ron.

1056
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,985
Charlie!

1057
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:47,320
Charlie!

1058
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,782
Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

1059
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,326
Where is your sister?

1060
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:57,914
Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

1061
01:21:57,997 --> 01:22:01,292
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

1062
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,585
What?

1063
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,341
Charlie has fallen ill

1064
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:11,219
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

1065
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,638
- She wishes not to...
- Otis!

1066
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:15,848
Are you on drugs? Hmm?

1067
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:17,391
No, no. Mom, Mom, Mom.

1068
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:19,143
- Please stop. Stop!
- Charlie!

1069
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:21,270
- Mom, there is no reason to go...
- Where is she?

1070
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,231
- Mom, stop!
- Quit it, Otis.

1071
01:22:29,237 --> 01:22:30,488
Where is she?

1072
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:32,907
Uh...

1073
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:35,493
Otis?

1074
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:40,331
SHATTER: I found a tower
to transmit our message.

1075
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,667
It's close.

1076
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:47,296
Oh. B-127. I almost forgot.

1077
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,673
I didn't.

1078
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,426
No! Don't shoot!

1079
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,471
No!

1080
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:12,405
Bee!

1081
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:16,367
Talk to me, Bee, talk to me.

1082
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:25,626
I can fix this. I can fix this.

1083
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:30,923
Charlie.

1084
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:34,010
You got to wake up, Bee.
You got to wake up.

1085
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:35,344
Please.

1086
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:38,973
Charlie, we got to go.

1087
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:44,896
- CHARLIE: The gun.
- What?

1088
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:46,439
The electric gun. Get it.

1089
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:50,151
I can fix you.

1090
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,113
Come on, Bee.

1091
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,573
Come back to me.

1092
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:03,539
Come on, give me the other one.

1093
01:24:09,921 --> 01:24:11,505
Bee, come on.

1094
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,384
I can't lose you, too, Bee.

1095
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,178
Please, Bee!

1096
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:32,443
I'm sorry.

1097
01:24:46,624 --> 01:24:47,792
Oh.

1098
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,427
Oh, my God.

1099
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,472
Come on, Bee,
we've got to get you out of here.

1100
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:16,946
MEMO: Charlie, there's like
a million guys out there!

1101
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,073
We got to move, now.

1102
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,325
CHARLIE: Come on, Bee,
you've gotta get up. Can you get up?

1103
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,161
There's a door in my way.

1104
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:27,915
They've got bombs!

1105
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:29,458
- We got to go.
- CHARLIE: Bee, come on.

1106
01:25:31,419 --> 01:25:32,503
Charlie!

1107
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:33,796
You've gotta get up, come on.

1108
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:36,090
- Three.
- Charlie!

1109
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:37,883
- Two.
- CHARLIE: Come on.

1110
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:39,135
One.

1111
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:40,386
- Charlie!
- Come on.

1112
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:58,696
Memo?

1113
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:04,869
Memo. Memo, wake up.

1114
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,955
AGENT BURNS: Easy.

1115
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,084
Easy.

1116
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,130
Hold your fire!

1117
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,882
Get the kid out of here.

1118
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:21,844
CHARLIE: Memo! Wake up, Memo!

1119
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,512
AGENT BURNS: Come on, kid.

1120
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:24,805
Hey! No!

1121
01:26:25,598 --> 01:26:26,682
Bee!

1122
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:28,017
Run!

1123
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:31,270
Bee!

1124
01:26:32,563 --> 01:26:33,731
Run!

1125
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,775
- Let go of me!
- You need to get away from that thing.

1126
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:40,905
- Take it down!
- CHARLIE: No, stop!

1127
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:44,075
- Stop it!
- AGENT BURNS: Contain it

1128
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,242
and dismantle it!

1129
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:47,078
Strip it down to parts!

1130
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,289
CHARLIE: Leave him alone!
You don't understand.

1131
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,042
Fight back, Bee!

1132
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:55,795
- Bee!
- Kid, stop! It's a machine!

1133
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,214
He's more human than you'll ever be!

1134
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,341
That is enough!

1135
01:27:23,364 --> 01:27:24,407
Oh, shit.

1136
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,794
AGENT: Open fire!

1137
01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:51,934
Fall back! Take cover!

1138
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,492
Bee!

1139
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,329
Bee!

1140
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,167
CHARLIE: Bee, stop!

1141
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:38,355
You remember, don't you?

1142
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:44,695
CHARLIE: They're coming back.

1143
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:51,285
Oh, God.

1144
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:53,245
Are you okay?

1145
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:56,248
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1146
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:58,459
We need to get out of here.

1147
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,587
We've got to get you someplace safe.

1148
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:07,009
Bee, stop. They will kill you!

1149
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,637
OPTIMUS: <i>If the Decepticons find Earth,</i>

1150

<i>then our people are truly finished.</i>

1151
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:17,269
CHARLIE: Okay. Then we fight.

1152
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:26,779
Let's go, get in.

1153
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,408
Go on. I'll buy you
some time with these guys.

1154
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:43,879
You just kiss me?

1155
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,423
On the cheek.

1156
01:29:46,507 --> 01:29:47,841
Still counts.

1157
01:29:54,348 --> 01:29:55,349
Still counts.

1158
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:06,277
Halt!

1159
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:09,113
Stop.

1160
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:15,119
Well, that didn't work.

1161
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:23,460
AGENT: Move, move!

1162
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,353
Faster, Bee, faster!

1163
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:45,899
We should really look
into getting seatbelts.

1164
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:47,234
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1165
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:49,778
It's okay. She's gonna steal
the robot back, fight off the police,

1166
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:51,655
kill two bigger robots,
and come right back home.

1167
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:52,865
Shut up, Otis.

1168
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,366
REPORTER:
<i>Folks, this just breaking.</i>

1169

a high-speed chase underway</i>

1170

<i>just outside McKinnon Air Base.</i>

1171
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,414
Go right! Go right!

1172
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,220
Closer. Closer.

1173
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:16,388
You lose that car,

1174
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:18,432
I will personally rip your face off.

1175
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,228
Oh, God!

1176
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:24,313
It's all under control.

1177
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,319
- SALLY: Charlie!
- Mom?

1178
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,571
You pull that car over
right this second.

1179
01:31:32,655 --> 01:31:34,782
This is very unsafe, what you're doing.

1180
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,575
Mom, you got to get out of here, okay?

1181
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:38,577
Whoa! Whoa!

1182
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:41,955
CHARLIE: Mom...

1183
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:44,041
You have to trust me, please!

1184
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:46,669
Charlie!

1185
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:48,879
- We got to help her, Ron!
- Hang on.

1186
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:53,425
SALLY: Oh, my God! Ron!

1187
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,013
Get out of the way!

1188
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,599
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing?

1189
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,142
I saw this on Miami Vice.

1190
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:06,772
God!

1191
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:10,526
- Oh. Oh. I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Oh, my God!

1192
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:12,444
Whoa!

1193
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:21,829
Whoa!

1194
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:26,417
Whoa!

1195
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:35,968
Nice driving, Ron.

1196
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:40,347
Is everyone okay?

1197
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:43,767
Ron! We have a kid in the car!

1198
01:32:43,934 --> 01:32:46,603
I was trying to save
the other kid! What was I...

1199
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,272
It was a lose-lose.

1200
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:51,024
Otis? Otis, are you all right?

1201
01:32:52,526 --> 01:32:55,654
That was radical.

1202
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:25,476
Preparing satellites
to transmit our message.

1203
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:46,538
Okay. What's the plan?

1204
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:56,089
This is the plan?
I hate this plan. Bee, I want to help.

1205
01:33:57,257 --> 01:34:01,845
<i>I would hate anything
To happen to her</i>

1206
01:34:01,929 --> 01:34:05,933
You're actually talking.
And you're listening to The Smiths.

1207
01:34:16,318 --> 01:34:17,319
Be careful.

1208
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:29,540
Handle him!
And finish the job this time!

1209
01:34:46,306 --> 01:34:47,307
Oh, shit!

1210
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,503
How the hell am I gonna get up there?

1211
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:53,684
There. The one on the tower.

1212
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:56,580
You think these little chains
can hold...

1213
01:38:09,176 --> 01:38:10,427
Okay.

1214
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:37,370
Hold on!

1215
01:38:56,807 --> 01:38:58,558
SHATTER: What are you doing?

1216
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:39,057
Come on.

1217
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:45,272
Come on.

1218
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,501
No.

1219
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:32,652
After I kill you, I kill her.

1220
01:40:32,736 --> 01:40:33,820
Bee, no!

1221
01:40:37,866 --> 01:40:38,950
You missed.

1222
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,250
You'll kill us both!

1223
01:40:57,177 --> 01:40:58,470
Bumblebee!

1224
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:20,802
Oh, God.

1225
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:23,972
AGENT BURNS: You.

1226
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:31,646
You need to get outta here.

1227
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:34,733
What do you mean?

1228
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:36,318
I mean my friends are coming.

1229
01:42:37,277 --> 01:42:38,820
And they're gonna be looking for him.

1230
01:42:42,574 --> 01:42:43,908
Thank you.

1231
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:47,746
Thank you.

1232
01:43:02,844 --> 01:43:04,262
Hey, soldier!

1233
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:37,170
I'm here. I made it.

1234
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:39,547
What's going on?

1235
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:41,966
World's already been saved, kid.

1236
01:43:43,093 --> 01:43:44,386
Cool.

1237
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:47,263
Cool.

1238
01:43:50,058 --> 01:43:52,268
Hey, can you call my mom?

1239
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:02,112
This is it, Bee.

1240

<i>Let's go!</i>

1241
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:28,888
Bee, I can't go with you.

1242
01:44:39,566 --> 01:44:41,651
You've got people out there
that need you.

1243
01:44:44,988 --> 01:44:46,489
And so do I.

1244
01:44:55,665 --> 01:44:57,125
I gotta let you go.

I'll never forget you.

Goodbye, Bumblebee.

1253
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:10,698
No way.

1254
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:13,284
You kidding me?

1255
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:17,455
Are you telling me you could've been
a Camaro this whole time?

1256
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:21,125
Oh, my God!

Never love me?</i>

That was some driving, Ron.

01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:31,738
Well, I've taken a few notes.

1272

Otis.

1273
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,369
They forced me to tell.

1274
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,040
I'm glad they did.

1275
