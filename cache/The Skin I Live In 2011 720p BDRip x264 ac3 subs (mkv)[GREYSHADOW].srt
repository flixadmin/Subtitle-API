1
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,790
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,671
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:45,215
Open it.

4
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,596
Take this.

5
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:14,290
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,293
Yes.

7
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:22,342
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:25,640
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,848
OK.

10
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:34,312
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,777
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,408
Yeah.

13
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,945
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:23,450
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough.

15
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:29,048
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:30,421
A face with features...

17
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,261
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:34,882
I have participated in

19
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:37,464
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:41,094
carried out in the world...

21
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:44,640
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,101
Good...

23
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,770
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,490
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:54,578 --> 00:05:00,700
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,543
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,633
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,644
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:27,757
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,838
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,593
Don't talk rubbish.

32
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:37,894
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:40,777
Your skin is softer than I thought.

34
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:43,275
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:45,653
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:47,900
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,078
In any case...

38
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:54,495
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:04,463
Here it is...

40
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:07,302
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,976
Thank you.

42
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:23,945
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:28,154
You said that a year ago.

44
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:30,951
I was hasty.

45
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:40,086
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:41,924
No.

47
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:46,129
And now?

48
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,382
No.

49
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:52,101
Now!

50
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:53,770
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:56,186
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,306
in recent years.

53
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,106
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:14:00,237 --> 00:14:03,488
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,903
No.

56
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,116
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,579
...malaria, for example.

58
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:14,742
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

59
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,709
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:18,794
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,883
and the results...

62
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:25,756
...have been spectacular.

63
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,676
This leads me to suppose

64
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,767
they would be equally positive...

65
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:31,646
in human mammals.

66
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:37,226
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:38,940
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,280
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,202
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:49,284
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,126
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:54,754
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:56,507
and it smells different.

74
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,259
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,918
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:03,589
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,683
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,395
That isn't enough.

79
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:11,603
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,687
Excuse me.

81
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,987
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,531
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,411
By mutating it.

84
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,700
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,451
Transgenesis.

86
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,960
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,633
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,423
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,304
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:39,884
You're insane!

91
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,345
You know the application
of transgenetic therapy...

92
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:45,021
in humans is completely forbidden!

93
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,227
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:50,017
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:53,192
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:56,574
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,445
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:01,909
You know how many diseases...

99
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,992
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:06,458
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:07,964
Don't go on!

102
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:10,171
I know the list by heart...

103
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,132
and I think of it every day.

104
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:15,420
But even so...

105
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,884
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

106
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,012
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,688
to the scientific community.

108
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,731
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,815
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:34,197
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,784
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,578
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:40,617
I remember...

114
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,628
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,998
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:47,919
And it still is.

117
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,421
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:53,805
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:57,760
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,608
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,487
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,189
I don't know.

123
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:11,362
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:14,247
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,994
Do you like what you see?

126
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:14,547
What do you mean?

127
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,258
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:22,100
No.

129
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:25,057
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:29,108
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:31,812
Yes...

132
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:35,530
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,866
And now what?

134
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:47,088
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,045
and smoke it.

136
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,340
I mean us.

137
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:53,796
Me.

138
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:57,007
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:19:58,225 --> 00:20:00,302
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:01,509
When?

141
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:04,143
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:07,776
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,403
Live together.

144
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:13,781
Live together?

145
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:17,162
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,419
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,668
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:27,126
Living together as equals.

149
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:30,052
That's it!

150
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,229
Here.

151
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,353
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,324
I'm yours.

153
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,653
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:57,076
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,327
Did I say that?

156
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:04,170
I know you look at me.

157
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,546
Since you brought me here,

158
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:10,348
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,184
In this pocket.

160
00:21:54,524 --> 00:22:01,649
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.</i>

161
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,869
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:14,459
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:17,085
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:19,251
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:22:19,843 --> 00:22:22,133
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:23,544
No.

167
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:27,845
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:31,933
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:35,270
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:37,771
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:40,782
No! Not this one!

172
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:44,862
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,198
You're sick.

174
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,875
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,127
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:55,587
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:22:57,095 --> 00:23:00,760
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:05,102
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:07,982
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,523
What do you want?

181
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:50,602
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.</i>

182
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:51,937
If she was a servant...

183
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,362
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:58,324
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.</i>

185
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:00,075
<i>My mother is prettier.</i>

186
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,123
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,467
Zeca!

188
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:21,980
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,851
How dare you come here!

190
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,395
Open the door!

191
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:31,240
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,073
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:40,960
Little tiger!

194
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,460
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:46,383
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:48,379
Whatever you say.

197
00:24:48,512 --> 00:24:53,091
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,588
How did you find us?

199
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:23,800
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:25,713
He was giving a...

201
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,134
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:25:29,225 --> 00:25:31,134
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:32,265
Can't I come in?

204
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,646
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:38,855
It smells good.
I'm hungry.

206
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:42,280
Brute!

207
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,624
<i>The main new items today...</i>

208
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,462
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...</i>

209
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,756
<i>and the daring robbery committed
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...</i>

210
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,793
<i>in the heart of Madrid.</i>

211
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,209
<i>It happened last night...</i>

212
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,803
<i>and today we have the first images
recorded by one...</i>

213
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:12,054
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.</i>

214
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:15,642
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...</i>

215
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:19,229
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...</i>

216
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:23,322
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.</i>

217
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:26,705
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,955
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:32,369
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:35,043
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:37,007
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:41,008
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:43,382
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,934
Hide you here?

225
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,092
Not a chance.

226
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,059
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:51,141
I know how to hide.

228
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:54,811
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,655
Robert?

230
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,775
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,946
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,582
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,041
after what you did?

234
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,243
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:14,250
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,669
You're raving mad.

237
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:20,512
I'm just a servant.

238
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:23,686
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:26,600
Even better.

240
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:29,272
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:34,532
Where are you going?

242
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:37,072
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:43,040
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:10,521
What's this?

245
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,200
It's a film!

246
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,070
Go away!

247
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:41,556
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:43,854
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:28:45,113 --> 00:28:46,572
Mom...

250
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:50,111
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:54,744
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,914
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,544
How could it be her?

254
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,623
Get out of here!

255
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:03,168
Keep away!

256
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:12,267
Marilia?

257
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,511
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:17,559
Is anything wrong?

259
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,607
<i>I heard voices too.</i>

260
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,319
<i>Marilia?</i>

261
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:24,149
Marilia!

262
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:48,434
There.

263
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,823
Who is it?

264
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:19,910
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:21,830
I can't.

266
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:24,875
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,710
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:29,252
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

269
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:54,524
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:04,960
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,089
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,420
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,178
No, where is it?

274
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,597
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,357
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,737
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:36,821
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:46,833
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:49,419
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:50,885
Open your mouth!

281
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,509
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,229
It all fit before.

283
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,579
Did Robert send you?

284
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:50,863
No.

285
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:54,542
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:01,345
He saved me.

287
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:04,965
Get me out of here!

288
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:07,098
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,395
You're saying that...

290
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,224
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:14,438
No!

292
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:18,688
Ask me for anything!

293
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,742
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:24,443
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:34:24,872 --> 00:34:26,497
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,833
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:32,754
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:35,216
Great.

299
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:38,424
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:42,257
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,809
Yes.

302
00:34:45,646 --> 00:34:47,887
I'll take you with me.

303
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:49,981
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:55,446
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:59,703
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:05,996
Listen...

307
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:07,702
What?

308
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:10,085
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:14,088
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:16,261
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:24,688
Don't you like it?

312
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,482
You're hurting me.

313
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,735
It's very big.

314
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:31,613
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:33,116
Yes...

316
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:35,786
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:40,615
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:55,993
Kill her!

319
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,663
Kill them both!

320
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,539
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,121
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:40,339
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,380
Yes.

324
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:44,674
They're brothers...

325
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,806
but they don't know it.

326
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:50,886
At least I've never told them.

327
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:56,607
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:37:57,696 --> 00:38:02,490
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:07,947
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:12,459
It's my fault.

331
00:38:18,928 --> 00:38:22,215
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:25,435
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:27,850
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:33,018
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:37,657
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:43,368
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,371
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:52,709
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,510
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:04,475
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:08,650
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:18,284
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:22,290
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:26,036
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,000
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:32,631
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,387
Their car crashed,

348
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,218
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:43,890
But she...

350
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:53,197
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:39:56,956 --> 00:40:00,657
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:08,587
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:10,589
He didn't sleep.

354
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:17,304
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:19,846
covered with gauzes.

356
00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:24,649
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:29,033
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:34,073
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,915
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:42,047
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:47,302
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,261
One day...

363
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:59,148
when she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,403
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:41:05,116 --> 00:41:08,817
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:13,835
And she got emotional.

367
00:41:15,462 --> 00:41:20,801
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:23,547
And it was...

369
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:27,675
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,270
When she opened the window...

371
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:12,859
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:23,698
She didn't look human.

373
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,697
She was a cinder.

374
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:33,085
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:35,416
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,026
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:55,107
went in search of her mother...

378
00:42:56,367 --> 00:43:00,282
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:05,367
Through the window.

380
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:48,251
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:49,878
Did you pray?

382
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:53,220
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:00,311
Shall we go inside?

384
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,729
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,445
for tomorrow?

386
00:44:44,907 --> 00:44:47,908
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:44:48,744 --> 00:44:50,571
As you wish.

388
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,084
But hold me!

389
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:05,585
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:09,343
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,353
Thank you!

392
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:29,244
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:45:36,757 --> 00:45:38,797
Sleep, my love.

394
00:45:59,283 --> 00:46:01,026
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:35,652
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,362
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:43,410
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:45,949
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:55,588
Your daughter is getting on well
with my nieces.

400
00:46:56,305 --> 00:46:58,049
She seems much better...

401
00:46:58,224 --> 00:47:00,929
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,640
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:08,066
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:23,495
To you!

405
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:17,516
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,189
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:33,158
Excuse me.

408
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:44,305
Norma!

409
00:50:44,438 --> 00:50:45,981
Norma!

410
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:48,142
Norma!

411
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,984
Norma!

412
00:50:50,153 --> 00:50:51,730
Norma!

413
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:55,399
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:02,823
There, there!

415
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,192
What about this one?

416
00:52:12,288 --> 00:52:13,486
Yes, but...

417
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:14,743
no.

418
00:52:14,874 --> 00:52:15,989
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:52:16,084 --> 00:52:18,290
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:52:18,377 --> 00:52:20,834
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:52:20,922 --> 00:52:23,414
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,045
Not stripes either.

423
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:26,553
No stripes.

424
00:52:37,774 --> 00:52:39,317
Something graphic?

425
00:52:39,443 --> 00:52:42,065
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:44,071
I'll come back another day.

427
00:52:44,157 --> 00:52:47,277
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:52,328
Cristina...

429
00:52:53,334 --> 00:52:55,327
Here. On the house.

430
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:57,330
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:52:57,464 --> 00:52:59,006
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:01,748
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:53:03,387 --> 00:53:05,464
It'll look great on you.

434
00:53:05,598 --> 00:53:07,591
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:53:08,726 --> 00:53:10,434
You're so mistaken!

436
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,430
Because I don't like men?

437
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,812
Because you don't like me.

438
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,062
In any case...

439
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,897
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:23,072
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:28,323
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:30,667
I'm off.

443
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:32,502
Where to?

444
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:34,004
Home, to get changed.

445
00:53:34,088 --> 00:53:35,333
How come?

446
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:36,955
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,588
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:53:39,804 --> 00:53:40,835
Were you invited?

449
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,006
Jorge knows one of the nieces.

450
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:44,842
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:48,135
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:50,555
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:53:52,484 --> 00:53:53,813
Good afternoon.

454
00:53:53,986 --> 00:53:55,445
Hello.

455
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:58,904
My wife has left us...

456
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:01,530
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,578
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,500
Well...

459
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,917
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:16,134
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,880
They're very nice.

462
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,214
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:23,932
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:54:23,979 --> 00:54:24,928
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:26,432
It certainly is.

466
00:54:26,522 --> 00:54:27,898
But...

467
00:54:28,316 --> 00:54:30,606
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:32,776
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,865
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,658
So the next time she does it...

471
00:54:37,744 --> 00:54:40,829
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,583
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:32,430
What a party!

474
00:55:32,556 --> 00:55:34,015
Fresh air!

475
00:55:35,768 --> 00:55:38,804
You're all stoners!

476
00:55:41,983 --> 00:55:43,692
I'm Vicente.

477
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,147
I'm Norma.

478
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:52,076
Your friends have gone.

479
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:55,577
All the better, right?

480
00:56:08,763 --> 00:56:10,258
Are you stoned?

481
00:56:10,975 --> 00:56:12,385
Stoned?

482
00:56:12,893 --> 00:56:14,851
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:17,355
Yes.

484
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:19,975
Cipralex 20...

485
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,779
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:27,150
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:28,903
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,743
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:56:31,873 --> 00:56:33,154
Shit!

490
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:35,249
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:36,706
High?

492
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,582
Yes.

493
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:45,504
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:47,715
No. Are you?

495
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:50,638
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:57:09,707 --> 00:57:12,495
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:57:18,426 --> 00:57:20,004
And this jacket!

498
00:57:21,512 --> 00:57:25,428
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:29,635
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:57:31,899 --> 00:57:33,179
Wait.

501
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:35,902
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:17,984
You're so pretty...

503
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,412
and different.

504
00:58:23,582 --> 00:58:25,290
I'm different too.

505
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,744
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,627
No.

507
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,756
Do you think I should be?

508
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,254
I don't know.

509
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,464
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:39,970
"I Need To Love".

511
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:42,017
This is also for the bride...

512
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:43,888
with all my affection.

513
00:59:43,465 --> 00:59:48,756
No!

514
00:59:53,642 --> 00:59:55,683
Shut up!

515
00:59:58,147 --> 01:00:00,307
Stop!

516
01:01:34,716 --> 01:01:36,257
Cristina...

517
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:39,634
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,305
Yes...

519
01:01:41,389 --> 01:01:43,181
but where are you going?

520
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:46,221
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:47,973
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:49,516
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:51,232
Then it's because of that.

524
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:54,109
So should I take it or not?

525
01:01:54,154 --> 01:01:55,696
It's best not to.

526
01:01:57,617 --> 01:01:59,158
I'm going out.

527
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:01,528
Now? Without finishing it?

528
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:02,528
Yes.

529
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:07,829
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
01:02:07,919 --> 01:02:10,625
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:13,710
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,009
Are you leaving that mess?

533
01:02:17,055 --> 01:02:19,511
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:03:13,953 --> 01:03:17,156
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:03:58,128 --> 01:03:59,753
Son of a bitch!

536
01:04:00,672 --> 01:04:03,080
Bastard!

537
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,809
Are you crazy?

538
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:16,228
Don't shoot!

539
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:14,528
Help!

540
01:06:18,703 --> 01:06:20,198
<i>Help!</i>

541
01:06:32,552 --> 01:06:33,963
Come in.

542
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:37,260
Sit down, please.

543
01:06:39,226 --> 01:06:40,638
Thank you.

544
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:44,681
I was told there's news.

545
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:50,273
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:53,527
And the body?

547
01:06:53,952 --> 01:06:55,280
Nothing.

548
01:06:55,787 --> 01:06:57,945
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:07:02,544 --> 01:07:04,336
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:07:05,548 --> 01:07:07,256
My son is alive.

551
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:12,094
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:07:12,138 --> 01:07:13,763
but my son?

553
01:07:15,267 --> 01:07:17,759
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,809
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:07:23,902 --> 01:07:25,860
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:07:25,946 --> 01:07:29,991
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:07:30,076 --> 01:07:32,649
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:38,035
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:41,330
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,123
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:07:43,173 --> 01:07:44,503
Cristina heard him.

562
01:07:44,675 --> 01:07:48,127
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,407
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:08:22,051 --> 01:08:25,752
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:30,885
Norma...

566
01:08:32,771 --> 01:08:33,803
Sweetheart...

567
01:08:33,856 --> 01:08:35,101
Sweetheart...

568
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:38,146
I won't touch you.

569
01:08:40,447 --> 01:08:42,025
Where are you going?

570
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:50,665
Where are you going?

571
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,710
Norma, love.

572
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:06,304
Everything OK?

573
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,759
Yes.

574
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,144
It's me, Norma.

575
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:17,562
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:09:17,697 --> 01:09:21,743
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:23,322
We tried...

578
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:26,991
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,743
She rips it off.

580
01:09:30,545 --> 01:09:34,625
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,045
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:41,298
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:44,427
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:09:44,561 --> 01:09:45,936
I just found her lying there!

585
01:09:46,021 --> 01:09:48,394
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:09:48,482 --> 01:09:51,234
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,601
Maybe...

588
01:09:53,696 --> 01:09:56,567
we let her out too soon.

589
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:59,363
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:09:59,411 --> 01:10:02,033
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:03,196
How could I know...

592
01:10:03,249 --> 01:10:06,203
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:11:32,307 --> 01:11:37,184
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:11:37,272 --> 01:11:40,189
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,943
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:11:45,364 --> 01:11:47,156
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:50,362
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:11:50,495 --> 01:11:53,580
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:57,329
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:12:08,766 --> 01:12:10,141
Turn around!

601
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:43,674
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:12:43,805 --> 01:12:47,091
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:50,226
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:13:27,522 --> 01:13:29,015
Eat.

605
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:31,853
Thank you!

606
01:13:37,866 --> 01:13:40,109
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:13:40,953 --> 01:13:43,410
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:13:46,293 --> 01:13:49,497
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:55,710
Please, don't go!

610
01:13:55,887 --> 01:13:57,927
We have to talk.

611
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:27,379
My condolences.

612
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:32,878
We did what we could.

613
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:35,671
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:14:35,807 --> 01:14:37,681
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:39,392
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:42,188
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:14:45,901 --> 01:14:47,728
You really want to work today?

618
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:48,984
Yes.

619
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:52,234
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:55,410
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:14:55,496 --> 01:14:57,987
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:18,137
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:15:18,898 --> 01:15:21,389
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:15:31,328 --> 01:15:33,404
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:15:39,504 --> 01:15:41,248
Why do you say that?

626
01:15:42,841 --> 01:15:44,751
The toys...

627
01:15:44,843 --> 01:15:46,587
My daughter is dead.

628
01:15:48,389 --> 01:15:50,963
We buried her today.

629
01:15:53,562 --> 01:15:55,471
I'm sorry.

630
01:16:04,574 --> 01:16:07,243
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:16:09,955 --> 01:16:11,995
Why did you shave me?

632
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,451
That's a good question.

633
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:08,933
Yes?

634
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,356
<i>It's us.</i>

635
01:17:10,482 --> 01:17:11,893
I'll let you in.

636
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:32,625
If he says we're late,

637
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:34,916
say there were two
accidents on the road

638
01:17:35,177 --> 01:17:37,051
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:17:40,516 --> 01:17:42,141
Good evening.

640
01:17:42,226 --> 01:17:43,555
You're late.

641
01:17:43,728 --> 01:17:45,555
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,650
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:51,059
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:55,449
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:39,787
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:18:40,584 --> 01:18:42,292
He isn't.

647
01:18:43,045 --> 01:18:46,212
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:49,342
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:19:24,884 --> 01:19:26,841
What's happened?

650
01:19:31,474 --> 01:19:33,433
What did you do to me?

651
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,345
A vaginoplasty

652
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:47,532
No...

653
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:37,085
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:20:37,174 --> 01:20:38,799
It's very important.

655
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:44,471
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:20:44,682 --> 01:20:49,429
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:20:49,522 --> 01:20:52,688
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:20:52,942 --> 01:20:54,223
You...

659
01:20:55,528 --> 01:20:58,364
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:20:58,448 --> 01:21:01,818
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:21:02,953 --> 01:21:07,580
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:10,040
that you breathe through it.

663
01:21:11,755 --> 01:21:13,130
In this case...

664
01:21:14,716 --> 01:21:17,920
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:21:20,432 --> 01:21:24,810
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:21:27,147 --> 01:21:29,390
It will hurt at first...

667
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:32,773
but in a few months...

668
01:21:32,904 --> 01:21:35,988
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:21:36,115 --> 01:21:37,824
and the skin...

670
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:42,073
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:21:50,549 --> 01:21:54,168
This is very good.

672
01:21:55,972 --> 01:21:58,428
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:00,177
Four weeks.

674
01:22:00,518 --> 01:22:02,061
Can I go now?

675
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:05,053
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:22:05,566 --> 01:22:07,523
But we've just started.

677
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,417
What else are you going to do?

678
01:22:26,464 --> 01:22:29,086
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:22:31,262 --> 01:22:33,550
Why are you doing this?

680
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:43,978
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:22:45,152 --> 01:22:47,690
In that spectacular house?

682
01:22:49,073 --> 01:22:53,321
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:22:54,913 --> 01:22:56,953
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:22:56,999 --> 01:23:01,329
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:23:02,297 --> 01:23:07,173
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:23:07,218 --> 01:23:11,763
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:13,641
What are you going to do now?

688
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:38,493
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:23:42,342 --> 01:23:45,794
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:50,100
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:23:58,944 --> 01:24:01,815
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:24:02,448 --> 01:24:04,904
There's still work to do.

693
01:24:05,994 --> 01:24:10,455
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:17,956
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,383
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:24:22,053 --> 01:24:26,348
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:24:27,643 --> 01:24:29,137
like a second skin.

698
01:24:30,563 --> 01:24:32,105
Put it on.

699
01:25:17,658 --> 01:25:19,947
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:41,762
Bitch!

701
01:26:30,448 --> 01:26:31,824
Stop!

702
01:26:33,118 --> 01:26:35,610
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:26:37,748 --> 01:26:39,456
Stay where you are!

704
01:26:55,351 --> 01:26:57,178
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:26:57,228 --> 01:26:59,305
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:27:00,482 --> 01:27:02,226
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:27:37,274 --> 01:27:39,066
We were lucky.

708
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,612
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:29,368
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:28:32,378 --> 01:28:36,708
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:30:23,962 --> 01:30:26,371
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:30:26,465 --> 01:30:28,874
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:30:28,968 --> 01:30:30,629
Do what you want with them.

714
01:30:53,455 --> 01:30:56,029
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...</i>

715
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:58,953
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.</i>

716
01:31:19,567 --> 01:31:22,771
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...</i>

717
01:31:23,238 --> 01:31:26,025
<i>a place inside you...</i>

718
01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:27,908
<i>a place to which...</i>

719
01:31:27,994 --> 01:31:30,319
<i>no one else has access...</i>

720
01:31:30,371 --> 01:31:33,040
<i>a place that no one can destroy.</i>

721
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:35,873
<i>To access that place there is yoga...</i>

722
01:31:36,128 --> 01:31:39,045
<i>an ancient technique.</i>

723
01:31:39,923 --> 01:31:43,423
<i>It's a place where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...</i>

724
01:31:43,469 --> 01:31:45,094
<i>freedom.</i>

725
01:31:45,221 --> 01:31:46,929
<i>But you must practice it...</i>

726
01:31:47,015 --> 01:31:49,637
<i>continuously, intensely...</i>

727
01:31:49,726 --> 01:31:54,056
<i>and then you'll achieve it.</i>

728
01:31:54,524 --> 01:31:56,516
YOGA BOOKS

729
01:32:57,928 --> 01:32:59,838
My Cigarral!

730
01:33:00,682 --> 01:33:02,591
I missed it so much!

731
01:33:04,143 --> 01:33:06,850
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:10,682
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:33:11,235 --> 01:33:13,904
I thought you'd forgotten me.

734
01:33:14,739 --> 01:33:16,447
I thought that...

735
01:33:16,617 --> 01:33:19,867
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:33:20,412 --> 01:33:22,571
My poor child.

737
01:33:22,832 --> 01:33:24,908
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:27,451
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:30,004
As you wish.

740
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:33,416
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:33:35,263 --> 01:33:37,220
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,051
I'm parched.

743
01:33:43,105 --> 01:33:45,062
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:49,184
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:33:49,404 --> 01:33:52,939
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:33:53,283 --> 01:33:55,656
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:33:55,786 --> 01:34:00,080
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:34:00,207 --> 01:34:01,999
I'll explain.

749
01:34:02,877 --> 01:34:05,369
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:34:05,463 --> 01:34:09,378
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:34:11,386 --> 01:34:15,385
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:34:36,165 --> 01:34:37,872
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:34:38,584 --> 01:34:41,040
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:34:41,087 --> 01:34:42,629
I like the uniform...

755
01:34:42,755 --> 01:34:45,377
because it means we're together again.

756
01:34:53,309 --> 01:34:54,804
Who is she?

757
01:34:56,062 --> 01:34:58,185
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:34:58,982 --> 01:35:00,725
What's she doing?

759
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:03,318
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:35:03,445 --> 01:35:05,735
I can see that.

761
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:09,319
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,953
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:35:14,082 --> 01:35:16,870
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:20,207
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,838
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

766
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:29,800
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:32,932
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:35:33,062 --> 01:35:36,728
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:35:36,858 --> 01:35:41,070
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:35:52,293 --> 01:35:55,745
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:10,808
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:36:23,786 --> 01:36:26,029
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:36:30,669 --> 01:36:33,456
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:36:35,758 --> 01:36:38,380
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:36:38,511 --> 01:36:40,303
I don't trust you.

776
01:36:40,638 --> 01:36:43,842
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:36:45,143 --> 01:36:46,686
Pass me the tray.

778
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:49,808
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:56,813
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,695
Thank you.

781
01:38:02,315 --> 01:38:04,058
Good morning.

782
01:38:09,864 --> 01:38:11,573
Breakfast.

783
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:16,870
Thank you.

784
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,674
Where's Marilia?

785
01:38:28,845 --> 01:38:30,884
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:38:31,931 --> 01:38:35,265
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:47,441
Last night...

788
01:38:48,283 --> 01:38:50,157
before we went to bed...

789
01:38:50,285 --> 01:38:53,203
we talked a lot and we made a promise.

790
01:38:54,749 --> 01:38:58,035
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:39:00,005 --> 01:39:03,124
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:39:03,925 --> 01:39:06,547
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:39:07,722 --> 01:39:09,845
that I was free.

794
01:39:11,976 --> 01:39:15,013
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:39:16,273 --> 01:39:18,231
Don't let me down.

796
01:39:18,817 --> 01:39:21,274
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:39:21,905 --> 01:39:24,146
Your promise and mine.

798
01:39:33,543 --> 01:39:36,295
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:39:37,422 --> 01:39:40,874
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:39:40,967 --> 01:39:42,711
She promised not to.

801
01:39:42,803 --> 01:39:46,054
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:39:46,599 --> 01:39:50,432
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:39:50,478 --> 01:39:52,056
That's enough!

804
01:39:55,108 --> 01:39:57,351
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:39:58,279 --> 01:40:01,280
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:40:01,741 --> 01:40:05,193
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:06,948
Thank you.

808
01:40:22,974 --> 01:40:24,634
Come along, child!

809
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:33,147
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:36,980
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:40:38,742 --> 01:40:42,110
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:40:42,329 --> 01:40:44,322
I told you on the phone.

813
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:46,832
After talking to the president...

814
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:50,417
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:40:52,173 --> 01:40:55,091
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:40:55,176 --> 01:40:56,801
It's not just that.

817
01:40:57,095 --> 01:41:00,880
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:41:02,602 --> 01:41:06,185
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:41:06,273 --> 01:41:09,108
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:41:09,234 --> 01:41:12,069
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:41:12,112 --> 01:41:15,612
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:21,992
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:26,292
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:01,575
Are you still here?

825
01:42:02,962 --> 01:42:04,207
I'm leaving now...

826
01:42:04,338 --> 01:42:08,004
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:42:12,305 --> 01:42:14,013
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:16,300
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:42:17,061 --> 01:42:20,680
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:42:20,898 --> 01:42:22,013
as you can see.

831
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:23,692
And?

832
01:42:24,402 --> 01:42:26,811
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,864
without hormones.

834
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:30,984
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:42:31,494 --> 01:42:34,910
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:38,539
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:46,542
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:42:46,636 --> 01:42:48,795
Don't go there.

839
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:51,339
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

840
01:42:51,767 --> 01:42:52,716
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:42:52,809 --> 01:42:55,561
we accepted false documents.

842
01:42:55,687 --> 01:42:58,309
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:42:58,357 --> 01:43:01,276
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:43:01,945 --> 01:43:05,990
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:43:06,074 --> 01:43:08,317
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:43:08,619 --> 01:43:09,734
You told us...

847
01:43:09,828 --> 01:43:12,450
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

848
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:14,332
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:43:14,418 --> 01:43:17,751
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:43:17,837 --> 01:43:19,712
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:43:20,049 --> 01:43:23,963
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:43:24,054 --> 01:43:26,011
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:43:26,097 --> 01:43:28,137
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:43:28,183 --> 01:43:30,805
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:43:33,147 --> 01:43:35,686
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:43:38,986 --> 01:43:41,858
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:43:43,325 --> 01:43:47,110
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:43:50,499 --> 01:43:51,449
And...

859
01:43:51,543 --> 01:43:53,500
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:43:54,879 --> 01:43:56,623
A cream?

861
01:43:58,884 --> 01:44:01,554
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:44:02,805 --> 01:44:06,674
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:44:07,018 --> 01:44:08,643
Vera Cruz!

864
01:44:10,064 --> 01:44:12,602
And I was always a woman!

865
01:44:34,716 --> 01:44:36,294
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:47,723
Thank you.

867
01:44:48,023 --> 01:44:50,811
No, I thank you.

868
01:45:17,765 --> 01:45:19,509
Does it still hurt?

869
01:45:19,642 --> 01:45:21,220
Yes.

870
01:45:23,313 --> 01:45:25,306
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:45:26,525 --> 01:45:28,815
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:45:29,612 --> 01:45:31,355
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:45:31,448 --> 01:45:33,606
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:45:33,658 --> 01:45:36,197
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,378
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:54,677
but I can't find it.

877
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:57,339
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:45:57,518 --> 01:46:00,639
I'll go and get it.

879
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:37,560
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:46:49,744 --> 01:46:52,829
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:56,828
Not yet.

882
01:47:02,759 --> 01:47:04,134
Come on...

883
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,595
What are you doing?

884
01:47:10,225 --> 01:47:12,052
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,180
This is a joke, right?

886
01:47:15,065 --> 01:47:16,808
Call it what you want.

887
01:47:18,318 --> 01:47:20,276
But you promised!

888
01:47:20,404 --> 01:47:22,278
I lied.

889
01:48:01,701 --> 01:48:03,159
Robert?

890
01:48:05,121 --> 01:48:06,580
Robert?

891
01:48:06,706 --> 01:48:08,249
He's asleep.

892
01:48:09,542 --> 01:48:11,286
I heard a noise.

893
01:48:11,545 --> 01:48:13,087
Yes, so did I.

894
01:48:13,464 --> 01:48:16,251
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:48:22,933 --> 01:48:24,510
Robert!

896
01:48:25,435 --> 01:48:27,096
My son!

897
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:41,444
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:48:43,373 --> 01:48:45,200
Where are you?

899
01:49:00,392 --> 01:49:02,432
I knew it.

900
01:51:01,737 --> 01:51:03,362
Hello.

901
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:15,160
You see to her.

902
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:18,958
Good morning.

903
01:51:31,813 --> 01:51:33,640
What did you want?

904
01:51:35,525 --> 01:51:37,566
Is anything wrong?

905
01:51:38,654 --> 01:51:40,730
Are you all right?

906
01:51:44,578 --> 01:51:47,330
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:51:49,416 --> 01:51:51,374
Do you know me?

908
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:56,044
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:51:57,092 --> 01:52:00,592
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:52:03,015 --> 01:52:06,100
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:52:08,146 --> 01:52:10,305
You have to help me.

912
01:52:15,237 --> 01:52:16,945
Look.

913
01:52:17,657 --> 01:52:19,696
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:52:21,995 --> 01:52:26,076
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:52:26,417 --> 01:52:28,540
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:52:28,961 --> 01:52:31,500
just to see how it looked.

917
01:52:31,589 --> 01:52:35,967
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:52:38,013 --> 01:52:42,841
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:52:50,110 --> 01:52:52,186
Is anything wrong?

920
01:52:54,365 --> 01:52:56,821
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:53:10,091 --> 01:53:12,796
Why are you crying?

922
01:53:23,982 --> 01:53:26,355
I'm Vicente.
