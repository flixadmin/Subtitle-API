1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:07,090
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,646
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:25,275
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:30,072
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,658
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,245
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,581
Iris West.
I hear you've been writing about me.

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,627
- I collect posts about the Streak.
- There's no Streak.

12
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,629
I saw him, Barry. He wears a red suit.

13
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,633
I've finally diagnosed why Iris
is writing about the Streak.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,842
She's doing it for me.

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:55,138
I'm gonna find out who really killed Nora
and I'm going to get you out of here.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,352
Whoever the Streak is, I am not stopping
until the rest of the world believes in him.

17
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,771
Maybe we shouldn't see each other
for a while.

18
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:12,990
To understand what I'm about to tell
you, you need to do something first.

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,409
You need to believe in the impossible.

20
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,494
Can you do that? Good.

21
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,539
Because all of us,
we have forgotten what miracles look like.

22
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,585
Maybe because they haven't made
much of an appearance lately. Our lives...

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,295
have become ordinary.

24
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,798
But there is someone out there
who is truly extraordinary.

25
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,759
I don't know where you came from.
I don't know your name.

26
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,555
But I have seen you do the impossible
to protect the city I love.

27
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:41,602
So for those of us who believe in you,
and what you're doing, I just wanna say:

28
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,645
Thank you.

29
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,066
Heh.

30
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,036
You're welcome.

31
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,458
How did you...? I literally just hit send.

32
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,667
Speed reading.

33
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,919
It's crazy what you can do to your voice.

34
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,673
You need to stop writing your blog.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,467
People need to know that you exist.

36
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,516
What else can you do?

37
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:27,147
- This is not an interview.
- Come on, you gotta give me something.

38
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,483
Hobbies, pet peeves, favorite color.

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,445
- Wait, scratch that last one. Red. Obviously.
- You're not hearing me.

40
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,740
My hearing is fine, it's just selective.

41
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,158
What should I call you?

42
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,454
Anything but the Streak.

43
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,540
Fine. Suggestions?

44
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,461
You said you were writing about me
to bring hope to someone you care about.

45
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,006
How would he feel if doing that
put you in harm's way?

46
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,552
He and I aren't exactly on the same page
these days.

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,971
Besides, you're giving hope
to a lot of people.

48
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,807
So I'm doing this for them.

49
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,773
To be continued. Gotta run.

50
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,902
Wait. You can't just leave me up...

51
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,405
Here. Wow.

52
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,992
Woo-hoo!

53
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:44,474
- What kind of a tool steals a yellow Humvee?
- What kind of tool buys a yellow Humvee?

54
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,644
- Get these people back.
- I need everybody back.

55
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,568
Son! Out of the way! Out of the way!

56
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,043
What the hell?

57
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,628
Eddie, Eddie.

58
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,633
Yeah.

59
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,270
Step out of the vehicle.

60
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,315
If you say so.

61
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,779
Uh-oh.

62
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,849
Looks like you were born to take a beating.

63
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,277
Check the math.
Your dispersal models don't correlate.

64
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,906
Uh, they do if you factor in the seasonal
fluctuations in reproduction cycles.

65
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,241
What are we debating?

66
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,410
The average number of bugs
Barry swallows in a day of running.

67
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,622
I look forward to seeing you accept
your Nobel.

68
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,753
Barry?

69
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,883
Barry, are you okay?

70
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,348
Thirteen fractures. That's a new record.
And that's just in your hand.

71
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:53,103
You also have a concussion,
three cracked ribs and a bruised spleen.

72
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,773
Even with your powers,
you'll need a few hours to heal.

73
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,780
- What exactly did you hit?
- A man. A big, bad man.

74
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,702
His skin changed when I hit him.
Like it turned to metal.

75
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,788
Interesting. A man of steel.

76
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,958
So you went after a meta-human alone?

77
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,003
- Dude, why didn't you call us?
- I didn't know what he was.

78
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,090
Besides, I was off duty.

79
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,217
Hmm.

80
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,430
Lucky he didn't knock out your teeth.
Those puppies don't grow back.

81
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:33,476
- Strange thing is I feel like I knew him.
- What do you mean?

82
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,438
He said something that was familiar.

83
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,526
But he's gonna hurt someone. So
how do I fight a guy that's made of steel?

84
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:47,032
- We will find a way. Tonight, you heal.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,209
There was lightning
in my house. Yellow-and-red lightning.

86
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,713
There was a man in yellow.
Then I was on the street.

87
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,924
I don't know how I got there.

88
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,217
Please, you have to believe me.

89
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,679
Hey.

90
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,558
- What happened to you last night?
- Got beat up by a steel-plated sociopath.

91
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,268
Good times.

92
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,272
- So he is meta-human.
- Yeah.

93
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,817
That particle accelerator
is the gift that keeps on giving.

94
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,904
- You okay?
- Relatively.

95
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,197
Any idea who he is?

96
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,616
Eddie's taking point
while I run down a lead.

97
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,452
- I need you to work with him until I get back.
- Why me?

98
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,247
Because he saw something impossible
that he's got questions about.

99
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,875
Questions that I can't answer.

100
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,754
In other words, make up
some science-y stuff to throw him off.

101
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,090
Exactly.

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,925
Heh.

103
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,845
He stole the Humvee and evaded capture.

104
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,557
So pleased you could join us, Mr. Allen.
Rough night?

105
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,977
Uh, just a little beat, sir.

106
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:02,399
As I was saying, our perp yanked
three ATMs after he boosted the vehicle.

107
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,152
ATM security cameras caught him on video.
We got a hit in the database.

108
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,616
Tony Woodward. History of violence, petty
theft, assault, going way back to juvie.

109
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,493
Dropped off the radar 10 months ago.

110
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,413
Looks like he's back.

111
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,292
Increased pressure produces heat, and if
you don't release it, you get combustion.

112
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,004
I don't know how do you remember
all this stuff, Barry.

113
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,715
Because he's a little freak.
Just like his old man.

114
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,634
- Don't talk about my dad.
- Or what?

115
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,511
Is he going to murder me too?

116
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,307
Looks like you were born
to take a beating, Allen.

117
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,105
Allen.

118
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,149
Hey, Allen.

119
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,525
- Hey.
- You okay?

120
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,318
Hey, yeah. Sorry, Eddie.

121
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:52,198
Listen, I saw something last night
I just can't get my head around.

122
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,616
Uh-huh.

123
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:59,497
I fired a dozen rounds at our car thief
and it was like they sparked off of him.

124
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,166
Huh.

125
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,420
Well, I mean, he must have been
wearing some kind of body armor.

126
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,963
On his face?

127
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,175
- Um...
- Hey.

128
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,594
Barry.

129
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,305
Hi, babe, I saw the news. Are you okay?

130
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,350
I'm fine. Which you'd know if you checked
your messages. I tried you three times.

131
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,521
Sorry, I had to work late.

132
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,859
Um, so I heard that the Streak saved a kid.
Any comment, detective?

133
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,111
All I know is our perp got away.

134
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,405
But Barry here is gonna help me find him.

135
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,740
- Yeah.
- Fine.

136
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,951
I have other sources.
I will see you tonight.

137
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,704
- Bye.
- Bye.

138
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,376
- What is going on with you two?
- What do you mean? Nothing.

139
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,464
It's fine. It's... It's fine. I don't know.

140
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,300
Okay.

141
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,144
- Dr. Wells.
- L1 guess you heard about...

142
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,981
Barry's incident last night. If you're
looking for him, he's at the station.

143
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,525
I came here to see you.

144
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,822
- I need your help solving an old case.
- What case is that?

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,241
The murder of Barry's mother.

146
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,042
Your childhood nemesis
is now an unstoppable meta-human.

147
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,296
- That is seriously messed up.
- I had a childhood nemesis.

148
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,466
Lexi La Roche.
She used to put gum in my hair.

149
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,759
Jake Puckett.

150
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,971
If I didn't let him copy my homework,
he'd give me a swirly.

151
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,682
Now that we've established
that we're all uber-nerds...

152
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,893
- what are we gonna do about Tony?
- Glad you asked.

153
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,897
We're gonna train you, man.
Karate Kid style.

154
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,816
Behold.

155
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,156
- I call him Girder.
- For the record, not my idea.

156
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,907
Fighting is physics.

157
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:02,537
It's not about strength, it's not about
size, it's about energy and power.

158
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,082
Channel your speed the right way,
you can totally take this bad boy down.

159
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:11,629
Now, obviously,
your Girder is a moving target.

160
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,007
So...

161
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,804
I have ice and bandages standing by.

162
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,489
I'm pretty sure
I just dislocated my shoulder.

163
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,454
Okay, not gonna lie. This is
gonna be quick but extremely painful.

164
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,252
Oh, speaking of pain. Eddie, hey.

165
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,380
We found the stolen Humvee
in the alley at Fremont and Lawrence.

166
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,218
- Need you down here to do your thing.
- Great, I'll see you in a sec.

167
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,180
Okay. Okay, let's do this.

168
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:08,144
So, Barry, when you said
you were off duty last night...

169
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,732
you weren't visiting Iris again,
you know, in disguise?

170
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,109
That would be reckless and a little creepy.

171
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,780
- Nope.
- Good.

172
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:27,705
- Allen, you really need a car.
- I usually manage on foot okay.

173
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,915
What do we got?

174
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,042
The rig Tony Woodward
boosted last night.

175
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,629
No sign of the stolen ATMs,
probably got those where he's holed up.

176
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,715
Though he's going to have
a hell of time breaking them open.

177
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,218
I wouldn't be so sure.

178
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,140
- So about you and Iris.
- Look, Eddie, we had a fight...

179
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,560
and I just don't really feel comfortable
talking about it with you.

180
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:54,232
I get that. And I get that you two
go way back.

181
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,026
To be honest,
I was a little threatened by you at first.

182
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,946
- You were threatened by me?
- Sure.

183
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,284
I mean, I've seen how close you two are,
but you seem like a good guy...

184
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,788
and Iris, I just want her to be happy.
From my experience...

185
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,959
- good friends are hard to find.
- Detective. Excuse me.

186
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,421
Sir, we ran the plates on that Humvee...

187
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,175
- Come on, Barry, you can do it.
- Bar, focus.

188
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,722
- I am.
- Son, son, you're getting frustrated.

189
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,142
You need to learn
how to control your emotions.

190
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,229
- Iris, come here, sweetie.
- You want me to hit a girl?

191
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,939
He wants you to try.

192
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,525
Relax, Barry, I've had her in gloves
since she was 6.

193
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,319
She's tougher than she looks.

194
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,121
Sorry, Barry.

195
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:59,464
Son, sometimes the best way
to win a fight is not to start one...

196
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,801
but if you do come up against somebody
you know you can't beat, be smart.

197
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,720
It's okay to run the other way.

198
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,347
All right?

199
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,265
So, what do you think?

200
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,517
Judging by the mud and kegs...

201
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:16,981
I'd say he got hammered,
stole a big-ass truck and went joy-riding.

202
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,860
I bet the kegs are stolen too. Rusty
Iron Ale. It's a microbrew right over in...

203
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,905
- Keystone. I know it. Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

204
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,090
Barry described a tornado
of red-and-yellow lightning...

205
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,884
inside a man in yellow.

206
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:49,263
Then, bam, he's blocks away, on the street,
doesn't know how he got there.

207
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,850
- When I arrived, the place was a wreck.
- Nora Allen is dead.

208
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,145
Single stab wound to the heart.
Henry Allen covered in her blood.

209
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,523
Despite all the evidence
that Henry is guilty...

210
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,860
now you believe this man in yellow
is responsible?

211
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,988
Last night I saw Barry rescue
a young boy from being run over...

212
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,659
and it looked exactly like
what Barry described happened to him.

213
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:14,247
It got me thinking, what if somebody
with Barry's abilities killed Nora?

214
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:21,754
There's one flaw with your theory, detective,
and that is all of this happened 14 years ago.

215
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,089
Which is long before...

216
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,217
- Your machine gave Barry powers.
- An accident gave Barry powers.

217
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:31,347
Do you think it is possible
that somebody with Barry's super speed...

218
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,516
could have existed before the explosion?

219
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,686
Detective, I deal in probabilities
as a scientist.

220
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:41,190
And in this case, it's highly unlikely.

221
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:54,412
Gentlemen. C.C.P.D. Any chance some of
your merchandise was stolen last night?

222
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,747
No. I don't think so.

223
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,625
How about this guy. You seen him?

224
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,465
You know Tony, don't you?

225
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,258
Hey.

226
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,138
Allen, come on.

227
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,031
- Allen, you okay?
- Oh, never better.

228
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,950
- Get up.
- Unh. I didn't do nothing, man.

229
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,243
So why did you run?

230
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,163
- Look, it was an accident.
- What was?

231
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,290
Tony falling, okay?

232
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:43,711
- But I swear to God, we didn't kill him.
- Keep talking.

233
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,547
About 10 months ago, Keystone Ironworks.

234
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:51,427
Boss was handing out pink slips.
Tony gets his and he just snapped.

235
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,056
He started beating the crap out of the guy.
We pulled him off.

236
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,267
Then the lights went out,
some kind of power surge...

237
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,438
and Tony went over the railing
right into a vat of molten scrap.

238
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,983
- Just gone.
- Lucky for you, he's still alive.

239
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,069
What?

240
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,947
- How did you get in front of us?
- Shortcut.

241
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,830
I've been meaning to ask you,
where's your shadow?

242
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,917
- What shadow?
- Barry.

243
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,879
- He hasn't been in all week.
- Getting his fix somewhere else.

244
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,173
Too bad. He's cute.

245
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,759
I kind of miss having him around.

246
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:37,473
Iris? Long time, no see.

247
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,482
I gotta say, Iris, you look amazing.

248
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:52,947
- Thanks, Tony. Um, you too.
- Oh. Yeah, I keep in shape.

249
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,158
Got a gym at my place.
Been living out in Keystone. The west side.

250
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,579
You should, uh, stop by sometime.

251
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,789
So, uh, can I get you a drink?

252
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,666
No, I came to see you.

253
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,670
- How did you know I was here?
- Been reading up on the Streak.

254
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,338
Found your little blog.

255
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,342
- Why are you writing about this guy?
- People say that he's a hero.

256
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,178
I say he's a coward.

257
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,182
I happen to know that he took a beating
last night and ran off like a little girl.

258
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,976
You should write about that.

259
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:27,982
Do you, uh, have any idea
who leather boy is?

260
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,525
No clue.

261
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,862
So, um, if you don't want to drink,
I should get back to work.

262
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,531
Actually, I'd prefer to buy you a drink.

263
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,950
What time are you off?

264
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,370
Thanks, Tony, but I don't think
my boyfriend would approve.

265
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:46,292
- He's a cop, like my dad.
- I never really did like cops too much.

266
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,044
Iris.

267
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,176
Well, he's picking me up
for the policeman's ball.

268
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,638
Wall-to-wall cops, can't swing a cat,
I should call to see where he is.

269
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,474
Give me the phone, Iris. Now!

270
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,900
Sorry.

271
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,487
For the damage.

272
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,864
We'll pick this up some other time.

273
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,085
Barry. Check it out.

274
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,006
The gravel you pulled from Tony's ride?
It contains 76.8 percent hematite...

275
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,926
consistent with the mines
at Keystone Ironworks.

276
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:41,055
Which closed down 10 months ago.
It's the perfect hideout.

277
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,433
Barry? Do you mind telling me about this?

278
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,020
"I have info about someone
you're looking for. He was here.

279
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,939
You know where to find me."

280
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,859
Now who could she be talking to?

281
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,919
- I guess you got my message.
- Are you okay?

282
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,130
Cop's daughter. I can handle myself.

283
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,758
- Not with this guy.
- I knew him when we were kids.

284
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,302
He didn't want to hurt me.
He wanted to impress me.

285
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,222
But he is fixated on you
and not in a good way.

286
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,932
Do you know where he went?

287
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,309
Said he had a place in West Keystone.

288
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,479
Bragged about how big it was,
but I have no idea where.

289
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,607
- I do.
- Wait. There's something else.

290
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,943
His hand, it transformed.

291
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,487
Like an iron fist.

292
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,825
- He's like you, isn't he?
- Yes.

293
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,494
And writing about me
is what brought him to you.

294
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,621
- I know but maybe I can talk to him...
- No.

295
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,998
He's too dangerous.

296
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:57,381
Damn, that's my ride.
Eddie insisted on a detail. I have to...

297
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,175
go.

298
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,013
Barry, talk to us. What are you doing?

299
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,896
Dude, don't run angry.
We don't know how to defeat him yet.

300
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

301
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,977
This is definitely the place.

302
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,441
You're trespassing, freak.

303
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,571
There's nowhere left to run.

304
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,412
- Barry?
- Barry, where are you?

305
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,581
Caitlin, over here.

306
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,375
Barry?

307
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,671
Please say something.
Say something so we know you're okay.

308
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,842
- Ow.
- Get him out of there.

309
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,762
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?

310
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,682
I told you that we would figure out
a way to deal with him.

311
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,184
- I'll heal.
- You can't heal when you're dead.

312
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,938
- He could have killed you.
- I know, all right? I know.

313
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,275
In the past 36 hours,
I've had my ass handed to me twice...

314
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,277
by the guy that tortured me as a kid.

315
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,946
I couldn't stop him then
and I can't stop him now.

316
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,907
Even with my powers,
I'm still powerless against him.

317
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,910
Not necessarily. Cisco.

318
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,248
Any material,
if struck at a high enough velocity...

319
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,750
can be compromised.

320
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,628
We ran an analysis on the metal
in Tony's footprint.

321
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:04,717
Based on its density and atomic structure,
if you impact it at just the right angle...

322
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,053
at just the right speed,
you could do some serious damage.

323
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,975
- How fast would I have to go?
- Factoring in the metal's tensile strength...

324
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,645
estimated dermal thickness,
atmospheric pressure, air temp...

325
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,690
you'd have to hit
him at approximately...

326
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,818
Mach 1.1.

327
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,988
You want Barry to hit something
at 800 miles an hour?

328
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,992
- Eight hundred thirty-seven, actually.
- That's faster than the speed of sound.

329
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,998
I know. He would create a sonic boom,
which, as I said before, would be awesome.

330
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,500
- I've never gone that fast.
- Yet.

331
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,338
I can't believe we're actually
entertaining this idea.

332
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,341
I mean, he'd need a straight shot
from miles away.

333
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,177
Yeah, 5.3 miles, theoretically.

334
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,888
Do it right, you'll take him down.

335
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:57,311
Do it wrong,
you'll shatter every bone in your body.

336
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,945
- Barry.
- Joe, I've been beaten enough for one day.

337
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,030
- I gotta...
- Hey, wait.

338
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,116
An anonymous tip led us
to Tony Woodward's hideout.

339
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,077
The place was trashed. What happened?

340
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,955
He showed up at Jitters to see Iris.
I had to go after him.

341
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,207
- Iris? Where is she?
- She's fine, she's fine.

342
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,292
Eddie put a detail on her to be safe.

343
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,545
I thought I could handle him this time.
I tried.

344
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,382
Look, I know what this punk
put you through...

345
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,259
but you can't let emotion
cloud your judgment.

346
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,139
Toll-booth camera got a shot of Woodward.
Stolen car headed out of town.

347
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,476
State police are taking over. We lost him.

348
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,561
Don't worry, Eddie. They'll get him.

349
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,982
- I wanted to take this guy down.
- Not half as much as I did.

350
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,235
- Let's go, Allen.
- Go where?

351
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,862
Blow off some steam.
I need to hit something.

352
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,657
- What?
- I don't think he meant hit you. Go.

353
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,753
So I heard you and this Woodward guy
have a history.

354
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,173
Hey, Allen, it's okay.

355
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,759
Trust me, I had my fair share of bullies
at school.

356
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,720
Somehow I find that hard to believe.

357
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:19,101
I was short, fat, and the son of a politician
who closed a factory in my school district.

358
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,937
So not so popular.

359
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,568
So, what did you do about it?

360
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,779
I got my ass kicked. A lot.

361
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:35,117
Until my gym coach took pity on me. Ha, ha.

362
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,953
She said the key to fighting is patience.

363
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,455
Here.

364
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,833
A lot of guys waste energy
trying to land the most punches.

365
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,461
All it takes is one.

366
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,546
But you gotta make it count.

367
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,090
Choose your spot and drive through it.

368
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,468
Like it's 6 inches behind the target.

369
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,727
Harder.

370
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,357
Harder.

371
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,243
The seam was starting to split.

372
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,168
Appreciate you coming down.

373
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:31,340
Mm. These days, it's rare to find someone
happy to have a drink with me.

374
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,929
Well, our conversation yesterday
got me thinking.

375
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,932
You said as a scientist,
you look for the probable.

376
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,141
That's right.

377
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:46,105
And we've both recently seen things
that have redefined what is possible.

378
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,150
Yes, we have, and we both know
the direct cause of those things.

379
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,111
Your accelerator explosion.

380
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,864
Evolutionary leaps follow the creation
of new technologies. It's that simple.

381
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,201
Like the Roomba. Ha-ha-ha.

382
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,371
Yes, like the Roomba.

383
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,293
So humor me here.

384
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,672
If we know that...

385
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,217
meta-humans were created
by the particle accelerator...

386
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,804
and testimony shows that a meta-human
may have been involved...

387
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,015
in the murder of Barry Allen's mother
14 years ago...

388
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,185
it seems to me that way back then...

389
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,981
there must have been
another particle accelerator.

390
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,944
Another particle accelerator?

391
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,237
Mm.

392
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:39,825
I can assure you that's extremely unlikely,
detective, and if there were...

393
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,537
I don't recall any dark-matter
lightning storms before I moved to town.

394
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,872
Do you?

395
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,083
No.

396
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,418
No, I don't.

397
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,256
When did you move to town, Dr. Wells?

398
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:07,936
Something tells me that you already know
the answer to that question, detective.

399
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,107
This whole "help you solve
the murder of Nora Allen"...

400
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,612
You were never looking for my help,
were you?

401
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,949
You opened your lab
a month after Nora Allen's murder.

402
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,286
You mind telling me what you were doing
in Central City before that?

403
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,126
I was starting over.

404
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,128
Starting what over?

405
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:41,303
Well, here I thought we were just
two guys having a friendly drink.

406
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,765
You want answers, detective?
Tess Morgan. Look her up.

407
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,530
Unit 52, this is Dispatch.
Requesting status on the West house.

408
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,794
Hey, Iris.

409
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,098
- Nice, Allen. All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

410
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,183
Hey, next time work on your speed.

411
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,561
Yeah. I'll do my best.

412
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,021
Thawne, Allen.

413
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,857
The unit watching Joe's daughter,
they've been attacked.

414
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,776
Iris is missing.

415
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,570
Go, all right? I'll call Joe.

416
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,203
Let's adjust the impact angle by
0.2 degrees, up the speed to 838...

417
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,539
Bam.

418
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,876
- Ouch.
- Ouch?

419
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,213
- Guys, you there?
- Yeah, man. What's up?

420
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,717
Tony took Iris. I need you to do
whatever you can to help me find her.

421
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,636
- Satellites, security cameras, hack them all.
- We're on it.

422
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,890
What's wrong?

423
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,443
Remember this place, Iris?

424
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,987
So, what's the plan here, Tony?

425
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,072
Finally gonna go for that G.E.D.?

426
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,908
You want a plan?
You used to write about the Streak, right?

427
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,953
- Now you're gonna write about me.
- You just abducted me, Tony.

428
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,124
- Why would I do that?
- Because the Streak is dead.

429
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,667
- No.
- Yeah.

430
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,961
Squashed like a little bug, by me.

431
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,298
If you don't want the same thing
to happen to you, tell the world...

432
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,217
that there's a new big man on campus!

433
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,511
And I'm just getting started.

434
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,098
You could have anybody
write about you, Tony. Why me?

435
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,268
Because I like you, Iris. Always have.

436
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,816
You should have said something.

437
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,366
You try anything like that again
and I'm gonna leave more than a bruise.

438
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,952
Eddie, anything yet?

439
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,164
We have roadblocks on every major artery.
Units are searching.

440
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,957
We will find Iris, Joe.

441
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,382
You don't think he'll hurt her, do you?

442
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,302
Sir. Sir. We got a fire alarm call
at Carmichael Elementary.

443
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,638
Dispatch the fire department.
We'll send backup.

444
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,140
- That's the school you and Iris went to.
- And Tony.

445
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,017
Go.

446
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,069
Tony, turn yourself in before
things get worse. It's not too late.

447
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,821
Yeah, it is.

448
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,489
Cops are already looking for me.

449
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,158
So get ready to cover
the showdown of a lifetime...

450
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,869
because I'm not
going out without a fight.

451
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,791
Good, because you just found one.

452
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,085
You just won't stay dead.

453
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,671
Come to save your little fangirl?

454
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,674
This is between us. Let her go.

455
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:14,683
Oh, I could. But I'd rather make her watch
while I break every bone in your body.

456
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,528
- Wait here.
- Okay.

457
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,868
Too slow, Tin Man.

458
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,209
I've known guys like you.
Peaked in high school, never got over it.

459
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:46,047
All these powers, and look at you.
Bully then, bully now.

460
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,357
He's hurt.

461
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,736
No!

462
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,873
If you do come up against somebody
you know you can't beat, be smart.

463
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,500
It's okay to run the other way.

464
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,926
There goes your hero.

465
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,600
He made it out. Barely.

466
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,151
- Why did he stop?
- He's miles away.

467
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,655
5.3 miles away.

468
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,960
- Barry, wait.
- No way. He's gonna do it.

469
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,462
Go, man, go!

470
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,656
Supersonic punch, baby! Whoo!

471
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,337
Nice cross.

472
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,008
- I think I broke my hand.
- Me too.

473
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,267
Hey!

474
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,937
What is this? Where the hell am I?

475
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,024
Somewhere you'll never hurt anyone
ever again.

476
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,735
Who the hell do you think you are?

477
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,031
You know who I am.

478
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,743
Allen?

479
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:24,372
The thing that happened to you, Tony,
it happened to me too.

480
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:29,794
But it didn't just give us abilities.
It made us more of who we are.

481
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,296
You got strong.

482
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,798
I got fast.

483
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,926
Fast enough to beat you.

484
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,931
You used your gift to hurt people.

485
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,892
Not anymore.

486
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,645
Allen.

487
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,438
Allen.

488
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,650
Allen, don't walk away from me, Allen!
Hey! Come back here!

489
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,735
Allen! Allen!

490
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,115
Dude. That had to feel great.

491
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,910
- You have no idea.
- Almost as good as proving me wrong...

492
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,495
about the supersonic punch?

493
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:07,290
Actually, that part hurt. Like, a lot.

494
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,251
But I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

495
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,923
All I wanna know is, which childhood bully
are we gonna take down next?

496
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,675
- Mine or Caitlin's?
- Oh, yeah.

497
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,303
I vote mine. What?
Guys, this is not a joke.

498
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,849
- Doctor.
- Detective.

499
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,310
Are you here to make more accusations?

500
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm here to make amends.

501
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,858
I looked up Tess Morgan.

502
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,070
Sorry for your loss.

503
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,289
You two were research partners
in Maryland?

504
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:53,461
Yes, we were. We were married to the work
as much as to each other.

505
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:59,134
After the car accident,
I could not go back to the work.

506
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,636
Could not go back to our lab.

507
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:02,971
So you moved here.

508
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,308
Where no one knew me.

509
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,312
Where no one could remind me
of what I had lost.

510
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:21,156
And I've found it difficult.

511
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,325
Starting over, you know...

512
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,995
rebuilding.

513
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:32,083
And what took me 14 years,
Tess could have done in four.

514
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,044
Believe me, she...

515
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,011
At the time of Nora Allen's murder...

516
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,222
the particle accelerator
that I would eventually create...

517
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,225
was but a notion, much less a reality.

518
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:53,605
And so whomever,
or whatever is responsible for her death...

519
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,858
it did not originate from me
or from my work.

520
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,279
I'm sorry I doubted you.

521
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,784
But I hope I can still count on your help.

522
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,126
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope.

523
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,045
Not till I get my man.

524
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,963
I owe that to Barry and to Henry.

525
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,386
Barry is lucky to have
you on his side, Joe.

526
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,897
Yeah I knew that you saw me
You laughed when I looked back.

527
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,816
Hi.

528
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,070
Oh, I thought that you were someone else.

529
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,993
So Joe told me what happened.

530
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,579
How's the hand?

531
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,708
Not broken, so that's something. Heh.

532
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,504
Do you want to get understood?

533
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,758
- I should have believe...
- I'm sorry I said...

534
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,095
I've missed you.

535
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,639
Yeah, I've missed you too.

536
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,144
When I heard Tony took you, I...

537
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,357
I just... I don't know what I would do
if anything happened to you.

538
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:24,279
Well, my guardian angel
is looking out for me.

539
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,449
Do you wanna hang out, catch up?

540
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,119
Yeah. I would like that, yeah.

541
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,454
I promise not to talk about
the Streak tonight.

542
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,957
No, I want you to. No, I mean, you can...

543
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,710
I want you to talk about
whatever you wanna talk about.

544
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,338
- I know it's important to you.
- Good, because it's not just the Streak.

545
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,966
There are others out
there that are like him.

546
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:50,013
I've gotten scattered posts about this guy
that's on fire, except that he doesn't burn up.

547
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,681
Okay, wait, wait.

548
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,225
You're trying to find
the Burning Man now too?

549
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,021
Yeah, why not? I mean, a lot can happen
in a week, especially with the Streak.

550
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,522
Yeah.

551
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,317
I've been trying to get answers.
Where does he come from?

552
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,570
How does he do what he does?
But he dodges everything, literally...

553
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,324
with this super-speed power.

554
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,577
When he moves, Barry,
you don't even see him.

555
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,913
He comes and goes in the blink of an eye,
in a...

556
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,331
Flash?

557
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,838
In a flash.

558
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,763
Yeah. Heh.

559
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,729
Today, I was saved by the impossible.
A mystery man.

560
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,356
The fastest man alive.

561
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,943
Then a friend gave me an idea
for a new name.

562
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,989
And something tells me it's gonna catch on.

563
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:58,013
