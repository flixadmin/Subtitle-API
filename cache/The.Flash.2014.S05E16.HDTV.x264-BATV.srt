1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:01,595
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:03,835
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,143
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,146 --> 00:00:07,037
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,405
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,074
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,832
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:12,933
like me.

9
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:15,310
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

10
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:17,431
she changed the present

11
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,343
and now our world is
more dangerous than ever

12
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:22,855
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

13
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,361
I am the Flash.

14
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:27,832
Previously on "The Flash"...

15
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:28,865
Save her.

16
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:31,187
Our life is a million times
better than what it was

17
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,023
and it's all because of you, Gracie.

18
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:34,191
Got you some groceries

19
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:35,653
and some meloxicam for your injuries.

20
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:37,067
We call it the cure.

21
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,222
It's a serum that suppresses
dark matter in meta-humans.

22
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:41,870
You're the first person to take it.

23
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:44,459
I think we should offer
the cure to Cicada.

24
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,179
From the journal of Nora West-Allen:

25
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:49,372
"Timeline is malleable."

26
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:51,093
Why is she hiding this interest?

27
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,721
Tell me you know what you're doing.

28
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:55,210
I am the only speedster
who knows what he's doing!

29
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,605
Stick with the plan.

30
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:10,411
The cure is finished, and it works.

31
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:11,787
Now we can use it on Dwyer,

32
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,897
and then his connection to
the dagger will be broken.

33
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,919
What's wrong?

34
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,589
The timeline.

35
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:25,824
I've charted this timeline
from Anthro the First Boy

36
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:27,276
to Kamandi the Last.

37
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,455
I know all of it.

38
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,287
I know its crests, I know its valleys,

39
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,958
I know what we must do to defeat Cicada.

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,178
Or rather, I knew.

41
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,602
This is a photo of the
last public sighting

42
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:40,785
of Flash and Cicada.

43
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:42,628
Their final confrontation.

44
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,042
Dad's last chance to
use the cure on Cicada.

45
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:46,947
I've been trying to
engineer a moment like this

46
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:50,939
- the whole time I've been there.
- Now, watch.

47
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,287
See this?

48
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:58,291
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through,

49
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:01,945
manifesting itself
right before our eyes.

50
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:04,706
Is it a good timeline,
or is it a bad timeline?

51
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,712
That doesn't matter.

52
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:08,801
What matters is it's new
and, as such, unpredictable,

53
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:11,955
and we may lose our
window of opportunity.

54
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:15,125
So we need to find Cicada
before the timeline changes.

55
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,503
Why did it change?

56
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,222
Did I screw something up?

57
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,173
No.

58
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:25,986
No, no.

59
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:28,155
You've done very well, little runner.

60
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:32,567
But a new variable is coming,
something big is coming.

61
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,986
Or someone.

62
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,075
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

63
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,932
Well, it's interesting
that you say that, sir,

64
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,593
since it's your company that's denying

65
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:46,929
the Robertson family's claim.

66
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:50,058
Yes, of course, I have the
contract right in front of me.

67
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,188
And it says that animal attacks

68
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,182
do not fall under Acts of God,

69
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:58,960
and that includes gorillas.

70
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,046
The Citizen looks
forward to your statement.

71
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,774
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:05,434
Are you ready to do this thing now?

73
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,102
Hell yeah, we just got to find Nora.

74
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,529
It's her big day after all.

75
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:10,063
You don't think she's too busy, do you?

76
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,681
Okay, people, think!

77
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,608
We haven't seen Cicada
since the rooftop fight,

78
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,685
which means the only way to
track him down is to figure out

79
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:17,479
who his next meta-human
target's gonna be.

80
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,729
Have we double checked
every bank robbery,

81
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,949
every lab break-in?

82
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:23,416
Yes, yes! We have looked
at all of that, all right?

83
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,403
And all the criminals
that are in custody

84
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,122
are simply mere mortals.

85
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,342
What about the ones on the street?

86
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,177
Frost says that no
new metas have shown up

87
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,698
since Norvock went into witsec.

88
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,697
Are the satellites
tracking for dark matter

89
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,583
or meta-gene bursts or Element X?

90
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,140
Yes, yes, and yes.

91
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,098
They're scanning for everything.

92
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,244
Congratulations, you raised a menace.

93
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:43,312
Your daughter, so energetic.

94
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:46,882
This is pretty impressive.

95
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,804
Um, and I... and I know
with the cure working,

96
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,776
we're all ready to put Cicada to rest,

97
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,514
but I'm sure he'll resurface soon.

98
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:55,558
And then you're going
to give him the chance

99
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,929
to take the meta-human cure?

100
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,365
Yes, exactly.

101
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,559
Even Dwyer deserves a choice,

102
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,512
we just got to convince
him to do the right thing.

103
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:03,659
Are you ready?

104
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:05,535
This is gonna be one of
the biggest challenges

105
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,920
of your career as a hero.

106
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:08,423
Do you know what you're going to say?

107
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,836
Oh, yeah... you know, yeah.

108
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,346
I've... I've got some loose thoughts.

109
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,332
Oh, great.

110
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,461
Well, that instills all of
us with confidence, right?

111
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:23,178
Loose thoughts? What
are you going to say?

112
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,421
"Hey, most bloodthirsty enemy! Stop."

113
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:28,613
Guys, it worked for Marlize.

114
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,486
Maybe not so much for Savitar, but...

115
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:33,263
I will figure out what
to say to him, all right?

116
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,448
I got this.

117
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,733
I know you do, Dad.

118
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:39,043
Which is why we need to try
everything to try and find him.

119
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,086
Okay?

120
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,366
Maybe we should go on patrol?

121
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,358
Patrol, you say? What
this is, World War II?

122
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,338
Oh, wow. Wow, this is crazy.

123
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,771
There is something nuts
going on at Jitters.

124
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:49,836
Do you think it's a meta-human?

125
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,823
Probably. You should...

126
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,992
- We should check it out.
- Yeah.

127
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,094
- For sure.
- Yeah.

128
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:56,470
- Mm-hmm. Y-yeah. Go!
- I'm... oh!

129
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,832
- You two did this.
- You made her.

130
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,933
You are responsible.

131
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:14,822
Well, well, well.

132
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:17,658
It is nice to see
someone back at his desk

133
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,517
Oh, hey, Foxy.

134
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,756
It's good to be back.

135
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,854
After three months of sipping
Wally's Tibetan butter tea,

136
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,667
I actually kind of missed
this break room coffee.

137
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,035
Ugh. Uh-uh.

138
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,507
Hey, you have any idea
where I can get my hands

139
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,321
on the Cicada task force file?

140
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,040
Babe, you're standing in it.

141
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,375
What?

142
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,161
I've been trying to catch
up on what I've been missing.

143
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,356
Oh.

144
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,497
Uh, speaking of which...

145
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,016
you ever seen this woman?

146
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,969
Uh, Dr. Vanessa Ambres.

147
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,587
Born and raised in Central City,

148
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,839
got her MD from McNider U.

149
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,591
Oh, that's interesting.

150
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:53,927
This says she treated Orlin
Dwyer and Grace Gibbons

151
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:55,404
on the night of the Enlightenment.

152
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:58,430
Yes, and she has been
treating Grace ever since,

153
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,241
even though she's an ER doctor,

154
00:06:00,244 --> 00:06:02,894
and the nurses report a
whole slew of drugs missing

155
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:03,908
from the coma ward.

156
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:05,438
You think she's working with Dwyer?

157
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:07,948
The guy got stabbed,
struck by lightning.

158
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,228
He's got a hole in his chest.

159
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:11,377
Somebody has got to be
patching him up, right?

160
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,682
I think we should be asking
the doctor a few questions.

161
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:16,866
All right, let's do it.

162
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:18,534
Oh, you want to come with?

163
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:20,253
Yeah, I want to come with. What?

164
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,962
Uh, yeah, yeah.

165
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,798
- Yeah!
- All right, partner.

166
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,893
- Partner. I like that.
- Yeah.

167
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:29,224
Okay, I thought something big

168
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,677
was supposed to be going on down here.

169
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,612
Oh, I don't know. It's pretty big.

170
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:38,553
Feast your eyes on the newest
addition to the Jitters menu.

171
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,725
The XS-presso.

172
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:43,893
I got my own drink!

173
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,233
It's pretty schway, right?

174
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:47,730
Think of what could be next.

175
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,875
An XS action figure? XS Day?

176
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,826
Guys, you are embarrassing me.

177
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,085
We're just really excited.

178
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,320
I mean, we still haven't
even gone on a trip together

179
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:58,116
or made Grandma Esther's
famous sweet potato pie recipe.

180
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,993
Did you put karaoke on
the list like I asked?

181
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:01,178
I think so, actually.

182
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,041
Just a sec... Let me see this.

183
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,126
Okay, there are so many
things on this list.

184
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,861
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I mean, we've got time.

185
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:12,143
Okay, is that a real
alert or another fake one?

186
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:13,145
No, this one's real.

187
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,974
M-20 at CCU, Chemistry Department.

188
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,018
- A meta attack.
- Yeah, let's go. Come on.

189
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:24,361
Been a while since high school chem,

190
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:27,028
but that does not look
like proper lab safety.

191
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,815
I need this! Leave me alone!

192
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,709
Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes any acid.

193
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,618
You have the cuffs?

194
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:52,721
Let's go get him.

195
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,556
- We don't need to.
- What?

196
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,108
Look at this burn mark.

197
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:00,988
That acid guy, he...
He must've been there

198
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,250
when the photo was taken.

199
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:03,982
What are you talking about?

200
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,852
Dad, today's the day you stop Cicada.

201
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:15,458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Say that again?

202
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,683
There's a photo, it's
in The Flash museum,

203
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:19,844
of Flash and Cicada... the
last time they were ever seen

204
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:21,281
confronting each other in public,

205
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:23,243
and in the photo, by Flash's feet,

206
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:25,794
the exact same burn
mark left by the meta

207
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,866
that we just fought.

208
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,539
This acid meta was at
their final confrontation?

209
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,542
He must be Cicada's final target.

210
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,428
His final target before I vanish

211
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,653
and he starts killing again.

212
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:38,215
Why is Nora just telling us
about this crucial meta now?

213
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:41,528
Because a lot of the
stuff from my timeline

214
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,747
is unreliable.

215
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,721
You know, uh, different
metas, different victims,

216
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,933
different circumstances.

217
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,170
But this time, everything's
exactly the same.

218
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:49,352
So far.

219
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,371
If Cicada goes after this acid meta,

220
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,448
that means that today's the last day

221
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,908
we're going to confront him.

222
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,285
And our last chance to stop him.

223
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,071
Yeah, all right, well, then,
I gotta figure out exactly

224
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,450
what I'm gonna say to him.

225
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,533
You'll find the words,
Dad. I'll help you.

226
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,762
And I am going to start
working on facial rec

227
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:07,296
for this Acid Master.

228
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,590
Yup, that's what I'm going with.

229
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,987
Always trust your gut, kids.

230
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,052
And we'll figure out a way
for you to talk to Cicada

231
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:13,801
without him killing you.

232
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:19,549
Well...

233
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:22,402
if it all works out, then...

234
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:26,264
looks like today could
be the end of our journey.

235
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,358
Yeah.

236
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,560
And I guess everyone starts moving on.

237
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,831
- Nora.
- Oh, hey, Mom.

238
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,160
Um, look, I've really
gotta hurry and go help Dad.

239
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,754
Yeah, I know, it's just...

240
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,907
I guess you might be
going home tomorrow.

241
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,232
Yeah, I guess so. Um,
mission accomplished.

242
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:47,894
Well, if you two need
a break after a while,

243
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,580
Papa Joe taught me the
famous West family right hook.

244
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:52,224
I-I would love to teach you.

245
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,926
- Nora?
- Sorry, uh, sorry, Mom.

246
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,105
I just, uh, thought of something

247
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:00,235
that's going to help
Dad... I-I got to go.

248
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,780
Babe, this is a first!

249
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,598
We've worked together before.

250
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,024
We have, Detective,

251
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,285
but anytime we did
anything even close to this,

252
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,529
I didn't have my abilities.

253
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:18,624
Okay, here we go.

254
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:22,528
Uh, if I fiddle with my ring, you know,

255
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,322
assume that means she's lying

256
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,295
and then you just get
in there and, mm, mm,

257
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:27,129
do your thing.

258
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:29,027
You cop it up.

259
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,465
Prednisone, sirolimus, abatacept.

260
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,791
All drugs classified
as immunosuppressants.

261
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,553
They also happen to have
all been reported stolen

262
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,673
from this facility.

263
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:40,972
I'm aware of the report.

264
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,368
What I'm wondering is why it
warrants the interest of the DA?

265
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,130
We believe that the missing medications

266
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,846
are connected to a much
higher profile case.

267
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,489
Orlin Dwyer.

268
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,682
Grace Gibbons' uncle.

269
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,494
Is he still at large? I
don't really watch the news.

270
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,620
Yes, he's very much at large.

271
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:01,692
And we have reason to believe
that those exact medications

272
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,912
are the ones that Dwyer would
need to treat his injuries.

273
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,245
What are you saying exactly?

274
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,052
The records of the stolen meds

275
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:10,997
continued after Dwyer
stopped visiting the hospital.

276
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,662
Which means that someone here

277
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,497
may be still supplying them to him.

278
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,374
Sounds like a good theory,

279
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,875
but I don't know who that could be.

280
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,143
Everything I know is in those reports.

281
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,049
Okay, okay.

282
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,425
That's enough for now.

283
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:28,195
Thank you very much for your time.

284
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,447
Of course.

285
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:32,065
What are you doing?

286
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,808
You're just gonna let
her walk away like that?

287
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,726
I-I didn't want to scare her.

288
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,312
We don't have enough evidence.
We don't even have a motive.

289
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:41,208
So, then, let me keep doing my thing!

290
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,117
I'm not used to going into an interview

291
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,076
factoring in your meta-abilities.

292
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,955
I-I'm used to going in using my gut.

293
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,864
What about my gut?

294
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:52,159
All due respect, this
isn't about your gut.

295
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,386
Huh.

296
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,296
Look, Cecile, what I meant to say was...

297
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,723
No, no, no, no, no, no, Joe.

298
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,633
You said exactly what you meant,

299
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,393
and you know what, right now,

300
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:02,736
I'm about to say something that I mean.

301
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:05,423
Maybe we shouldn't be working
on this together after all.

302
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,143
Oh, man.

303
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,627
Okay, the clock's ticking,

304
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,722
and we have no clue
how to convince Cicada

305
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:13,678
to take the cure,

306
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:16,267
but we still have our best weapon.

307
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,578
- Your journal.
- Your legacy.

308
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,438
One of the biggest
things history remembers

309
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,998
about The Flash is your ability

310
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,084
to change people's hearts and minds,

311
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,603
especially your enemy's,

312
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,237
and I have dozens of
entries about those times.

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,923
Any chance you've got the future words

314
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,227
I say to Cicada in there?

315
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,760
Nope, but I have your past words.

316
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:37,246
Magenta, she wanted to drop
an oil tanker on a hospital,

317
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,340
but you convinced her
she was a good person.

318
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,319
You said, "Use that
good to beat the bad."

319
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:45,264
Magenta had split personalities.

320
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,440
She literally had a
good side and a bad side.

321
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,133
That's not gonna work with Cicada.

322
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,367
Leonard Snart,

323
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,054
he said he didn't want to be saved

324
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:55,127
and you still found a way to
convince him to save himself.

325
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,801
"There's a part of you that knows

326
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:58,933
you don't have to let
your past define you."

327
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:03,147
Except Snart had already
worked with us at that point.

328
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,651
Killer Frost, you dared her to kill you.

329
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,694
"Come on, live up to
your name, Killer Frost!"

330
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,154
- And what did she do?
- Nora.

331
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,040
Amunet, Plastique, the
list goes on and on.

332
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:16,249
Nora, all... all of these
times are... are different.

333
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:19,288
Cicada doesn't even care if
he lives when this is over.

334
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,550
What am I supposed to
say that he'll care about?

335
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,961
You'll know. The Flash always knows.

336
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:35,396
So, when you think about
it, an anti-dampening array

337
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,065
is the way to stop him in his tracks.

338
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,233
Sherloque, are you happy
to be going home soon?

339
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,726
Of course I'm happy to go back.

340
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:42,904
I just feel that...

341
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,096
somehow there's more
work to be done here.

342
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:48,168
I think he's, uh, talking
about his lady friend.

343
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,362
You know, I have a bit of
experience with these, uh,

344
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,155
long-distance relationships.

345
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:55,658
I got one word for you: holo-cube.

346
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,026
These things work wonders.

347
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,934
And I request that you stop
speaking possibly forever.

348
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,196
I can deduce from your
conversation when you came in

349
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,792
that you have indeed tracked
down Cicada's next target

350
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,853
but do need help
facilitating the conversation

351
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,290
between Cicada and The Flash.

352
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:09,597
Correct? Yes? Oh, good.

353
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,465
Come with me and I will
give you the solution.

354
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,259
When did you figure it out?

355
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,774
I will miss you both very much.

356
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:23,812
But you will miss me more! Allez!

357
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:29,001
Philip Master!

358
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:51,547
We good?

359
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:54,517
Yes, Philip Master is
secure in the pipeline.

360
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,904
Wait, Acid Master's real
name is Philip Master?

361
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:01,223
This is it. Just like in the photo.

362
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:04,393
The last confrontation
between Flash and Cicada.

363
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,659
Oh, what's the matter?

364
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:12,751
You don't have one of these?

365
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:15,463
Bye-bye.

366
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,759
Cicada!

367
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,595
How long does he have?

368
00:15:26,598 --> 00:15:29,918
He has to hold that dagger
for 60 seconds, maybe less.

369
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,105
Flash better figure out
what he's going to say fast.

370
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:34,256
He will. I know he will.

371
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:35,966
I don't want to fight.

372
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:39,970
We have a cure.

373
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,473
What are you talking about?

374
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,810
We have a way to cure meta-humans.

375
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,646
We have a way to take their powers away.

376
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,958
We want you to take it.

377
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,037
And why would I agree to do that?

378
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:04,620
Your legacy.

379
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,549
I know how this ends.

380
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,885
You keep killing,

381
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,129
and you're remembered
as a monster, not a hero.

382
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:15,965
But we can change that together,

383
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,175
you can have a different legacy.

384
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,819
You just have to choose it.

385
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,672
I don't give a damn about my legacy.

386
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,362
That was it. That was our last chance.

387
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,767
We ran citywide facial recognition scans

388
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,393
and scanned for dark matter signals

389
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:19,679
from Cicada's dagger.

390
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:21,604
That was our last shot
at confronting Cicada.

391
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,856
We don't know that.

392
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,442
We're changing the timeline.

393
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:26,252
That photo that Nora
saw at the Flash museum,

394
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,495
it could be different now.

395
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:28,671
Maybe it doesn't even exist.

396
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:33,200
After all... the timeline is malleable.

397
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,243
I just don't understand
why our plan didn't work.

398
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:39,581
Yeah, you guys did everything right.

399
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,600
The only reason it didn't work

400
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,143
is because I couldn't convince him.

401
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:43,961
Dad, you're the Flash.

402
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,681
When the Flash speaks honestly
from his heart, people listen.

403
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:50,318
Not all people.

404
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,611
Let's keep searching.

405
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,138
I'm gonna check the
Cicada files at CCPD.

406
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,823
See if I missed anything.

407
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:01,454
Nora.

408
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,605
We just... we just need to create

409
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,649
another window of opportunity, okay?

410
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,543
Dad couldn't convince
Cicada to take the cure.

411
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:11,339
He just... he just needs
to find the right words.

412
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,472
Bare.

413
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,886
What are you doing here so late?

414
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,791
We hit a wall at S.T.A.R.
Labs tracking Cicada.

415
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:26,837
Thought a change of
scenery would help, but...

416
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,631
Keep your head up, man.

417
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,485
We'll find him. We always do.

418
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:36,730
Honestly, I'm more worried
about what happens when we do.

419
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:41,018
Our whole plan depends on me
being able to convince Dwyer

420
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,645
to just take the cure.

421
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,311
The last time I tried...

422
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:48,983
I don't think I've
ever struck out so hard.

423
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:50,527
Wow, that's saying a lot

424
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,553
considering your track
record at the plate.

425
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,675
Wait, what exactly did you say to him?

426
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:00,537
That he was creating a legacy of fear,

427
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,349
one that would go down in history,

428
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:08,020
but that we could work
together to change that.

429
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,840
That sounds like something
the Flash would say.

430
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,151
Well, I am the Flash.

431
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,694
Look, that man's a zealot.

432
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:15,841
He sees you in that suit

433
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:17,720
and all he sees is the thing he hates.

434
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,106
Meta-human, superpowers,

435
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,852
the thing that took
his niece away from him.

436
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,776
He can't see past the Flash,

437
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,169
but what he doesn't know...

438
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,372
There's a whole lot
more to you than that.

439
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:30,896
Be more Barry Allen. Human.

440
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:33,904
Yeah, you're right.

441
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,864
Thanks. I'm gonna dive back in.

442
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:37,895
I'll let you get back
to running down Ambres.

443
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,627
Actually...

444
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,746
me and Cecile ran into a wall ourselves.

445
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,467
We are... uh, she...
like, working together.

446
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:50,087
I mean, ever since she got her powers,

447
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:54,007
it's like she's a human lie detector.

448
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,226
How is that a bad thing?

449
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,135
You know I've always prided myself

450
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:59,780
on being able to read people, right?

451
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:04,935
But Cecile and these powers,
I mean, she puts me to shame.

452
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,311
Well, you just got to remember

453
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:07,655
that you guys are a team.

454
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:09,415
That makes her strengths your strengths

455
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,361
and yours hers.

456
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:13,326
So if you let her do
what she's great at,

457
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:14,762
it's only going to create more room

458
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,922
for you to do more of what
you're great at too, right?

459
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,169
Well, damn.

460
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,172
You're getting real good
at these pep talks, Bare.

461
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,624
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

462
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,925
Hey, Nora.

463
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,148
Hi, Nora.

464
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:39,319
Yeah.

465
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,179
Do you want to turn
that down a little bit?

466
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:43,232
Hmm? Oh, sorry.

467
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:45,723
What are you listening to?

468
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:48,102
Sped-up archives of the
Flash's comm recordings.

469
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,939
I thought that if I
listen to his best appeals,

470
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:53,451
I could figure out what
exactly worked so well.

471
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:54,985
And did you?

472
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,486
No, not yet.

473
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,464
But if I run the transcripts
through the computer,

474
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,633
I can extrapolate recurring key words

475
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,301
from his most successful appeals

476
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,454
and create a sort of
"best of speeches" speech.

477
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:07,640
Well, um,

478
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,791
why don't you let
your dad think about it

479
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,581
and we could go to
the rooftop of Jitters.

480
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:14,480
It's a great place to clear your mind,

481
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,181
plus it's got the
best views of the city.

482
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:18,967
You want to go sightseeing? Right now?

483
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:20,927
What... is this from that list of yours?

484
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,403
Well, yeah, but...

485
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:25,862
All day I've been trying to
figure out a way to stop Cicada

486
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:28,887
and all day you've been
trying to pull me away.

487
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,687
Why are you pushing this list?

488
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,147
I mean, it's just the last time

489
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:34,742
that we may get to spend together.

490
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,836
Nora, I mean, once we stop Cicada,

491
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,380
you'll go back to your time and...

492
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:46,461
Us like this together will end.

493
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:47,717
Mom, it doesn't end.

494
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,312
We have our whole future together.

495
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:51,540
Yeah, for you it'll feel
like no time has passed

496
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:56,096
but for me, it'll be decades before I...

497
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:58,190
see you like this again.

498
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,901
Uh, no, it's okay.

499
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:08,249
Um, I will catch up with you later.

500
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:17,448
Joe.

501
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:18,526
What's going on?

502
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:19,937
Why'd you want me to meet you here?

503
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,207
Look, I know the last time
we tried to work together

504
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,881
went a bit south.

505
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:26,076
Oh, a bit?

506
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,537
You're right. I'm sorry, Cecile.

507
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:31,581
I let my pride get in the way,

508
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,042
and I didn't lean on your strengths

509
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:35,961
when I should have.

510
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,921
But you know me,

511
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,399
I'm not a man who makes
the same mistake twice.

512
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,568
So...

513
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,482
Would you do me the honor

514
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,393
of joining me in this interrogation?

515
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:55,272
You do what you do best,
I'll take care of the rest.

516
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,334
Get 'em, girl.

517
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:08,743
Detective. DA.

518
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:10,579
This is starting to
border on harassment.

519
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,541
I have told you everything I know.

520
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:13,428
That's not true.

521
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,392
We know that you've been
funneling meds to Orlin Dwyer.

522
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,710
Well, if you knew that,

523
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:19,962
then I'd be arrested
and not sitting here.

524
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,925
Let me correct myself.

525
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:27,012
We have a strong hunch,

526
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,638
but I bet if we were to go through

527
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,932
the video camera footage
from the hospital,

528
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:34,027
we'll find proof that
you were assisting Dwyer.

529
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:35,075
I'm a doctor.

530
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:37,839
I mean, why would I condone
a vigilante murderer?

531
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:39,959
Because of what happened to Darius.

532
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:43,570
Darius.

533
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,117
It hurts you to even think about it.

534
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,303
My fiancé was killed by meta-humans

535
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,548
during Zoom's rampage.

536
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,381
So, yes, it hurts to think about him.

537
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:58,031
Hurt enough for you to help
Dwyer kill other meta-humans?

538
00:23:58,034 --> 00:23:59,307
Correct me if I'm wrong,

539
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,721
you took an oath to do no harm, right?

540
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:04,650
Can you truthfully say
you've upheld that oath?

541
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:11,064
That guilt that you feel right now?

542
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,758
There's a way to make up for it.

543
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,656
All you have to do
is help us find Orlin.

544
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,201
What, so... so you can
put him in jail? Kill him?

545
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:19,954
No, so we can cure him.

546
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,474
It's not possible.

547
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:23,669
Maybe not with the medicine
you've been giving him,

548
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,029
but S.T.A.R. Labs has
created a treatment

549
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:30,342
that turns metas back
into normal human beings.

550
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,763
I can't take you to him.

551
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,457
Okay, okay, then help us set up a meet.

552
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:39,626
Look, Dr. Ambres, it's clear.

553
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:42,212
You've come to truly care for Dwyer.

554
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,507
So we're asking you now...

555
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:47,676
help us save his life.

556
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:57,352
I can make contact, and
I can share the location.

557
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:01,373
I have rounds in an hour

558
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,209
and patients that I can save tonight.

559
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,026
So am I free to go, please?

560
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,704
I love my job.

561
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:18,182
I can stay here all night.

562
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,894
And we will, unless you tell
us what you're keeping hidden

563
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,437
right now.

564
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,658
Yo, yo. I got your text.
You talked to Ambres?

565
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:33,597
Cecile and I together
got through to her.

566
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,224
She's going to show
us where to find Dwyer.

567
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,588
Joe, that's amazing.

568
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:39,820
Yeah, Ambres told us something else.

569
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,405
Dwyer's niece, Grace? She's a meta.

570
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:52,440
So le petit Dwyer is a meta.

571
00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:55,235
Wait, I thought we scanned
Grace for meta powers

572
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:56,516
when Nora entered her brain.

573
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,539
We did but that was back
when her DNA was 100% human.

574
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,074
Her powers must have activated

575
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,876
in just the last few weeks, right?

576
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:06,138
Yeah, Ambres told Joe that
the wound in Grace's head

577
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
recently started glowing and mutating.

578
00:26:08,142 --> 00:26:12,961
Now all we need to do is get
Dwyer to listen to you, again.

579
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:15,556
Killer Frost can put him
on ice from the neck down.

580
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:18,175
Better yet, I can re-sequence
the Speed Force Bazooka

581
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,677
to overload him with negative tachyons.

582
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,011
- Yes. Absolutely.
- So that he's stuck there...

583
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,488
Tachyon, shmack-yon. No,
no. La Machine Ã  Mémoire!

584
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:24,848
We could go inside Dwyer's mind.

585
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:29,151
- Guys...
- No, La Machine Ã  Mémoire!

586
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,163
Guys, hey!

587
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,649
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

588
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:37,911
but I think we need to
take a different approach.

589
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:42,300
No powers, no crazy plans.

590
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:44,888
The Flash can't convince
Cicada to stop this,

591
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:48,014
but... maybe...

592
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:50,090
I can.

593
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,545
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,801
Dad's back.

595
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:59,466
He says Papa Joe's got news about Dwyer.

596
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:02,662
Okay, good. I guess we
should get over to the Cortex.

597
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:05,406
You know, I had a list too.

598
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,910
Your wedding, Auntie
Jenna's baby shower,

599
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:14,040
Jitters, The Enlightenment.

600
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,195
Those were all the moments in time

601
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:21,863
you wanted to go back and see us?

602
00:27:21,865 --> 00:27:24,666
Yeah, so I could have
memories and experiences

603
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,785
with all of you.

604
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:28,295
I get it.

605
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:32,207
I should've been sensitive
and I-I'm so sorry.

606
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:35,135
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

607
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:38,397
I was so focused on making
sure Flash beat Cicada,

608
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,468
I forgot what I was supposed
to really be focused on.

609
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,263
You and Dad.

610
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,224
You're the reason I
came back to this time,

611
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:53,946
not fighting big bads or
getting my own XS-presso.

612
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:57,375
So that I could spend
time with my parents.

613
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:00,068
My family.

614
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,496
I don't know how much
time we have left together

615
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,740
or how much of your list
we're going to get done,

616
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:09,911
but from now on, every
moment we have left,

617
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:11,672
we're going to make it a memorable one.

618
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:13,131
I promise.

619
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:22,799
Well, I guess we can cross off
"hugging while drinking tea"

620
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,593
- off our list.
- Yeah.

621
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:27,471
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.

622
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,690
No, it's fine. We were just...

623
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,867
We were just talking about Mom's list.

624
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:36,634
Um, so I heard Dad has a lead on Dwyer?

625
00:28:36,637 --> 00:28:38,315
We have a location.

626
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,792
I'm going to head there any minute.

627
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:42,711
Does Flash know what he's
going to say this time?

628
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:48,466
Actually, I think I'm
just gonna talk to him,

629
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:50,711
father to father.

630
00:28:50,713 --> 00:28:52,638
That's a really good idea, Dad.

631
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:08,237
Hey, Doc.

632
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,390
Dr. Ambres told us where to find you.

633
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,327
I just want to talk.

634
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,741
There's no more talking.

635
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:25,987
Every time one of you metas
comes near the rest of us,

636
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:28,674
good people get hurt.

637
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:31,868
This is what you all deserve.

638
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,870
Does that include Grace?

639
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,292
Ambres hasn't told you.

640
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:42,879
Grace. She's a meta.

641
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,182
The night the satellite crashed,

642
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:47,175
she was hit with a piece of shrapnel

643
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,435
inflected with dark matter.

644
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:50,863
That's... that's why she's in a coma,

645
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:53,223
and now it's changing her.

646
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,442
That's a lie.

647
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:57,870
And that's why Ambres
told us where to find you.

648
00:29:57,872 --> 00:29:59,257
She's afraid.

649
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,025
She's afraid you're
going to do the one thing

650
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:02,399
you can't come back from.

651
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:11,792
I know how much you care about Grace.

652
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:14,578
You're trying to make the
world a better place for her.

653
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,539
She didn't choose to be a meta,

654
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,374
but she is.

655
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:21,751
Does that mean she deserves to die?

656
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,087
No.

657
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,474
I would never hurt Grace.

658
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:30,143
Then you'd let her grow
up in a world of fear.

659
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:33,447
Where there's someone out
there hurting people like her.

660
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:39,632
The cure, it will heal Grace and you.

661
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,242
And why should I believe you, Flash?

662
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,346
Because I'm a father too.

663
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,515
My daughter,

664
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:13,279
I love her more than I
ever thought possible.

665
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:15,281
I would do anything to make the world

666
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:16,931
a better place for her.

667
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,978
And I think you would too.

668
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,150
So do it.

669
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,990
We made an arrangement.

670
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:45,994
We cure him and then Grace.

671
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:47,379
Okay.

672
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:51,592
Why are we here and not at a hospital?

673
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:55,354
We have to be sure that
the cure is successful.

674
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:56,897
We created it.

675
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:58,715
We're the ones who know how it works.

676
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,843
Once administered, the
cure will take 60 seconds

677
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:04,688
to eliminate the meta-human
powers in your system.

678
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,867
That means the wound in
your chest will then open.

679
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:09,393
You'll need me to suture it shut

680
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,644
so you don't bleed out.

681
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,673
Why not Doc Ambres?

682
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:14,226
She's being held for questioning.

683
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:18,878
No, it's Ambres, or we're done.

684
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,908
All right, we'll get her.

685
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,536
If anything goes wrong,

686
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:29,492
or if you're lying to me,

687
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:34,709
I'll kill every... last...

688
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:36,812
one of you.

689
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:43,569
And we're certain everything
in this room is sterile?

690
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:45,979
Of course.

691
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,815
Everything except that.

692
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,936
That thing's not negotiable.

693
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:59,868
That rage of his, it's...

694
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,071
Joe, I can't.

695
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,309
Are you going to stay?

696
00:33:04,312 --> 00:33:06,450
Uh, yeah, just in case.

697
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:09,461
- Okay.
- All right, babe.

698
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:10,763
Good job today.

699
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:13,006
You too. Partner.

700
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,631
We never could have done
this without you guys.

701
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,300
Well, I'm glad it worked out,

702
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:26,470
but when this is over,
he's going to jail,

703
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,620
for a long time.

704
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:34,920
Okay, one fresh serving of
piping hot meta-human cure.

705
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:37,123
I'm just supposed to trust
that that thing works?

706
00:33:37,126 --> 00:33:39,283
Has it gone through any human testing?

707
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,318
It's gone through giant shark testing.

708
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:44,630
It's a long story.

709
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:49,117
It's okay, Doc.

710
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,545
I wanted to tell you
the truth about Grace.

711
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:54,414
I just couldn't find the words.

712
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,792
You were just trying to keep her safe.

713
00:33:57,794 --> 00:34:00,146
I'll always be thankful for that.

714
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:06,652
See you on the other side.

715
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,649
There we go.

716
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,673
Injecting the cure.

717
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,054
His vitals are spiking.

718
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,881
How can we tell if the
cure is even working?

719
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,289
Oh, it's working.

720
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,468
My powers are back.

721
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:09,864
Which means Dwyer's powers must be gone.

722
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,913
Well...

723
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,781
It appears your sojourn
into the past was a success.

724
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,134
Congratulations.

725
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,794
Thank you.

726
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:25,567
You as well. It's your, uh, 38th Cicada?

727
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,797
That's right, yes.

728
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,882
38th Cicada. Trente-huit Cicada.

729
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:30,260
Alley-oop!

730
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,238
But, of course, there's
some business here

731
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,464
that remains unfinished.

732
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,599
For instance, how did you know
before you saw the burn marks

733
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:39,152
in the photograph that
it was a meta-human

734
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:41,479
that would lead us to Cicada?

735
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:43,691
Uh, I...

736
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,236
You know, I just had this feeling

737
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,511
that something big was coming.

738
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:51,257
They're working on him now.

739
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:54,409
I will be so happy when
this is all over with.

740
00:36:09,277 --> 00:36:11,184
What's going on?

741
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:12,752
What happened to the power?

742
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:15,339
I have no idea.

743
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,732
I should check the Med Lab.

744
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,937
- Someone's coming.
- Who?

745
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:34,917
Cicada?

746
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,693
Where's that coming from?

747
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:04,112
Cisco!

748
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:05,812
- Hold on!
- Iris.

749
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:08,107
- Careful.
- I can't see anything.

750
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,768
Here.

751
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,066
Cisco, we need power.

752
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:12,896
We got a much bigger problem.

753
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:15,482
Cicada?

754
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,715
How the hell did that happen?

755
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,241
I don't know, but he's coming here

756
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,258
and he looks pissed.

757
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:20,552
We have to move now.

758
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:21,967
I've got to keep patching him up.

759
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,489
Stand back.

760
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,676
There.

761
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:38,213
- He's in the hallway.
- Get the hell out of here.

762
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,629
Iris! Get down!

763
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,762
Come on!

764
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,842
Who are you?

765
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:37,541
Please, whoever you are.

766
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,001
I only came here to
make him human again!

767
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,095
I helped him!

768
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:04,207
Please!

769
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,260
Please don't do this!

770
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,477
Nope. They're all toast.

771
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,216
Well, better the computers than us.

772
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:31,428
- Joe.
- Are you okay?

773
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,222
I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm
a little bruised, but...

774
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,765
Everybody else?

775
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:36,984
Yeah, we're okay.

776
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:41,104
Guys... Dr. Ambres didn't make it.

777
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,995
There's no sign of them anywhere.

778
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:49,582
I don't understand what happened.

779
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,981
I mean, we got Dwyer,
we gave him the cure.

780
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:55,426
If... if Cicada doesn't
exist anymore, who was that?

781
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,597
Someone worse.

782
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:33,698
I've missed you.

783
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,317
Uncle Orlin.

784
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,302
