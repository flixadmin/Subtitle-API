[Oliver]<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,586
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,132
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,592
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,805
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,732
Traitor! I'm taking you to hell with...

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,068
[Quentin] I'm sorry you didn't
get to know your father.

12
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,570
I guess you're stuck knowing me.

13
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,406
What I saw in her is what I see here.

14
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:35,326
It sounds crazy, but if there is just
some way to get through to her...

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,328
-We have a massively huge problem.
-What is it?

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,039
The nano-thermite,
when combined with the explosive

17
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,248
creates a thermobaric weapon.

18
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,374
[John] <i>Cayden James could do it.</i>

19
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,126
And he'd probably detonate
in a populated area.

20
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,294
Maximize casualties.

21
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,964
Your city's entire infrastructure
is under my control.

22
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,509
Buildings, institutions, even people,

23
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,345
all under my dominion.

24
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,513
These are innocent people.

25
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,973
And you can save them...

26
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,852
By wiring $10 million
into that offshore account

27
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,729
no later than 11:30 tonight.

28
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,981
And every night.

29
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,608
Wire the money.

30
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,703
All right, we're all set here.

31
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,457
Captain Hilton, thank you for
stepping up to lead the department.

32
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,292
I wish it was under better circumstances.

33
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,710
After tonight, they will be.

34
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,337
All right, take me through the details.

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,381
We know Cayden James is monitoring
traffic in and out of the city.

36
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,133
Airports, highways, ports.

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,885
But the shoreline might be the blind spot.

38
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,345
Specifically, right here,

39
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,430
there's no satellite flyover
for about 10 minutes.

40
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,723
That's our window.

41
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,849
SWAT has the perimeter,

42
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,976
so no one's getting in or out
without us knowing it.

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,561
Good. When do we make contact?

44
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,854
Should be any minute.

45
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,327
Mr. Mayor, I'm Alex Scott, A.R.G.U.S.

46
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,912
-Good to meet you.
-We're good to move?

47
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,288
-Yes.
-[beeps]

-No, just some weird feedback.

51
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,920
Are your comms line of sight?

52
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,004
No, we're patched in.

00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,297

{\an8}[clears throat] At this point,
we've got maybe another day or two.

59
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,382
{\an8}[Thea] What about the federal government?

60
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,301
{\an8}I mean, don't they have plans
for this kind of stuff?

61
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,804
{\an8}A.R.G.U.S. was our best shot,
and Cayden James was ready for it.

62
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,933
{\an8}I think that we are on our own.

63
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,895
{\an8}So does that mean I go forward
with the emergency bomb shelters?

64
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:11,274
{\an8}Yeah. We need a contingency.
It won't save everyone.

65
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,360
{\an8}But it's a start. [sighs]

66

{\an8}How is William holding up?

67
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,531
{\an8}Doing as well as can be expected.

68
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,367
{\an8}He's holed up at an A.R.G.U.S. safe house

69
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,995
{\an8}with Raisa and a PlayStation 4.

70
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,415
You look like you could use some rest.

71
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,833
I'll get some if you will.

72
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,044
Like brother like sister, I guess.

73
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,882
{\an8}Hey, don't worry, okay?

74
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,510
Cayden James is not the first guy
to try to take our city hostage.

75
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,222
We will figure it out.

{\an8}<i>Cayden James' hold on Star City</i>

{\an8}You believe me, right?

94
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,165
Cayden James likes to play things
close to the vest.

95

Even with the people
he's supposedly in league with.

96
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,630
Which makes finding the location
of the thermobaric bomb very difficult.

About not knowing
about the A.R.G.U.S. divers?

I already told you, I do.

I guess what I'm asking is,

102
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,851
do you trust me?

{\an8}And he is smart.

{\an8}He makes sure that no one person ever
sees enough of the whole picture.

115
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,369
{\an8}Sounds like you could use

{\an8}I gotta tell you, Sonus isn't just smart,

118
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,338
{\an8}he is unpredictable.

119
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,925
{\an8}This could go south, fast.

{\an8}When do we start?

{\an8}Didn't know we were having

{\an8}Miss Lance is en route.

124
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,612
{\an8}And this is less a meeting
than it is a wake for Mr. Sheck.

125
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,698
He bought the farm a week ago.

126
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,785
I didn't think we were
sentimental like that.

127
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,413
It's not sentimental. Surprised.

128
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,084
Oliver would not kill a man this way.

129
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,795
None of his team would.

130
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,588
The place wasn't lacking for cops.

131
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,841
One of them probably took him out.

132
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,057
What's really behind this sudden paranoia?

133
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,561
Mr. Queen was obviously able
to get word outside the cordon

134
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,895
we placed around the city.

To A.R.G.U.S., you mean.

00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,816
He seems more than capable.

137
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,152
[Cayden] Agreed. But it was unexpected.

138
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,988
As was Mr. Sheck's demise.

139
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,118
I don't like surprises.

140
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,206
And I like even less the feeling
that I can't trust my comrades.

141
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,626
It sounds like
it's just me you don't trust.

If I didn't, you wouldn't be

that we will get out
from underneath Cayden James' thumb.

148
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,113
Not sure
even I believe that, at this point.

00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,717
Mmm-hmm. Any news here?

158
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,011
We split the city in half
with the other team.

159
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,848
Divide-and-conquer is not getting us
any closer to finding Cayden James.

160
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,725
Our sector has been quiet for a few hours.

161
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,935
[computer beeps]

162
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,021
"Has been" being the operative phrase.

163
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,732
Okay, facial recognition
picked up Vigilante,

164
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,108
despite his mask having no face.

165
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,277
Cayden James' people don't ordinarily
walk around like that.

166
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,489
We might have caught a break.
Let's text John the location.

167
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,000
-[beeps]
-I'm headed your way.

168
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,390
Going somewhere?

169
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,725
Where's Cayden James?

170
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,564
You're making a mistake.

171
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,898
You've got three seconds.

172
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,692
-Oliver, listen.
-One!

173
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,819
-I'm trying to stop Cayden.
-Two!

174
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,404
I can't blow my cover.

175
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,030
Three.

176
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,782
[Mr. Terrific] Hold your fire.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

177
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,367
-[Wild Dog] He's a friendly.
-[Arrow] What?

178
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,828
He's here for a meet, with us.

179
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,413
[Wild Dog] He's undercover
with James' group.

180
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,081
We were gonna tell you guys.

181
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,165
Eventually.

182
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,802
I can't believe that you had time
to secretly put all this together

183
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,346
and continue starting our start-up.

184
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,058
[sighs] Well, being single does wonders
for your time management.

185
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,769
Okay, on your next date, you are
not allowed to lead with that.

186
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,855
How do you know you can trust him?

187
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,815
[Rene] He saved my life last week.

188
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,525
Killed one of James' men to do it.

189
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,818
And he's in love with Dinah.

190
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,778
Look, just stating the facts.

191
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,615
Vince is working on locating
the thermobaric bomb.

192
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,492
We take that out of play
and we got the situation handled.

193
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,330
What kind of progress are you making
locating the bomb?

194
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,456
[Vince] Not much.

195
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,625
Cayden keeps the bomb
on the move constantly.

196
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,919
He's become especially paranoid
since I killed one of his men.

197
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,756
Your stunt with A.R.G.U.S. last night
didn't help matters.

198
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,717
So why don't you just take us
to where Cayden and his men are hiding?

199
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,887
'Cause the second you show up,
he'll detonate the bomb.

200
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,057
The amplifier he has,
he'll take out the city.

201
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
[Rene] He's right.

202
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,101
And until we find out where
that bomb is, we've got no moves.

203
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,937
Okay, well, then we just...
We find out where the bomb is.

204
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,356
Last year we used a sniffer device

205
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,232
to pull information from
Prometheus' mother's house.

206
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,276
You wanna use the same device
for Cayden James?

207
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,444
[Felicity] That's exactly what I wanna do.

208
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,945
We can gather all his ones and zeroes.

209
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,739
There's gotta be a scrap of data
left in there somewhere.

210
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,783
Then we have someone to plant
Felicity's toy for us.

211
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,452
[Felicity] Yeah.
There's just one small problem.

212
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,871
-[Dinah Drake] Just one?
-Well, two, actually.

213
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,333
The sniffer needs to be manually
implanted into Cayden's server...

214
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,794
No, no. There's no way he can do that
without Cayden noticing, Felicity.

215
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,545
Especially now
that he's circling the wagons.

216
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,547
I knew what I signed up for.

217
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,633
I didn't expect this to be easy.

218
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,678
What else?

219
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,555
[Felicity] Okay, Cayden's server
is deep within the building,

220
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,266
so while our comms will be working,
transmitting a data-pull that large,

221
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,726
it requires line of sight.

222
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,436
[Curtis] Which means you'll
have to install the sniffer,

223
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,397
then wait for it to download
the content to Cayden James' server.

224
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,565
Making sure Cayden doesn't see you or
the sniffer. That'd be bad, very bad.

225
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,484
And then get it outside
so you can transmit the files.

226
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,569
Yeah, that sounds
like more than two problems.

227
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,405
Sounds like a good way
of getting yourself killed.

228
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,615
Then it's a good thing I heal fast.

229
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,410
[Oliver] Vince.

230
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,663
May I speak with you, please?

231
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,923
Miss Queen, I'm telling you,
there is nothing liquid.

232
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,008
And we have no way of borrowing capital.

233
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,718
Jake, that's just not gonna work for us,

234
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,973
so I need you to try to find more money.

235
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,477
I might be able to pull
a few hundred thousand, but...

236
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,105
That's not gonna be enough money
for Cayden James,

237
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,774
so I just...
I need you to try and find some more.

238
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,949
Sorry, sometimes he just needs to be
pushed a little bit.

239
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,036
Quentin, what's up?

240
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,997
Uh, she's been following me.

241
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,623
-Laurel?
-Yeah.

242
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,459
It started a couple of days ago.

243
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,252
Okay, have you talked to her?

244
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,920
Not quite.

245
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,468
Every time I turn around, she disappears.

246
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,760
[Thea] What do you think it means?

247
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,472
I think maybe we made
some kind of connection.

248
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,723
She wants to reach out,

249
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,850
but she's afraid.

250
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,686
-Does that sound crazy?
-No.

251
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,273
Not after everything
we've seen lately, no.

252
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,733
So what do we do?

253
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,153
If it seems like she's trying
to reach out to you, then...

254
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,490
I don't know,
maybe we just gotta find a way

255
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,909
for you to reach out to her.

256
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,083
[Vince] What's on your mind?

257
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,711
[Oliver] Dinah, Curtis and Rene trust you.

258
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,213
I'm not there yet.

259
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,382
I want you to try to imagine
how little I give a damn.

260
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,092
You've taken a shot at me.

261
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,845
Matter of fact, you've taken a shot

262
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,639
at nearly everybody in that room,

263
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,808
so I will be convinced
that you're not playing us,

264
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,895
the way that you claim
to be playing Cayden James.

265
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,563
I don't have to convince you.

266
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,442
Because you're not stopping me
from doing this.

267
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,611
-Are you sure?
-I am.

268
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,782
Because you know saving this city
means doing whatever's necessary.

269
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,535
And you know that means using me.

270
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,090
Did Oliver push you to do this?

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,009
He didn't have to, D. It's the right play.

272
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,680
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

273
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,348
I'm not so sure.

274
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,308
Something just doesn't feel right.

275
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,852
You know, the same way it did for you
when everything went bad with Sonus.

276
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,354
That was my call, D.

277
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,981
Don't you wear that guilt.

278
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,358
I don't wanna lose you again.

279
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,235
I'm so happy to hear that.

280
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,070
And you won't.

281
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,668
Aces and queens.

282
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,753
Got me.

283
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,799
And you are in the black, barely.

284
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,217
Thanks.

285
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,387
Yeah, this cash inflow coming
from San Francisco is huge,

286
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,680
but it wasn't very efficient.

287
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,850
You know, if I knew more I might be
able to maximize revenue stream.

288
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,272
Sorry. I know I'm not supposed
to ask specifics.

289
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,025
Just... We need a little more of it,
that's all I'm saying.

290
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,943
I'll take that under advisement.

291
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,529
All right.

292
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,866
Well, I'm going to go home for the night.

293
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,205
Good night, boys.

294
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,374
I'll walk with you. [grunts]

295
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,252
Can't let a lady walk home alone, hmm?

296
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,216
That was subtle.
What, you didn't have a neon sign?

297
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,636
It's fine, no one noticed.

298
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,602
So what did his book say?

299
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,270
He's got a boatload
of money floating around

300
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,355
neither of us have eyes on.

301
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,400
And seriously, Vince,
Sonus should not see us together.

302
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,111
They all think I'm just trying
to get in your pants.

303
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,529
Hmm.

304
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,491
Well, if only wishing made it so.

305
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,337
[Curtis] Nice.

306
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,090
Love what you guys
haven't done with the place.

307
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,257
Let's get this over with.

308
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,259
We turned your room
into a home gym, because...

309
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,931
'Cause this extremely awkward situation
needs to be masked with humor.

310
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,433
I think what she means to say is,
welcome back.

311
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,852
We have the inside man, you have the tech.

312
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
It's the only reason we're back, hoss.

313
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,983
-Is Vince on site?
-Should be, as of five minutes ago.

314
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,694
That is, if everything
goes according to plan.

315
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,696
You sound like it might not.

316
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,447
Vince said he doesn't have access
to the server room,

317
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,992
so if anyone spots him in there,
he's gonna have a lot of explaining to do.

318
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,118
We've got eyes.

319
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,120
-[Dinah Drake] Can I talk to him?
-Yeah.

320
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,122
Hey, Vince.

321
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,499
[over comms] <i>You get any kind of
bad feeling here at all, you abort.</i>

322
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,583
<i>You hear me?</i>

323
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,919
[Vince] <i>Don't worry, I'll see you soon.</i>

324
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,755
He's at the server.

325
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,384
[Vince] <i>The door to
the server room is locked.</i>

326
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,011
You guys have a solve for this?

327
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,388
Try 0-6-1-4-1-9-9-8.

328
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,932
-"Try"?
-It's his son's birthday.

329
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,393
-If you're wrong, he's dead.
-I'm not gonna be wrong.

330
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,566

331
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,738
[Felicity] <i>Okay, Vince, you're in the red
zone, just let the sniffer do its thing.</i>

332
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,541
Eighty terabytes of data.

333
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,835
You guys can get comfortable.
This is gonna take a minute.

334
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,505
[Cayden] Mr. Sobel?

335
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,468
Frack.

336
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,512
I think we need to talk.

337
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,685
[Cayden] [over speaker] <i>All of my people
have specific domains.</i>

338
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,854
<i>I don't believe that IT is one of yours,</i>

339
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,941
<i>which means you would not have
a proper pass code to enter.</i>

340
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,443
How much data's been copied?

341
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,611
20%.

342
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,863
No, but Mr. Sheck did.

343
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,157
He was a little more loose-lipped
then you'd like.

344
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,784
Rest in peace.

345
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,956
Still, it doesn't explain
what exactly you're doing in here.

346
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,917
-We gotta pull him out.
-Dinah, not yet.

347
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,251
-Oliver!
-[Felicity] Okay, wait.

348
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,797
Vince, if you wanna stay alive,
repeat exactly what I say.

349
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,633
-"You think just..."
-...because I can handle a gun,

350
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,426
doesn't mean I know the difference between

351
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,471
a transpolymer hybrid
and a fiber-optic cable.

352
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,890
I'm just impressed.

353
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,936
I wanted to know how you maximize
the data through-put.

354
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,979
Sorry.

355
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,815
I should have asked first.

356
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,442
Perhaps.

357
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,196
I may have underestimated you.

358
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,700
It seems that you have more skill
than I gave you credit for.

359
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,912
I keep telling people
I'm more than just a pretty face.

360
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,249
Keep him talking, we're at 80%.

361
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,254
Funny thing is, I underestimated you, too.

362
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,630
Is that right?

363
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,134
When you recruited me to help you
take this city from Oliver Queen,

364
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,427
I didn't think you'd have
the resolve to do

365
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,680
what was necessary to make him fear you.

366
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,516
I was wrong.

367
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,269
Does that mean
that you also fear me, Mr. Sobel?

368
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,396
I'd be a fool not to.

369
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,189
[sighs]

370
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,526
Such flattery.

371
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,532
Are we done here?

372
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,786
[Felicity] [over comms] <i>Yeah, we're good.
Take the sniffer and leave.</i>

373
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,246
After you.

374
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,092
<i>It appears that Mr. Knyazev
has returned from the ports.</i>

375
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,844
Join us in five.

376
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,096
Absolutely.

377
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,223
[Dinah Drake] <i>You were amazing.</i>

378

[Felicity] <i>Yeah, we'll engrave your Oscar</i>

-[exhales]

380
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,979
Heading out now.

381
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,611
That's our final offer.

382
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,614
Oh, please, your final offer
is never really final, Sean.

383
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,282
[Sean] You got a vice under there?

384
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,659
You want me to just
gently put my nuts in it for you?

385
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,412
So, are we gonna celebrate or what?

386
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,289
I think she's gonna drop half the product

387
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,458
and leave us with our asses
hanging out, like she did last time.

388
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,627
[Carmen] I'll make good on my end.
You don't need to worry about me.

389
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,086
I'd take a look at your own house first.

390
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,963
What the hell are you talking about?

391
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,882
The Darbinyans rooted out
a mole last month.

392
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,425
An OCB operative.

393
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,636
A few fingernails later,
he got very chatty.

394
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,056
According to him,
you have a cop on your payroll.

395
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,318
Hold up. Mr. James wants to see you.

396
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,658
[both grunting]

397
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,037
Did I teach you that move?

398
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,956
I taught you that move.

399
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,544
All right. Transmitting now.

400
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,172
It's coming through.
Man, this is the mother lode.

401
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,549
We're gonna need Alena on this
to help us process.

402
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,968
[Dinah Drake]
<i>Now get your ass back to Helix.</i>

403
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,219
On my way.

404
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,226
We need to call Singh.

405
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,645
Roll this thing up right now.

406
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,483
We don't even have Sonus yet.

407
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,403
We've got enough.

408
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,282
If the Alvarez buy falls through,
we have got nothing.

409
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,785
Vince, we need Sonus in the room.

410
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,121
-We need money changing hands.
-I know.

411
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,958
But what we don't know
is which one of us is made.

412
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,878
No, baby. If Sonus knew anything at all,

413
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,964
one of us would already be dead.

414
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,883
We've been working at this for months.

415
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,012
And we're close. You know, we're so close.

416
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,765
We can't pull the pin on this now.

417
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,353
All right.

418
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,981
We'll play it your way.

419
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,321
[Cayden] Mr. Sobel.

420
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,160
Sorry. I got a text from my girlfriend.

421
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,621
She's at the hospital.
Thinks it's appendicitis.

422
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,374
Well, I'm sure the doctors
are doing everything they can.

423
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,711
I need you here
for a rather important assignment.

424
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,088
Yeah? What's that?

425
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,965
Rooting out a traitor.

[dramatic music playing]

427
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,727
Cayden sure has a lot of junk
in his server

428
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,604
for someone who's as type-A
as you say he is.

429
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,191
Well, brilliant people are often
slobs. Or so I tell myself.

430
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,817
-And my dates.
-Show-off.

431
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,236
-I can't even get a date.
-Anything yet?

432
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,906
Well, if by "anything," you mean
the location of the bomb...

433
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,700
-No, not yet.
-Okay. [sighs]

434
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,077
How much longer is this gonna take?

435
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,412
Yeah. How much longer do I got to be here?

436
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,997
'Cause I'm starting to get PTSD.

437

-Maybe an hour.
-Hopefully less.

438
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,585
I'm gonna head back to Helix.
I should've heard from Vince by now.

439
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,295
I'll go with you.

440
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,300
Sorry, boys.

441
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,676
Guess I'm just lucky.

442
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,637
More like pretty women
make smart men dumb.

443
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,055
Speak for yourself, Declan.

Hey, Tina, can I borrow you for a sec?

445
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,892
Yeah. What's up?

446
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,687
I got the Alvarez buy coming up.
I wanted your expertise on the numbers.

447
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,022
Yeah, sure. You want me to dive in now?

448
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,649
You can start on page 12.

449
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,734
I noticed something a little concerning.

450
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,115
Looks like your luck is up.

[gun cocks]

452
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,961
You were always the enigma, Mr. Sobel.

453
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:46,716
The vigilante willing
to ally himself with criminals

454
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,010
to take out other vigilantes.

455
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,805
I must confess,
I never totally bought into it.

456
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,432
Given your background
as an undercover operative,

457
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,851
I would have been a fool to.

458
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,228
I don't strike you as a fool, do I?

459
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,729
No.

460
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,692
You are coming off a little crazy, though.

461
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,444
I've done good work for you.

462
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,240
I got no love for Oliver Queen.
You know that.

463
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,242
I don't know anything for certain.

464

That's what this is for.

00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,266
I must admit, that is fascinating.

468
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,894
You can torture me all you want.

469
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,273
You'll keep getting the same answer.

470
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,193
I didn't do anything.

471
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,528
I admire your tenacity.

472
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,406
But even a man who's difficult to kill

473
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,075
cannot withstand torture,
at least, not forever.

474
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,577
Hmm.

475
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,998
In my country, we do things a little,
how do you say... Dirtier?

476
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,418
We'll give the two of you some privacy.

[cracks knuckles]

478

Okey-dokey. [sighs]

479
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,143
Where shall we begin?

480
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,526
Okay, Thea, I'm inside.
Are you sure she's still following?

481
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,238
[Thea] [on phone] <i>She's right
behind you. Keep moving.</i>

482
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,697
All right.

483
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:57,639
Laurel? Wait, wait, wait.
Don't go. Please.

484
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,560
This was a mistake.

485
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,271
If you really thought that,
you wouldn't have spent

486
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,647
the past few nights following me.

487
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,651
-I think you wanna talk.
-There's nothing to talk about.

488
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,944
Then don't.

489
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,405
[stutters] Just listen.

490
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,324
And watch.

491
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,997
[Quentin] You see her?

492
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,291
This is Laurel.

493
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,421
This is my Laurel.

494
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,841
[sighing] She was incredible.

495
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:42,559
When I look into your eyes,
I see the girl I raised.

496
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,228
I see the same warmth,

497
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,981
kindness and love.

498
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,734
And I see a hero.

499
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,237
You just need to see it, too.

500
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,198
Please.

501
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,243
This isn't me.

502
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,454
This isn't... This isn't me!

[high-pitched screaming]

504

-Are you okay?
-[Quentin] Yeah, I'm fine.

505
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,798
You know, I know it sounds crazy,

506
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,009
but I think I just saw
my daughter in her eyes.

507
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,554
I saw her.

508
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,937
Vince didn't make it back to Helix.

509
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,106
-Did he reach out to any of you?
-No.

510
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,483
-Boom!
-Goes the dynamite.

511
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,611
Maybe not the best choice of words
considering the circumstances.

512
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,696
Oh, if by circumstances you mean locating

513
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,990
Cayden's bomb then, yes, we just did.

514
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:39,991
Where?

515
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,493
[Felicity] Warehouse District,
10th and Valley.

516
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,161
What exactly
are we walking ourselves into here?

517
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,245
We have no idea.

518
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,830
It's a surveillance dead zone,
we can't really see a thing.

519
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,874
-No surprise there.
-The place is massive.

520
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,292
Then we need everybody.

521
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,087
Agreed?

[Vince screaming over comms]

523
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,926
-What's that?
-That's Vince.

524
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,386
He just activated his comms.

525
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,097
[Anatoly] [over comms] <i>The pain stops
once I have my answers.</i>

526
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,640
Vince!

527
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,934
Oh, my God. We need to help him.

528
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,229
Hey, look, like Vince said,
James is constantly moving the bomb.

529
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,522
This might be our only chance.

530
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,066
-He is being tortured!
-[John] And he can handle it.

531
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,860
With his healing abilities, they can't
do anything to hurt him permanently.

532
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,362
As far as we know, this could be a trap.

533
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,322
-[Vince screaming]
-[Oliver] Once the bomb is rendered safe,

534

we go back in, we get Vince.

535
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,617
He has already been made.

536
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,994
By the time we get there,
that bomb is gonna be long gone!

-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do!

538
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,834
Look, we all got him into this.

539
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,044
We should all be getting him out!

540

[Vince continues screaming]

00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,341
Fine.

-I'll do it myself.
-Dinah.

543
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,762
Vince would not want you
to do it this way!

544
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,847
Don't you dare!

545

You know damn well
if it was Felicity out there,

546
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,602
if it was Lyla,
this wouldn't even be up for debate.

Vince is my family.

But I'm not letting him die.

549

Not again.

You guys save the city.

00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,203
[breathing heavily]

632
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,209
Baby.

633
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,460
Baby, wake up.

634
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,881
No, baby, please. Baby, please wake up.

635
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,759
-Wake up.
-He's gone, D.

636
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,472
[sobbing] No.

637
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,516
Oh, my God.

638
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,019
[sobbing] No, baby, not again. No. No.

639
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,438
Baby, no.

640
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,157
[Curtis] She hasn't moved or said a word
in over an hour.

641
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,952
[Rene] After my wife was murdered,
it took me days.

642
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,165
[Curtis] What do we do?

643
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,501
Nothing.

644
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,545
I'm fine.

645
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,256
You're definitely not fine.

646
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,093
How can we help you, Dinah?

647
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,471
You already have...

648
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,391
By having my back.

649
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,228
Did they get the bomb?

650
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,696
Tell me.

651
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,741
Felicity called.

652
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,746
There was nothing they could do.

653
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,664
[gasps]

654
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,167
Vince died for nothing.

655
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,682
[John sighs]

656
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,727
Sorry.

657
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,021
We needed more numbers. We didn't have it.

658
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,857
-Any word from the other team?
-I wish it was better news.

659
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,652
Vince?

660
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,654
He didn't make it.

661
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,780
[sighs]

662
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,784
How is Dinah?

663
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,244
[Felicity] As good as she can be.

664
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,038
It was a choice between
an entire city or one man.

665
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,414
He made the right call.

666
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,708
I know it feels like
this was all for nothing,

667
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,001
but it's not entirely true.

668
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,462
Alena found something.

669
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,967
I've been working on my data haul
from Cayden's servers.

670
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,426
Mmm-hmm. What'd you find?

671
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,512
Evidence he received
while in Corto Maltese.

672
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,931
Video of his son's murder.

673
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,232
It's Cayden's son, Owen Post.

674
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,733
Guess we know why he hates you so much.

675
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,861
This is fabricated. It didn't happen.

676
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,613
This could not have been you.
You were in Hub City.

677
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,741
Yeah, but Owen Post was still murdered,
supposedly by the Green Arrow.

678
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,577
Wouldn't the SCPD
be all over this? The FBI?

679
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,079
Records on the case were wiped clean.

680
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,206
Right. So, Cayden wanted me all to himself

681
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,250
and didn't want anyone to get in the way.

682
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,961
How do we prove that this is fake?

683
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,045
Well, we're working on that,

684
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,506
but there is something
super-interesting about this.

685
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,008
The digital alteration of this

686
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,718
is consistent with that of the bogus

687
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,469
surveillance photo of you
in the Green Arrow suit.

688
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,762
We thought Cayden James leaked that image.

689
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,848
Whoever doctored this leaked that photo.

690
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,558
To make James think you killed his son.

691
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,394
Whoever planned this,
knew exactly how Cayden would react.

692
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,146
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

693
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,647
If that's true,

694
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,984
Vince wasn't the only traitor
that Cayden has to worry about.

695
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,660
-[door opens]
-[chuckles]

696
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,245
[Quentin] Hey.

697
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,581
You know what?
Laurel, she needs to see this. Right?

698
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,665
'Cause the video worked,

699
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,209
it got through to her a little bit,
but this is gonna...

700
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,754
What is it? You all right?

701
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,840
I think we might've been wrong
about Laurel.

702
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,842
What are you talking about?

703
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,260
Felicity just called.

704
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,680
Dinah's former partner, her boyfriend...

705
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,765
Right.

706
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,434
-He's dead.
-Oh...

707
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,105
And, um, Laurel killed him.

708
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,818
I know how badly
you want to believe in this,

709
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,905
[inhales sharply]
and believe in her and then...

710
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,616
Seriously, Quentin, I really do, too.

711
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,077
I'm so sorry.

712
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,471
[knock at door]

713
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,697
You shouldn't be here.

714
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,699
Dinah, please give me a chance to explain.

715
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,370
You lost that right when you decided
to leave Vince on his own to die.

716
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,164
I'm truly sorry about
what happened to Vince.

717
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,917
Because I know what he meant to you.

718
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,294
But this was his call.

719
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,588
And he knew what he signed up for.

720
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,840
[scoffs]

721
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,969
Wow, you are really bad at apologies.

722
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,353
I'm not here to apologize.

723
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,690
Of course you're not.

724
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,276
I'm here to explain that...

725
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,237
This wasn't all for nothing.

726
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,198
Felicity's been going through
the data that Vince pulled out.

727
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:55,995
And for the first time...
Dinah, for the first time...

728
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,957
-We have some viable options.
-"Viable options"?

729
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:01,792
You know, I used to tell Vince

730
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,545
his way of seeking justice
wasn't "viable."

731
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,215
I convinced him to change.

732
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,551
Just how you convinced me.

733
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,887
But you know what, Oliver?

734
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,849
Vince was right.

735
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,271
The only way to bring justice
to this city is with a bullet.

736
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,482
No. Dinah...

737
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,609
I need you to listen to me.

738
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm going to make sure
Vince didn't die for nothing.

739
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,158
I'm going to kill every last one of them.

740
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,454
Starting with Laurel.
