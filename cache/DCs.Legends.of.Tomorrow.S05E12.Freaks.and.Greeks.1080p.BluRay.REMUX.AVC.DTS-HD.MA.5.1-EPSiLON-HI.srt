1
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:10,512
Nothing.

2
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:13,223
There's gotta be some spell,
some potion,

3
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,558
something to give us the power

4
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,810
so we can touch the Loom
without turning extra-crispy.

5
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:18,955
There's also the question
of who's gonna use it with me.

6
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:21,899
The Loom requires three weavers
who are as powerful as gods.

7
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,319
Well, I'm not leaving my mom's life
in the hands of you idiots.

8
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:26,862
Wow.

9
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:29,073
Okay, well, that's one person.
What do you think, Sara?

10
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:31,617
I'm already a blind
time-traveling Paragon

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,826
who can see the future.

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,496
So, might as well just add
"wannabe god" to the list.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,748
Speaking of which,

14
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,335
can you use your Sara-Vision to tell me
if what I need is in this book?

15
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,004
Nothing there.

16
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:45,481
You know, you could just read the book.

17
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,884
[sighs] You know I would do anything
to save Behrad, but this is faster.

18
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,093
[Gary grunts]

19
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:53,096
These are all the spell books
in the manor you asked for.

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,681
Yes, you're a good man, Gary.

21
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,182
[grunts]

22
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,560
[Gary] And these...

23
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:00,979
- are for you.
- Mmm.

24
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:03,023
Can you just give them to me?

25
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:05,400
Thank you.

26
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,338
- Shouldn't you be resting?
- Shouldn't you get out of my face?

27
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:09,714
- [Gary] Yeah.
- No, he's right, love.

28
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:11,531
Getting some rest
wouldn't be a bad thing.

29
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:12,783
Not gonna happen.

30
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,619
Look, the sooner we find
this magical cure-all,

31
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,983
then the sooner we can use the Loom
and get my sight back.

32
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,164
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

33
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:22,793
This book says that Merlin used
the Philosopher's Stone.

34
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:26,129
- [scoffs] That thing's as real as Santa.
- Shh! Gary's in the room.

35
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:27,881
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:30,634
The Chalice of Dionysus.

37
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,887
It says here that the Chalice was gifted
to an Olympian, Dionysus,

38
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,013
by his father, Zeus.

39
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:37,432
Whoever drinks from it becomes a god.

40
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:38,725
But only for a day.

41
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,561
Look, don't get your hopes up,
all right?

42
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:42,872
The Olympians fed off devotion,

43
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:45,232
so once they lost their followers,
they just died off,

44
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,526
and their enchanted objects...
Lost to time.

45
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:49,695
I've seen that.

46
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:52,252
I've seen that.
I've seen that in college.

47
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,992
Okay, your degree is finally paying off.

48
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:56,535
What class did you see it in?

49
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:57,661
[chuckles]

50
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,037
That was not in a class.

51
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:00,807
[students chanting]
<i>Chug! Chug! Chug!</i>

52
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,249
Chug! Chug! Chug!

53
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,667
[Nate] <i>It's called the Chug Cup.</i>

54
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,960
Chug! Chug! Chug!

55
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,796
<i>Right, campus legend said
that whoever drank from it</i>

56
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,173
<i>became invincible for a day.</i>

57
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,921
<i>Now, I went to a rival school,</i>

58
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:19,850
<i>so the only way I could get a taste
of it is if we, you know...</i>

59
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,143
Hey!

60
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:22,978
[student] Who's that?

61
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:26,773
- [ladder rattles]
- [Nate gasps]

62
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,942
Hudson sucks, Brixton rules!

63
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:29,984
[screams]

64
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:31,653
[cheering]

65
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,739
...stole it. [chuckles]

66
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,616
We really think that Dionysus' Chalice

67
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,827
- is with bunch of frat boys?
- Yes.

68
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,930
[Gideon] <i>A scan of social media
confirms that a Chalice</i>

69
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:43,415
<i>matching that of Dionysus
is currently in possession</i>

70
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:46,293
<i>of the Sigma Psi Phi fraternity
at Hudson University.</i>

71
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,461
[Astra] So, we get that,

72
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,504
I become immortal, use the Loom,

73
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,506
and I can forget I ever knew you people.

74
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,468
Well, then, Legends,

75
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:59,431
you better get your togas dry-cleaned
because we are going Greek.

76
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,881
[Agent Sharpe] So, babe, all right.

77
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:17,199
Every year, the Chug Cup
is presented at the student fair.

78
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,968
And then, apparently,
fraternities and sororities

79
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,079
compete for the right to drink in it
in something called the Chug Challenge.

80
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,282
Definitely our best place
to try to steal the Chalice.

81
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,331
Truth.

82
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:26,833
Okay, I can get around the ship,

83
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,668
but I'm not so sure
about navigating my way

84
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:31,421
through a bunch
of drunk college kids, so...

85
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:32,839
You got this.

86
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:34,466
- Yeah.
- Team loves you. Don't worry.

87
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,944
Okay, I'm not... I'm not really worried
about them accepting me.

88
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,595
The college kids, on the other hand...

89
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,347
Hi, Aunt Ava, Sara.

90
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,640
[gasps]

91
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,559
Lita, honey, I am so, so glad
that you're still here.

92
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:45,912
I need you to help me with something.

93
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,438
Um, what are the, like,
kids into these days?

94
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:50,774
Like, I need them to think I'm cool.

95
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,567
Mission's at Hudson U.

96
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:53,652
Oh, my guidance counselor

97
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,320
- told me to apply there.
- [Sara] Mmm.

98
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,906
- Sweetie, that's amazing.
- I can't afford it.

99
00:03:58,615 --> 00:03:59,658
You should do it.

100
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,702
If you want to do it,
I can make it happen.

101
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:06,248
Yeah, I mean, it could be cool
to take a tour. We're here, right?

102
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:10,252
Yeah, yeah. The, um, mission's all good.
Rory, you should definitely do that.

103
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,628
Okay. Thanks.

104
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,065
If you want kids to think you're cool,
I wouldn't wear that.

105
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,483
They're gonna think
you look like a narc.

106
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:16,842
I'm... What...

107
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:25,434
[marching band music playing]

108
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,274
Welcome to Hudson University.

109
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:33,442
[inhales deeply]

110
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,402
[sighs] You smell that?

111
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,654
Mmm. That smells like the good ol' days.

112
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,031
[grunting] I've had it.
I can't breathe in here.

113
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:42,659
Ooh. Maybe it was for the better.
What is that smell?

114
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,871
Okay, so the Sigmas hosted the games.
We find them, we find the cup.

115
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:48,874
Great. Let's fan out. Zari, thank you.
Nate, take up the north end.

116
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,125
- [Nate] Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you.

117
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,103
- Astra, Charlie, you guys...
- Let's just find this Chalice

118
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:53,420
so we can get this over with.

119
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:55,839
I wasn't finished, but...

120
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,507
- I'll go after her.
- Thank you.

121
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,762
Pledge Theta! Find your girl gang.

122
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:05,241
Maybe you can tell me where
I can find the Chalice of Dionysus.

123
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,493
Sorry, we're just really excited
about the Chug Challenge.

124
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:10,145
Why are we even doing this?
We should just take it by force.

125
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,648
Listen to me. In order to use the Loom,
the weavers have to be in sync.

126
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:14,917
Now, I'm not gonna let you use it

127
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,711
unless you can prove
that you can work as a team.

128
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:17,777
Let me?

129
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,490
I left Hell 'cause I was done
working for a Fate.

130
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:24,783
[sighs]

131
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:29,581
[tour guide] And that was Quincy Hall,
our economics building.

132
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,875
Hudson has the top program
in the country.

133
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,318
- Did you hear that, Henry?
- Yeah.

134
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,838
[Gene] He's majoring in finance.
I told him, "You have to go to Hudson."

135
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,299
You know
that's not the only reason, Gene.

136
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,259
Guilty. [chuckles]

137
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:43,345
I want him to follow in Dad's footsteps.

138
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:46,389
I'm an alumnus,
you probably noticed the scarf.

139
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:47,557
Yeah.

140
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,452
[mutters] I'd like to wring your neck
with it.

141
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:50,560
What was that?

142
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:51,686
- I said...
- [Lita coughs]

143
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:53,597
I said it's a great building.

144
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:56,900
Good brick structure, fire-resistant.

145
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,503
Oh, you really know your architecture.

146
00:05:58,527 --> 00:05:59,962
- Where did you study?
- Iron Heights.

147
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,031
- Haven't heard of it.
- It's a super prestigious art school.

148
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,198
Oh.

149
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,868
[chuckles] Just go with it.

150
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,915
I can't believe I'm back here.

151
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,726
They used to call me Shotgun Nate.

152
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,377
[sighs] I think I know why, but why?

153
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,671
Is that true, Pops?
Show us what you got.

154
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:19,798
"Pops?"

155
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:23,009
Pops. Pops. [scoffs]

156
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,093
Pops.

157
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:32,644
And I also turn to steel.

158
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,812
Whoa!

159
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,064
Okay, come on, Grandpa.
We gotta keep looking.

160
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,148
[air horn blares]

161
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:38,358
[chanting] Sigma Psi Phi!

162
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,818
- What?
- Sigma Psi Phi!

163
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,361
- What?
- Sigma Psi Phi!

164
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,223
Ava, I think we found the Sigmas.

165
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,240
<i>Ava? Hello?</i>

166
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,242
[grunting]

167
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,287
I'm on my way.

168
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:55,750
[chanting] Sigma Psi Phi!
Sigma Psi Phi! Sigma Psi Phi!

169
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:06,553
Oh, wow. That was just like
my entrance to the 2044 VMAs.

170
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:17,188
What's up, Hudson hedonists?

171
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:18,857
[cheering]

172
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:22,986
Welcome to the Chug Challenge's
pre-game!

173
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,149
- That's the Chalice.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:27,490
- That's Dion.
- [Astra] Hmm?

175
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:29,743
He was the head of the Sigmas
when I was in school.

176
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,036
The guy hasn't aged a day.

177
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:33,204
We have so much in common.

178
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:35,665
Dude, that's because
your Dion is Dionysus.

179
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,542
This is the Greek god
of wine and revelry!

180
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,461
God, the guy's a riot, honestly.

181
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:42,213
Now, as chug keeper,

182
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:46,468
I get the honor of announcing
our 2020 Challenges.

183
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,179
[cheering]

184
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:54,309
I will reveal the first round tonight
at the Sigma rager.

185
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,395
Now let the Challenge begin!

186
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,147
[cheering, grunting]

187
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,126
Look, just leave this to me, all right?

188
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:04,778
Oi, Dion.

189
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,906
Or should I say, Dionysus.

190
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,283
- It's me, Clotho.
- Clotho?

191
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,244
- Yes.
- Damn, it's really you.

192
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:14,746
My God.

193
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:19,793
The Loombreaker is in the house!

194
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,921
Dude, back before people had free will,

195
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,882
the gods were always
reining in the party.

196
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,759
But look at me now.

197
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,469
You're in college.

198
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,930
Yeah, I know. I'm a lifer.

199
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,266
I found a place where the party
doesn't stop, and I haven't left since.

200
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,310
Honestly, they worship me here,

201
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:39,688
and they don't even know
that I'm the party god.

202
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,791
- Hey, listen, man, um...
- Yeah.

203
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,334
I kind of wanted
to ask a little favor of you.

204
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,568
Yeah, anything
for the Loombreaker, and, um...

205
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,822
- Sick, is this your squad?
- Yeah.

206
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,782
Yeah, they call me Shotgun Nate.

207
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,468
- I went to Brixton, but...
- All right, enough of this.

208
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,450
Whoa, whoa...

209
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,245
[Dionysus] Hey. Whoa.

210
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:58,915
So, that's why you're really here.

211
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:01,668
Wanted to give your gang
a little taste of immortality, hmm?

212
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:02,752
Is that what it is?

213
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:06,005
Well, here's the thing.
To pick this up, you gotta be Greek,

214
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,674
and I gotta deem you worthy.

215
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,300
Okay, how are we supposed to do that?

216
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:10,468
Ah, good question.

217
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:13,763
You gotta either join a sorority,
a fraternity or a frorority,

218
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,241
and you gotta win the Chug Challenge.

219
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,808
- This is ridiculous.
- Ah!

220
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,476
And that's what makes it fun.

221
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,147
- See you, Clotho.
- [Nate sighs]

222
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,732
He's still so... Ow!

223
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,067
Just stop. I need to focus.
I need to think of something.

224
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:27,402
- I have an idea.
- No.

225
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,487
Something that does not involve maiming.

226
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,909
[students chatting and laughing]

227
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,665
Since the Chalice belongs to Dion,
we've gotta follow his rules.

228
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,252
You guys, we're gonna win that cup.

229
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:53,178
So, what you're saying is
in order to use the Loom of Fate,

230
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:55,388
we have to join a sorority?

231
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,016
Ah, finally. A mission I can get behind.

232
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,686
Luckily for us, the Thetas are hosting
a pledge social today.

233
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,438
This cannot be your plan.

234
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,000
Look, as long as Dion's got the cup,
we've gotta play by his rules.

235
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,902
Counterpoint. You don't get anywhere
playing by the rules.

236
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,921
Oh, really? Because I think I was
about to win him over

237
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,697
before you tried to nab the cup.

238
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:17,327
Hey, okay. So, who wants to rush
Theta Lambda Rho?

239
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,412
No, no, no. Just stop.

240
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:21,289
Charlie, Astra, you'll pledge Theta.

241
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,058
Just try to remember
you're on the same side, yeah?

242
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,082
Yeah.

243
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,835
Yeah. Sure we are.

244
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,298
[whispers] She's exhausting.

245
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:35,386
So, I'm doing track and debate,
plus my dad got me this internship.

246
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,180
What are your extracurriculars?

247
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,474
I was in band for a while, but I quit

248
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,851
because no one else wanted
to play The Replacements.

249
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,938
And I have a part-time job.
I heard that helps.

250
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:47,649
Actually, to get into a place like this,

251
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,276
you'll really want to build out
your application.

252
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,698
And here we are at Neuman Hall.

253
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:58,701
The name might sound familiar
to some families on this tour.

254
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,328
Oh, Henry Neuman.

255
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,847
This is actually
my grandfather's building,

256
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,707
which should help my chances
of getting in here.

257
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,551
Hey, hope I didn't miss
too much of the tour.

258
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:09,212
Uh, just to be super clear,
I'm not a prospective student.

259
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:13,132
Okay, my name is Dr. Nate Heywood.
I got my PhD from Brixton.

260
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,466
Go, Big Red.

261
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,135
Oh, a doctor.

262
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:18,096
And Lita's dad.

263
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:19,847
- What?
- What?

264
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,141
Just go with it.

265
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,706
Thank you for your enquiry.
I think it's really important...

266
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,190
- Hi, how's it going?
- Be yourself.

267
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:31,693
Hi.

268
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:36,781
I can't believe we are this close
to becoming Thetas.

269
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:40,368
I don't even know you,
but we could be sisters.

270
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,078
I'm only here as a performance.

271
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,788
Notice my empty teacup,

272
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:45,874
a commentary on the emptiness
of this charade.

273
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,459
Oh, my God.
We should start a group text.

274
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,169
What are your numbers?

275
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:51,921
[applause]

276
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,507
Welcome to the Theta luncheon.

277
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:56,301
Everybody, look around you.

278
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,887
This could be your new family,

279
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,892
the ones you turn to for support,
sisterhood, guidance.

280
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:06,019
That is, as long as you make the cut.

281
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:08,521
[chuckles] So, bid Theta.

282
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:09,605
[claps]

283
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,776
[Charlie] What are you doing?

284
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,130
Come on, we gotta try and convince
these people, no matter what.

285
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:19,157
Now, just try and fit in, please.

286
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:21,576
Fine. You want me to fit in?

287
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,830
Waiter, replace this drink.

288
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:28,791
If I wanted weak tea, I'd rush Omega.

289
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,501
[Mel] Oh!

290
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,047
This girl's fire. I like that.

291
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,965
We're gonna start with your table.

292
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:41,304
This here is the house paddle,

293
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,514
our most sacred object.

294
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,224
I'm going to ask a question,

295
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,977
and when you're holding the paddle,
it's your turn to answer.

296
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,145
Okay?

297
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,232
[chuckles] What did you do
before college?

298
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:56,736
So, I grew up in Hell,

299
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,530
had minions do my bidding
and rose to power

300
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,199
until I practically ran the place.

301
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:03,618
Oh, and she's ambitious.

302
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:05,827
Now you go.

303
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,580
Oh. Okay, um...

304
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:11,042
Well, I traveled around the world
with a bunch of friends.

305
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,378
- Oh.
- More like rejects.

306
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,505
[students giggle]

307
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:18,800
But before that, I was actually
in this really cool punk band.

308
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,803
Yeah, Thetas don't really do punk.

309
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,596
Yeah, I know her type.

310
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,265
You pretend like you're
all about bucking the system,

311
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:29,727
and then you get pissed when people
don't fall in line behind you.

312
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:34,482
You think you're better
than the sisters you ran away from,

313
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,109
but the truth is...

314
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,361
you're all the same.

315
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,430
That's a little bit rich, isn't it?

316
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,702
- Coming from my sister's lapdog.
- [student gasps]

317
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,161
- [grunts]
- [gasping]

318
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,251
- [ripping]
- [gasps]

319
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,925
Theta, no.

320
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:07,265
You know what?
This whole table is exiled.

321
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,851
None of you are Theta material.

322
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,573
How'd the mission go?
You immortal sorority girls yet?

323
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,241
[Charlie sighs] I need a drink.

324
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,284
Mmm.

325
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:28,495
The refreshing sound of failure.

326
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:31,122
We would be well on our way
to using the Loom right now

327
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,707
if someone hadn't blown it.

328
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,918
Our cover was blown 'cause you decided
to go Hell mode on us.

329
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,712
Oh, you think that was Hell mode?
Honey...

330
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,422
Call me "honey" again.
Go on, I dare you.

331
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,983
Try me
and you'll wish you were immortal.

332
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:42,568
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

333
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:43,718
No one's killing anyone.

334
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:44,927
[exclaims]

335
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:47,555
Astra was definitely gonna go for it.
Zari, hide that fork.

336
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:49,783
[Agent Sharpe] Charlie, just chill.
Please sit down.

337
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,351
Just take a breath, yeah?
All right. You good?

338
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:53,936
Okay.

339
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,831
All right, we need to find another way
to get the Chalice.

340
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,733
You can't defy a god.
We have to win as a sorority.

341
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,276
And with no sorority...

342
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:03,321
- We're screwed.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,700
Ladies, we're gonna start our own.

344
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:09,994
I can't tell, is she serious?

345
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,663
I think so.

346
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,665
Becoming an official sorority
by tonight?

347
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:16,189
I mean, the paperwork alone would...

348
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,087
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

349
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,463
Why not?

350
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,205
I really should've killed you all
when I had the chance.

351
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,384
Go, sisters.

352
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:26,719
Whoo!

353
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,972
We'll get there.

354
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:31,474
[students chuckle]

355
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,077
- Do you think my dad's okay?
- Oh, yeah.

356
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:36,062
He comes and goes as he pleases.
It's really part of his charm.

357
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,273
Bright side is I get to show you
what college is all about.

358
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:41,025
This is Greek Row.

359
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,653
This is where the fraternities
and the sororities live.

360
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,197
They're the most influential people
on campus.

361
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,324
[whoops]

362
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,243
These are the guys
that have the Chalice?

363
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,745
- Mmm-hmm.
- Wish I could be more impressed.

364
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,418
Call the Bro Patrol.
Looks like somebody wants to party!

365
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:00,711
Is he talking to us?

366
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,435
- Act cool. Be cool. Shut up.
- I don't...

367
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:09,053
Uh, this is Agent Heywood to Bro Patrol.
Desire to party confirmed.

368
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,137
Whoo!

369
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,973
[chuckles] How cool was that?

370
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:13,057
Do you have a man-crush?

371
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,642
No. It's unrequited.

372
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,352
- You should tell him.
- Shut up.

373
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:18,813
Super-stoked that you're here.

374
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:22,275
Anyone who's a friend of the Loombreaker
is chill with me.

375
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,777
So snag some bags and some brews.

376
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:28,239
Oh, and fear not, we have energy drinks
for the little ones.

377
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,741
It's all peers, no pressure
at Casa de Sigma.

378
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,619
Uh, I want to say that's tight,

379
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,747
but, uh, I got responsibilities.

380
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:41,169
Well, hey, come by anytime,
and we'll party like it's 1999.

381
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,046
Wait, hold on.

382
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,150
You said these are the guys
that have the Chalice, right?

383
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,090
Uh-huh.

384
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,569
So, why don't you go inside
and get requited,

385
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,913
and I can do some scouting
and find out where they keep it.

386
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,348
Only if your dad doesn't try to set me
on fire while I'm asleep. Deal?

387
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:55,892
Yeah, deal.

388
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,663
All right, so what are we doing?
League rules?

389
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,731
All right, two points
for those overhangs!

390
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:02,814
[cheering]

391
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,029
Okay, I call to order
the charter meeting of Delta Chi Sigma,

392
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,488
Sisterhood of Legends.

393
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:11,073
Let's make a sorority.

394
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:12,909
First up, we need a house.

395
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:15,161
I say we steal the Thetas' place.

396
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,722
You disable
the carbon monoxide detector,

397
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:17,806
I'll go in, cut the power...

398
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,790
Or I have a more non-fatal idea.

399
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,710
There's a place that's been empty
since Pi Epsilon's last rager.

400
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,795
Something about a de-Jell-O-ing?

401
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:27,757
- Oh, that is really foul.
- Yeah.

402
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,133
But with a little trickery,

403
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,719
I'll just open up a portal,
instant remodel.

404
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,512
They'll never know the difference.

405
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,091
You know, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

406
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,809
It's not my fault you can't resist
my effortless charms.

407
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,480
Obviously,
we're gonna have to redecorate.

408
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,334
Well, you lot have fun. I can't bear
to watch you desecrate this place.

409
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:48,527
Oh, and watch out for these bad boys.

410
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:50,529
They bite.

411
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,990
Mmm, so do I.

412
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:58,621
Okay, so, in order
to be an official sorority,

413
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,456
we need three more sisters.

414
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,625
And if we wanna win that Chalice,
they gotta be good.

415
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,210
So, Gideon, what do you got?

416
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,880
[Gideon] Inez Martin was voted out
of pep squad for being too enthusiastic.

417
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:09,840
Hey.

418
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,175
How's it going? What's up?

419
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,885
Hi. Hey, there.

420
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,721
- Oh, uh, Inez, right?
- Yes.

421
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,075
This is weird, but I was just wondering
if you wanted to join...

422
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,475
Definitely.

423
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,619
You don't even know what I...

424
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,162
It doesn't matter. Where can I meet you?

425
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,605
[Gideon] Lisa Lindhome.
Aspiring influencer,

426
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,857
shunned after becoming the subject
of a viral video

427
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:29,443
entitled "Girl Snarts at Party."

428
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,280
Wait. What is a snart?

429
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:33,906
It's when you sneeze and...

430
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,326
And let's not. Let's just ease Astra
back onto Earth, all right?

431
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,411
Fair.

432
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:02,310
[Gideon] Silvia Hines created
her own major in performance art.

433
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,979
You're the ones who tried
to kill each other at the tea party.

434
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,188
Yeah, about that.

435
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,708
We've actually started
our own sorority and...

436
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:11,444
What is the point of partying
with a bunch of brain-dead wasteoids?

437
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,447
I get it.

438
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,907
Seems impossible
to feel any kind of power

439
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,826
in a cruel, dying world, right?

440
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,998
But have you considered that winning
the masses over with the illusion of fun

441
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,625
might be the perfect way to ply them
to do your bidding?

442
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,670
I'm in.

443
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,841
[Gideon] Unfortunately, Captain,
the pool of Theta rejects is slim.

444
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,426
Beggars can't be choosers.

445
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:36,969
I like 'em.

446
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,641
We chose you
because we know what it's like

447
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,311
looking for a place to belong.

448
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,356
Because we, too, were there at your age.

449
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:52,318
That's why we've created that place.

450
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:57,615
And as of today, you are Deltas.

451
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,535
Welcome to the sisterhood.

452
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,124
Wait, are you blind?

453
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,833
Yes.

454
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,462
I love it. Deltas are so inclusive.

455
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,214
But don't we need a motto?

456
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,925
We can't do anything without a motto.

457
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:19,512
Yeah. The sisters...

458
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,474
...are the glue...

459
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,019
Glue that greases the wheels of...

460
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,270
time.

461
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,524
[chuckles] That doesn't make any sense.

462
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,025
It's called avant-garde.

463
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,402
What about, um,

464
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:39,865
"We might not have it all together,
but together we have it all"?

465
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:44,078
Okay, I need that on a T-shirt,
like, now.

466
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:48,165
- Okay, go, sisters.
- [all cheering]

467
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:49,625
Sisters!

468
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,003
I'm telling you, I can take it.

469
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:54,797
Dude, it's 2020.
We don't do that anymore.

470
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,549
[exclaims] Just do it.

471
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,427

00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,683
'Cause it is.

00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:21,824
Whoa.

[cell phone vibrating]

477
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:32,835
Keg's here, D.

478
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:33,836
Whoa.

479
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:34,795
Hey.

480
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,046
So glad that you found us.

481
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,008
I knew that you had bro-tential
the second I saw you.

482
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,049
[Nate] That's nice of you.

483
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,844
I wanted to mark the occasion.

484
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:42,969
[taps]

485
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,221
It's my special stash.

486
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:46,557
I brew it out back.
I hope you like IPAs.

487
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,894
- Bro, I am all about the IPAs.
- Yeah?

488
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,813
- You mind?
- [students clamoring]

489
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,819
- My man.
- Mmm! So good.

490
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:00,488
Yeah, that brew right there,

491
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,157
honestly, will just take you back
to the glory days.

492
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,244
Make you forget all about that stupid
and stressful world out there.

493
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:08,954
- Honestly, it's magic, bro.
- Yeah.

494
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,208
I, um... [clears throat]
I just need to check up...

495
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,422
I feel awesome.

496
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,025
- I knew you would.
- Thank you.

497
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,051
- Hey, I wanted to ask you something.
- What?

498
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,262
Why did you and your friends
really end up here, of all places?

499
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:26,764
Oh, man, they're cool.

500
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,975
Uh, we just wanted to take your Chalice,
so we can use the Loom of Fate.

501
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:35,898
Are you saying that the Loombreaker
is a Loomfaker?

502
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:42,947
Bro, you're a looker and a cooker.

503
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:48,369
Right, but she puts
that Loom together...

504
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,370
[grunts]

505
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,958
I mean, there... There goes free will.

506
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,503
There goes the party.

507
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,047
God...

508
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:03,926
And that is very not tight.

And... post.

519
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:58,230
All right, we are officially a part
of the Chug Challenge.

520
00:23:58,314 --> 00:23:59,398
[Agent Sharpe] Yeah.

521
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,625
This should scare the competition.

522
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,569
Yeah, and put us well on track
to using the Loom.

523
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,904
Okay, I think this calls
for a snack party.

524
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,991
Who wants nachos?
It's my brother's special recipe.

[all giggling]

526

Hey, I just wanted to say thank you.

527
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:19,543
I've just always been so focused
on changing the world at all costs

528
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:22,212
that I just push people away.

529
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,591
So... thanks.

530
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:26,967
Oh, I mean...

531
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,302
They're really the ones who...

532
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:31,971
Thank you.

533
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,356
Loom or no Loom,
at least some things are changing.

534
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,275
I can still put a stiletto
through your head.

535
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,944
But your plan does seem to be working.

536
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,906
I still think it's the stupidest way
to get what we want, but...

'Sup, ladies?

00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,083
Heard there was a new sorority
on the block.

540
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,794
Had to come and hit y'all
with that Big D welcome.

541
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,087
What?

542
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,130
You guys tricked out this place.

00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:06,382
[gasps]

544
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,967
Gargoyles in sunglasses? Sick.

545
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,427
So sick!

546
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,972
- Nate, what the hell are you...
- No, it's Shotgun Nate.

547
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,392
You guys have got to come to Dion's.

548
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,477
I mean, it makes me wonder
why I ever left college.

549
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:22,439
Dionysus has the power to put people
in a constant state of ecstasy.

550
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,816
Nate's under his spell.

551
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,026
You mean Shotgun Nate.

552
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,155
Yeah, we're gonna go train
for your dumb challenge,

553
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,740
so go bother some other house.

554
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,992
Oh, right. Uh...

555
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,162
I'm not here
just to meet the new neighbors.

556
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,831
I also wanted to tell you...

557
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,543
that you're disqualified
from the Chug Challenges.

558
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:47,339
There's no way you're getting
that Chalice.

559
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:48,549
The hell are you on about?

560
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,385
Shotgun told me why you're really here.

561
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,179
And the thing is,
I just can't have you using that Loom.

562
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,181
Thing's a total buzzkill.

563
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:59,268
We did everything you said,
played by every stupid rule.

564
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,145
You can't just change them on us now.

565
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:03,188
Well, yeah, I can.

566
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:06,275
I mean,
who says that you have to play fair?

567
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,904
I'm a god. I just gotta
keep it whimsical, bro.

568
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,322
Let's roll.

569
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:15,242

- [men chanting] Whimsy! Whimsy!

570
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,411
Whimsy! Whimsy! Whimsy!

571
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,599
- Who was at the door?
- [Astra groans]

572
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:22,623
What's wrong?

573
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,227
We're not getting the Chalice,
that's what.

574
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,503
Dion's refusing to let us participate
in the challenges.

575
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,667
He somehow got to Nate,
figured out what we're doing.

576
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,007
Of course he did.

577
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,885
[sighs] It's okay,
we will figure this out.

578
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,180
I am done trying to figure this out
with you people.

579
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,056
I should've done this my way
from the start,

580
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,808
so I'm taking that Chalice by force.

581
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,436
Look, even if you tried,
that won't work. You can't defy a god.

582
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,980
And there is no way you're using
the Loom on your own.

583
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,316
Being a grown-up sounds weird.

584
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,903
[Astra] If I can't get Dion's cup,
I can at least make him suffer.

585
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,070
Him and all his bros,

586
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,198
including your
hyp-bro-tized friend, Nate.

587
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:55,407
Hold on a minute.

588
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,576
You can't do that.
We're a sisterhood, remember?

589
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,953
You can stop feeding me
that line right now.

590
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,873
You pretend we're sisters,
but all you do is expect me to change.

591
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,751
I'm only your sister
if I become more like you.

592
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,563
- Astra, calm down, that's not...
- [Astra] You never listen to my ideas,

593
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,631
and I see how you all look at me.

594
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,258
I might be new to this,
but that is not sisterhood,

595
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:15,677
and I am done trying to fit in.

596
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,393
Hey, got your text.

597
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,478
[Mick] Hey.

598
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:26,980
Where were you?

599
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,233
Trying to get you into this place.
What do you think?

600
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,528
What? Dad, how'd you do this?

601
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,238
Went back in time. Donated.

602
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,156
You're as good as in.

603
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,034
Thank you,
but I didn't really need a building.

604
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,828
I just needed you here.

605
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:45,374
Well, I thought you were embarrassed
to be with me.

606
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,543
I don't belong with these people.

607
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,044
I didn't want to ruin your chances.

608
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:53,173
I'm sorry, it wasn't about you.
I was just ashamed of me.

609
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,175
What are you talking about?

610
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,886
Don't be stupid. You're great.

611
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,072
Yeah, but I don't belong
with them either.

612
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,074
I mean, the only reason
that I survived high school

613
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,643
was because I was imagining that one day
I would get out and find my people.

614
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,830
They're never gonna take me
as one of them.

615
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,272
I don't really want to be.

616
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,524
You don't have to impress these idiots,
these leeches.

617
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,777
- You're twice the person they'd ever be.
- Yeah, but so are you.

618
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,321
I mean, you fought a demon dog.

619
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,174
And these people think
that they're better than us

620
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,798
because they have whales
on their shorts?

621
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,075
[Lita scoffs]

622
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,358
What do you say we find a way
to piss off some rich kids?

623
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,789
I like the sound of that.

624
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,465
Give me that.

625
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,391
Wait, Astra, no, no, no!
You don't have to do this.

626
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,726
I am done listening to you.

627
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,895
Fine, then don't listen to me.
Listen to yourself.

628
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,564
Come on, you know this isn't right.

629
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,287
Yeah, that's the thing,
I don't know that.

630
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,818
Where I'm from,
I had to fight to survive.

631
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,862
This is all I know.
This is what life has made me.

632
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,322
I am not gonna change.

633
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,699
Blimey, no, we don't want you
to give up who you are.

634
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,785
Look, when I joined the Legends,
I was a punk.

635
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:06,163
All right? And there wasn't a rule
that I couldn't break.

636
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,457
And guess what? I still am.

637
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,518
I just don't need to hurt people
to survive anymore,

638
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,502
because I have them.

639
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,217
Fine, so I don't burn down a house.

640
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,511
But what if I never wanna dress
as a moose,

641
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,681
or sit through one
of your interminable team meetings?

642
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,620
Then we've still got a place for you.

643
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,645
Did you come to party down?

644
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,064
No, we've come
to get the Chalice and you.

645
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,024
Come on, Nate, you can't stay here.

646
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,735
Sure, I can.
Dion says as long as he has followers,

647
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,218
he has the power to run this place
and grant people that cup.

648
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,616
Thought that'd be useful information
for you.

649
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:43,951
Can't really remember why.

650
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,620
Either way, I'm very important here,
so excuse me.

651
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:50,916
- [chanting] Shotgun Nate! Shotgun Nate!
- [students] Shotgun Nate! Shotgun Nate!

652
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,126
- Shotgun Nate! Shotgun Nate!
- Wait.

653
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,839
The Olympians feed off devotion, right?

654
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,634
So that means that Dion
only has his followers

655
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,136
for as long as they worship him
as the party god.

656
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,140
So, if we take away
all these followers from him,

657
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,309
that's it, the Chalice is released
from his grasp.

658
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,145
Okay, but the party isn't slowing down.

659
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:16,108
No, but there is one way
to get college kids to leave a party.

660
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:18,860
Oh, wait, no, no, please don't say...

661
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:22,781
And that is to throw
an even bigger party. Which means...

662
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,574
[groans] What is wrong with you people?

663
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:25,784
Come on.

664
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,788
[exhales] The Deltas
have got to out-party Dionysus.

665
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,790
I am still in Hell, aren't I?

666
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:33,624
Come on.

667
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,139
I can't believe it.
Delta's very first house party.

668
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,141
You know, I'm actually excited.

669
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,685
I get it now.
Parties aren't just about getting drunk.

670
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,311
They're about building community.

671
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,772
This is so much better
than just some frat party.

672
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,942
Yeah, it would be
if anyone were here to see it.

673
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:00,944
So, where is everybody?

674
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,821
You know what? I think I know.

675
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,825
- [music playing]
- [lively chatter]

676
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,785
[sighs]

677
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:14,166
I don't know why we thought
we could out-party Dion.

678
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,043
You know what? Let's not give up yet.

679
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:20,297
Why not? We have drinks, games, music.

680
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,759
We did everything we were supposed to,
and no one came.

681
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:27,304
That's right. We did everything
that we were supposed to.

682
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,266
But maybe we should ask ourselves,
"What would Astra do?"

683
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,104
If you really want to win,

684
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:38,231
it is not enough to be good
at your own game.

685
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,068
You also
have to take out the competition.

686
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,778
So, I am talking...

687
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,655
- sabotage.
- Yeah.

688
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,408
All right, what's the plan?

689
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,869
First, we take Dion out of play.

690
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,233
Now, I scoped out his place
when I was gonna burn it down,

691
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,415
and I have an idea.

692
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,668
[hip-hop music playing]

693
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,547
Ooh. 'Sup, Charlie?

694
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,221
[whooshing]

695
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,100
- Big D!
- [Dionysus] Yeah.

696
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,935
Now that I got my team out of your hair,

697
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,395
how about we get
a fresh keg and celebrate?

698
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,731
I like how you think, Shotgun.

699
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,691
[Astra] <i>Once he's out,
we mess with his party.</i>

700
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,568
<i>Anything we can do to kill the vibe.</i>

701
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,404
Hacking into Dion's accounts and...

702
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,381
<i>- Buh-bye, party playlist.</i>
- [music stops]

703
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,120
Hey. Who cut the music?

704
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,538
[yodel music playing]

705
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,248
What the hell is this?

706
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:39,000
[Astra] <i>Then we take out his booze.</i>

707
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,838
And this is where all the magic happens.

708
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,714
[Charlie as Nate] Wow.

709
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:49,094
So, uh, are these all lagers?

710
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,637
Whoa.

711
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,848
I'm sorry, bro.
No hard feelings, yeah?

712
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,474
Dad, now!

713
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,273
[yelps]

714
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:02,858
[keg explodes]

715
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:07,779
And now the keg is tapped.

716
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:12,450
So, final phase, hijack the party.

717
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,997
Hey, guys, I heard there's a rager
at Delta Chi Sigma.

718
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,541
[students cheering]

719
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,879
So, what are we waiting for?

720
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:25,589
Let's go party.

721
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,300
[upbeat dance song playing]

722
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:33,180
I gotta say it,
you Legends do know how to party.

723
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,182
Rory, are you able
to lift the Chalice yet?

724
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,226
[grunts] It's still not giving.

725
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:42,189
That doesn't make sense.
All of his followers are here.

726
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:48,445
Cool little trick you pulled back there.
Gotta appreciate a good stunt.

727
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:52,199
Still, I heard there was a party
that I wasn't invited to,

728
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:53,658
and that hurts.

729
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,619
We're getting that Chalice, Dion.

730
00:33:55,702 --> 00:34:00,040
As long as I have my followers,
my Chug Cup isn't going anywhere.

731
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,125
And bros are bros for life.

732
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:08,465
Bros are bros for life! Bros are bros
for life! Bros are bros for life!

733
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,966
[Sara] Hey!

734
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:13,220
Your reign on this campus is over.

735
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,763
I challenge you...

736
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,265
to beer pong.

737
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:18,850
[students] Ooh.

738
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,399
You do know I'm undefeated
in all my years on campus, right?

739
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:32,781
Yeah, but it might be pretty hard
to hold on to all your followers

740
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:36,201
once they watch me demolish you.

741
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:40,538
So come on, D-Bag.

742
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:42,415
[students laughing]

743
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:43,833
What do you say?

744
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,295
Winner takes all. Dartmouth rules.

745
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,839
[sighs]

746
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,276
You know I can't say no to a challenge.

747
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,012
Hmm.

748
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,723
Stupid whimsy. You're on.

749
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,268
But if I win,

750
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,895
Delta House gets shut down.

751
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:09,609
No sorority and no Chug Cup.

752
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,736
Yeah! [whooping]

753
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,074
You sure about this, babe?
'Cause, you know, you can't see.

754
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,660
Oh, I've played some beer pong
in my life.

755
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,620
And plus, superpowers, remember?

756
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,250
The game is beer pong.

757
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,751
[students cheering]

758
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:29,587
Now, sink a ball into a cup
and the other player drinks it.

759
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:33,258
And to make it even more fun,
body saves are fair game.

760
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:34,342
[students murmuring]

761
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:39,180
So remember, everybody, the first player
to clear the other's cups takes it all.

762
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,808
Now, opponents, please shake hands.

763
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,812
May the best player win.

764
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,192
Whatever.

765
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,618
[hip-hop music playing]

766
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:07,667
[exhales]

767
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,210
And pong!

768
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,015
[Charlie] Chug!

769
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:27,937
[groans]

770
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:32,691
[students cheering]

771
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,654
[grunts] Okay.

772
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:41,284
Chug! Chug! Chug!

773
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,209
[groans]

774
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,210
Yes!

775
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:51,211
Whoo!

776
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,005
This point wins it.

777
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,261
All right. Let's do this.

778
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,179
Whoo!

779
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:05,849
[kisses]

780
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,536
[students groan]

781
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,413
[all cheering]

782
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,669
I'm sorry, dude.

783
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:34,921
[Charlie cheers]

784
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,004
Our winner!

785
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,383
[woman] Whoo!

786
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:39,384
We gotta give it to her.

787
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:41,821
Wait, wait, wait.
What happened to "Bros for life"?

788
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:42,845
[exclaims]

789
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,890
Come on. I know you wanna say it.

790
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,101
I will not.

791
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,769
Then I will.

792
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,355
Go, sisters!

793
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,857
[all cheering]

794
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
[portal opens]

795
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,025
Huh?

796
00:37:58,236 --> 00:37:59,236
Got your cup.

797
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,531
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

798
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,244
Best father-daughter weekend ever.

799
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,257
I can't believe that actually worked.

800
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,550
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

801
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,844
We couldn't have done it
without the three of you.

802
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,430
Yeah, thanks for sticking with us
even when we were right gits.

803
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:26,473
[all chuckling]

804
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:27,682
It's been real, ladies.

805
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:31,186
I'm sorry this chapter of Delta Chi
Sigma has to come to an end.

806
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:32,437
Oh, it's not over.

807
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,938
We're gonna keep Delta House going.

808
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,207
- What?
- [Lisa] After the party,

809
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:37,358
I applied for a house on Greek Row.

810
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:39,360
Fitting in is hard enough.

811
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:42,322
So many people telling you what to do
and what to wear.

812
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:45,450
Now there's a space for people
to figure it out for themselves.

813
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,534
Thanks to you guys.

814
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,245
I get it. You're welcome.

815
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:50,663
[Zari] All right, ladies.

816
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:51,789
- [Charlie] Oi.
- What?

817
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:52,831
One for the road?

818
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:53,958
Go...

819
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,125
[all] Deltas.

820
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:58,670
[Zari] Aw.

821
00:38:58,671 --> 00:38:59,671
We'll miss you.

822
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,424
- Say no to drugs, kids.
- [Zari sighs]

823
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,384
Don't do it. It's not worth it.

824
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,054
- I need a nap.
- [chuckles]

825
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,536
[Dionysus] You guys earned
the good stuff.

826
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,272
You won the Chalice and, with it,
immortality for a day.

827
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,400
All right, guess it's time to chug.

828
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,196
[sighs]

829
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,533
To Behrad and to your mum.

830
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,037
[sighs] Well...

831
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,831
[chuckles] It's actually quite a lot
of responsibility, really.

832
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:35,917
And that is a lot of wine.

833
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,586
Why don't we all just drink from it?

834
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,564
I mean, who says there only has
to be three Fates, right?

835
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:41,899
Yeah, we could
all use the Loom together.

836
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,403
Yeah, you're not alone in this, love.

837
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,510
Immortality sounds pretty epic.

838
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:46,995
- [Charlie chuckles]
- Let's drink.

839
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,097
Let's all do it, then.

840
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,820
- [Agent Sharpe] Yeah.
- [Nate] All right.

841
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,350
[Charlie sighs]

842
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,312
[chuckles]

843
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,568
[groans] Wow.

844
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:05,154
[clears throat] Yeah,
I'm not gonna drink, super haram,

845
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:08,199
but I trust all of you to bring
my baby brother back.

846
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:14,538
Here goes nothing.

847
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,209
[Sara exclaims]

848
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,385
[Nate grunts softly]

849
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:30,555
That's it.

850
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,142
Well, not exactly, bro.

851
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,401
Oh, wow. You are all glowing.

852
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:48,364
Oh, must be the moisturizer
you recommended. My skin feels tighter.

853
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,366
Literally... You're literally glowing.

854
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,994
Guys, we did it.

855
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,621
- [Nate whoops]
- [chuckles]

856
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:56,748
Come on, let's go and use that Loom.

857
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,918
And remember, no looming anything
that'll ruin my party.

858
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,589
Not that you would, Clotho.
I can tell you're still chill.

859
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:05,757
That's right.

860
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,175
Later days, Shotgun.

861
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,910
[voice breaking] Later days, Dion.

862
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,012
You guys got some trippy art here.

863
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,265
- This cane was yelling at me.
- [Constantine] Yeah.

864
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:15,975
I'll take that. Nice one, love.

865
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,561
Sounds like someone's had
too much to drink.

866
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,355
Let's get you out of here.

867
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,798
- [Agent Sharpe] Bye.
- [Zari] Bye.

868
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,399
[mouthes] Wow.

869
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:31,113
[Lachesis] Hello, traitor.

870
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:38,039
Just the woman I wanted to see.

871
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:40,792
Don't bother trying to win me back.
I don't need you anymore.

872
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,920
When you asked for my help
killing John Constantine,

873
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:46,172
I warned you, you would be in my debt.

874
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,050
Well, honey, I'm calling in the favor.

875
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,852
