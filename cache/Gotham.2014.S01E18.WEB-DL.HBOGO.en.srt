1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,440
This is Reginald Payne.
We served together, sir.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,160
Feel free to stay with us a few days.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
You're stealing from us?

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Arnold Flass, you're under arrest
for the murder of Leon Winkler.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,480
IA ruled it a suicide.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,440
- Arnold Flass, you're under arrest.
- I'm protected.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,760
So you're the one causing
all of the fuss.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,040
You will take nothing from me.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,240
Really?

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,360
- Stop...
- No!

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
He has nothing concrete.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, is the time to make
a move on the kid.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,760
Slim pickings at the food court.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,120
- Brought you a bagel.
- Thanks.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,040
Nothing for the invalid?

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,400
Sorry.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,920
Hospital food only. Doctor's orders.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
- How you feeling?
- All right.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,920
There's a slight puncture,
leaked a bit.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
So, I know last night
must be kind of a blur,

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,560
but do you have any idea
who did this?

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
- It... It was...
- Dark. It was very dark.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,720
I saw a shadow,

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,240
then my savior,

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,240
Master Bruce, was leaning over me.

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,640
Did you get a look at the guy?

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,000
No.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,720
- Sorry. My captain keeps calling.
- It's fine, detective.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,560
- Just... Just go.
- No, I can stay.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,440
I appreciate you sitting
with Master Bruce

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,840
but as you can see
I'm completely fine.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Go.

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
All right.
I'll try and stop by later.

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,280
Thank you again for coming,
detective.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
Why not tell him the truth?

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,560
Well, believe it or not,
Master Bruce,

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Reggie is a mate.

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,720
You don't set coppers on your mates,
do you?

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,360
- But he nearly killed you.
- I served with that bastard.

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,800
Anyone sorts him out, it's me,
nobody else. It wouldn't be right.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,040
- Why would he stab you?
- Now, that's a bloody good question.

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,160
And one...

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,480
I mean to find out.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,320
Because the longer that bloody
lunatic's out on the loose,

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,680
the harder it's gonna be to find him.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Now, you just...

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,640
Get back in bed, Alfred.

49
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,600
- Just pass me my robe.
- Get back in bed.

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,200
That's an order.

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,280
You're awake.

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,400
Wonderful.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,680
- How long have I been?
- Asleep?

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,240
Just since last night.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
How do you feel?

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,560
- My head hurts.
- To be expected.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
May I?

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Who are you?

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,640
Doctor Francis Dulmacher.

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Founder of this facility.

61
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,560
A pleasure.

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,080
I've gone to great lengths
to meet you, doctor.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,480
Indeed you have.

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,160
I must say you have
a remarkable constitution.

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,200
I wish I could say the same
of all my patients.

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,000
So I'm a patient now,
no longer a prisoner.

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,680
I confess I don't know what you are.

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,080
You seize control of the basement,

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
take one of my guards hostage,

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,160
then scoop out your own eye.

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
What am I to do with you?

72
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,840
Simple.

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
Make me your right hand.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,160
I'm glad to see you've retained
your sense of humor.

75
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm not joking.

76
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,280
For the past 10 years,

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
I have been Carmine Falcone's
top lieutenant.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,360
I'm afraid the name
means nothing to me.

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,600
I woke up hungry and alone
in an underground cell.

80
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,040
In less than a week,
I brought this place to a standstill.

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,760
Now, you've had me as your enemy.

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,280
Wouldn't you rather have me
as your friend?

83
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Such vim,

84
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,520
such panache.

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Bravo.

86
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,120
And now you should eat.

87
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I have a nurse coming
with some food.

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,400
We'll talk more later.

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Tricky things, eyes.

90
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,720
Our stock is frightfully low
at the moment.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,640
And apologies,

92
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,920
we couldn't match
your original color.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,080
We'll talk soon.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,280
This can't be true.

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,960
{\an5}I was prepping the case for the DA
when word came down this morning.

96
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,240
{\an5}Press got it last night, of course.

97
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,080
{\an5}We had the murder weapon.
With Flass' prints.

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
{\an5}There's no way.

99
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,120
{\an5}Apparently, the defense dug up
a witness,

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,680
{\an5}cleared Flass of all charges.

101
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,480
- What witness?
- No idea.

102
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,040
Only the judge and the lead attorneys
were privy,

103
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,320
{\an5}and our honorable DA is staying mum.

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,680
{\an5}- What about a subpoena?
- We don't have sufficient grounds.

105
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,320
{\an5}But I did a little snooping around.

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,040
- And?
- The mystery witness

107
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
{\an5}was provided by Commissioner Loeb.

108
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,320
{\an5}Let me guess,

109
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,520
{\an5}Loeb's reinstating Flass
as head of Narco.

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,840
{\an5}Worse.
He announced he's backing Flass

111
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
{\an5}for president
of the Policemen's Union

112
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
in the upcoming election.

113
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,440
{\an5}You're telling me a man we know
is a drug dealer and a murderer

114
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,200
{\an5}is gonna hold a major position

115
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,640
- in the G.C.P.D.?
- Clearly, Loeb's sending a message.

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,880
{\an5}This is not gonna stand.

117
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,400
{\an5}Look. I'm just as upset
about this as you are.

118
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,480
{\an5}- Jim. But it's the commissioner.
- Which is what makes it worse.

119
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,440
{\an5}Jim... Jim!

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,480
{\an5}Jimbo.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,200
{\an5}You heard the good news?

122
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,400
{\an5}Hey, the boys are throwing me a
welcome-back down at O'Donnell's.

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,520
{\an5}Figure you'd wanna stop by...

124
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Show us support
for your soon-to-be new president.

125
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,440
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

126
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,800
{\an5}You just don't learn.

127
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,840
{\an5}You still wanna take me down.

128
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,000
{\an5}I'm like the phoenix.

129
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,080
{\an5}I'll just rise
again and again and again.

130
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,560
Detective Gordon.

131
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,800
{\an5}I had a presentiment
I might be seeing you.

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,600
{\an5}Arnold Flass is a murderer.
He belongs in jail.

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,160
{\an5}Detective Flass
was legally exonerated.

134
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,600
{\an5}The judge heard testimony.
The case is closed.

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,080
{\an5}You used your connections
to orchestrate his release.

136
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,200
{\an5}You perverted the system.

137
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,560
Petulance and naiveté
are a bad combination.

138
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,800
Know when you're beaten.

139
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
{\an5}I was knee- deep
in the Flass investigation.

140
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,720
There is no one with enough
credibility to trump our evidence.

141
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,760
{\an5}I do enjoy when unwavering certainty
is undermined by the truth.

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,040
<i>Look into the camera,
state your name and why you're here.</i>

143
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,400
<i>My name is
Detective Harvey Bullock...</i>

144
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
<i>And I presented
false evidence against</i>

145
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,640
<i>my fellow G.C.P.D. detective...</i>

146
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
<i>Arnold Flass.</i>

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,440
Hey, there you are.

148
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,160
Dude,
I feel like a herd of cattle had

149
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,760
a dance party
in my head last night.

150
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,520
- What's up?
- Why the hell would you lie

151
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,720
to exonerate Flass?

152
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,200
Don't deny it, I saw the tape.

153
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,640
I'm not denying anything.

154
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
I did what I had to do.

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,560
If I didn't do
what Loeb told me to do,

156
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,040
I would have lost my job.

157
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,360
Probably gone to prison.

158
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,080
What does he have on you? Harvey.

159
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,960
You honestly think you're
the only one who had orders

160
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,600
to take a punk down to the end of
a pier and put a bullet in his head?

161
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,760
The difference is my Cobblepot
didn't come back.

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Who'd you kill?

163
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
Some scumbag mobster.

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,120
Caught him coming out
of a club one night.

165
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
My sergeant put a gun in my hand,

166
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,920
held another to my head and said,
"Make a choice."

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,720
I decided to keep breathing.

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Damn it, Harvey.

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,040
So, what?
What are you gonna do, arrest me?

170
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Go ahead, arrest me,
but don't stop there.

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,720
Half the cops on the G.C.P.D.
have a Cobblepot

172
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
and Loeb has the goods
on all of them.

173
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
That is what Loeb does.

174
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
Well, it ends now.

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Jim, hey.

176
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Going after Flass was bad enough.

177
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,120
Going after Loeb is suicide,
plain and simple.

178
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,320
So, what? I'm supposed to stay quiet?
Fall in line like the rest of you?

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,800
- That would be a good idea.
- The day,

180
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,640
I do that is the day
I quit being a cop.

181
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,520
- My.
- Fun fact.

182
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,480
The human species attracts
the opposite sex via pheromones

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,560
secreted through saliva,
sweat and urine.

184
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
- Gross.
- But...

185
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,720
One can't always trust
such an animalistic method

186
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
to find a suitable partner.

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,840
What are you trying to tell me?

188
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
Arnold Flass was released.

189
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,920
I know that you two were dating,

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,760
and if the attraction
wasn't intellectual...

191
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,320
How could it be with that gorilla?

192
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,560
Then it must be physical.

193
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,920
He's just...
He's such a bad, bad, ba...

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,240
I appreciate your concern...

195
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,040
But it won't be necessary.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
I've realized
there are far better men

197
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,720
in the world than Arnold Flass.

198
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,200
<i>So Loeb's been collecting dirt
on cops for years</i>

199
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,040
<i>and using it to control
the department.</i>

200
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,400
I doubt it stops there.

201
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,360
He's probably got leverage
on businessmen, politicians.

202
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,720
He's got nothing on me.

203
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,960
Just checking.

204
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,000
Anyway, yeah,
that's the source of all his power.

205
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,800
And you wanna
steal the dragon's gold.

206
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,240
If we find his cache of evidence
and destroy it, he'll be toothless.

207
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Well, I know Loeb.

208
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,560
He won't keep it anywhere obvious.

209
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,400
We could watch him,
hope he leads us to it.

210
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,680
We don't have that kind of time.

211
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,800
Isn't there someone Loeb
might have trusted?

212
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,000
Ex-friends, an estranged wife.

213
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,280
No. Well, he was married.

214
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
She died 20 years ago.

215
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,480
Fell down the stairs.

216
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,440
There were rumors Loeb killed her,
but nothing ever happened with it.

217
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,800
I still can't believe
about your partner.

218
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Why did he do it?
What's Loeb have on him?

219
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I don't know.

220
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,440
Well, it's gotta be rough.

221
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,240
I know how it is
with cops and their partners.

222
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,600
What is it?

223
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,240
What's the matter, Dent?

224
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,680
I thought that lambaster
case was settled.

225
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,320
And why the hell are
we meeting here?

226
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,080
You'll see.

227
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,880
You know, Jim Gordon.

228
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
What the hell is going on?

229
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Have a seat.

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Back before Loeb
was commissioner,

231
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,160
when he was a lowly Homicide dick,
you were his partner.

232
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,760
Yeah. That was 20 years ago.

233
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,200
But I always hear that
cop partnerships are like marriages.

234
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,720
You know, each other better
than your wives.

235
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
Isn't that right, Jim?

236
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,640
That's right.

237
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,640
You digging up that old story
about Loeb killing his wife?

238
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,560
He was with me when she died.

239
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,080
We know about the secret files.

240
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,160
- What secret files?
- That was good.

241
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,320
I almost believed him.
What about you, Jim?

242
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,120
- No.
- You're out of your depth, kid.

243
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,280
Both of you.

244
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,440
Swim back to shore.

245
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
He's got something on you too,
doesn't he?

246
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,560
He got you to do something for him.
What was it?

247
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Robbery?

248
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Coercion?

249
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Murder?

250
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,800
And all this time, he's been using it
to keep you under his thumb.

251
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,400
This is your chance
to breathe easy again.

252
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,760
Take it, Griggs.

253
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,800
I don't know
what you two are talking about.

254
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,840
If I did, I'd say talk to Xi Lu.

255
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,760
Chinese bookkeeper on Huron Street.

256
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,520
Loeb always said,
"You wanna keep something safe...

257
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,240
You give it Xi Lu."

258
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,160
You wanna bring in Bullock?
We might need him.

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
No.

260
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,920
- Thanks, gentleman.
- Yeah.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,560
I mean it.

262
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,040
- I like the blue.
- I'm so pleased.

263
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,600
Happy patient, happy doctor.

264
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,920
Mrs. Harris.

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,280
- Hello, doctor.
- Don't forget,

266
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
jazz at 6 on the veranda...

267
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,080
But no martinis
until the bandages come off, yes?

268
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,080
- You're no fun.
- Good girl.

269
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,520
Kidney transplant.

270
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,440
We threw in a new face for free.

271
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,000
And none too soon.

272
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,040
But you need
a steady supply of organs?

273
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,160
Yes.

274
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,400
Which is suddenly something
of a problem, thanks to you.

275
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,720
But I'm also a solution.

276
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,760
The people in the basement trust me.

277
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Put me in charge and I promise you
a dependable flow of healthy product.

278
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,960
Or I could save myself the trouble
and kill you and everyone downstairs.

279
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,920
Now, if that were an option,
you would have done it already.

280
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,120
And you surely wouldn't have wasted
this beautiful eye on little old me.

281
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,640
I'd like to show you something.

282
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,640
People view themselves as unique,
self-contained systems.

283
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,360
But we are merely
a collection of parts.

284
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,520
What happens
when I replace your eyes,

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,720
your face, your heart?

286
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,080
When do you stop being you
and become something new?

287
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,440
That's what fascinates me.

288
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,680
Nice talk.

289
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,360
Do we have a deal?

290
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,000
Conditionally.

291
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,200
I will send you back to the basement.

292
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
You will retrieve my guard
and then prove to me

293
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,200
that you can provide me
with the bodies.

294
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,640
A test?

295
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,760
And if I fail?

296
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,920
Those who fail me
still have their uses.

297
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,400
You may remember
my former officer manager.

298
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,640
No!

299
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
No!

300
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,680
Amusing, no?

301
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,520
No!

302
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,440
Help.

303
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,120
<i>"And then I looked at the stars</i>

304
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,560
<i>and considered how awful it would be</i>

305
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,200
for a man to turn his face up to them
as he froze to death

306
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,040
and see no help or pity
in the glittering multitude.

307
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Here come...

308
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,840
That's cheerful.

309
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,280
What are you doing here?

310
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
Ivy sneaks in a few times a week.

311
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,120
Steals food from the sickies.

312
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,280
She's spotted you.

313
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
He okay?

314
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,640
Thanks.

316
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,440
Alfred was stabbed.

317
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,800
It was a friend of his from the army.

318
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,200
Well, that sucks.

319
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,880
I think he was there because of me.

320
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
What are you talking about?

321
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,480
I had a meeting with the board
of Wayne Enterprises,

322
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,880
to tell them
I was investigating them.

323
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,840
So they sent someone
we trust to spy on us.

324
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,440
What was he looking for?

325
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
Some of my files are missing.

326
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,480
I think the other things
he stole were just cover.

327
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,080
If I find him...

328
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,040
I could find out who hired him.
He's the key to everything.

329
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,560
You're gonna track him down?

330
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,160
Really? You?

331
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I have to.

332
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,840
- This... This is my fault.
- Kid, you're out of your mind.

333
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,440
Look. Is that how you wanna end up?

334
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,880
I don't expect you to understand.

335
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,360
- I'll help.
- No.

336
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,200
I can't risk anybody else
getting hurt on the account of me.

337
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,840
You know, how to find me.

338
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,320
Xi Lu.

339
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,760
Detective Gordon. G.C.P.D.

340
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,360
We have a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

341
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,320
Is there somewhere
we could talk in private?

342
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,360
Ask your questions, detective.

343
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,960
It's about Commissioner Loeb.

344
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,600
We understand you two have
a business relationship.

345
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,680
- I do not know Commissioner Loeb.
- Listen, old man.

346
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,920
We can have a dozen ADAs
and cops here in 10 minutes.

347
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,520
We'll confiscate every dollar
in this place

348
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,320
and you will go to jail.

349
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,080
Your name is Gordon?

350
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,040
That's right.

351
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,280
And you are Dent.

352
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,720
Yes.

353
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,120
Wait here.

354
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,720
(Foreign language)

355
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,200
- Okay, not good.
- G.C.P.D. Drop your weapons now.

356
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,840
- Gordon.
- Yeah, run.

357
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,920
Get in!

358
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,920
We gotta go back there. Call backup.

359
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,600
Forget it. Place will be cleaned out.

360
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Thanks for stopping by.

361
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,400
I got enough on my conscience.

362
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
Griggs set us up.

363
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,840
Now, Loeb knows
we're after his evidence cache.

364
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,240
Griggs sent you?

365
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,200
The guy would turn on anyone
to save his own skin.

366
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,400
- You gotta scare him enough.
- We tried.

367
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,920
Let me. Counselor, trust me,
you're gonna wanna sit this one out.

368
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,640
I want a name!

369
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,440
- Falcone.
- What?

370
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,960
The only person who knows
where Loeb keeps his stash.

371
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,400
Falcone.

372
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,160
The two of them are in it together.

373
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,600
Loeb and Falcone.

374
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,920
You two are dead men.

375
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,080
You're going against
Loeb and Falcone, you're dead.

376
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,720
Go! Before I lose my good cheer. Go!

377
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,440
He has a point.

378
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Yeah.

379
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,680
So, what next?

380
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,960
Assume Loeb and Falcone
are the only ones

381
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,000
who know where the stash is.

382
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,800
We need someone close to them.

383
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,800
Someone who'll talk.

384
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
That person doesn't exist.

385
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,800
Yeah, he does.

386
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,120
yes.

387
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Gentlemen.

388
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,960
So nice to see you.

389
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
What can I do for you?

390
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,480
You do realize
what you're asking me to do?

391
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,560
If Don Falcone is working
with Commissioner Loeb

392
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,960
to keep this trove of secrets hidden
and I help you uncover them,

393
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,600
I'd be betraying my patron?

394
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,880
- That's right.
- If he found out, he'd...

395
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,240
Well, he'd be very angry.
To say the least.

396
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,040
Enough with
the hemming and hawing.

397
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,920
Are you gonna help us or not?

398
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,120
Let's say for argument's sake
I could help you,

399
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,360
what's in it for me?

400
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,560
I'll owe you a favor.

401
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,600
No questions asked?

402
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Jim.

403
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Yes.

404
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,800
Do you know what this is?

405
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,440
Madre de Dios.

406
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,720
A hundred bottles made once a year
by monks in the Italian countryside.

407
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,960
It's Don Maroni's favorite.

408
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,360
What's your point?

409
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,840
It's just a piece of information
that might be useful one day.

410
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,440
I like information.

411
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,760
If I help you find
where Loeb keeps his files

412
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,600
you give me 10 minutes alone
with them.

413
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,120
I take what I want.

414
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,160
- This is not a good idea.
- Five minutes.

415
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,800
And you don't touch anything
that has to do with cops.

416
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,600
Five minutes with the files
and a favor from Jim Gordon?

417
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Done.

418
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,000
So, who's up for a road trip?

419
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,200
We have to give Fish more time.

420
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,480
She'll get us out of here,
she promised.

421
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,360
Can't you see she abandoned us?

422
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,160
Got herself out
and left us here to rot.

423
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,960
I say we kill this one.
Let them know we're serious.

424
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,320
- Fish said- -
- Fish, Fish, Fish.

425
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Where is Fish now?

426
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm disappointed.

427
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,560
I told you I was coming back.
What, you didn't believe me?

428
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,720
Family is built on trust,
and that's what we are.

429
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,240
- A family.
- Fish,

430
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
I tried. I did.

431
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,600
I know you did.

432
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,560
So, where's everything you promised?

433
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,080
- When do we get out?
- First things first.

434
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,120
I spoke to the man upstairs

435
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,560
about our demands
for better conditions, better food.

436
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,280
He asked, for a show of good faith...

437
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,280
We're gonna return his guard.

438
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Let him go.

439
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Now.

440
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,920
Next.

441
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,960
- What?
- No!

442
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,120
What are they doing?

443
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm sorry,
honey, you're on the list.

444
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,360
- Doctor's orders.
- Fish.

445
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
- Fish!
- I told you, didn't I?

446
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
She's working for them now.

447
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,120
I warned you not
everyone would live.

448
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
Their sacrifice means your survival.

449
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,760
And my promise remains the same.

450
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,760
You sure about this, Penguin?

451
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,200
You're telling me this is where Loeb
keeps 20 years of dirty secrets?

452
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,680
- It doesn't feel right.
- Maybe that's the point.

453
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,280
No one would suspect it.

454
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,280
What would you prefer,
Detective Bullock?

455
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
A sign saying
"super-secret blackmail hoard"?

456
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,480
You know, the last time
the three of us took a ride,

457
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,240
you were in the trunk.

458
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,760
I like that better.

459
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,840
I told you, I overheard Falcone
on the phone to Loeb.

460
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,200
He said the farm was safe.

461
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,960
Now, I'll wait here,
and when you're done

462
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,000
flash the lights or something.

463
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,400
You're coming along.

464
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,640
But if whoever is inside sees me
and reports back to Falcone...

465
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
Then you'll be
in some really deep doo.

466
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
What did you think?

467
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,320
We were gonna go
do your dirty work?

468
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,240
And then you were just gonna waltz
in and pick through the leavings?

469
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,760
Have some respect.

470
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,480
- You fellows lost?
- Good evening, sir.

471
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,400
We were sent by Commissioner Loeb.

472
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,760
Might we have a word?

473
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,280
Out of the cold.

474
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,680
Well,

475
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,640
Marge is putting on some tea.

476
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,080
- I love your house. So cozy.
- Thank you.

477
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,080
How long have you two been here?

478
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,080
Well, about 20 years.

479
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,920
Ever since Mr. Loeb bought the place.

480
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,120
Hard to believe, time, boy.

481
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,720
You should have
seen Margie back then.

482
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,280
Hot to trot.

483
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,480
- What were you doing before that?
- Nothing much.

484
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,960
Margie was a nurse over at Arkham,
and I was working on the railroad.

485
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,440
Why are you men here?

486
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,080
Inspection.

487
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,200
Commissioner Loeb
has some concerns about security.

488
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,080
We didn't hear nothing about it.

489
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,440
- You didn't get a letter?
- No.

490
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,560
That's odd.
You should have gotten a letter.

491
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,160
You got ID?

492
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Well, I don't know
if that's necessary.

493
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,480
No, no. It's fine.

494
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,040
Jim Gordon, G.C.P.D.

495
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,720
This is Detective Bullock.

496
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,320
We're on the commissioner's
personal detail.

497
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,880
He don't look like a cop.

498
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm undercover.

499
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,520
Damn raccoons.

500
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,760
Jim, what do you say we get on
with our inspection?

501
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,680
Perhaps you wouldn't mind
showing us around.

502
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,840
Absolutely. Marge,
would you mind fetching my keys?

503
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,360
Sure.

504
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,600
Now, listen, before you go

505
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,560
you fellows have got to get a piece
of Marge's cake.

506
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,240
She makes it with sour cream.
Tastes like a warm Sunday morning.

507
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,360
- That's one hell of a big raccoon.
- Maybe we should start upstairs.

508
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,280
Just wait a lick for the keys.

509
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,720
- Margie pie, that was quick.
- Ma'am, put down the...

510
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,160
Freeze!

511
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,800
Thanks, Jim.

512
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,360
- You saved my life.
- Watch them.

513
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,080
You're lucky
I have a soft spot for old ladies.

514
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,720
It... It's so quiet downstairs.

515
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,720
Is the party over?

516
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,520
I prepared a song.

517
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,520
It... It includes
a dance and everything.

518
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,360
Who the hell are you?

519
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,760
I'm Miriam Loeb.

520
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,960
Did my father send you?

521
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Miss Kringle.

522
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,080
- Mr. Nygma.
- Miss Kringle,

523
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,520
I was wondering
if you had plans this evening.

524
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,560
Actually I do.

525
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,520
With Tom. Have you met Tom?

526
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,400
You're the guy that likes riddles.
Hey.

527
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,400
What has hands but can't clap?

528
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,920
- A clock.
- Correct.

529
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,840
He's good. You're good.

530
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,680
Am I correct to assume
that this is your?

531
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,800
Your new boyfriend?

532
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,080
- Yeah... Yes, I guess so.
- You betcha.

533
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,280
Congratulations, sir.

534
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Thank you.

535
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,400
- Well, we should probably get going.
- Okay.

536
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,080
It's nice to meet you.

537
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,080
Riddle man, next time.

538
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,680
I'm gonna stump you.

539
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,200
Yes. Next time.

540
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,040
So, Miriam.

541
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,600
- You live up here all the time?
- Always.

542
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,840
Ever since...

543
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,120
I...

544
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,400
I'm not alone, though.

545
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,080
Father comes to visit on Sundays,

546
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,320
and we listen to the radio
and play checkers.

547
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,880
He always lets me win.

548
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,000
My dad used to do the same thing.

549
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Really?

550
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Fathers are funny like that,
aren't they?

551
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Your dad's a real hoot.

552
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,040
Does he keep other stuff up here?

553
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,880
Like important papers or files
or maybe rooms full of boxes?

554
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
No.

555
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,600
Why would he do that?

556
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,840
This is a waste of time.

557
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Miriam.

558
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,560
What happened to your mother?

559
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
She...

560
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,320
Died.

561
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,400
I... I've started a new hobby.

562
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,640
- Would you like to see?
- Sure.

563
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,880
Great.

564
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
What are you doing?

565
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,440
Loeb's wife died 20 years ago.

566
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,040
Skull fracture
from a fall down the stairs.

567
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,600
Miriam would have been a teenager.

568
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
You think Loeb killed her?

569
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,600
She was the witness? That's why
he keeps her cooped up here?

570
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,320
You said I wasn't the only one
with a Cobblepot.

571
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,560
Maybe this is his.

572
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,520
I started making jewelry.

573
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,520
What's it made of?

574
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,280
Bones.

575
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,520
Starlings.

576
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,040
They...

577
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,720
They land on my windowsill

578
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,000
and...

579
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,640
You can catch them
if you're really silent and still.

580
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,360
And I can be really silent and still.

581
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,760
Silent as a mouse.

582
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,000
Then what do you do?

583
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I...

584
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,280
Crush the back of their heads...

585
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,360
As I press down my thumb.

586
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,880
It makes like a popping noise.

587
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Pop it.

588
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,680
Miriam.

589
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,440
Can you tell us
about your mother's death?

590
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,640
I'm a good person.

591
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,520
Sometimes good people
make mistakes.

592
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,320
That's what Father said.

593
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,240
Did you make a mistake
with your mother?

594
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,480
Is it like what happens
with the birds?

595
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
No.

596
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,720
Not like with the birds, no.

597
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Silly.

598
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,680
I had to use a candlestick on her.

599
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,400
She wouldn't stop singing either.

600
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,600
She knew that it was my night.

601
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,960
I was supposed to perform at dinner.

602
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,440
Not her.

603
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,440
So you hit her and she stopped.

604
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,800
And your dad covered it up.

605
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,760
He knew that it was my night.

606
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,040
I'm sorry, Jim.

607
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,840
They came at me. I tried...

608
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,320
Did you find what Loeb's hiding?

609
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,560
Is it here?

610
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes.

611
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,200
Well, a deal is a deal.

612
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,840
You have to let me in there.

613
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,160
Who's he?

614
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,880
He looks just like a bird.

615
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
I love birds.

616
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,880
I see you still haven't learned
the art of knocking,

617
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,000
Detective Gordon.

618
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,760
Miriam is sick.

619
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,840
She didn't mean to hurt her mother.
She just...

620
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,200
Has these urges.

621
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,920
If you want to expose
what she did, go ahead.

622
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,920
You think
I can't weather the scandal?

623
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm sure you could.

624
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,960
But that's not why you kept her
locked away for 20 years.

625
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,520
Do enlighten me.

626
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,840
I think you love her.

627
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,000
I think you've done everything you
can to keep her out of Arkham.

628
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,080
And you'll keep doing it.

629
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
You're willing to hold my daughter
hostage to achieve your ends?

630
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,400
You're much colder than I thought.

631
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,960
So it seems.

632
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,960
I'll hand in my resignation today.
Just keep Miriam out of it.

633
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,160
No, you're not resigning.

634
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,560
You step down,
I'll have someone else to deal with.

635
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,720
And chances are he'll be
Falcone's lapdog, same as you.

636
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
With you,

637
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
I have leverage.

638
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,800
So, what do you want?

639
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,080
Flass is tried.

640
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,480
Fairly.

641
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,840
And I want all evidence you have
on Bullock

642
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,720
and every other cop in the G.C.P.D.
sent to Harvey Dent.

643
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,920
- He'll decide who to prosecute.
- No.

644
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
I do that, I'm a dead man.

645
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,000
I love Miriam, but I love living too.

646
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,360
You can have Bullock's file,

647
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,560
but not the rest.

648
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Fine.

649
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,560
And Miriam stays where she is.

650
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,920
Is that all?

651
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
There's one more thing.

652
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,400
It's become something
of a habit to stand up here

653
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,120
with Detective Gordon.

654
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,160
But with the coming election
for president

655
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,320
of the Policemen's Union...

656
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,360
There's no man I'd rather support.

657
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,600
Thank you, Commissioner Loeb.

658
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,720
It's a new day in the G.C.P.D.

659
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,120
Sorry I missed your big moment.

660
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,560
I figured I'd catch the next one.

661
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Your file.

662
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,400
It's everything Loeb has on you.

663
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,080
Always hated that picture.

664
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,640
You know you tell yourself.

665
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,160
"I'll just do this one bad thing...

666
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,200
But all the good things
I'll do later will make up for it."

667
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
But they don't.

668
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,160
There's still that bad thing.

669
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,080
Penguin's gonna come asking
for that favor.

670
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Be careful.

671
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,920
I know we had a deal.

672
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,400
I let you go and you escape
the inevitable punishment

673
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,600
that will descend on your heads

674
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,720
when Commissioner Loeb hears
of your failure.

675
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,440
Unfortunately, I was only able
to acquire one ticket to Arizona.

676
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,160
So, who's it gonna be?

677
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,600
Marge and I have been together
for 20 years.

678
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
We're not splitting up.

679
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,520
Life can be cruel sometimes.

680
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,200
How do we decide who goes?

681
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
I leave that in your hands.

682
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Wait a minute.

683
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,720
Margie. Margie.

684
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,720
My... Here...

685
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Here we...

686
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,080
Here we... Here we go.

687
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,480
What time is the train?

688
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,960
There's no train.

689
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,320
- I just needed your help.
- What?

690
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,680
I was down to one shell.

691
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,880
I've been thinking
of introducing salsa night.

692
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
You think our guests would like that?

693
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,280
No.

694
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,480
Honest. Good.

695
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,320
But I like salsa.

696
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,560
Tuesday it is.

697
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,000
So...

698
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,560
You've completed your task

699
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,360
and the lines of supply
are open once again.

700
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,720
I am duly impressed.

701
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,080
Hope is a carrot,

702
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,680
easily dangled in front
of the desperate, doctor.

703
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,440
And you have earned your carrot.

704
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,600
Welcome to upper management.

705
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,880
I think you'll find the view better
than in the basement.

706
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,840
In fact...

707
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,560
You see why I can trust you?

708
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,720
Why I'm not worried about
you betraying me and escaping?

709
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,200
Yes, I see.
