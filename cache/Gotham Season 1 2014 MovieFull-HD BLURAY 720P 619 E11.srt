167

Yes.

So who are we looking for?

What does it take to pull this off?

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,211
Uh, some basic knowledge
of human anatomy.

172
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,806
Um, basic electrical skills.

173
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,570
Circuit boards and wiring.

174
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,841
Is that all?

175
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,610
And the door keys, of course.

176
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,451
The door keys. Right.

177
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,921
No, man, I got my keys right here.

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,048
Look at me, Steven.

179
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,044
Look at me.

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,565
Tell me the truth.

181
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,122
Why you picking on me? There's five
other guards with keys to this wing.

182
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,245
True, and you're the only one who looks
and smells like a hunted animal.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,924
Look, Steven,
whoever fried Frogman had keys.

184
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,925
Now, we've searched
all of the inmates' cells. No keys.

185
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,323
But I know they're out there
and I need to know where.

186
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,763
I'm backed up against a wall.
And I'm starting to lose my patience.

Do you understand?

188
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,926
That fight...

189
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,486
...during the play...

190
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,847
...right after I noticed my keys were gone.

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,083
You lose equipment, that's a big deal.
They'd dock me a week's pay.

192
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,720
- So I tracked down a spare set.
- Who took the keys?

193
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,167
I don't know.
Anyone could have taken them.

194
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,845
Walk away.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,365
- Sorry--
- Walk away!

196

And then he raises our taxes,
after his money blows up.

197
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,371

I'll say it.

198

...I wish something would happen to old man
Falcone before he comes after one of us.

199
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,367
- That's where this is going.
- Slow down.

200
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,082
Now, let's imagine-- God forbid anything
happened to Falcone. --just for kicks.

201
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,686
Who would take over then?

202
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,888
Who'd take over? I do.

That's the way the system works.

That's how the system used to work,
back in the day.

some fresh thinking at the top.

You didn't like him very much, did you?

I had no opinion of him.

228
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,848
He was called the Frogman
because he believed a giant bullfrog...

229

...lived inside his abdomen,
controlling his thoughts.

You're not authorized to conduct
an investigation of the staff.

325
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,810
Whoa!

326
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,769
You're trying to force my hand.

327
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,924
- You want me to call the police.
- No.

328
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,601
I already called them.

329
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,482
Barbara, you need to wake up.

330
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,290
Good morning.

331
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,010
I got you coffee.

332
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,890
Extra sweet.

333
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,531
You always remember.

334
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,326
Yeah.

335
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,445
Have you spoken to Jim recently?

336
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,926
Why would I?

337
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,731
Renee, you don't have to be jealous
of Jim.

338
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,845
I'm over him.

339
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,485
This was a mistake.

340
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,841
What was?

341
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,404
This. Us.

342
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,006
I should have never let it
go on for this long.

343
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,611
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,044
Oh, I see.

345
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,321
Barbara.

346
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,201
No, I mean--
No, you are absolutely right.

347
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,521
This was a mistake.

348
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,001
This has been a really
long process for me...

349
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,322
...and I've worked too hard
to get right with myself.

350
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,371
I wanted this to be good
but I can't fall back now.

351
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,443
The drinking, the drugs.

352
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,324
We are toxic together, you and me.

353
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,211
Please, Renee, stop.
There's no need to say another word.

354
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm sorry that I interfered
with your process.

355
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,561
You need help I can't give you right now.
Let me call Jim for you, please.

356
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,370
No.
Where's my purse?

357
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,525
You don't need to go. Stay here,
take time to get yourself together. I'll go.

358
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,762
I am perfectly together, thank you.

359
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,570
I am just toxic, that's all.

360
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,166
- Now where is my damn purse?
- Barbara, stop!

361
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,731
Calm down, please, all right?

362
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,688
I'll go. Please.

363
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,169
Fine.

364
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,370
Do what you want, go.

365
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,328
- I'm sorry.
- Just go.

366
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,005
Hey, pal.

367
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,921
In a cowslip's bell I lie.

368
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,249
There I crouch when owls do cry.

369
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,687
All right. I can dig that.

370
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,520
- Detective.
- Jim! Ha, ha! Partner!

371
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,883
Let me take a good look at you.
Lord have mercy, you're screwed.

372
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,451
- Excuse me!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,610
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.
Freaky as advertised.

374
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,366
Nobody of authority called on you, sir.

375
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,971
This is not a police matter.

376
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,249
You must be Director Dr. Lang.
See, I beg to differ.

377
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,002
This is third degree assault,
at the very least.

378
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,843
A friend of yours, is it?

379
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,521
Egregious insubordination.

380
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,922
Your job here was already
hanging on a thread.

381
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,441
This is the end of your career
in law enforcement, count on it.

382
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,570
Whoa, take it easy, hot shot.
Officer Gordon did the right thing.

383
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,767
Why wouldn't he call the police?

384
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,089
Anyone would think
you want to keep this business quiet.

385
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,010
Gerry-- It is Gerry, isn't it?

386
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,640
Now, did you do this terrible thing, Gerry?

387
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,807
That doesn't even merit a reply.

388
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,444
No, I did not do this terrible thing.

389
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,530
But you have the skill though, as a doctor.
You could do it lickity split.

390
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,887
- Now, why would I do this?
- Why would anyone?

391
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,610
Exactly, Officer Gordon.

392
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,888
Gerry, I think we'll have to
take you down to the precinct.

393
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,726
You're raising a lot of questions that need
clearing up in a more formal setting.

394
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,530
- But you can't do this.
- Shh, shh, shh.

395
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,048
As of this moment this is
an official GCPD investigation.

396
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,766
You, sir, will cooperate or face arrest.

397
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,208
Officer Gordon, would you mind
going through the, uh, staff records...

398
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,601
...while I take Gerry here
downtown for a chat?

399
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,807
Will do, detective.

400
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,407
Sir.

401
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,641
Jimmy.

402

Butch.

403
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,167
Good to see you.

404
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,606
Come on.

405
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,324
Like Old times, huh?

Ha, ha.

407
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,250
What happened, man?

408
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,686
In my head, we're still kids
chasing girls in Harlow Park.

409
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,410
Caught a couple of hot ones, huh?

410
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,005
Especially me. Ha, ha.

411
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,328
Thanks for meeting with me.

412
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,329
What did you tell your boss lady?

413
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,486
I suggested I reach out to you,
she agreed.

414
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,688
Talk some sense into me?

415
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,087
It's a "new dawn."
What the--?

416
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,044
Yeah, like that.

417
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,891
She's not wrong, you know.

418
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,205
City's changing.

419
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,925
You really want Falcone's job?

420
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,360
Since we were kids
I love you like a brother.

421
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,921
I love you too, always, you know that.

422
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,923
I do. I do.

423
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,605
That's why I trust you...

428
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,281
I mean, Butch, without you
and your crew, what's she got?

429
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,771
Very little.

430
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,327
Everybody knows it, you know it.

431
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,249
Maybe.

432
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,081
What's it gonna take
to make you make a move?

433
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,688
- What are you offering?
- Name it.

434
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,202
Drop Fish, come over to us.

That's day one. A welcome bonus.

What else do you want?

439
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,800
That's a good question.

440
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,881
Let me think it over.

441
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,451
Yeah.

442
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,248
Hey, brother.

443
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,568
Don't think too long, huh?

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,440
Detective Bullock!

445
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,491
Wait here.

Ha, ha. Penguin...

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,407
- What are you guys doing?
- Old friend.

449
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,291
Thank goodness you're here.

450
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,209
There's been some silly mistake.

451
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,971
Looks like it. Unless you irritated
someone important.

452
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,485
You didn't do that, did you?

453
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,721
Me?

454
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,041
Of course not.

455
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,844
Are you sure?

456
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,043
Examine your soul, Penguin.

457
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,281
Wait!

458
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,890
Don't go.
Please, sir, I beg of you.

My patron, Don Maroni, is obviously
unaware of my predicament.

A simple phone call would resolve things,
I'm sure.

00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,888
But see, I like having you here.

462
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,521
I can sit at my desk and look at you.

463
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,285
It's soothing...

464
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,130
...like a bonsai tree.

465
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,489

So...

468
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,283
...did you see our friend?

469
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,847
I saw him.

470
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,331
And?

471
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,251
Enh. I'm working him.

472
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,050
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

473
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,683
So give him a little time.

474
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,849
Time, hmm?

475
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,770
Okay.

476
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,924
He can have time.

477
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,329
I'm optimistic.

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,329
Good.

They were hidden by her hair.

This is crazy.
How could she do this to herself?

649
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,282
She couldn't. Not humanly possible.

650
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,488
Which means
she was just another victim.

651
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,563
- She couldn't...
- Oh, crap.

652
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,121
Hey, Aaron.

653
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,525
What's up?

Well done, Aaron.

Remember when we were 14?
We stole all that meat from Satriani's?

694

Yeah, I do.
It was like 50 pounds of pork and whatnot.

Never seen my mom so happy.

Thing is, when I was sharing it out...

698
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,331
...it was 15 pounds
of prime angus beefsteaks in there.

699
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,965
I kept it all for myself.

700
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,405
Didn't give you any.

701
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,444
Gave you all the cheap cuts.

702
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,405
I never knew that.

703
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,883
Yeah, it's been bugging me ever since.

Hey, we're talking a long time ago.

I wanna say I'm sorry.

I apologize
for cheating you out of your beefsteak.

707

- Forget about it.
- No.

No. Brothers don't do that.

709
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,726
Why did I do that?

710
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,083
Hey, forget about it. It's okay.

711
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,924
Apology accepted.
