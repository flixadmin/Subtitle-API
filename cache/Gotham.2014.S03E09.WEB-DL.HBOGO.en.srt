1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,800
<i>- Previously on</i>Gotham...
- Watch out!

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,320
- Ivy's missing.
- She'll turn up somewhere.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,520
It was a long way down into water.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,240
- What's your name?
- My name's Ivy.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,560
- Who the hell are you?
- Not yet.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
This is too fun.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,320
He loves me and I love him.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,200
I am telling you one last time,
let Ed go.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,880
- No.
- Very well.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Oh, no.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Somebody help!

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,720
I want to rejoin the G.C.P.D.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,840
Welcome back, Detective.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,760
Captain, I'm so glad you came.

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,000
I came to congratulate you.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,560
If a person comes into contact
with my blood, it changes them.

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,320
You and I are gonna
make a difference in this city.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
We're gonna clean it up.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,400
Sentence served.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Symon.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who did this?

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Barnes.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,240
So, seems anyone could have
gotten access to that bathroom

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,480
not just the guests.

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,600
Suspect pool's wide open.

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,720
All right, start with statements
from everyone at the party.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,320
Someone saw Symon go
into that bathroom.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Okay.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,440
I still can't believe it.

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm sorry things went down this way.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
Don't apologize, you were right.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,200
Did you give your statement already?

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm afraid I wasn't very helpful.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,960
Till about an hour ago,
I couldn't pick Symon out of a crowd.

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,520
Did you talk to Barnes at the party?

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,000
Little. We had a drink.

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
Symon died around 10.30.

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,840
The attack happened just before.
What time did you talk with Barnes?

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
9.00.

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
What is this about?

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,480
- Nothing.
- Nothing, really?

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
I can't talk about it.

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,520
- No.
- Lee, I cannot talk about it.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,880
Jim, I hope you know
what you're doing.

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Me, too.

46
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Barnes? No. No, no, no, no, no.

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,600
I asked Symon who attacked him.
And he said Barnes.

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
Symon was a psychopath

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,120
who gave face transplants
to the mob using stolen faces.

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
Hardly a credible witness.
And this guy, Barnes?

51
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,880
If he so much as jaywalked,
he would write himself a ticket.

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
- I know.
- And now you're saying

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,680
he went to Lee Thompkins'
engagement party, and out of nowhere,

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,280
busted some guy's face
and chucked him through a wall?

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
I know, Harvey.

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,840
- What's the motive?
- I don't know.

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,040
Maybe he... he saw Symon.

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,200
He got pissed he was released,
and he lost control.

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
- Okay.
- So, you're saying

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,560
that a man with a spotless
20-year career just went ape.

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,680
Is... is that your theory?

62
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,600
You know, something's been off
about him, recently.

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
You yourself said he nearly beat
Tetch to death.

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,360
And what's with him insisting
on running point

65
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
- in the Paulie Pennies' case?
- Look, I don't know

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,520
but that does not make him a killer.

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,280
- So where is he now?
- Home!

68
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,360
He spent the better part of yesterday
chasing down Symon, maybe he's tired.

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,760
That doesn't mean he's guilty.

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,920
The last thing I want
is for Barnes to be guilty.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I look up to the man.

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
But if there is even a chance,
then we have to know.

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
And something doesn't feel right.

74
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Okay. Okay.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm gonna help you.

76
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,200
But, just so you know, I'm doing it
to prove he's innocent, not guilty.

77
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,400
That's fine. All right?
So, I'll go back to the scene.

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,880
See if forensics can pull some prints
from the bathroom.

79
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,640
Barnes' should already be on file.

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,760
Jim, I know how to do my job.

81
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
I hope I'm wrong.

82
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,720
Yeah. Me, too.

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,360
It starts as a whisper.

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,040
You have to strain to hear it.

85
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,680
And then it grows louder.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
And louder.

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Until it becomes a roar.

88
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,040
It's everything you can do
to just shut it out.

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
And then, just like that...

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,720
You suddenly realize it's your voice.

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
The one you've been denying.

92
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,640
Telling you who you are.

93
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,600
What you have to do.

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,040
And then you stop fighting...

95
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,600
...and this calm comes over you.

96
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,160
Sex trafficking.

97
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Drugs.

98
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Murder.

99
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,640
I've kept files on all three of you,
for years.

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,760
Waiting for the proof we needed
while you sneered at the law.

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Not tonight.

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,200
Tonight, I am the law!

103
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,240
And you are hereby tried...

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
Found guilty!

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,600
And sentenced!

106
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,800
Justice is served.

107
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,920
{\an5}So what's an antiquities dealer?

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,160
{\an5}I buy and sell rare
and beautiful objects.

109
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,600
{\an5}I like to think I have an eye
for beauty.

110
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,080
{\an5}- Is this a bug?
- An Egyptian scarab.

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,840
{\an5}More than 3,000 years old.
It's priceless.

112
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Everything has a price.

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,040
{\an5}- What's upstairs?
- The bedroom.

114
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
{\an5}And the vault.

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
{\an5}Vault?

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,800
{\an5}It's where I keep my most valuable
acquisitions.

117
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Can I see?

118
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,480
{\an5}Ivy, you are very beautiful.

119
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,960
{\an5}But we've only just met.

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,040
{\an5}We haven't had time
to get to know each other.

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,560
{\an5}Who are you? Where do you come from?

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
{\an5}What do you do?

123
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,240
{\an5}Well, I'm from Gotham.

124
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
{\an5}And I meet men,

125
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
{\an5}like you.

126
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
{\an5}They give me things.

127
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,760
{\an5}And what do you give them?

128
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
{\an5}Nothing.

129
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,480
{\an5}I also like plants.

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,480
I've always been able to get them
to grow for me.

131
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,600
{\an5}Lately, I've been using them
to make perfume.

132
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,880
{\an5}Plants are so much more powerful
than people imagine.

133
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,240
{\an5}They can poison you, heal you,
make you fall in love.

134
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,920
{\an5}I made this from a strain
of cananga odorata.

135
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Smell.

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,120
Now, open the vault.

137
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>Access granted.</i>

138
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,280
Did they send you?
You lying schlampe!

139
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Did they?

140
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Come back here!

141
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,760
You hear me? I'll find you!

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
You've been checking
your watch all morning.

144
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,760
- You expecting...
- A call from Isabella.

145
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,720
She's at her librarian conference.

146
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,920
Probably just busy.

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Most likely.

148
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,480
I can imagine librarian conferences
can be hectic affairs.

149
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,800
Not so much.

150
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,040
Well, I'm sure she'll call soon.

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Hello.

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
This is Edward Nygma.

153
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Why?

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Very well.

155
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
It was the G.C.P.D.

156
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,280
They wanna see me.
Wouldn't say why.

157
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Oh?

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
You don't think
that something happened?

159
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
No!

160
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,720
The officer said Isabella
blew through a red light

161
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,880
and crashed into a train.

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,400
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,240
Yours was the last number
in her phone.

164
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,760
I am so, so sorry, Ed.

165
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,480
Did she suffer?

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No.

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Anything you need, Ed,

168
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,000
anything at all, I am here for you.

169
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Breakfast!

170
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
Still collecting strays?

171
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Lady...

172
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,920
...you got two seconds
to get out of here

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
before I gut you like a fish.

174
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,520
You really don't recognize me?

175
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,240
Selina, it's me. Ivy?

176
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Hey, you got anything
to eat around here?

177
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
I'm starving.

178
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,400
- Yeah.
<i>- Jim, I'm outside the scene.</i>

179
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,520
Forensics found tons of prints
inside the bathroom

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,840
where Symon was attacked.

181
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,960
- Barnes?
<i>- That just means he was in there.</i>

182
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,080
It puts him at the scene.

183
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,640
Listen, I've been thinking. You got
to tell Barnes what Symon said.

184
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,400
<i>Give him the right to defend himself.</i>

185
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
I will.

186
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
When I'm ready.

187
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Help you?

188
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Captain.

189
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,760
I was, looking
for the Paulie Pennies file.

190
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,120
Thinking the cases might be related.

191
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Thanks.

192
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Fill me in.

193
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Nothing hard yet,
but we'll get there.

194
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,960
I was reading through
some of the witness statements.

195
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,160
The couple from the alley

196
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,280
they say when they found Symon,
he was still alive.

197
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,200
You were first on the scene.

198
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,640
- Did he say anything to you?
- No.

199
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,800
He didn't ID the killer?

200
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
No.

201
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,800
'Cause one of the witnesses seems to
think that you were talking to him.

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,640
He tried, sure.

203
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,600
But he couldn't speak.
He died almost right away.

204
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,800
Well, for what it's worth,
I called an old C.I. of mine

205
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,520
with deep ties to the mob.

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,840
He says that once I collared Symon,
the higher-ups got jumpy.

207
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,080
You're saying the mob had him killed?

208
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,200
He was giving these guys new faces.

209
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,160
He's probably the only one
who can ID them.

210
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,880
That's a lot to protect. Makes sense.

211
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,800
My C.I. also had a name.
Mid-level enforcer

212
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,760
goes by "Sugar,"
works out of the East End.

213
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,400
- Says he actually did the killing.
- I'll have a team pick him up.

214
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,320
I'd rather you kept this between us.

215
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,080
Mob still has their fingers
in most of these guys' pockets.

216
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,200
You never know who you can trust.

217
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
So, you ready to ride
with the old man?

218
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,000
Sure. Just let me run it by
my, partner.

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Why bother him?

220
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
We'll be there and back
before you know it.

221
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
So where are we headed?

222
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,000
Sugar works out of an old
foundry at 133rd and 6th.

223
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,240
Oh, that reminds me.

224
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,960
<i>It's Harvey. Leave a message.</i>

225
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm with Barnes,
heading to 133rd and 6th.

226
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Get there.

227
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,200
You never know what's gonna go down.

228
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I have to say, Jim...

229
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
...I'm disappointed with you.

230
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Oh, yeah? How's that?

231
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,240
Lead detective
for a high-profile murder,

232
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
and you don't collect statements
from everyone present?

233
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Me.

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,280
Well, let's do it now.

235
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
And for the record,
I waive my right to counsel.

236
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,560
- Captain...
- Ask your questions, Gordon.

237
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,360
Did you see Symon at the party?

238
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Yes.

239
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,080
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I did not.

240
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,120
Did you see him go into
the bathroom before he was attacked?

241
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,680
Unfortunately, no.

242
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,120
- Were you ever in it?
- Yes.

243
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,000
Before it was a crime scene,
obviously.

244
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,440
- So, Detective, am I in the clear?
- For now.

245
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,960
This city's a cesspool.

246
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,720
Don't you ever want
to do something about it?

247
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
I thought I was.

248
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,720
What, as a cop?

249
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,000
I would think that you,
of all people

250
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,880
would find that limiting.

251
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Not anymore.

252
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,440
Came back to the G.C.P.D.
to do things right.

253
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Like you.

254
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,720
Like me?

255
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Last year, at Galavan's,
when we were attacked,

256
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,640
you told me the law shows
you where the line is.

257
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
That stuck with me.

258
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,200
Some would say that our job,
first and foremost,

259
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,480
is to protect the citizens
of this city

260
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,520
even if it means bending the laws.

261
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,400
No. We break the law,
we're no better than the criminals.

262
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,920
Is that what you were thinking
the night that Galavan was killed?

263
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
The first time.

264
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,520
This city's at a crossroads, Gordon.

265
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Question is...

266
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,920
Will good men fight for it?

267
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,200
Will they do what's necessary?

268
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,680
The decision is yours to make.

269
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,920
You passed our stop. 133rd and 6th?

270
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,920
Did I say that? 136th and 3rd.

271
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
It's an honest mistake.

272
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
I don't believe it.

273
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,680
Well, I should have known.

274
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,560
I saw what that freak Marv could do.

275
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,400
How he could age people,

276
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,360
and when he told me that the girl
wearing her sweater was older, I...

277
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,280
...I should have realized.

278
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
- That's really Ivy.
- Trust me.

279
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,760
She came, and literally ate
all my food.

280
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,600
Immediately ate all my food.
It's her.

281
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,800
So why is she back here?

282
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Good question.

283
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,720
What was that for?

284
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,640
For being alive and not telling me!

285
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,240
I was just having fun.

287
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Why did you come back?

288
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,440
I don't have to answer
your questions.

289
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,560
- Why'd you call him anyway?
- 'Cause you freaked me out!

290
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,440
Where have you been,
and why are you dressed like that?

291
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,040
Oh, it's so crazy.

292
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,400
Selina. When you look like this,

293
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,920
guys just come up to you
and give you stuff.

294
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,120
Half the time,
you don't even have to steal it.

295
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,400
And what do you give them?

296
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,600
I have ways of getting what I want.

297
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,600
- I'll bet.
- You do look nice.

298
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,040
So why did you come back?

299
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,920
And don't say
it's 'cause you missed me.

300
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
It's true.

301
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,800
You may be 10 feet tall,
but you're still a crappy liar, Ivy.

302
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,640
What's going on?

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,840
Well, I might be in trouble.

304
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,040
- I knew it.
- There was this guy...

305
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
What was his name?

306
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,640
Like I learn their names.

307
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,040
So I was at his place last night.

308
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,200
Total creep.
Anyway, I stole a necklace.

309
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,960
I was surprised he noticed
'cause he had so much crap.

310
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,440
But he caught me,
and he totally freaked out.

311
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,680
If only Marv's power
had made you smart, too.

312
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,600
- You steal all the time.
- Yeah, well, I don't get caught.

313
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,040
- Rude.
- No. Be, be quiet.

314
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
I hear something.

315
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,400
We have to go. Someone's here.

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Ivy, in.

317
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Bruce! Seriously?

318
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
So who is this guy again?

319
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,960
Just follow my lead.

320
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,800
G.C.P.D.!

321
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
- Don't move!
- Hey.

322
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,840
- Hiya, Sugar.
- What the hell is this?

323
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,560
We're here about the gas bill.

324
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,680
- You're delinquent.
- Huh?

325
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,080
Where were you last night,
say about 10.00pm?

326
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,280
- At your mama's, like always.
- Answer the question.

327
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,000
I was at the fights.
A dozen people saw me.

328
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,160
A dozen of your lying,
bottom-feeding friends?

329
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,040
The name Symon mean anything to you?

330
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,560
- No.
- No?

331
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,560
Plastic surgeon?
Face man for your mob buddies?

332
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Wait.

333
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,880
No. Like I said,

334
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,360
so whatever the hell you think I did,
I didn't.

335
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,680
I was at the fights!

336
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,080
People saw me!

337
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,600
- I'm innocent, man!
- You know what?

338
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,080
I think he's telling the truth.

339
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,920
He didn't kill anyone.

340
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,920
But you're not innocent.

341
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
I think we lost them.

342
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,640
Is that who you stole
the necklace from?

343
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
No. I-I don't think so.

344
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Then who were they?

345
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't know.
Maybe they work for him.

346
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,560
Oh, great, Ivy!

347
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,880
Now my squat is burned,

348
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,120
and masked weirdoes
are trying to kill us.

349
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
So glad you came back.

350
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
You have to return it.

351
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,560
What? No way.

352
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,960
Ivy, he's right. That dumb necklace
almost got us killed.

353
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,960
It's mine. I worked for it.

354
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,120
And it's super valuable.

355
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,480
- How much?
- Wait. Bruce, don't.

356
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,360
If I buy it, you get paid,

357
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,560
but we can still return it, and those
men will have no reason to harm us.

358
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
How much?

359
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,960
- One thousand dollars.
- Fine.

360
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,200
Idiot.

361
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,560
- Two thousand.
- Fine.

362
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,880
Five... No. Ten!

363
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,160
Well, how much should I ask for?

364
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
I'll get you 5,000 in cash today.

365
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Or you can try to avoid
those men on your own.

366
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
That's my offer.

367
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
Now, where does this man live?

368
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,400
Now, just raise your chin
a mite higher.

369
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,360
Would you excuse me for a moment?

370
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Ed.

371
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yes.

372
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,720
The music!

373
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,480
It's too loud. I'm sorry!

374
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,760
Isabella always loved Vivaldi.

375
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,680
- So you are just going to sit here.
- Yes.

376
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
- All by yourself.
- Correct.

377
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Okay then.

378
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Apologies.

379
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,160
Ed, I, as much as anyone,

380
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,560
know how hard it is to lose someone.

381
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,920
Even if you've only known them
for, like, a week.

382
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,880
But this is not healthy behavior.

383
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
It is depressing

384
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,480
and if I'm being honest, a bit scary.

385
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,040
Less scary. Check.

386
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
No, you're not...

387
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,280
Ed, you need to heal.

388
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
And healing is about moving on.

389
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
No doubt you're right.

390
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Of course I'm right.

391
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,760
I'll go to where she was taken
from me and say good-bye.

392
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,920
Isabelle would want you to be happy.

393
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Isabella.

394
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Of course.

395
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
That's good.

396
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
That's far enough.

397
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,960
I know what you're thinking, Jim.

398
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,200
You're thinking,

399
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,880
"Why would Captain Nathaniel Barnes,
Mr. By-the-book, blow a hole

400
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,800
in this unarmed scumbag?

401
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,840
Could it be that he actually
killed Symon, too?"

402
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,520
You see, I know that you've
been investigating me, Jim.

403
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,880
Did you kill Symon?

404
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,920
Is that what he told you? I know he
said something to you before he died.

405
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Yes, he did.

406
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,440
Probably the truest words
that bastard ever uttered.

407
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,760
And Paulie Pennies?

408
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,520
He chopped up bodies for murderers.

409
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,920
You gonna tell me
he didn't deserve it?

410
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,680
That's for the law to decide.

411
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,080
Open your eyes, Jim.

412
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,800
I am the law.

413
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,960
What happened to you?

414
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
How did you become this?

415
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
This...

416
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,800
...is who I've always been.

417
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,720
I just needed something to unlock it.

418
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,800
What are you talking about?

419
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,480
You're just gonna say that I'm sick.

420
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,200
Well, I'm not.

421
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,360
I have never been so clear,
so strong in my life.

422
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,760
Alice Tetch's virus.

423
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,400
The files on your desk.
You're infected.

424
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,600
Oh, you are a detective after all.

425
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Don't you see?

426
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,400
This means you're innocent.

427
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,920
We, we can get you help.

428
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,080
Can we just skip the part where
you try to get me to give myself up?

429
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,520
- This isn't you. This is the virus.
- No!

430
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm not insane.

431
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,640
And you are not seeing
the big picture.

432
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,160
You're gonna frame me
for Sugar's murder.

433
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
That's up to you.

434
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,720
I deal in absolutes.

435
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,520
Black and white.

436
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Innocence...

437
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,360
...and guilt.

438
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,760
Gotham, the people of this city,
need men like me,

439
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,960
men who can see what needs to be done
and have the courage to do it.

440
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,120
You have it within you...

441
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,920
...to be one of those men.

442
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,760
You want me to join you?

443
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,240
- Be a part of this?
- Oh, don't be so high and mighty.

444
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,520
You shot Galavan in cold blood.

445
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,440
And every day I wish I hadn't!

446
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,280
Thought I didn't have a choice,
but I did.

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,080
I lost my freedom.

448
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
I lost Lee.

449
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,680
I'd give anything
to take it all back.

450
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,600
I didn't say it was easy, Jim.

451
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,120
I said it was right.

452
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,040
Day after day, criminals
thumbing their nose at the law.

453
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,480
Well, today, I draw a line
in the sand.

454
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,560
Only question is...

455
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,600
...where do you stand?

456
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Against you.

457
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,160
Well, I'm disappointed.

458
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,400
- Good-bye, Jim.
- Hey, Sugar! I got a...

459
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
No!

460
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,440
The time I knew
you feels like a dream.

461
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And now I'm awake.

462
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
I wish I'd gone on sleeping.

463
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,560
I will never forget you, my love.

464
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,160
Good-bye, Isabella.

465
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
We are four blocks
from her apartment.

466
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,400
Spare some change, sir?

467
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
I'm sorry...

468
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,360
...you weren't, per chance,
in this area at 11.00pm last night?

469
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
Uh-huh.

470
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,160
So... You saw the accident?

471
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,520
Haven't seen nothin' for 20 years.

472
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,840
But I heard it.

473
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Girl screaming, "Help! Help!"

474
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
- Then bang!
- I'm sorry...

475
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,600
...she was screaming
before the crash?

476
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,160
Well, she were dead after.

477
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,120
But you, you definitely
heard screaming?

478
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,080
Yep. Blood-curdling.

479
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,000
How odd.

480
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,720
I'll give him the necklace
and explain

481
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,000
there's no need for further violence.

482
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,800
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

483
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,320
I kind of hit him over the head
with a vase.

484
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
'Course you did.

485
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Door's open.

486
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,000
I did not do that.

487
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,160
We really got to go.

488
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,680
- Bruce.
- It was the men that came after us.

489
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,600
He was killed by the same weapon.

490
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,840
I thought they worked for him.

491
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,080
Oh, looks like
you were wrong again, Ivy.

492
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Can we leave now?

493
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Why is this necklace so important?

494
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,440
What'd make someone kill for it?

495
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,800
Who cares?

496
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,280
Are you crazy?
That's worth 5,000 dollars.

497
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
What is it?

498
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
A key.

499
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,120
We should really go, Bruce.

500
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,040
Oh, my God.

501
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,360
You two are a couple now?

502
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
- No.
- Yes.

503
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
We're not?

504
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,840
I'm not talking about this right now.

505
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,960
We need to go somewhere right now.

506
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
And my place is toast,
thanks to this dimwit.

507
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,120
We'll go to my house.

508
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,840
You just had to come back.

509
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,640
Alvarez, hey, what is all this?

510
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,840
Barnes called in.

511
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,960
Gordon went loco.

512
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,680
Shot an unarmed suspect,
then tried taking out Barnes, too.

513
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
No, no, no, no. This is not right.

514
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,240
Harvey, if I was you,

515
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,720
I'd find your partner,
have him come in quiet.

516
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,360
Otherwise, he's going down.

517
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,240
Jim? Hey.

518
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,280
Where the hell are you?
Half the precinct's looking for you.

519
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,520
Barnes killed Symon
and Paulie Pennies.

520
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,520
And he just murdered someone
right in front of me!

521
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,240
What? I was gone for, like, an hour.

522
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
<i>He's infected
with Alice Tetch's blood.</i>

523
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,680
<i>He's lost his mind.
He's trying to kill me.</i>

524
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,480
Oh, sweet gentle virgin.

525
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
I need your help, Harvey.

526
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,560
<i>- Okay, where are you?</i>
- The old foundry.

527
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,320
<i>Jim? Jim?</i>

528
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
<i>Jim...</i>

529
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,680
Harvey, what's going on?

530
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,240
- They said Jim killed someone?
- It's a lie. It's Barnes.

531
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,840
It's Barnes. He's infected
with the Alice Tetch virus.

532
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,520
Oh, my God.

533
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,640
He was there when she died.

534
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,400
Yeah, and I figure we got,
like, 10 minutes

535
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,560
before those trigger-happy
kill-bots find Jim and take him out.

536
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,680
Harvey, you have to tell them.

537
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Come on, they're not gonna
believe me.

538
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,760
But they will believe
the medical examiner.

539
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,160
- What are you asking me to do?
- I need you to trust Jim.

540
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,720
Because right now,
you and I are all he has.

541
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Stop!

542
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Sorry, Jim.

543
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,880
End of the line.

544
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
Just as I suspected.

545
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,600
The brake lines are cut!

546
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
How is it...

547
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,640
...that not one single ignoramus
from the G.C.P.D.

548
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,040
noticed that the brake lines
were cut?

549
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
I don't know.

550
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,240
Someone paid 'em off.

551
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
The question is, who?

552
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,120
Who has that kind of money
and influence?

553
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
You don't know.

554
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
But I do.

555
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,640
End of the line.

556
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
No more running.

557
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,280
Just in time.

558
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,960
In a few moments,
your brothers in arms

559
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,760
are gonna come up those stairs
and find your dead body,

560
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,240
and they'll believe me
when I tell them

561
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,400
that Jim Gordon is a killer.

562
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
It's a shame, really.

563
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,240
Could've made a great team.

564
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,720
Doesn't have to be this way.

565
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,760
You need help.

566
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,240
Are those really gonna be
your last words?

567
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,840
Nothing to say to Lee?

568
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Go to hell.

569
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,960
<i>Captain Barnes!</i>

570
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,400
<i>This is Detective Bullock.</i>

571
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,120
<i>You're under arrest.</i>

572
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,960
Throw down your weapons
and come out with your hands up.

573
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,960
We know you killed Symon.

574
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,920
We know you killed Paulie Pennies.

575
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
We know you killed the suspects
in the East End.

576
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,920
You're infected with the Tetch virus.

577
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,760
The M.E. has proof.

578
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,000
Now, we don't want any bloodshed,
Cap. It's up to you.

579
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
No.

580
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,080
Thompkins and Bullock.

581
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,840
They lied for you.

582
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,720
They turned the whole
damn G.C.P.D. against me!

583
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,120
We're going in. Come on! Move!

584
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Don't.

585
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,360
You're under arrest.

586
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Drop it.

587
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
No.

588
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,880
Don't make me do this.

589
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm not making you do anything.

590
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
Stand down, Jim. Let me go.

591
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,080
If the cops want to hunt me, fine.

592
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,960
But you, let me go.

593
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
I won't do that.

594
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,960
You would condemn this city
when I would save it.

595
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,320
You've got it all wrong.

596
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,680
You're just the same as I am.

597
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,320
- I just have the guts to admit it.
- No.

598
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,600
And I'll decide who I am.

599
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,840
Stand down.

600
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
No.

601
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,040
Then it is you that is guilty.

602
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Jim, you okay?

603
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,880
Yeah. I'm okay.

604
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,200
Holy cow.

605
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,280
- Don't get any ideas.
- Okay, Mom.

606
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,920
Tomorrow we'll look into
what this all means.

607
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,800
Who those men in masks were.

608
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,520
For now, I'll have Alfred
make up beds for you both.

609
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,760
There's food in the kitchen
if you're hungry.

610
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,520
- I could eat.
- Surprise.

611
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,320
I hope I didn't mess things up
with your boyfriend.

612
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,840
I told you, he's not my boyfriend.

613
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,400
What happened? Are you okay?

614
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah.

615
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm fine.

616
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,680
- And Barnes?
- He's alive.

617
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,280
Bullock told me what you did.

618
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,720
- It was nothing.
- No.

619
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
You could've done nothing.

620
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
You didn't.

621
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,240
I suppose I did fabricate
a blood test stating that my superior

622
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,200
had a psychosis-inducing virus.

623
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
And I'm glad I did.

624
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Me, too.

625
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,040
I suppose I better get going.

626
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Lee?

627
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Thank you.

628
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Oswald!

629
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,360
Oswald. I need to speak with you.

630
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,240
Yes, but I have to show
you something first.

631
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,640
- This is important.
- So is this.

632
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,120
I was not compassionate this morning,
and I regret that.

633
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
What you are going through
is terrible.

634
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
So...

635
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,680
You put me in your painting.

636
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,000
The artist went off a photograph,

637
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,680
but I think it's an excellent
likeness.

638
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,840
Isabella was murdered.

639
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,560
What?

640
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,400
I went to the intersection
where she died.

641
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,560
It is four blocks from her apartment.

642
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,520
Who falls asleep four blocks
from their home? No one.

643
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,880
Also, a very fragrant homeless man

644
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,320
said that he heard her scream
before the crash,

645
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,480
so definitely not asleep.

646
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,720
Now, if she were awake,
why didn't she brake?

647
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Why are there no skid marks?

648
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,080
Ed, you are exhausted,
you are, you are emotional...

649
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,240
Her brake lines were cut!

650
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,040
Which leaves one conclusion.

651
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Murder.

652
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,440
- No.
- Yes.

653
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,920
And I know who did it.

654
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Who?

655
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Butch.

656
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,880
- Butch?
- In retaliation.

657
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,120
For exposing him
as the leader of the Red Hood gang.

658
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,520
That makes perfect sense.

659
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,000
I swear to you, Ed,
we will find him

660
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,760
and make him pay
for what he has done.

661
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Thank you.

662
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,760
I knew I could count on you.

663
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,920
I feel like this office is cursed.

664
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,960
You think Barnes'll be all right?

665
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I don't know.

666
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,480
I'm sorry I doubted you.

667
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
You didn't.

668
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Not when it mattered.

669
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,160
