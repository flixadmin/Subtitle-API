1
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,020
Stark!

2
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,772
He doesn't seem happy.

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,065
Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,485
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,237
I took a detour...

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,448
Through your defense lab.

7
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,618
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,747
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,125
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

10
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,710
You were instructed to go to Russia.

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,796
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

12
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:46,964
I'm a scientist.

13
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,715
Then act like one.

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,301
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

15
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,511
Help us put it to good use.

16
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,055
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,057
and now you try to steal my research?

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,270
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

19
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,985
Easy, Hank.

20
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,114
You mention my wife again

21
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,241
and I'll show you ferocity.

22
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,784
Don't look at me. You said it.

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,329
I formally tender my resignation.

24
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,665
We don't accept it. Formally.

25
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,041
Hank,

26
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,835
we need you.

27
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,296
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,673
Don't let your past determine the future.

29
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,676
As long as I am alive,

30
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:36,138
nobody will ever get that formula.

31
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,938
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

32
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,191
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

33
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,817
Yes.

34
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,862
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

35
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,947
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

36
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,491
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

37
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,286
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

38
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,662
He's no security risk.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,583
Unless we make him one.

40
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,250
You like that? You like that?

41
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,751
Come get you some now.

42
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,430
You didn't even move.

43
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,057
Nah.

44
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,601
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

45
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,520
You see this right here?

46
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,779
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

47
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,656
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

48
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,535
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

49
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,579
All right, break it up.

50
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,789
Break it up! Break it up!

51
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,308
Scotty!

52
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,143
What's up, man!

53
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,686
Damn! Hey.

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,022
Hey, man.

55
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,108
Hey, what's up with your eye?

56
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,403
Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

57
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,322
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

58
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,282
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

59
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,619
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,704
Well, I definitely didn't.

61
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,915
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

62
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,501
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

63
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,835
Hey, how's your girl, man?

64
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,961
She left me.

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,881
Yeah, my ma died, too.

66
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,216
And my dad got deported.

67
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,011
But I got the van!

68
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,471
-It's nice.
-Yeah, right?

69
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,474
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

70
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,851
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

71
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,353
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

72
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,938
-I hope so.
-Yeah.

73
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,607
And I gotta introduce you to some
people. Some really skilled people.

74
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,317
-Not interested.
-Yeah, right.

75
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,569
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

76
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,281
I got a daughter to take care of.

77
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,534
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

78
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,411
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

79
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,372
I'm gonna be fine.

80
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,126
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

81
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,087
Would you like to try
our Mango Fruit Blast?

82
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,171
No, thanks.

83
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,800
I will have... I'll have a burger, please.

84
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,386
We don't... We don't make that.

85
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,389
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

86
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,224
It's ice cream. Baskin-Robbins.

87
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,769
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

88
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,563
Dude.

89
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,439
Can I see you in the back,
chief? Pronto.

90
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,108
Sure thing, Dale.

91
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,778
Darby, could you just
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,783
-Hey, Dale.
-Come on in.

93
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,660
Pull up some chair.

94
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,415
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

95
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,666
You found out.

96
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,002
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

97
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,421
Look, I'm sorry, all right? But I...

98
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,131
No one would hire me.

99
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,633
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

100
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,927
Look, I'm sorry.

101
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,387
I don't do it anymore. I just...

102
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,430
Respect.

103
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,807
I couldn't be happier about it.

104
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,267
-Really?
-Yeah.

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,352
Thank you. Thank you.

106
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,022
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

107
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,608
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

108
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,152
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

109
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,362
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

110
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,781
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

111
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,159
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

112
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,619
Well, you're fired, of course.

113
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,497
I can't really keep you on.

114
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,291
Wait, what? Fired?

115
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,459
Yeah.

116
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,544
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

117
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,464
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

118
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,882
I'll tell you what, though.

119
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,135
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

120
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,180
but if you want to grab
one of those Mango Fruit Blasts

121
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,598
on your way out the door,

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,975
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

123
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,849
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

124
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,268
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

125
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,186
I was. I got fired.

126
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,021
Damn. They find out who you are?

127
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,064
Yeah.

128
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,983
Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro.

129
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,985
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

130
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,113
-You want some waffles?
-Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

131
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,781
That's Kurt.

132
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:31,034
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

133
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,412
-Nice meet you.
-Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

134
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,372
Who are you?

135
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,790
Dave.

136
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,668
Nice work on the Vista job.

137
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,045
Vista job, yes.

138
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,548
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

139
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,051
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

140
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,804
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

141
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,347
You mean you're a pussy.

142
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,515
Yeah.

143
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,392
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

144
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,935
And it added up to millions.

145
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,770
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

146
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,731
And what does he do?

147
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,733
He hacks into the security system

148
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,527
and transfers millions back
to the people that they stole it from.

149
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,487
Posts all the bank records online.

150
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,282
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

151
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,203
What are you doing?

152
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,415
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

153
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,750
What do you want?

154
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,834
Okay.

155
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,378
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

156
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,672
-about this little perfect job.
-No way.

157
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,175
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

158
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,259
No!

159
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,595
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

160
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,764
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

161
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,765
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

162
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,768
I don't care. I'm out.

163
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,996
Dr. Pym?

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,332
Yes. I'm still alive.

165
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,549
ID?

166
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,844
Perhaps that will suffice.

167
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,348
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

168
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,477
Is that Hank Pym?

169
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,899
Good morning, Hank.

170
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,318
Hope.

171
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,863
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

172
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,616
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

173
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,160
More like "thrilled."

174
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,790
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

175
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,375
What's the occasion?

176
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,127
You'll see. Won't he, Hope?

177
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,300
We're ready for you inside.

178
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,594
Ouch.

179
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,182
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

180
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,725
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

181
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,687
You're in for a treat.

182
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,152
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

183
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,362
How's your face?

184
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,326
After you.

185
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,170
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

186
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,422
This company's founder
and my mentor,

187
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,174
Dr. Hank Pym.

188
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,900
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

189
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,152
I immediately started
researching a particle

190
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,030
that could change
the distance between atoms,

191
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,741
while increasing density and strength.

192
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,495
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

193
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,874
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

194
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,876
But just imagine,

195
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:12,172
a soldier the size of an insect.

196
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,052
The ultimate secret weapon.

197
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,149
An Ant-Man.

198
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,361
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

199
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,284
Silly, I know.

200
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,827
Propaganda.

201
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,912
Tales to astonish!

202
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,457
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

203
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,420
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

204
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,965
every single time I asked you,

205
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,094
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

206
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,804
Just a tall tale.

207
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:01,930
Right.

208
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,892
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

209
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:19,114
Well, I was inspired by
the legend of the Ant-Man.

210
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,992
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

211
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,120
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

212
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,623
Could that be done?

213
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,252
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

214
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,255
Distinguished guests,

215
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,968
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

216
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,678
The Yellowjacket!

217
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,977
Oh, no.

218
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,189
The Yellowjacket is
an all-purpose weapon of war

219
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,400
capable of altering
the size of the wearer

220
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,444
for the ultimate combat advantage.

221
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,696
We live in an era

222
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,949
in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves

223
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,118
are undermined
by constant surveillance.

224
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,870
It's time to return to a simpler age.

225
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,874
One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly

226
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,167
to protect their interests.

227
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,170
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,

228
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,548
the Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict

229
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,049
on the geopolitical landscape

230
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,218
completely unseen.

231
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,264
Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.

232
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,517
Practical applications
include surveillance,

233
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,143
industrial sabotage,

234
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:35,440
and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.

235
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,775
A single Yellowjacket

236
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:41,405
offers the user unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.

237
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,157
And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets

238
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:49,454
will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.

239
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,331
The Yellowjacket.

240
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,709
So, it's a suit?

241
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,047
Don't be crude, Frank.

242
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,092
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

243
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,219
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

244
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,139
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

245
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,225
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

246
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,895
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

247
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,688
I really value your opinion.

248
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,065
Thank you for coming. Hope?

249
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,652
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

250
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:21,862
Thank you.

251
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,742
You seem a bit shocked.

252
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:31,038
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

253
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,123
So you finally admit it!

254
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,419
We could have done this together,
Hank. But you ruined that.

255
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,671
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

256
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,090
Don't do this.

257
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,426
Dr. Cross?

258
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,472
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

259
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,432
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

260
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,683
Deal.

261
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,611
We have to make our move, Hank.

262
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,695
How close is he?

263
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,490
He still can't shrink a live subject.

264
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,117
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

265
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,494
No.

266
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,329
I have Cross' complete trust.

267
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,414
-It's too dangerous.
-We don't have a choice.

268
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, that's not entirely true.

269
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,838
I think I found a guy.

270
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,799
Who?

271
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,680
Daddy!

272
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,223
Peanut!

273
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,517
Happy birthday!

274
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,560
I'm so sorry I'm late.

275
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,228
I didn't know
what time your party started.

276
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,855
It was on the invitation.

277
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,690
He didn't get an invitation.

278
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,233
But he came anyway!

279
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,319
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

280
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,154
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

281
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,197
You don't...

282
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,323
What are you doing here, Lang?

283
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,867
You haven't paid a dime
of child support.

284
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,702
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

285
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,786
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

286
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,123
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

287
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,502
Hey, look what I have for you.

288
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,920
Can I open it now?

289
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,589
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

290
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,720
You're my bestest friend.

291
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,929
What is that thing?

292
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,556
He's so ugly!

293
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,267
I love him!

294
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,894
Can I go show my friends?

295
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,770
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

296
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,148
You're my bestest friend.

297
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,400
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

298
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,444
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

299
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm sure you'll figure it out. But for now,
I want you out of my house. Okay?

300
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,907
-No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
-It's my house!

301
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,116
-So what? It's my kid!
-Scott!

302
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,912
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

303
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,038
It's a birthday party.

304
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,748
Yeah, I know,
but you can't just show up.

305
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,832
She's my daughter.

306
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,375
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

307
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,505
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

308
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,548
Your fiancé is an asshat.

309
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,674
He's not an asshat.

310
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,636
-Hey, watch your language. Okay?
-What language? I said "hat."

311
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,095
Stop it.

312
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,432
Really, Maggie? That guy?

313
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,100
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

314
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,519
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

315
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,103
At least he's not a crook.

316
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,858
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight.

317
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,902
I had a job and...

318
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:09,905
I wanna provide.

319
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,491
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

320
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,617
So much.

321
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,912
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

322
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:17,954
What do I do?

323
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,998
Get an apartment,

324
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,126
get a job, pay child support.

325
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,296
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

326
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,757
You're her hero, Scott.

327
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,971
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

328
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,497
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

329
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,292
Yeah. Well...

330
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,504
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

331
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,090
It'd be nice though, right?

332
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,093
But there are laws.

333
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,720
What laws? Of man?

334
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,222
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

335
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,349
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

336
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,689
Darren, I don't think you understand...

337
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,364
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

338
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,913
Goodbye, Frank.

339
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,969
Thank you.

340
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,018
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

341
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,395
And today,
during my morning meditation,

342
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,524
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

343
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,775
How's that?

344
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,568
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

345
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,657
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

346
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,326
I devoted my genius to him.

347
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,119
I could have worked anywhere.

348
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,413
I chose my mentor poorly.

349
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,083
You didn't even have a choice.

350
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,961
He never believed in you.

351
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,716
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

352
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,262
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

353
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,932
Because his failures as a mentor,

354
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,976
as a father,

355
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,604
forced us to spread our wings.

356
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,526
You're a success, Darren.

357
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,696
You deserve everything
coming your way.

358
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,635
Stop cheating.

359
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,971
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

360
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,266
Maybe he didn't hear you.

361
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,976
How was the party?

362
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,651
-Tell me about that tip.
-What?

363
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,695
I wanna know about that tip.

364
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,406
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

365
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,867
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

366
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,160
It's gotta be airtight.

367
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,162
Okay.

368
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,497
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

369
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,875
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

370
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,710
But there was a rosé that saved the day.
It was delightful.

371
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,963
And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.

372
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,257
It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.

373
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,967
It's the wrong details.

374
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,344
It has nothing to do with the story.

375
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,386
Go.

376
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:06,016
So, he tells me that she's working
as a housekeeper now, right?

377
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,893
And she's dating this dude, Carlos,

378
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,353
who's a shot-caller
from across the bay.

379
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,523
And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.

380
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,025
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO

381
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,152
that is all retired now, but he's loaded.

382
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,948
And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,

383
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,699
and they get to talking, right?

384
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:26,203
And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.

385
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:30,374
"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."

386
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,458
Of course Ernesto comes to me

387
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,751
because he knows
I got mad thieving skills.

388
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:33,836
Of course, I ask him...

389
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:37,381
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"

390
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,674
And he says, "Nah, dawg.

391
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,968
"All she said is that it's super-legit

392
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,095
"and whatever's in it,
it's gotta be good."

393
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,224
What?

394
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,685
Old man have safe.

395
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,979
And he's gone for a week.

396
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,064
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

397
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,190
and he's gone for a week.

398
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:56,358
Let's just work with that.

399
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,776
You know what I'm saying?

400
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,870
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

401
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,289
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

402
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,332
Comm check.

403
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,541
-Check.
-Check.

404
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,793
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

405
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,128
Don't worry.

406
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,339
It's not gonna happen.

407
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,468
I love it when he gets cocky.

408
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:11,642
Damn!

409
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,587
Alarm is dead.

410
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:41,672
Nice.

411
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,260
All right, I'm moving through the house.

412
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,453
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

413
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,123
It's got what? Ernesto didn't tell me
nothing about that.

414
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,292
Man, are we screwed?

415
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,085
Not necessarily.

416
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,426
I'm in.

417
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:12,471
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

418
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,268
Oh, man.

419
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,686
What is it?

420
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,106
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

421
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,359
How serious are we talking, Scotty?

422
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,110
It's a Carbondale.

423
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:28,612
It's from 1910.

424
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,448
Made from the same steel
as the Titanic.

425
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:32,783
Wow.

426
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,284
Can you crack it?

427
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:37,788
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

428
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,122
Remember what that iceberg did?

429
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,958
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

430
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,000
Killed everybody.

431
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,627
Did not kill the old lady.

432
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,796
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

433
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,641
What are you doing?

434
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:40,976
I poured water
in the locking mechanism

435
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,060
and froze it with nitrogen.

436
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,063
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

437
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,566
-What are you doing now?
-Waiting.

438
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,944
Waiting.

439
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,536
Nice.

440
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,375
What is it? Cash? Jewels?

441
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,462
-There's nothing here.
-What did you say?

442
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,924
-It's a suit.
-What?

443
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,468
It's an old motorcycle suit.

444
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,554
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

445
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:18,931
No.

446
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,891
It's a bust.

447
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,477
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

448
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,229
I know you needed to score.

449
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,306
I thought we were using mice.

450
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,267
What's the difference?

451
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:09,606
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

452
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,608
Darren, maybe we should think...

453
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,111
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

454
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,113
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

455
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,850
Experiment 34-C results,

456
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:45,976
negative.

457
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,942
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

458
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,705
Why would you lock this up?

459
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,812
This is so weird.

460
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:03,971
Scotty, what's up, man?

461
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,812
I wonder... What is this?

462
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,762
The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

463
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,265
What? Who said that?

464
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,397
Luis, down here!

465
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:59,902
It's a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case,

466
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:00,944
water.

467
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,804
Guess you're tougher
than you thought.

468
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,850
Oh, I don't want to see this!

469
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,019
Luis!

470
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:39,775
Son of a...

471
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,228
What the hell?

472
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,982
Not bad for a test drive.

473
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,151
Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.

474
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,236
No! No! No, thank you!

475
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,584
Get down on the ground!

476
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,085
You are under arrest!

477
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:24,880
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

478
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,927
Don't move.

479
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,349
You know,
you almost had us convinced

480
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,434
that you were gonna change your ways.

481
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,062
They were really rooting for you.

482
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,732
It's gonna break their hearts.

483
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,862
-You got a visitor.
-Who?

484
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,280
Your lawyer.

485
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,533
My lawyer?

486
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,080
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

487
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:02,417
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

488
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,878
Oh, man.

489
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,088
Sit down.

490
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,803
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

491
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,721
I don't even wanna know
why you have it.

492
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,598
Maggie was right about you.

493
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,351
How do you know about...

494
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,186
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

495
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,481
The moment things get hard,

496
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,858
you turn right back to crime.

497
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,654
The way I see it, you have a choice.

498
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,197
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

499
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,034
or go back to your cell

500
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,121
and await further instructions.

501
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,664
I don't understand.

502
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,833
No, I don't expect you to.

503
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,003
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

504
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,337
neither do I.

505
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:52,134
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

506
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:53,177
What?

507
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,857
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

508
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,985
So, next time you think
you might see one,

509
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:14,364
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

510
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:28,754
You're my bestest friend!

511
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,839
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

512
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,841
No, I love this one.

513
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,178
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

514
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,222
Mommy?

515
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,599
Is Daddy a bad man?

516
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:43,894
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

517
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,146
No.

518
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:49,900
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

519
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:44,329
Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.

520
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:46,415
Under the door.

521
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,297
Okay, where to now?

522
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,257
-Hang tight.
-Oh, God.

523
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:59,178
What, what?

524
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,304
Where the hell did he go?

525
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,597
I have no idea. He just vanished.

526
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,640
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

527
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:04,975
Get back! Get back!

528
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,603
Scott, these are my associates.

529
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:09,521
Is that a camera on an ant?

530
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,481
Yeah, sure. Why not?

531
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:12,566
Where's the car?

532
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,318
No car. We've got wings.

533
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,652
Incoming!

534
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,665
Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.

535
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,168
-How safe is...
-Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

536
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:47,351
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

537
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,853
So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.

538
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,522
All right.

539
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:53,565
-Now, what's the next move?
-Hang on tight.

540
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:55,400
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

541
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,110
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

542
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,238
You're throwing 247 off balance.

543
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,739
Wait, his name is 247?

544
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,574
He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.

545
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,035
Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?

546
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,956
Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.

547
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,541
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

548
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,584
-No, I think it's 247.
-Wait.

549
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,545
Hang on tight!

550
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,547
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

551
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,508
I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.

552
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,551
What?

553
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,553
-Can I make one little request?
-No.

554
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,889
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

555
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:27,724
Time out.

556
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,893
All right, hold on.

557
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:30,936
Just wait!

558
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,230
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

559
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:36,692
It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.

560
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,402
Let's set her down, all right?

561
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,444
I'm getting light-headed.

562
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:40,612
Hang on, Scott.

563
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,240
I'm getting a little light...

564
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,075
I need a snooze button.

565
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,828
Hit me in 5 minutes.

566
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:07,764
Hello.

567
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:12,436
Who are you?

568
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,399
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

569
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,609
Yes.

570
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,693
Why?

571
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:22,529
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

572
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,492
Hey, look...

573
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,959
Paraponera clavata.

574
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,503
Giant tropical bullet ants,

575
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,129
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

576
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:40,714
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

577
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,510
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

578
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,428
Who?

579
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:49,932
Hey!

580
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,559
Whose pajamas are these?

581
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,026
How am I supposed to do this?

582
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:10,160
All right, just one step at a time.

583
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:19,628
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

584
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,717
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

585
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,010
We don't need this guy.

586
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,555
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

587
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:32,224
I did. She's great.

588
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,518
She doesn't think that we need you.

589
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,019
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

590
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:39,273
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

591
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,942
and then Hope has you arrested.

592
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:45,028
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

593
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,572
She's a little bit anxious.

594
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,740
It has to do with this job,

595
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:51,326
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

596
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,704
I take it that you're interested in.

597
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:54,872
What job?

598
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:55,914
Would you like some tea?

599
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,000
Sure.

600
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,043
I was very impressed with

601
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,671
how you managed to get
past my security system.

602
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:07,134
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

603
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,635
Were you watching me?

604
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,930
Scott, I've been watching you
for a while.

605
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:14,224
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

606
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,605
Excuse me. "Burgled" Vista Corp.

607
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:25,277
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

608
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,070
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

609
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,072
But you beat it.

610
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:30,490
Would you like some sugar?

611
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,117
Yeah, thanks.

612
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,122
You know what? I'm okay.

613
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,421
How do you make them do that?

614
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,132
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

615
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:50,844
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

616
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,971
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

617
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,437
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

618
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:03,774
I speak to them.

619
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:06,193
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

620
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:07,694
and see everything.

621
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:09,488
And still know absolutely nothing.

622
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,823
I'm late to meet Cross.

623
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:16,870
Dr. Pym?

624
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:19,122
You don't need to
raise your hand, Scott.

625
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,501
Sorry, I just have one question.

626
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,670
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

627
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:26,463
and can I go back to jail now?

628
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:27,756
Come with me.

629
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:32,636
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

630
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,971
Huh?

631
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,306
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

632
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,058
That's what powers the suit.

633
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,643
That's why it works.

634
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,020
Wow.

635
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,902
But it was dangerous.

636
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,780
It was too dangerous.

637
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,950
So I hid it from the world.

638
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,704
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

639
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:00,831
Pym Tech.

640
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:01,999
Yes.

641
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:06,753
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

642
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:08,088
Darren Cross.

643
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,214
He's a big deal.

644
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,758
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

645
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:16,180
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

646
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:18,557
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

647
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,227
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

648
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:26,023
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

649
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:29,067
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

650
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:30,861
But I wouldn't help him.

651
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:34,740
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

652
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,366
How could he do that?

653
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:39,203
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

654
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,454
She was the deciding vote.

655
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,208
But she came back to me

656
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,669
when she saw how close Cross was
to cracking my formula.

657
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,964
The process is highly volatile.

658
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:53,884
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

659
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:56,845
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

660
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,890
I don't think Darren realizes this,

661
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,684
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

662
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,562
So, what do you want from me?

663
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:11,401
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

664
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:12,486
Do you?

665
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:13,904
I do.

666
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,156
If you can help me,

667
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,743
I promise I can help you
be with your daughter again.

668
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:23,247
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

669
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,082
Absolutely.

670
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:28,877
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

671
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,338
What do you want me to do?

672
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:34,758
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

673
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,972
Are you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

674
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:43,433
Yeah. I'll pick something up. Text me.

675
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:44,810
Okay. Good news?

676
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,437
I don't know. It's news.

677
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,898
Are you trying to find my daddy?

678
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,485
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

679
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:56,363
I just want your daddy to be safe.

680
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:58,574
Hope you don't catch him.

681
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,371
This isn't the first time these guys

682
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:49,249
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

683
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:53,378
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

684
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,672
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

685
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:58,258
He always wanted my tech.

686
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:01,678
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

687
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,847
and destroy all the data,

688
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:09,728
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

689
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:16,360
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

690
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:19,446
I spent half my life

691
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,699
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

692
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:26,537
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

693
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,998
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

694
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,501
This could change the texture of reality.

695
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:38,465
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

696
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:41,051
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

697
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:43,971
Scott, they are ants.

698
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:47,808
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

699
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:53,897
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

700
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:57,568
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

701
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,736
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

702
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,281
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

703
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,575
I was against using him
when we had months,

704
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,577
and now we have days.

705
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,661
I'm wearing the suit.

706
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:09,121
Absolutely not!

707
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:12,124
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

708
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:13,750
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

709
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:16,628
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

710
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:19,089
-We don't have time to screw around!
-Hope, please listen to me...

711
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:20,674
He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.

712
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,092
No!

713
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:02,257
She's right, Hank.

714
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:03,884
I'm not your guy.

715
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,929
Why don't you wear the suit?

716
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,223
You think I don't want to?

717
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:10,349
I can't.

718
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:13,977
I spent years wearing it,

719
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:16,730
and it took a toll on me.

720
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,447
You're our only option.

721
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:33,872
Before Hope lost her mother,

722
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:37,876
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

723
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:42,923
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

724
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,345
It's too late for me,

725
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:51,348
but not for you.

726
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:53,350
This is your chance.

727
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:57,062
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

728
00:48:57,145 --> 00:49:00,899
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

729
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:04,194
It's not about saving our world.

730
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,739
It's about saving theirs.

731
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:12,703
Damn. That was a good speech.

732
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:14,288
Scott,

733
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:19,126
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

734
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:23,714
In the right hands,

735
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:27,050
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

736
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:30,888
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

737
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:33,807
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

738
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:35,100
you need to be fast.

739
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:37,102
You should be able to shrink and grow

740
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:38,353
on a dime.

741
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,732
So your size always suits your needs.

742
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,235
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

743
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:49,072
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

744
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,207
Useless.

745
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,085
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

746
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:04,046
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

747
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:07,424
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

748
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:10,844
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

749
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:12,429
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

750
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,264
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

751
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:16,099
Show me.

752
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,518
-Terrible.
-You wanna show me how to punch?

753
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:19,937
Show me...

754
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,689
That's how you punch.

755
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:25,526
-She's been looking forward to this.
-No kidding.

756
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:28,278
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

757
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,405
By "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

758
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,533
We lost her in a plane crash.

759
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:34,326
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

760
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,953
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

761
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,746
We're working, here.

762
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,418
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

763
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,587
Were you going for the hand?

764
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:54,179
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

765
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:56,974
Do not screw with the regulator.

766
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:58,809
If that regulator is compromised,

767
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,394
you would go subatomic.

768
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,770
What does that mean?

769
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:05,148
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

770
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,650
What does that mean?

771
00:51:06,692 --> 00:51:11,196
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

772
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,322
become irrelevant

773
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:15,158
as you shrink for all eternity.

774
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:18,579
Everything that you know

775
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:19,955
and love,

776
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:22,457
gone forever.

777
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,253
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

778
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,088
You've learned about the suit,

779
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:30,883
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

780
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:33,177
the ants.

781
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,179
Loyal, brave,

782
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,847
and your partners on this job.

783
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:45,981
Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.

784
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:48,233
They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,

785
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:50,777
which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.

786
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:52,362
You're not so crazy.

787
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,531
Hey!

788
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:56,325
You're cute.

789
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,835
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

790
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,973
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

791
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,975
There's a security guard posted
around the clock.

792
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,645
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

793
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:27,231
Okay, who's next?

794
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:30,651
Paraponera clavata.

795
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,402
I know. Bullet ants, right?

796
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:34,071
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

797
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:35,781
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

798
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:40,661
The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,

799
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:42,037
and the only access point is a tube

800
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,915
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

801
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:46,792
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

802
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,086
The tube is protected by a laser grid,

803
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,921
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

804
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:53,590
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

805
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:57,761
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

806
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,013
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

807
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:02,266
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

808
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:05,143
Ideal for ground and air transport.

809
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:06,770
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

810
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,482
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

811
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:11,817
That's good. That's very good.

812
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,530
Because this time, you're really gonna
have to learn how to control him.

813
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:19,199
Tell them to put the sugar
in the teacup.

814
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,037
You okay? Did I hurt...

815
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,467
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

816
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:39,178
The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.

817
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,013
Red shrinks.

818
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,682
Blue enlarges.

819
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,353
Solenopsis mandibularis.

820
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:49,771
Known for their bite,

821
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:52,566
the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.

822
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:55,652
They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.

823
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,039
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

824
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,752
They're not listening to me.

825
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:14,505
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

826
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,381
No shortcuts, no lies.

827
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:21,345
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

828
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:22,888
We don't have time for coddling.

829
00:54:22,971 --> 00:54:25,182
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

830
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:26,600
Really?

831
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:29,228
Is that where our focus should be?

832
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,837
Hope!

833
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:06,390
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

834
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,484
We can't do this without her.

835
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:22,739
Oh, God.

836
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:24,783
You gotta lock your doors.

837
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:27,744
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

838
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:29,371
Do you think this is a joke?

839
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:33,083
Do you have any idea
what he's asking you to risk?

840
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,376
You have a daughter.

841
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:35,752
I'm doing this for her.

842
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:38,672
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

843
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,591
He was in grief.

844
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:42,009
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

845
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,678
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

846
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:47,431
He just sent me off to boarding school.

847
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,559
You know, I thought,

848
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:52,019
with all that's at stake,

849
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:55,272
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

850
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:57,274
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

851
00:55:57,316 --> 00:56:00,194
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

852
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:01,653
Then why are you here?

853
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,614
It proves that he loves you.

854
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:07,284
Hope. Look at me.

855
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:10,329
I'm expendable.

856
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:12,289
That's why I'm here.

857
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,292
You must have realized that by now.

858
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:18,337
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

859
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,633
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

860
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:25,677
Anyway...

861
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:30,182
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

862
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,309
when I called the cops on you.

863
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,606
What's her name?

864
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,900
Cassie.

865
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:42,402
It's a pretty name.

866
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,199
You have to clear your mind, Scott.

867
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:48,784
You have to
make your thoughts precise.

868
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:50,452
That's how it works.

869
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:53,372
Think about Cassie.

870
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:57,334
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

871
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:07,886
Open your eyes

872
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,222
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

873
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:34,288
That's good!

874
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:55,225
Your mother convinced me

875
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:58,312
to let her join me on my missions.

876
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:01,064
They called her the Wasp.

877
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:03,317
She was born to it.

878
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:07,738
And there's not a day that goes by

879
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:10,699
that I don't regret having said yes.

880
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:16,830
It was 1987.

881
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:22,085
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

882
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:26,590
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

883
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:37,351
The only way to the internal mechanics

884
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,186
was through solid titanium.

885
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:53,367
I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.

886
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:56,620
But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

887
00:58:58,455 --> 00:58:59,831
Your mother,

888
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,166
she didn't hesitate.

889
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:04,962
Janet! No!

890
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:14,304
She turned off her regulator

891
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,557
and went subatomic

892
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,310
to deactivate the bomb.

893
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:23,856
And she was gone.

894
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:30,404
Your mom died a hero.

895
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,576
And I spent the next 10 years

896
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:39,955
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

897
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,669
You were trying to bring her back.

898
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:50,883
But all I learned was we know nothing.

899
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:57,556
It's not your fault.

900
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:01,518
She made her choice.

901
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:09,735
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

902
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,780
I was trying to protect you.

903
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:17,201
I lost your mother.

904
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:22,122
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

905
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,333
I'm sorry.

906
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:28,962
This is awesome.

907
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:31,715
It's awesome, you know?

908
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:33,800
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

909
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:36,386
It's important.

910
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:40,807
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

911
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:42,518
Yes, you did. Yes.

912
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,687
I'm going to make some tea.

913
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,361
Nailed it!

914
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:03,705
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

915
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:36,446
The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

916
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,698
It's freezing!

917
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,117
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

918
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:43,704
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

919
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:46,498
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

920
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:48,292
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

921
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,085
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

922
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,213
It's currently collecting dust

923
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:56,466
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

924
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,468
Should be a piece of cake.

925
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:00,470
You're over the target area.

926
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:02,806
Disengage now, Scott!

927
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,057
Squadron A, go!

928
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:05,350
B, go!

929
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:08,979
C, go!

930
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,316
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

931
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:16,612
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

932
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:17,654
Stay calm.

933
01:02:19,573 --> 01:02:21,491
Guys? We might have a problem.

934
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:24,912
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

935
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:25,996
It's not!

936
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,832
You son of a bitch!

937
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:33,587
-Scott, get out of there.
-Abort!

938
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:34,713
Abort now!

939
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:37,549
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

940
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:39,676
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

941
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:41,678
He's gonna lose the suit.

942
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,180
He's gonna lose his life.

943
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,188
All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.

944
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:53,815
Somebody's home, Scott.

945
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:58,362
What's going on down there, Sam?

946
01:02:58,445 --> 01:02:59,530
It's the Falcon!

947
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,199
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

948
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:03,951
Wait a second.

949
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:06,036
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

950
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,621
It's okay. He can't see me.

951
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:08,747
I can see you.

952
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:09,873
He can see me.

953
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:14,253
Hi. I'm Scott.

954
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:15,963
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

955
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:19,383
-What are you doing here?
-First off, I'm a big fan.

956
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:20,968
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

957
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:23,053
I'm Ant-Man.

958
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,388
"Ant-Man"?

959
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:26,557
What? You haven't heard of me?

960
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,392
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

961
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:30,269
You wanna tell me what you want?

962
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:32,771
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

963
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:34,565
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

964
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:37,276
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

965
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:38,694
I know exactly how that is.

966
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:40,737
Located the breach.

967
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,905
-Bringing him in.
-Sorry about this!

968
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,203
What the hell are you doing?

969
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:53,750
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

970
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:08,348
Sorry!

971
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:09,808
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

972
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:11,602
That's enough!

973
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,418
Ant-thony! A little help!

974
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:50,098
I've lost visual.

975
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:00,692
He's inside my pack!

976
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:01,777
Sorry!

977
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:04,404
You seem like a really great guy.

978
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:33,475
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

979
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:40,190
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

980
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,193
You jeopardized everything!

981
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:00,711
You got it.

982
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:04,840
Well done.

983
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:05,883
Wait a minute.

984
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:07,384
Did you just compliment me?

985
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:09,803
-He did, didn't he?
-Kind of sounded like he did.

986
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:13,140
I was good, wasn't I?

987
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:18,437
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

988
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,023
Let us not dwell on the past.

989
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,192
We gotta finish our planning.

990
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:27,070
Don't mind him.

991
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:28,739
You did good.

992
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:36,830
Darren.

993
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,710
How the hell did you get in here?

994
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:44,963
You left the front door open, Hank.

995
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:46,423
It's official.

996
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:47,508
You're old.

997
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:49,384
The plans.

998
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:52,262
He will kill him.

999
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,185
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1000
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:00,812
I have good news.

1001
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:02,147
Really?

1002
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:03,857
What's that?

1003
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:09,196
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1004
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:13,116
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

1005
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:16,787
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1006
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:24,628
You're welcome.

1007
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:31,385
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1008
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:34,096
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

1009
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,974
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1010
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,350
I'll be there.

1011
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:56,743
What did you see in me?

1012
01:07:57,995 --> 01:07:59,371
I don't know what you mean.

1013
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:02,958
All those years ago, you picked me.

1014
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,501
What did you see?

1015
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,422
I saw myself.

1016
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:11,383
Then why did you push me away?

1017
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:16,263
Because I saw too much of myself.

1018
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:28,692
He knows. He's baiting you.

1019
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:30,444
We have to call it off.

1020
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:31,694
We're all taking risks.

1021
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,071
What if he saw me here?

1022
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:34,531
He didn't. There's no way.

1023
01:08:34,573 --> 01:08:36,033
How do you know that?

1024
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:45,709
Darren, hi.

1025
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:48,545
Hope, where are you right now?

1026
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:50,464
I'm at home. Why?

1027
01:08:50,546 --> 01:08:52,299
I just saw Hank.

1028
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:54,218
I still get nothing
but contempt from him.

1029
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:57,804
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1030
01:08:57,888 --> 01:09:00,390
We need to start everyone working
around the clock.

1031
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:02,267
Get the assembly line up and running.

1032
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,602
And I'm tripling security.

1033
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:05,729
Full sensors at all entrances

1034
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:09,233
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1035
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,901
Great. Good idea.

1036
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:14,738
Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1037
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:22,246
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1038
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:24,247
But he is not onto you.

1039
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,707
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1040
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,544
and closing exterior vents.

1041
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:30,420
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1042
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,423
The water main.

1043
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:36,593
You can't add security to a water main.

1044
01:09:36,676 --> 01:09:39,011
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1045
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:40,305
that's how I get in.

1046
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:42,599
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1047
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,017
to change the water pressure.

1048
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,812
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

1049
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,272
So we expand our team.

1050
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:50,023
What do we need?

1051
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:53,484
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

1052
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:55,404
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1053
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:56,947
and kill the laser grid,

1054
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:59,283
and a getaway guy.

1055
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:03,203
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three wombats. No way.

1056
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:05,414
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1057
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:09,126
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1058
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,919
Because we just robbed you.

1059
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:16,175
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1060
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:17,551
Two smoothie machines.

1061
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,219
Are you sure they can handle this?

1062
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:20,679
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1063
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:24,391
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1064
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:27,144
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1065
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:28,520
We know our business.

1066
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:30,981
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

1067
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:32,482
I let you.

1068
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:35,861
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

1069
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:39,239
-Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
-Yeah, we can handle it.

1070
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,074
-You got their credentials?
-He's in the system.

1071
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:43,660
-I'm in the system?
-You're in the system.

1072
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:44,912
The system?

1073
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:47,331
Yeah, we're doomed.

1074
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:48,415
All right.

1075
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:50,167
There's something
you guys need to see.

1076
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,085
When you get to this corner,

1077
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:54,922
there's gonna be three offices
on your left side.

1078
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:56,256
Damn!

1079
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:00,719
That's so cool, bro!

1080
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,514
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

1081
01:11:03,555 --> 01:11:06,850
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

1082
01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:08,227
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1083
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,187
-Really?
-Yeah.

1084
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:11,355
Good.

1085
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,447
This is the work of gypsies.

1086
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:21,698
That's witchcraft.

1087
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:22,866
Wow, that's amazing.

1088
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:24,993
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1089
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:26,161
That's some kind of wizardry.

1090
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:27,371
This is sorcery!

1091
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:28,539
How'd you do that, bro?

1092
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:30,415
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1093
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:33,877
Get off! Get off!

1094
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:36,296
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

1095
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:40,175
I gave them each half a Xanax

1096
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:42,886
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1097
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:45,097
They fell right asleep.

1098
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:48,392
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1099
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,394
No, please don't.

1100
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,896
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1101
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,273
I'm just glad that you might have

1102
01:11:54,356 --> 01:11:56,817
a slight chance of
maybe pulling this off.

1103
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,987
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1104
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:02,739
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1105
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:04,408
to almost liking you.

1106
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,076
You really should write poetry.

1107
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,248
Get some sleep, Scott.

1108
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,635
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

1109
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:06,303
-Dave?
-Wheels on the ground.

1110
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:07,679
-Kurt?
-Eyes in the sky.

1111
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,223
-Luis?
-Oh, man, you know it.

1112
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:10,766
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.

1113
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,476
-That's what's up.
-Luis.

1114
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,728
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm just excited.

1115
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:16,146
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1116
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,523
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

1117
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:18,649
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1118
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,567
-Oh, my Lord.
-She's not my...

1119
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:22,986
You know what? I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover.

1120
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:24,947
Like a whistling. You know
what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1121
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:28,075
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1122
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:30,118
It's not The Andy Griffith Show.
No whistling.

1123
01:13:48,053 --> 01:13:49,179
All clear in Sector One.

1124
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:55,561
Step out.

1125
01:13:58,188 --> 01:13:59,356
All clear.

1126
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,071
We're set.

1127
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:07,990
Wish me luck.

1128
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:21,128
Utilities online.

1129
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,309
Hey! What are you doing?

1130
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:40,439
Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

1131
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,233
I'm the boss.

1132
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:45,110
Utilities 1.3...

1133
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,210
Water level is dropping!

1134
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:31,698
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1135
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,033
All right, I see it.

1136
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,461
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1137
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,884
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1138
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:57,683
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1139
01:16:08,193 --> 01:16:10,153
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1140
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:13,073
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1141
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,244
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1142
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:18,537
This is problem?

1143
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,664
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

1144
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:22,583
for undercover cops, man,

1145
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,001
yes, this is problem.

1146
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:29,006
That's Pym.

1147
01:16:31,758 --> 01:16:33,177
Oh, no.

1148
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:34,511
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1149
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:36,096
Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...

1150
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:39,099
I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.

1151
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,518
-What's up, man?
-Hey.

1152
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,696
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1153
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:55,199
That's what I call
an unfortunate casualty

1154
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,159
in a very serious operation.

1155
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:08,545
Signal decoy in place.

1156
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:10,964
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1157
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:14,593
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1158
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:16,386
Scott, we have problem.

1159
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,388
Problem? What's the problem?

1160
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:21,725
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1161
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:23,393
Listen to me.

1162
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:27,231
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

1163
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,566
That's awfully dramatic.

1164
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:33,695
Are you kidding me?

1165
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:39,910
Problem solved.

1166
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:56,176
Well...

1167
01:17:57,928 --> 01:17:59,596
How do I look?

1168
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,065
There he is.

1169
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:14,778
Just in time. Come on.

1170
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:26,123
12-point verification.

1171
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:27,958
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

1172
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,585
Confirming authorization level.

1173
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,295
Well, you can never be too safe.

1174
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:32,337
Access granted.

1175
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:41,388
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1176
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:44,183
You really did it.

1177
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:46,018
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1178
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:13,837
Arriving in second position.

1179
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,883
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

1180
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:30,020
Proceeding to command position.

1181
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,581
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1182
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,585
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1183
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:55,379
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1184
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,548
No, no, no, no, no!

1185
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:00,050
Did you see that?

1186
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:08,225
Assume formation.

1187
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:10,185
All right, you cute little crazies,

1188
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:11,979
let's fry these servers!

1189
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:26,076
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1190
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:39,798
Servers are fried.

1191
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:42,092
Data backup completely erased.

1192
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:43,635
Heading to the particle chamber.

1193
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:52,102
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1194
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:58,483
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

1195
01:20:58,567 --> 01:20:59,776
Wonderful.

1196
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:02,654
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

1197
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,323
They're representatives of Hydra.

1198
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:05,782
They're not what they were.

1199
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:08,118
They're doing some interesting work.

1200
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,454
And I'm enjoying myself.

1201
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,540
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

1202
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:15,459
And now it's gonna
blow up in your face.

1203
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:20,631
Wow.

1204
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:24,968
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch
coming a mile away,

1205
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,137
but I just figured
it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1206
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:28,639
Well, you figured wrong.

1207
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:31,099
I know this van.

1208
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:33,810
Anybody home?

1209
01:21:39,483 --> 01:21:40,526
All right, guys. I'm here.

1210
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,990
I'm setting the charges.

1211
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:08,929
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.

1212
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:20,524
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1213
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:22,526
Final position.

1214
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:33,537
Guys, how we looking
on that laser grid?

1215
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,205
-Almost.
-No, you're not.

1216
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:36,623
-I'm getting close!
-No, you're not.

1217
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,921
San Francisco P.D.!

1218
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:44,006
Out of the van!

1219
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:45,716
I know you're in there!

1220
01:22:45,757 --> 01:22:47,801
-Make it go faster.
-Dude, seriously.

1221
01:22:53,724 --> 01:22:55,726
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

1222
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:57,519
So close.

1223
01:22:57,561 --> 01:22:59,062
-Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
-Freeze!

1224
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:00,731
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

1225
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:02,733
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

1226
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:04,276
-Get out of the van!
-Okay, I'm coming.

1227
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:06,153
Take it easy!

1228
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:08,071
No, I will not move! Go now!

1229
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:12,242
-Wait!
-What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1230
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:23,837
What? What?

1231
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:26,757
Hey, little guy.

1232
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:42,731
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

1233
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:43,774
Which begs the question,

1234
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:46,026
who is the new Ant-Man?

1235
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:48,529
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

1236
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:50,405
trusted even more than me?

1237
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:54,785
Scott Lang.

1238
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:57,829
A martyr

1239
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:00,374
who took on the system
and paid the price,

1240
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:04,044
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

1241
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:07,214
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1242
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:13,053
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

1243
01:24:13,887 --> 01:24:17,224
And then he disappears magically,

1244
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:20,644
despite having no money to his name.

1245
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:23,272
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1246
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:29,528
The only thing that
can rival my creation.

1247
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:33,031
Darren, don't do this.

1248
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:35,158
If you sell to these men,

1249
01:24:35,242 --> 01:24:36,702
it's gonna be chaos.

1250
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,161
I already have.

1251
01:24:38,245 --> 01:24:39,705
And for twice the price,

1252
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:41,832
thanks to you.

1253
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:45,252
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

1254
01:24:45,335 --> 01:24:47,337
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1255
01:24:47,379 --> 01:24:51,049
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1256
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:53,677
They don't run on diesel.

1257
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:56,471
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

1258
01:24:57,848 --> 01:24:59,558
What do you call the only man

1259
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:02,477
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

1260
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,898
The most powerful man in the world.

1261
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:07,524
You proud of me yet?

1262
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:10,611
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

1263
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:14,198
It's been too late for a long time now.

1264
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:17,242
Darren!

1265
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:19,703
What are you doing?

1266
01:25:19,745 --> 01:25:22,915
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

1267
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:24,750
This is not who you are.

1268
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,669
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

1269
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,930
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1270
01:25:39,765 --> 01:25:42,226
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

1271
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:46,188
Here we go.

1272
01:25:47,814 --> 01:25:50,734
Drop your gun.

1273
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:56,490
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

1274
01:25:56,573 --> 01:25:57,658
but you were there.

1275
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:01,245
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

1276
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:02,454
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1277
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:05,582
but I think I am now!

1278
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:07,751
Drop your gun now!

1279
01:26:07,835 --> 01:26:11,088
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1280
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:25,310
Dad!

1281
01:26:34,152 --> 01:26:35,445
Hank, no.

1282
01:26:35,487 --> 01:26:36,947
No, Hank.

1283
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:39,700
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1284
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:41,118
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1285
01:26:42,953 --> 01:26:45,622
Take the suit off, or I'll blow
your brains out and peel it off.

1286
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:13,483
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

1287
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:15,027
Request immediate backup!

1288
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,278
Go, go, go!

1289
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:31,168
Get me to the roof.

1290
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:32,503
And radio ahead.

1291
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:35,422
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

1292
01:27:35,506 --> 01:27:36,548
You two,

1293
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:39,343
kill anything that
comes out of that vault!

1294
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:42,471
Dad, can you move?

1295
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:46,183
We need to get him out of here.

1296
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:50,187
Go get that suit.

1297
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:34,648
Hey, Scotty.

1298
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:36,316
Hey, did I save your life?

1299
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:38,610
Scotty?

1300
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:40,070
Scotty?

1301
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:44,241
Thank you, Luis.

1302
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:45,868
-Are we the good guys?
-Yeah.

1303
01:28:45,909 --> 01:28:47,995
-We're the good guys, right?
-Yeah, we're the good guys.

1304
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:50,497
Feels kinda weird, you know.

1305
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:52,666
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1306
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:54,668
Get out of here before this place blows!

1307
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:04,469
Damn it! That guy.

1308
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:07,890
Hey! We're getting out of here!

1309
01:29:12,561 --> 01:29:13,604
The charges are set.

1310
01:29:13,687 --> 01:29:15,689
We've gotta find a way out of here.
And fast.

1311
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:17,691
Don't worry.

1312
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:20,319
I'm not gonna die.

1313
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:21,737
And neither are you.

1314
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:25,199
It's not a keychain.

1315
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:31,455
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

1316
01:29:42,299 --> 01:29:43,926
And there's a tank.

1317
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:55,187
A little help!

1318
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:57,814
I got it.

1319
01:29:58,607 --> 01:30:00,067
We need a doctor!

1320
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:02,611
We've got him.

1321
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:06,365
Thank you.

1322
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:09,201
Let's go!

1323
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:26,677
Ant-thony!

1324
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,316
Go!

1325
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:43,694
You're gonna regret that.

1326
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:55,789
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

1327
01:30:55,873 --> 01:30:57,457
-What?
-Get out of that van!

1328
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:59,209
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

1329
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:02,838
Hey! Hey!

1330
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:10,053
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

1331
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:11,638
The windows!

1332
01:31:16,226 --> 01:31:18,979
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

1333
01:31:19,062 --> 01:31:20,480
It was never just a heist!

1334
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:44,338
Put the gun down!

1335
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:54,932
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

1336
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,200
We gotta set her down somewhere.

1337
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:45,691
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1338
01:32:45,774 --> 01:32:47,067
Playing Disintegration by the Cure.

1339
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:27,024
Call 911!

1340
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:47,127
It's okay.

1341
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:53,425
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

1342
01:33:56,094 --> 01:33:57,095
Scott?

1343
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,388
Paxton, you have to listen to me!

1344
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:29,086
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!

1345
01:34:29,127 --> 01:34:31,129
I am taking you back. To prison.

1346
01:34:31,213 --> 01:34:33,674
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1347
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:34,758
In the bug zapper. There...

1348
01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:40,013
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

1349
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:44,434
All units, we have a 2-36
in progress at 840 Winter Street.

1350
01:34:44,476 --> 01:34:45,727
-Cassie!
-That's my house.

1351
01:35:03,412 --> 01:35:04,621
Don't be scared.

1352
01:35:05,706 --> 01:35:06,957
Paxton, let me help!

1353
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,042
-Don't move.
-Let me help!

1354
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:11,211
-Maggie! What's going on?
-He's got Cassie!

1355
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:12,713
-Who's got Cassie, honey?
-That thing.

1356
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:14,214
-Thing?
-I don't know! I don't know!

1357
01:35:23,182 --> 01:35:24,766
Are you a monster?

1358
01:35:26,268 --> 01:35:28,228
Do I look like a monster?

1359
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:30,814
I want my daddy!

1360
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:33,817
I want your daddy, too.

1361
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:38,822
There you are.

1362
01:35:38,864 --> 01:35:40,115
Daddy, is that you?

1363
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:42,826
Hi, peanut.

1364
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,871
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1365
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:01,553
Now, where did you go, little guy?

1366
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,101
There you are.

1367
01:36:12,189 --> 01:36:13,482
Not just me!

1368
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:25,369
Damn it!

1369
01:36:26,203 --> 01:36:27,663
Go! Go!

1370
01:37:21,592 --> 01:37:23,177
Scotty needs us,
you know what I'm saying?

1371
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:24,928
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1372
01:37:27,806 --> 01:37:28,932
Back it up.

1373
01:37:29,016 --> 01:37:31,018
-Back it up, slow.
-Yeah.

1374
01:37:31,101 --> 01:37:32,519
-Back it up.
-Yeah.

1375
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:34,062
-Back it up.
-Okay.

1376
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:36,899
-We just back it up, okay?
-That's it.

1377
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,317
-Back it up.
-That's right.

1378
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,195
-Backin' up?
-Yep, just backin' up.

1379
01:37:41,278 --> 01:37:42,362
No, no. Just back it up.

1380
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:50,829
You insult me, Scott.

1381
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:59,129
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1382
01:38:01,048 --> 01:38:04,384
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

1383
01:38:06,803 --> 01:38:07,930
Yeah, I agree.

1384
01:38:29,618 --> 01:38:30,619
Cassie!

1385
01:38:37,835 --> 01:38:41,463
I'm gonna show you
just how insignificant you are.

1386
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:44,675
Cassie! I'm coming!

1387
01:38:57,855 --> 01:38:59,523
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1388
01:38:59,565 --> 01:39:02,192
I'm gonna destroy everything you love.

1389
01:39:04,027 --> 01:39:05,362
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1390
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:14,538
I can't break through.

1391
01:39:15,372 --> 01:39:17,666
It's titanium, you idiot!

1392
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:25,632
-Get her out of here.
-Come on.

1393
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:28,302
Sorry, sweetheart.

1394
01:39:28,385 --> 01:39:30,804
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

1395
01:39:30,888 --> 01:39:32,139
-You stay behind me, okay?
-Okay.

1396
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:33,223
Stay behind me.

1397
01:39:34,766 --> 01:39:37,728
I'm gonna have to shrink
between the molecules to get in there.

1398
01:39:37,769 --> 01:39:39,688
Get away from us!

1399
01:39:41,732 --> 01:39:42,733
Daddy, help!

1400
01:39:42,774 --> 01:39:44,193
I love you, Cassie.

1401
01:40:14,139 --> 01:40:15,349
Daddy, where are you?

1402
01:40:17,226 --> 01:40:19,144
You could go subatomic.

1403
01:40:19,228 --> 01:40:20,354
You could go subatomic.

1404
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:22,606
Oh, no.

1405
01:40:34,618 --> 01:40:37,287
You would enter a reality

1406
01:40:37,329 --> 01:40:41,083
where all concepts of time and space...

1407
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:45,838
All concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1408
01:40:47,047 --> 01:40:50,509
...all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1409
01:40:55,848 --> 01:40:57,933
Come back, Daddy!

1410
01:40:58,725 --> 01:41:05,274
...as you shrink for all eternity.

1411
01:41:06,859 --> 01:41:09,528
Everything that you know

1412
01:41:11,572 --> 01:41:13,198
and love,

1413
01:41:14,241 --> 01:41:16,159
gone forever.

1414
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:18,662
Daddy, where are you?

1415
01:41:36,346 --> 01:41:37,347
Where are you?

1416
01:41:40,309 --> 01:41:41,727
Where are you?

1417
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:44,605
-Daddy!
-Cassie.

1418
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:53,864
Come back, Daddy!

1419
01:41:58,202 --> 01:42:00,579
Do not screw with the regulator!

1420
01:42:31,401 --> 01:42:33,153
Daddy!

1421
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:37,824
I love you so much.

1422
01:42:38,534 --> 01:42:39,701
I love you, too.

1423
01:42:40,494 --> 01:42:41,537
So much.

1424
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:48,126
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1425
01:42:50,754 --> 01:42:51,839
Sorry.

1426
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:56,593
-Is she all right?
-Yeah, she's fine.

1427
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,763
Mommy!

1428
01:43:02,683 --> 01:43:04,184
She's fine, she's fine.

1429
01:43:13,652 --> 01:43:15,112
Scott, please.

1430
01:43:15,904 --> 01:43:17,781
You don't remember anything?

1431
01:43:17,865 --> 01:43:19,032
Hank. I don't.

1432
01:43:19,116 --> 01:43:21,368
There must be something else.

1433
01:43:23,328 --> 01:43:26,331
Well, I suppose the human mind

1434
01:43:26,415 --> 01:43:28,959
just can't comprehend the experience,

1435
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:32,379
but you made it.

1436
01:43:33,172 --> 01:43:34,798
You went in,

1437
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:37,885
and you got out.

1438
01:43:40,095 --> 01:43:41,555
It's amazing.

1439
01:43:42,389 --> 01:43:44,141
Scott,

1440
01:43:44,224 --> 01:43:45,934
I'll walk you out.

1441
01:43:50,105 --> 01:43:51,607
Get some rest.

1442
01:43:59,865 --> 01:44:02,117
Is it possible?

1443
01:44:20,135 --> 01:44:21,178
When did this happen?

1444
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:22,387
Nothing's happening.

1445
01:44:22,471 --> 01:44:24,681
Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

1446
01:44:24,765 --> 01:44:26,850
Well, if that's the case,

1447
01:44:26,892 --> 01:44:28,227
shoot me again.

1448
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:31,355
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1449
01:44:31,438 --> 01:44:33,357
I'm a little surprised myself.

1450
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,859
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

1451
01:44:35,901 --> 01:44:37,361
Really, Hope.

1452
01:44:38,195 --> 01:44:39,488
-Scott.
-Yeah?

1453
01:44:40,155 --> 01:44:41,823
-You're full of shit.
-Oh, yeah.

1454
01:44:43,325 --> 01:44:45,244
Scott, I met with my captain today.

1455
01:44:45,327 --> 01:44:47,871
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1456
01:44:48,664 --> 01:44:49,831
Something happened with the cameras.

1457
01:44:50,832 --> 01:44:53,001
Some circuits got fried.

1458
01:44:54,127 --> 01:44:56,380
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1459
01:44:56,463 --> 01:44:57,589
Really?

1460
01:44:57,673 --> 01:44:58,882
Well, yeah.

1461
01:45:00,968 --> 01:45:03,804
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1462
01:45:03,887 --> 01:45:05,889
Thank you, Paxton.

1463
01:45:05,931 --> 01:45:07,224
I'm blown away.

1464
01:45:08,183 --> 01:45:09,977
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1465
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,937
Well, that's my pleasure.

1466
01:45:13,397 --> 01:45:16,316
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1467
01:45:18,485 --> 01:45:19,903
-This is awkward.
-Yeah.

1468
01:45:19,987 --> 01:45:21,196
Yeah.

1469
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:23,323
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

1470
01:45:23,407 --> 01:45:24,783
-Oh, I know.
-What?

1471
01:45:24,867 --> 01:45:27,411
-I did my first cartwheel today.
-What?

1472
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:30,080
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1473
01:45:30,163 --> 01:45:31,582
But today was the magic day.

1474
01:45:31,665 --> 01:45:33,584
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1475
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:36,753
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.

1476
01:45:36,795 --> 01:45:38,422
-Yeah, it is.
-Yeah, it is.

1477
01:45:38,463 --> 01:45:40,591
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

1478
01:45:40,674 --> 01:45:41,717
Yeah, that's her.

1479
01:45:42,759 --> 01:45:44,219
Good boy.

1480
01:45:46,305 --> 01:45:48,807
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1481
01:45:51,935 --> 01:45:52,936
Sorry.

1482
01:45:54,605 --> 01:45:56,315
It's work.

1483
01:45:56,982 --> 01:45:58,233
Yeah.

1484
01:45:59,943 --> 01:46:00,944
All right.

1485
01:46:01,028 --> 01:46:02,779
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1486
01:46:02,863 --> 01:46:04,156
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1487
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:08,118
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1488
01:46:08,202 --> 01:46:09,870
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1489
01:46:09,953 --> 01:46:12,331
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1490
01:46:12,414 --> 01:46:14,625
And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.

1491
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:16,960
But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1492
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:19,713
But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1493
01:46:19,796 --> 01:46:21,965
-Luis.
-Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1494
01:46:22,007 --> 01:46:24,009
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1495
01:46:24,092 --> 01:46:26,053
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1496
01:46:26,136 --> 01:46:29,765
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1497
01:46:29,806 --> 01:46:32,226
"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1498
01:46:32,309 --> 01:46:33,977
"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1499
01:46:34,061 --> 01:46:35,312
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1500
01:46:35,395 --> 01:46:38,065
The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1501
01:46:38,148 --> 01:46:40,067
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1502
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:42,945
"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1503
01:46:42,986 --> 01:46:44,738
"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,

1504
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:45,822
"you know what I'm saying?"

1505
01:46:45,864 --> 01:46:47,366
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1506
01:46:47,449 --> 01:46:50,410
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1507
01:46:50,494 --> 01:46:51,870
"because he works with the Avengers."

1508
01:46:51,954 --> 01:46:53,247
Oh, no.

1509
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:55,749
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1510
01:46:55,832 --> 01:46:57,000
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1511
01:46:57,042 --> 01:46:59,086
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,

1512
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:00,337
"who's flashing his fresh tack,

1513
01:47:00,379 --> 01:47:02,923
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"

1514
01:47:03,006 --> 01:47:04,091
And she's like,

1515
01:47:04,174 --> 01:47:06,176
"Well, we got everything nowadays.
We got a guy who jumps.

1516
01:47:06,218 --> 01:47:08,345
"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1517
01:47:08,387 --> 01:47:10,097
"You gotta be more specific."

1518
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:12,015
And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1519
01:47:12,099 --> 01:47:13,267
And I'm, like, "Damn!"

1520
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:15,519
I got all nervous 'cause
I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1521
01:47:15,602 --> 01:47:16,687
So I asked Ignacio,

1522
01:47:16,728 --> 01:47:18,647
"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick

1523
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:21,108
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1524
01:47:21,191 --> 01:47:22,276
"that he's looking for him?"

1525
01:47:23,026 --> 01:47:25,487
And? What'd he say?

1526
01:47:28,866 --> 01:47:30,325
He said, "Yes."

1527
01:49:25,482 --> 01:49:27,693
There's something I want to show you.

1528
01:49:29,903 --> 01:49:33,156
I realized you can't destroy power.

1529
01:49:34,867 --> 01:49:38,787
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1530
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:47,671
This is an advanced prototype

1531
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:50,591
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1532
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:54,344
She never got to use it.

1533
01:49:55,345 --> 01:49:59,474
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1534
01:50:06,356 --> 01:50:08,692
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1535
01:50:15,532 --> 01:50:17,576
It's about damn time.

1536
01:56:18,061 --> 01:56:19,438
Hey, Cap!

1537
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:36,413
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

1538
01:56:36,455 --> 01:56:38,415
-If we call Tony...
-He won't believe us.

1539
01:56:38,457 --> 01:56:39,458
Even if he did...

1540
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:41,084
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1541
01:56:42,753 --> 01:56:44,213
We're on our own.

1542
01:56:45,714 --> 01:56:47,049
Maybe not.

1543
01:56:49,343 --> 01:56:50,594
I know a guy.
