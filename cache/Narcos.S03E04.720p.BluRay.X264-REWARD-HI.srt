Please, pay attention!

I need you to put your phones,
beepers and radios in the container.

(In English)
Is this necessary, Agent Peña?

5
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,204
- I'm afraid so, Captain.
- (In Spanish) Please, I'll take that.

6
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,998
(In English) One of my guys
says one of your guys

is working for the cartel.

8
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,713
- They have any proof?
- Can't say yet.

9
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,009
But this warrant will be hard to execute
if they're one step ahead.

10
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,764
It's just a precaution.

11
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,059
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Okay.

12

(In Spanish) For the next three hours,

13

- My colleagues and I will take the lead.
- And the target?

14
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,072
I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

15
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:01,705
We're advisors. We work together,
same as always. Credit's all yours.

16
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:12,383
Gentlemen, you heard!
I need you to be tight and right!

17
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,135
- Understood?
- (All) Yes, sir!

I wouldn't have come all the way
from Bogotáif it wasn't a big deal.

21
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,538
My men's safety,
that's what I care about.

22
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,000
I make the final call
if anything feels off.

23

You follow?

24
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,512
My kid gave it to me
right before I went out on this buy-bust.

25
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:02,474
Some Jamaican took a rip at me,
missed by that much, so...

26
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,228
I rub it for luck ever since.

27
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,385
(In Spanish)
So, what are we doing here?

28
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,681
We're arresting

Two years, more or less?

Less than ten percent. It's insane.
They don't have the manpower.

with a baby's bucket to try and stop it!

This is the right business.
I already know this, man.

No, man, what I'm saying is,

you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

And you're going to regret it.

You want some?

120
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,224
Amado, are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

121
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:51,146
No. No way.
Why betray? They want to get out.

122
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,109
I'm proposing that we start
something new, you and I.

123
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,530
Just imagine it,
you send it to me, I get it across.

124
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:05,577
In two years, we'll be flooding
this fucking shitty country.

125
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,831
Think about it, all right?
Think about it.

126
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,751
Just don't take too long,
because in six months,

127
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,420
I need to secure a new supply.

128
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,591
Hopefully, it'll be with you.

129

Hey...
Give it another once-over?

130

Okay.

(In Spanish) Thirty seconds.

Hey! Hey! You can't park there!

134
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:17,649
Damn truck. These fucking trucks
are always breaking down.

135
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,902
- You can't park here.
- Let me grab the cables and I'll move it.

136
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,654
Move the fucking truck!

Quickly! Move it!

What's going on?

146
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,993
Sit down, ladies.
Sit down, ladies, I won't say it again.

147
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,372
You can't come in here.
Get out.

148

He's fucking running!

Get up! Look at my face!

Let's go.

151

152
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,619
Did he contact anyone?

153
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,872
- No one, Colonel.
- No? All good?

154
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,793
Mrs. Rodríguez, I have a federal warrant
signed and executed by myself,

155
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,421
as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

156
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,385
The question is, will you cooperate?

157
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,390
(Moaning)

158
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,500
Are you all right?

159
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,044
Yes.

160
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,008
It's good here.

161
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,886
(Pager buzzes)

162
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,810
The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

163
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,107
Yeah. Okay.
We're done. I'm calling it.

164
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,654
I'm sorry, I thought we had something.

165
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,698
Welcome to my world.

166
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,745
Well, do what you need to wrap up,
have your men report back.

167
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,788
- Okay.
- Feistl, anything else?

168
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,332
- Ride to the airport?
- Sure.

169
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,264
(In Spanish) Look, when we get there,
I think it's better if I go in alone.

170
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,600
These people are angry.

171
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:44,064
What we're asking of them,
it's an insult on top of their grief.

172
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,610
You're different, Jorge Salcedo.

173
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,989
Different? How?

174
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,910
You're crippled.
You don't carry a gun.

175
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,624
Most people don't carry guns.

176
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,754
Yeah... but you're not most people.

177
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,133
And that's why it's so weird.
Interesting.

178
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,386
That you never carry a gun.

179
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,352
- I see. Why do you think that is?
- I don't know.

180
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,855
Maybe you're scared.

181
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,988
Fear... of what you could do with it.

182
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,160
That you've been walking around a killer
and never knew it.

183
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,184
Pedrito, go in the house!

184
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,898
Good afternoon, Mrs. Salazar.
Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

185
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:14,445
My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

186
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,574
Go right back to where you came from,

187
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,536
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

188
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,038
she can come looking for him.

189
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,790
I just came to talk.

190
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,168
If you don't like what I have to say,

191
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,336
I'll go back to Cali and deliver
whatever message you want.

192
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,547
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

193
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:39,053
Your boss murdered my son
to take up with his whore wife.

194
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,850
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

195
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,520
I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

196
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,315
And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.

197
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,567
Ha! Protecting?

198
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,196
Is that what they call it now?

199
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,740
And he will be protected as well.

200
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:03,870
And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

201
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,665
Ah, you promise?
How nice of you.

202
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,669
Who told you I would do that?

203
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:16,257
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

204
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,551
That bitch made her choice.

205
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,598
Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.

206
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,186
The next men who come...
won't be asking.

207
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,146
There will be war.

208
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,940
(Car approaches)

209
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,321
Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

210
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,203
(In English) If you don't mind, <i>Capitán,</i>
we need to stop by a friend's house.

211
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,457
Make a right here.

212
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,923
Nice neighbourhood.
Your friend's very wealthy.

213
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,635
He's a very fortunate man.

214
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,645
What is this?

215
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,857
My friend likes chickens.

216
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,324
- (In Spanish) Colonel Martínez.
- Captain.

217
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,037
- You know what's happening here?
- Yes, I think I know.

218
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,498
I'm giving you one chance

219
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,168
to do the right thing
and not fuck up this operation.

220
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,386
You think you're clever?

221
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,515
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogotá.

222
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,226
You're way out of line here, Hugo.

223
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,479
Perhaps.

224
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,161
He's here. We'll find him.

225
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,665
Watch him.

226
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,919
You got your kid's drawing?

227
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,758
I'm unarmed. I didn't come for a fight.

228
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,344
We'll send your fucking head
to Miguel in a fucking box.

229
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,138
- Walk, motherfucker.
- Let's go.

230
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,307
(Gerda) Duvan!

231
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,850
Duvan!

232
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,396
Bring out the car.

233
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,233
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

234
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,821
- Very good.
- Shut your fucking mouth or I kill her.

235
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,702
All right, my lady.
Make like a statue or I shoot your ass.

236
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,163
I'm getting in first, you hear?

237
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,956
Real still.

238
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:58,544
You're taking the boy.
What else do you want? Relax.

239
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,671
- Stop!
- Mama!

240
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,715
What else, motherfucker?

241
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,636
Fucking asshole!

242
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,388
(Muffled voices)

243
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,167
Fuck!

244
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,069
(Wood creaks)

245
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,318
(In Spanish) Drop the weapon.

246
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,241
Drop the weapon.

247
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,040
Don't shoot.

248
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,250
I'm a man of peace.

249
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,938
Let's go.

250
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,828
(Engine turns over)

251
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,206
Hey! Stop!

252
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,293
Colonel! Calderón took off.

253
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,045
- (In English) Fuck. We move fast.
- Okay.

254
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,677
- Do you have a phone in there?
- Yes, in there.

255
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,314
They got Gilberto and they're moving
towards the aerial base.

256
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,274
The whole workforce is on this.

257
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:54,155
'They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?'

258
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,842
(In Spanish) Move it, asshole!

259
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,477
They'll try to take us on the road.

260
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,187
Guns out!

261
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,733
(Phone rings)

262
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,072
Hello?

263
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,115
(Cordova) 'Don Miguel...

264
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,409
- 'Something's happened.'
- What happened?

265
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:45,706
I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him. They got your brother.

266
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:21,534
(Cordova over radio)
'We've got a visual.'

267
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,913
Surround him in the market!

268
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,217
(Calderón) Tail him!

269
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,562
Look! There he goes! Faster!

270
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,149
Let's get him on the next turn!

271
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,365
Hold your fire!

272
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,291
Driver! Put your hands
where I can see them!

273
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,501
Driver!

274
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,338
Out further!

275
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,924
Further!

276
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,728
Get out. Open the back.

277
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,814
- Okay. Let me get the keys.
- Open it.

278
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,289
- Open it!
- (In English) Okay. All right. Settle.

279
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,638
Those American sons of bitches tricked us.
We've got the wrong fucking truck!

280
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,848
They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

281
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,810
I took care of security.

282
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:15,439
Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

283
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,360
Send Salcedo's beeper
another message.

284
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,198
(Knock on door)

285
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,206
(Knock)

286
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,962
(Man) Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!

287
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,008
Come in.

288
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,263
- Nicolas.
- Uncle.

289
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,395
- Is it true?
- Yes.

290
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,357
They got him.

291
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,110
Nicolas, why don't you go home
and wait there?

292
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,404
Once something happens, I'll call you.

293
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,531
No, sir, I have to help.

294
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,159
Come.

295
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:13,330
You know your dad doesn't
want you mixed up in this.

296
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,458
We have to have faith that
your dad won't be taken out of Cali.

297
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:20,588
And if he is? Why did we waste
all that money on my education?

298
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,883
I'm a lawyer.
I'm taking the first flight to Bogotá.

299
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,260
I want to help him.

300
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,804
Let's hope that's not necessary.

301
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,739
(In English) Fuck.

302
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,199
Wait here.

303
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:41,627
- (Van Ness) 'Hey, boss. What's up?'
- There's cops surrounding the plane.

304
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,546
'Cops? Good ones?'

305
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,174
I don't think so.

306
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,888
Colonel Martínez...
Sir, please don't come any closer.

307
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:57,601
Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

308
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,439
You know it.
And that means prison.

309
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,196
What you do today...

310
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,533
...what you do this moment...

311
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,996
...defines you
for the rest of your lives.

312
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,837
Are you police or not?

313
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,264
That's better.

314
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,723
(In English) Home stretch.

315
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,034
(Beeping)

316
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,538
(In Spanish) Shit!

317
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,040
(Phone rings)

318
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,252
(Salcedo) 'What's up? It's me.'

319
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,130
- About fucking time.
- 'I was out of range.'

320
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,091
'They arrested Gilberto.'

321
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:57,471
- What?
- They got him, Jorge. They got Gilberto.

322
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,602
- You were monitoring the raid.
- 'But they never mentioned Gilberto's name.'

323
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,564
(Salcedo) Even so, we checked
all the tapes. It's impossible.

324
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,777
It doesn't make sense!

325
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,488
I just don't understand!

326
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,700
Brother... they got him.
They took him away.

327
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,245
We got beat.

328
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,372
Get back here quick.

329
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,624
(Dialling tone)

330
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,880
Hasta la vista, baby. Ciao.

331
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,355
Take that.

332
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,492
Five seconds to take photos, no more.

333
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,536
Congratulations.

334
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,164
But you know this won't hold up.

335
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,917
You're fucking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

336
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,882
Smile, Gilberto.
You're about to be on TV.

337
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,428
This way, Mr. Rodríguez!

338
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,431
Mr. Rodríguez, do you have a response
to the charges against you?

339
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,225
Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

340
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,643
Enough. Let's go.

341
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:30,981
Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodríguez.

342
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,490
(Peña in English) 'For those of us
who thought the surrender was bullshit,

343
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:44,453
'Gilberto's arrest proved
that these guys could be caught.

344
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,207
'For the people who thought the surrender
was the only way to avoid violence,

345
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,500
'it was the beginning of a nightmare.

346
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:54,796
'The first shot in a war
to bring down another cartel.

347
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:58,842
'But whatever side you fell on,
one thing was clear:

348
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,971
'Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
came as a surprise to everybody.

349
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,059
'Especially him.'

350
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,534
(Man) Don Gilberto.

351
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,173
(Man) Hey, congrats.

352
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,592
Congratulations. Good work.

353
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,470
No, where you going?
Come on, we want to toast you!

354
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,264
Start without me.

355
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,689
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Big day.

356
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,734
- Quite a notch on your belt.
- It was strong intel, sir...

357
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,611
Do you know how much work
you torched?

358
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:03,156
The people want to see the godfathers
in handcuffs and that's what they'll get.

359
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:07,119
- Front page of every newspaper tomorrow.
- Colombians may not feel that way.

360
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,123
Let's go find out.

361
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,293
Get changed.

362
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,721
- (In Spanish) My love!
- Mummy!

363
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,725
Mummy.

364
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,102
- Are you hungry? No?
- No.

365
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:37,024
How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.

366
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,280
Come on.
Mum'll read you a story in a bit.

367
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,824
(María) Go. I'll be right there.

368
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,411
Thanks for showing up, Jorge.

369
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,501
Sir, we don't know
how much the DEA knows.

370
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,547
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

371
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,135
I'll stay here for now.

372
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,142
We all need to talk.

373
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:19,858
What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorises the police...

374
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:23,820
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

375
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,574
This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

376
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,076
of the United States.

377
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,995
The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,
was National Police.

378
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,625
The transport was by our police.
The booking was by our police.

379
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,169
So a war started by National Police?

380
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,505
Look, as Attorney General,

381
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:47,094
my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

382
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,721
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela

383
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:54,267
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

384
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:57,270
The President of Colombia,
Ernesto Samper.

385
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,237
I hate to be late to a good debate.

386
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,990
You know us, might as well try
to smooth rough water with a hammer.

387
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:17,249
I've been apprised by Minister Botero
about our newly-incarcerated Cali godfather.

388
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:21,211
- With all due respect, Mr. President...
- Go ahead, Miguel.

389
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:26,133
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

390
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,429
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela.

391
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:37,727
Colombia is a nation of laws.
Not of concessions.

392
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,691
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organisation in the world,

393
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,527
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

394
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,743
Mr. Rodríguez is entitled to the same
due process as any Colombian citizen.

395
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,288
Let's see where due process gets him.

396
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,417
For now...

397
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,837
...his arrest stands.

398
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,174
Thank you, gentlemen.

399
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,760
(In English) Fuckin' A.

400
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,486
(In Spanish) Thank you very much.

401
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,563
We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

402
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,106
Relax, Dad.

403
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:09,236
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

404
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:17,202
Besides, I thought
you could use a friendly face.

405
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:22,374
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

406
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,506
How's it look?

407
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,426
The warrants are old.

408
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,180
- Invalid?
- Vulnerable.

409
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,060
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00pm
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

410
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,229
8:00am, latest, I'm out.

411
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,149
Dad, you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

412
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:53,238
And he'll hold you here in Bogotá
due to the conspiracy charge.

413
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:58,785
I don't get it.
This is a mistake, a blunder.

414
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,539
A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

415
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,166
That's what you want to believe.

416
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,128
But if that was the case,
you'd be out by now.

417
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:13,383
- Dad, this is real.
- No, money is real!

418
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,510
What about all I've paid?

419
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,098
Sons of bitches can't leave me
confined here!

420
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,896
How the fuck did they surprise us
like that, gentlemen?

421
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,565
It was Calderón.

422
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,862
Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.

423
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:38,325
- And his fucking family and his children.
- David, please.

424
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,661
Obviously, there's responsibility
on all sides.

425
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:45,957
- Cordova...
- Sir, just as we realised...

426
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,626
By the time you realised,

427
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:52,839
Colonel Martínez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

428
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,717
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

429
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:59,012
When it comes to the DEA,
Cordova counts on me.

430
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:05,268
Wait. Cordova, you're my brother's
personal head of security.

431
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:10,649
- Yes, sir.
- Then you should've been there.

432
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,403
Your men should've been there.

433
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,950
Your guards were fooled
by a fucking chicken truck!

434
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,163
I want to know what the fuck
is happening here.

435
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:31,294
Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us is safe.

436
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,464
Not your families...

437
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,552
...and not mine.

438
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,805
My family.

439
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,689
Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,
Defence Minister Botero.

440
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,276
(In English)
Today marks an important beginning,

441
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:57,320
an important victory.

442
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,990
Because of the success
of our Colombian-American operation,

443
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,660
the Cali cartel is on the run.

444
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:08,248
And with the continued support
of the Colombian National Police,

445
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:13,086
I promise you
the other three godfathers will fall.

446
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,006
'Questions?'

447
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,427
That's as much recognition
as we can hope for, right?

448
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,475
None at all? Smart move.

449
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,561
Keep his face all over this
while we're closing in.

450
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,022
Kiss-ass.

451
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,359
Want some?

452
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,945
No, I'm moving tables.

453
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,405
Oh, boy.

454
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:45,285
Oh, God.
Can't believe you're eating that shit.

455
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:15,106
(Knock on door)

456
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,527
- (Peña in Spanish) Colonel, please.
- Thanks.

457
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,240
(In English) Have a drink with me.

458
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,867
(Peña sighs)

459
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,828
Tonight, we celebrate.

460
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,081
Tomorrow, we go back to work.

461
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,837
Well, not for me.

462
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,882
(In Spanish)
What are you talking about?

463
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:44,969
(In English) You remember those papers
that were seized by your men in Cali?

464
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,097
Yeah, we never saw those.

465
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,934
Apparently, Vargas did.

466
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,854
There was a list of cops who've
been accepting money from Cali.

467
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:59,359
One name he was eager
to share: mine.

468
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,906
Those son of a bitches
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.

469
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:09,118
Exactly. It sends a message
to any cop who wants to try what we did.

470
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,839
(In Spanish)
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

471
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,718
Good luck.

472
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,221
Colonel...

473
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,933
I'm sorry.

474
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:43,736
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

475
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,867
You did everything right, Peña.

476
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:51,202
But now you're all alone.

477
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,915
(In English) Take care.

478
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,194
We need to talk about your security.

479
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,407
Let me be in charge.

480
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,785
I'll protect you, Dad.

481
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:38,625
Now's not the time for a change.

482
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,717
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

483
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,223
What if he doesn't come back?

484
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,740
(Paola) Jorge?

485
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,241
Jorge.

486
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,344
- They got Gilberto.
- (Pacho) 'I don't understand.

487
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,472
I thought Gilberto had this
all under control.

488
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,265
'So did I.'

489
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:40,937
- And what now?
- 'This could get messy.

490
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:46,025
'Stay where you are.
Right now, we look out for ourselves.

491
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,695
'Pacho... be smart.'

492
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,994
For now, we wait.
You stay there a while longer.

493
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,746
We have to keep everything running.

494
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:05,586
'The health of the business has never
been more important. Understand?'

495
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,130
Yes. Of course.

496
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,427
You listening to me, motherfucker?

497
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,389
(In English) Hey, listen, buddy,
I don't speak Spanish.

498
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,684
No speak Spanish.

499
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:24,022
Okay. Have a nice day.

500
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,513
Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?

501
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,265
The Jurado tapes.

502
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,144
We probably shouldn't call them that
because they're not legal, per se.

503
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,188
I want all of them.

504
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,228
(♪ "Adiós" playing)
