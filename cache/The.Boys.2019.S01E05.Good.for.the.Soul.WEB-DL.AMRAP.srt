1
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,659
Hey, baby.

2
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,134
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:21,288
Where have you been?
It's been days.

4
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,157
Yeah. I've been
handling business.

5
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:24,504
It's okay now, it's okay.

6
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:27,168
You said I had to hide, you said
we were in trouble and...

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,668
You know, I think, I think
I got it worked out.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,710
I think I have
some-some good news.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,216
Good news?

10
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:39,547
Stillwell. She's open
to us going public.

11
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:42,005
Don't you lie to me.

12
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,846
Hand on a Bible.

13
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:49,443
Yeah. But, listen,

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,070
for us to go public,
you have to come clean with me.

15
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,739
Like, I have to know
who you told about Compound V.

16
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:02,794
Hey, come on.

17
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,419
This is, this is you and me.

18
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:12,087
I mean, we're Bonnie and Clyde.

19
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:14,918
Ride or die, right?

20
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,388
I...

21
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,258
Oh, shit.

22
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:29,193
I told these guys,

23
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:32,818
you were running the V
down near the Noodle Palace.

24
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:36,187
I'm so sorry, baby.

25
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:37,525
I had to. I...

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,070
Why?

27
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:42,663
What do they have on you?

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,290
I don't know their names,

29
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,748
but there was this British guy,

30
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:50,578
dark hair, real smug asshole.

31
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:53,004
Buzz cut French guy,
big black guy with a goatee,

32
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:54,424
and a skinny white kid.

33
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:58,012
I think they were all
working together. Mm-hmm.

34
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:03,887
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- Nah.

35
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:05,219
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

36
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:06,934
- I fucked up so bad.
- It's all right.

37
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,442
You know what I was
thinking about

38
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,648
on my run over here?

39
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,687
Our first date.

40
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:20,324
Most first dates

41
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:23,323
order, like, a scallop

42
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,366
and a bottle of water.

43
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,293
But you...

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,340
...got a dark beer,

45
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:35,997
a New York strip,

46
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:40,255
and chocolate chip cheesecake.

47
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,089
I remember thinking,

48
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,224
"Here's someone

49
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:46,721
who isn't afraid to be happy."

50
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,725
And I fell for you,
right then and there.

51
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:58,153
I love you.

52
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:02,152
I love you, too.

53
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,839
Why?

54
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:41,861
Well?

55
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,112
Heroin overdose.

56
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:50,081
I'm sorry to hear that.

57
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,289
And the V?

58
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:53,288
- She told some guys about it.
- No, no.

59
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,330
I mean you.

60
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:00,172
Come on, A-Train.

61
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:02,172
You've been shooting it up
for weeks.

62
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:03,974
You really think
I wouldn't notice?

63
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:07,138
I'm done, man.

64
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,928
Nah, I'm fucking,
I'm fucking done.

65
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,761
- Cold turkey.
- Really?

66
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:12,176
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

67
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,564
Good.

68
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:17,562
Yeah.

69
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,935
You know,

70
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:22,442
you really screwed up, kiddo.

71
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:26,611
But you did the right thing
coming to me,

72
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:27,945
and I'm proud of you.

73
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,160
Thanks, Homelander,

74
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:32,911
for giving me the chance.

75
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,793
I appreciate it.

76
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,840
Hey. Come on.

77
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,625
I love you.

78
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:46,013
We're family.

79
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,760
I'll always be
watching over you.

80
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,387
Always.

81
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:57,232
Attaboy.

82
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,099
Oh, and the misplaced
Asian girl?

83
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:00,356
I'll find her.

84
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,900
Fuck.

85
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:19,168
Le poulet.

86
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,708
Massage the bird
with olive oil,

87
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:23,842
then a sprinkle
of salt and pepper,

88
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,799
then I bake.

89
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,549
Basting every 20 minutes
to keep it from drying out

90
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,893
is very important.

91
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:37,181
Till it's crisp,
but not too crunchy.

92
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,482
And voilà.

93
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,243
I think you understand me.

94
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:53,663
It's in your eyes.

95
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,291
Can you speak?

96
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:02,172
Tell me what you know,
mon coeur.

97
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,379
So we can find these fuckers

98
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,171
who did this to you,

99
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,295
so I can get you back home.

100
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,879
I like this outfit.
You know, the other one had...

101
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:50,092
Oh, my God.

102
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:51,932
The other one had kind of
like a, you know,

103
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,757
a Nikki Minaj thing going on.

104
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,552
Oh, yeah, the other one sucks.

105
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,256
They're only letting me
wear this one

106
00:06:57,306 --> 00:07:00,096
because, apparently,
it's family friendly.

107
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:02,232
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

108
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:04,099
You know,
I'm surprised you came.

109
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:07,016
I seem to remember
you inviting me?

110
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,936
No, I mean,
I'm-I'm glad you came.

111
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:10,994
You just... I don't know,

112
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:14,868
you don't really strike me
as the religious type.

113
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:18,447
Well, yeah, lapsed, but I served
my time in Sunday school.

114
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:20,704
- Hmm.
- Hey, Starlight.

115
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:21,866
Hi.

116
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:24,464
Okay, so, do you know
everybody here,

117
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,130
or just, like, 99.9%?

118
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:28,208
No. My mom and I, um,

119
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:31,923
we would drive coast to coast
in her brown Honda Civic,

120
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,835
just doing the whole
Christian Circuit thing.

121
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:36,894
You know, Power Fest,
Capes for Christ,

122
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:38,009
Believe Expo.

123
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:40,718
We wore

124
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:43,556
the tires off of that car.
These people are like

125
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:45,192
family to me.

126
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:48,569
After everything
that's happened,

127
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:50,857
it's actually...

128
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:52,951
it's really nice
to see them again.

129
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:57,198
- Sweetheart.
- Mom! Hi.

130
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,331
Mm.

131
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,761
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it was a nightmare.

132
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:02,245
I think we sat on the runway
for 45 minutes,

133
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,667
and then there was all the,
you know, Flight 37 stuff.

134
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:08,087
But a Xanax and a couple
of Pinot Grigio later,

135
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:10,167
here I am.

136
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:12,592
Oh, hello. Uh, do you want
a autograph?

137
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,221
H-Honey, give him an autograph.

138
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:16,508
Oh, no, no. We...
I mean, I know her.

139
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,012
- I mean, I don't...
- Yeah.

140
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:19,406
- We know each other. Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,850
- Yeah.
- Oh. Do you work at Vought?

142
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,059
No. No, no, no.

143
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,809
Mom, this is, this is Hughie.

144
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:27,441
He's... uh, he's a friend.

145
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:31,107
- Hi.
- Uh, how nice.

146
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,400
Starlight. You hydrating?

147
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:35,404
Hey, Donna.

148
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:37,465
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it-it was perfect in every w...

149
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:40,489
You have that "Teen Roundtable"
in about 15, are you ready?

150
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:41,845
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, she was born ready.

151
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,119
I should know, I was there.

152
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,502
Great.

153
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:47,368
Um, do you want to come?

154
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,706
Uh... You know what?
I'll let you go ahead.

155
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:51,882
Go, uh, go roundtable
those teens.

156
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,090
- Mm.
- We'll catch up later?

157
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,130
Yeah, sure.

158
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,931
So, Jesus...

159
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:05,273
Jesus said, "Hey, bro.

160
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:07,639
"Hey, bro, bring it in.

161
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:10,436
"You shouldn't need proof.

162
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:12,821
"You should just

163
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:15,148
"believe because I say so,

164
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:17,244
"because you have

165
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,319
faith."

166
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:21,874
"People who have faith,

167
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,619
those are my peeps, y'all."
That's what Jesus said.

168
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:28,667
But I am gonna ask you
one question...

169
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:30,627
Two twats at every entrance,

170
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,627
armed to holy hell. In church.

171
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,050
Well, that's America for you,

172
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,338
isn't it?

173
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,381
And God's watching
from up above.

174
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,175
Right there.

175
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,889
Over there.

176
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,059
Yeah.

177
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:46,596
Security's tighter
than a choir boy's asshole.

178
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,602
So let me ask you something:

179
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:51,694
Why could Jesus walk on water?

180
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,400
Why does Homelander fly?

181
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:59,738
How about A-Train, why does he
get to run the way he runs?

182
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:09,869
Or how do I get to hold
the whole world

183
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,785
in my loving embrace?

184
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,955
Why were we chosen?

185
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:18,924
Because of the Lord.

186
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:22,846
Because we were born
with his power.

187
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:25,306
Because we believe!

188
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,854
- We believe.
- $15,000

189
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:33,404
for an exclusive
VIP experience with Ezekiel.

190
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:34,608
Seriously?

191
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:37,318
There's not an easier,
cheaper way

192
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,899
for us to get to him?

193
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:43,275
We ain't getting to Ezekiel.
You are.

194
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:45,333
- I am?
- Whoa, whoa, wait. What?

195
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,303
- Well, Starlight's one of the headliners, right?
- Wait.

196
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,787
- She'll get you in.
- Whoa.

197
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,959
Look, we've only been on, like,
a date and a half, okay?

198
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,039
I can't just ask her
for a Diamond Club Pass.

199
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:56,424
What's the matter? You worried

200
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:58,481
your fake Supe girlfriend's
gonna think you're using her?

201
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,505
Okay, then what?

202
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:03,009
I just go up to Ezekiel,
"Hey, man. What's up with you

203
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,851
smuggling blue dope
into Chinatown basements?"

204
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:07,177
Yeah, pretty much.
Once you show him this.

205
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:10,774
Jesus.

206
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:14,688
This is from that club
you took me to?

207
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,749
You remembered our first
night together. I'm touched.

208
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:19,233
Okay, why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this plan?

209
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:21,146
This kid needs
to be trained up, Butcher.

210
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,664
Yeah. Yeah, what he said.

211
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,527
I-I don't know how
to blackmail anybody.

212
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:28,374
Hughie, you've done a murder.

213
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,040
Comparatively speaking,
this will be a piece of cake.

214
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,799
I know. I know.

215
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:40,207
We're here today

216
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,965
to remember the victims

217
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,257
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37.

218
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:48,181
123 brave souls lost
in an instant,

219
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:50,721
in a senseless act of violence.

220
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:55,975
Carolyn Kozinsky,

221
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:59,071
a preschool teacher from Skokie.

222
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:01,227
Dr. Julien Barro,

223
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:04,026
an esteemed French neurosurgeon.

224
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:12,081
Susan Lopez from Evanston

225
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,500
and her daughter Maya.

226
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:22,802
Samuel Brown,
a teacher of physics

227
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,009
from Los Angeles.

228
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:31,176
We are all truly sorry
for your loss.

229
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:37,443
Where'd you go?

230
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,019
The only thing I hate more
than blubbering people

231
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:42,985
- are boring speeches.
- Right.

232
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:45,066
You remember that nutjob

233
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,822
in Albany last year?

234
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:51,624
Killed his wife,
and he-he came out of the house

235
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,200
with a gun at his
daughter's head.

236
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:55,616
Remember that?

237
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:59,254
Cops pissing their pants,
didn't know what to do.

238
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,882
And then you, you...

239
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:05,261
you step up, very calmly,

240
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:08,178
ask for the sergeant's Bic pen
and fling it

241
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:11,968
26 yards,

242
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:14,684
right into
the asshole's eyeball.

243
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,813
- Dead shot, dead shooter.
- What's your point?

244
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:21,444
My point is that
you took action.

245
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,322
That's what I love
about you, Maeve.

246
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,242
Look, Maeve, nobody wanted

247
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:34,703
that airplane to go down
the way it did, of course not.

248
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:38,285
And now...

249
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,751
we got to make the best of it.

250
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,632
Otherwise...

251
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,089
Well, otherwise,
it was all for nothing.

252
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:55,063
What did I tell you
about boring speeches?

253
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:06,111
Mom, when did that happen?

254
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,231
What are you talking about?
That's always been there.

255
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,910
I know what
you're all thinking,

256
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:22,625
"Holy mackerel, Starlight?
From The Seven? Here with us?"

257
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,797
Well, I knew her
when she was still

258
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:26,336
in pigtails and braces

259
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,169
and she'd sit right
where you're sitting.

260
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,375
So don't be shy.

261
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:30,634
You ask what's on your mind.

262
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:32,385
Starlight is here for you.

263
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,562
Yeah?

264
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,727
I have this friend
from my soccer team, Sunji,

265
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,307
she's Hindu.

266
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:44,062
I know it's kind of
my responsibility, I guess,

267
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,476
to get her to accept Jesus,

268
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:48,824
but it feels weird to me.

269
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,990
Well, Jesus also says

270
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,449
to love your neighbor.

271
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,450
But if you love your neighbor,

272
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:57,372
don't you want to save them
from damnation?

273
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,700
You have to look at it
as good news.

274
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:01,916
You have a chance
to help your friend

275
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:04,787
find eternal life, right?

276
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:07,088
Oh, yes.

277
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:09,419
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

278
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:10,514
Well, yeah.

279
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,259
Yeah, I was with Drummer Boy
for a while,

280
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,340
for almost a year.

281
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,095
Yeah?

282
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:19,308
Um...

283
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:22,229
Did you have...

284
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,189
sex with him?

285
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:29,028
Well, I...

286
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,241
...you know, I think,
I think everyone hopes

287
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,660
that their first is the one.

288
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,619
And... it's private, but...

289
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,464
I'm a virgin.

290
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,920
Yeah, I'm...

291
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:52,761
saving myself for my
future husband.

292
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,299
See? Hebrews 13:4.

293
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:57,263
"Let the bed be undefiled,

294
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,814
for God will judge
the sexually immoral."

295
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:01,598
Okay.

296
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:05,151
I think we have time
for a few more.

297
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:07,107
I'm-I'm not really sure what
you're saying, son.

298
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:09,357
I'm saying if there is some
geezer up there

299
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,569
with a big white beard,

300
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,359
he's a world heavyweight cunt.

301
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,452
- What?
- I-I'm sorry, did you

302
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,737
just call God a C-word?

303
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,217
Yeah. He's got a hard-on
for mass murder

304
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,451
and giving kids cancer,
and his big old answer

305
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,163
to the existential clusterfuck
that is humanity

306
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:25,535
is to nail his own
bleeding son to a plank.

307
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:26,792
That is a cunt move.

308
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,269
Come on, even you got to agree
with me there.

309
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:29,562
- Hey, hey, hey, please...
- We should lob

310
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,397
a fucking nuke at him,
get it over and done with.

311
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:34,881
- You know what I'm saying?
- We're sorry, sir. We apologize. My man...

312
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:36,360
All right.
Good talk. Think about it.

313
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:38,684
- I'm here all day, all right?
- You mind

314
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,031
piping it down
just a little bit? Huh?

315
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:41,407
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to offend

316
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,681
your inner black Baptist mum
shouting "Praise the Lord."

317
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:45,305
Fuck you, I'm Episcopalian.

318
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:46,954
And there's nothing wrong
with having a little church

319
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:48,518
up in you, you know?

320
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:50,943
Said the bishop to the nun.
What about you, Hughie?

321
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:53,362
You believe in God?

322
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:54,611
I mean, I don't know.

323
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,073
- What? Come off it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

324
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:59,175
I don't think it's Morgan
Freeman up there or anything,

325
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,619
but it can't all be
random chaos.

326
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,221
So you think that
what happened to Robert

327
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:04,597
was some kind of
divine intervention?

328
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,331
- Is that what you're saying?
- Come on, Butcher.

329
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Hang about. Hello?

330
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,974
So what were
you supposed to say?

331
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:17,546
"Yes, I've had premarital sex,
go nuts."

332
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:21,762
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't
supposed to lie to them, Mom.

333
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,555
Aw, baby.

334
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:26,268
You're Starlight of The Seven.

335
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:29,019
Millions of kids are looking up
to you now.

336
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:30,982
You're a shining light to them.

337
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:32,862
How am I supposed
to live up to that?

338
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:35,899
Because that's the way
God made you.

339
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,664
You're a miracle.
You're my miracle.

340
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:42,911
Hey... hey, you two.
How's it going?

341
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:45,251
You know what?
I'll, I'll catch up.

342
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,537
- You sure?
- Don't worry, I'll be right there.

343
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,210
Mm-hmm.

344
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:51,539
Keep an eye on the lad,
all right?

345
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,634
Where the fuck are you going?

346
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:56,301
Just do it.

347
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:57,509
Yeah.

348
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,509
- You okay?
- Fine.

349
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:04,933
It's just... this place isn't
what I remember.

350
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:09,015
Hey...

351
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:20,488
Hughie?

352
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,870
Hey, can I ask you something?

353
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:26,748
Anything.

354
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,406
Is there any way you could
hook me up with one of those

355
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,246
Diamond Club Passes?

356
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,251
You know, to-to see Ezekiel?

357
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,883
I mean, I couldn't get one
unless I robbed a bank.

358
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,710
But... you know.

359
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:39,586
Ezekiel?

360
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:42,552
Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay.

361
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:45,854
Confession time. My dad is,
like, Ezekiel's number one fan.

362
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:48,479
Hmm.

363
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:50,806
So what do you think?

364
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:52,812
Pull a few strings, you know?

365
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:54,524
Hook me up with some tickets?

366
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:59,939
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:03,026
Sure, of course.

368
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:07,083
- It's the least I can do.
- Thank you.

369
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:15,417
Good to see you!

370
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,050
Thanks, guys. Oh!
How are you, girls?

371
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,629
Hey, pal, how are you?
How are you?

372
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,513
Great, thanks for coming along.

373
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,390
- God bless you guys!
- Thanks!

374
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:27,057
God bless you one and all!

375
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:30,677
Take care now.
Keep believing, ha-ha.

376
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:32,135
Grab Madelyn.

377
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:34,246
I need to talk to her about
these fucking talking points.

378
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,320
Um... uh...

379
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,668
Ms. Stillwell isn't here today.
I thought that you knew that.

380
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,402
But I'm here to help you
with anything,

381
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:43,454
I'll go through the talk...

382
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:47,327
Ashley?

383
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:52,867
Where is she?

384
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,684
What are you doing here?

385
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:06,678
Skipping work now?

386
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:10,269
I am taking Teddy
to the pediatrician.

387
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:11,556
Maybe reschedule it.

388
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,939
I've already rescheduled
three times.

389
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:15,307
What is the emergency?

390
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:17,403
My speech.

391
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,729
- Your speech?
- Yes. My speech.

392
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:20,533
It reads like corporate
fucking mayonnaise.

393
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:24,947
We're talking Believe here.
These are my people.

394
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:27,068
But you're not just
talking to them.

395
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:29,485
Every dove and Democrat
in Congress

396
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,494
is going to be
watching you on CNN.

397
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:32,930
- You need to appear moderate...
- No.

398
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,214
- Humble.
- No!

399
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:37,537
You... There is
an opportunity here.

400
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:41,004
People are scared.
They don't trust Washington

401
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:44,295
or the coastal elite,
and they hate foreigners.

402
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,550
What they want is a little
John Wayne frontier justice.

403
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:51,465
And that is what I do.

404
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:59,726
Don't forget... it was me that
saved that Flight 37 thing.

405
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:02,572
I turned that into a win.
For us.

406
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,859
You're really gonna talk to me
about "saving" Flight 37? Ha-ha.

407
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,624
Well, why wouldn't I?

408
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:11,736
Look, can I please just
talk to you later?

409
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:12,954
The speech is perfect.

410
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:15,084
- Trust me.
- Trust you.

411
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:17,041
Okay.
That's what you always say.

412
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:18,559
- Come here.
- You're not even fucking listening to me.

413
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,713
You're so full of shit!

414
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,501
You say you want my input,

415
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:22,594
but you don't.

416
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,589
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

417
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:28,471
- And you never did.
- I do. Can we please just talk later?

418
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,770
Why? You gonna run off
and play "strong single mom"?

419
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,806
Please...

420
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:39,191
That baby is an accessory.

421
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,275
We need boundaries.

422
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,429
Hey, Billy.

423
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,014
Rachel.

424
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:21,266
Just took a lovely little stroll
around St. John's.

425
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:24,732
And you'll never guess
what I happened across.

426
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,277
Who told you?

427
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,860
Well, I'll tell you who didn't
fucking tell me.

428
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,446
Me own fucking sister-in-law.

429
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,831
Would you like some tea?

430
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,538
I got the English stuff.

431
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,286
When'd you do it?

432
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:46,674
Last Sunday.

433
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:47,963
We used your last name.

434
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:49,376
We said "beloved wife."

435
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,554
You buried an empty
fucking coffin?

436
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:54,803
We didn't bury anything.
Just, um, a headstone.

437
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,574
Well, that's a sick fucking joke
then, isn't it?

438
00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:59,848
And you're wondering why we
didn't tell you.

439
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:01,982
Look...

440
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,770
my mom's getting old.

441
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:06,824
She just wants a place to talk
to her daughter.

442
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:08,858
Yeah, well, she's talking
to dirt, isn't she?

443
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:11,071
- It's something.
- No.

444
00:23:11,112 --> 00:23:12,492
It's fucking nothing.

445
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,280
It's nothing, 'cause there's
nothing fucking down there.

446
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:18,115
And for all you know, Rebecca's
still out there somewhere,

447
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,951
and you put up
a fucking headstone.

448
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:20,956
Stop!

449
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:23,247
You need to stop.

450
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,171
It has been eight years since
she's been missing.

451
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,670
The cops never found anything.
You never found anything.

452
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,175
She's not alive.

453
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:36,427
She got killed
or she killed herself.

454
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:38,141
You watch your fucking mouth.

455
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:42,311
You're not the only one
whose life was ruined.

456
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:45,522
She is my sister,
and I love her.

457
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:46,733
But she's gone.

458
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:51,987
We need this to be over.

459
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,590
Ah!

460
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:11,421
Oh, Popclaw.

461
00:24:11,464 --> 00:24:15,014
You got the right
to remain silent, bitch.

462
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:17,931
I did not kill your partner.

463
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,430
And I did not kill
Dr. Robinson.

464
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:21,563
I wouldn't lie to you.

465
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,389
I love you, baby.

466
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:26,024
Love is just another lie,
Donovan.

467
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:29,522
- You must think I'm stupid.
- No.

468
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:32,645
But as you can see,

469
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:35,954
I'm pretty sharp.

470
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:40,448
Y-Yeah, you've got talent.

471
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,880
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

472
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:58,472
Oh! Yeah, say it.

473
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:02,561
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

474
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:07,188
I'm a filthy pig...

475
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:11,323
Hold up. Easy.

476
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:13,397
Easy does it.
We ain't here to hurt you.

477
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:16,453
Who are you?

478
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,669
This guy's got 34 addresses

479
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:34,671
and at least a dozen aliases.

480
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:36,924
So, who the hell is he?

481
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:40,006
Something we're running down
on our own.

482
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,972
Uh, since when do you guys
run down stuff alone?

483
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,144
- Trevor...
- Yeah?

484
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:45,602
Shut up.

485
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:56,689
- Excuse me.
- Hughie.

486
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:59,355
Right?
You're Starlight's friend.

487
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:00,485
She got you in here.

488
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:02,951
- Yeah.
- There you go.

489
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,792
Good to meet you, pal.

490
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:08,208
Good to meet you.

491
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,327
How do you know Starlight?

492
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:14,004
Uh, you know, we met, um,
like, a few weeks ago, actually.

493
00:26:14,045 --> 00:26:15,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

494
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:19,182
- And she got you in here?
- Yeah, I guess she did.

495
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,137
Oh, this is a
pricey ticket, Hughie.

496
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:25,097
You must be a special guy.

497
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:27,269
I... no. No, I'm not...

498
00:26:27,308 --> 00:26:28,938
I just feel lucky
to be here. Really.

499
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:31,396
Um, ladies and gentlemen,

500
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:34,187
uh, I would like to welcome you
one and all.

501
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:37,942
And I would very much like to
welcome... Homelander,

502
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:38,985
our special guest.

503
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:48,701
So, without further ado,

504
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,956
if you would follow me.

505
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:57,213
Gather round, everybody.

506
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:59,875
Now, as many of you
may already know,

507
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:04,764
Homelander is an ordained
minister in Samaritan's Embrace.

508
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:10,854
Together, we will be rebaptizing
you, my most loyal followers.

509
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:16,572
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

510
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,857
- and Jesus Christ his son?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

511
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:22,612
Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

512
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,815
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

513
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:30,204
- Oh!
- Your sins have been purged.

514
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:33,456
Christ be with you.

515
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:38,379
On this blessed day,
you will be reborn a Christian.

516
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:41,381
You will be washed clean
of all your sins.

517
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,932
Something wrong, Hughie?

518
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:54,654
No. No, I'm-I'm
totally comfortable.

519
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,147
Why-why would you ask that?

520
00:27:56,188 --> 00:28:00,028
Well, your blood pressure's
150/90. It's a bit high.

521
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,567
Yeah, sorry. Just, um...

522
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:03,782
I'm afraid of water.

523
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:07,241
Don't panic.

524
00:28:07,283 --> 00:28:09,163
I got you.

525
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:13,291
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

526
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:15,831
and Jesus...

527
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,285
as his son?

528
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:21,212
Yes.

529
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:25,635
Hmm. Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

530
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:26,926
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

531
00:28:46,614 --> 00:28:48,574
God bless.

532
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:51,076
Thank you all once again
for allowing me to be a part

533
00:28:51,118 --> 00:28:52,828
of this beautiful occasion.

534
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,580
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good night.

535
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:57,003
See you, friend.

536
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,631
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

537
00:28:58,668 --> 00:29:02,208
May the light of God
shine in your lives.

538
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,550
Excuse me, sir.

539
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:07,341
Uh, may I speak with you
just for a moment?

540
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:10,146
- Sorry, son, I got a packed schedule.
- All right, I understand, sir,

541
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:12,139
but it's just,
I need your guidance.

542
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,641
I need Christ's guidance.

543
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,234
What is it?

544
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:18,598
Just hold on... one second.

545
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:20,186
Let me just show you something.

546
00:29:27,947 --> 00:29:30,487
What's wrong?

547
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:31,533
Uh...

548
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:35,956
You fucked me.

549
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:38,077
What?

550
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:39,544
Yeah, in a private Supe club.

551
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,093
You know the one on East 29th?
Secret Lair,

552
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,772
- I think it's called?
- Don't know it. Nope.

553
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:45,440
- There were three of us?
- You've got nothing...

554
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:47,384
- Oiled up, and you...
- This...

555
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:49,569
...wrapped your stretchy arms
around me, and it was, it was

556
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:53,643
so fucking hot, and...
your dick was so... perfect.

557
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:56,771
And long and... stretchy.

558
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,979
And you... you played
my butt like jazz.

559
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:04,691
With poise and skill and...
willingness to improvise.

560
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:18,832
You come in here.

561
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:20,463
You try to talk to me?

562
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:22,749
Like this?

563
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:25,553
You are a filthy, filthy liar.

564
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:27,718
- You are unclean.
- I have a video.

565
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:29,337
- I have a video.
- What?

566
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,933
I have a video
of the three of us...

567
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:33,349
sucking and fucking.

568
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:35,257
And if you don't let me go,

569
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:37,016
my friend puts the video online.

570
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:38,388
Like that.

571
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:45,625
What do you want?
You want a little bit of money?

572
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:46,939
Are you here for money?

573
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:49,404
You ship boxes labeled
as polio vaccine

574
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:51,605
but they're not really
polio vaccine, are they?

575
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:53,525
They're Compound V.

576
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:58,748
- Who the hell are you?
- I want to know everything about 'em.

577
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:01,168
Okay? You tell me, you tell me
where they're going.

578
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,377
And you tell me
how many boxes you ship.

579
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,167
No.

580
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,131
No, they will destroy me.

581
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:08,881
Who's "they"? Vought?

582
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:13,136
Here's how this is gonna go.

583
00:31:13,177 --> 00:31:15,007
You're gonna tell me,

584
00:31:15,054 --> 00:31:17,014
or that video...

585
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:18,676
trends, number one on Twitter.

586
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:20,184
Tonight.

587
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,646
And you're also gonna stop

588
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:25,226
the fucking
"pray the gay away" shit.

589
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:29,112
Anyway, it's your choice.

590
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:36,744
Hello?

591
00:31:36,784 --> 00:31:39,914
Hey, um, so that wasn't
a piece of cake.

592
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:41,374
Hughie, that you?
You all right?

593
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,173
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, sorry.

594
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:45,497
I had to, had to borrow a phone.
Thanks again.

595
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:47,553
I got baptized.

596
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,046
Yeah. It's a long story.

597
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,629
Blackmailing somebody
is not cake, okay?

598
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:55,215
It is weird, it's scary,
you wind up

599
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,696
- just saying shit.
- Okay, but did you

600
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,906
get him to talk?
What'd he say?

601
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,140
Uh, yeah, yeah.

602
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:00,700
I mean, you-you know
that charity of his?

603
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:02,234
Samaritan's Embrace?

604
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,688
- Right.
- All right.

605
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:06,397
So what they do is they take
boxes full of that stuff

606
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,568
and they ship it to hospitals
all across the country.

607
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:09,977
And apparently the latest one

608
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:11,985
is going to the NICU
at Mercer Hospital.

609
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,487
It's, uh,
i-it's midtown, I think.

610
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,160
You are a natural, kid.
You're like the fucking...

611
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,699
Rain Man of fucking people over.

612
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:20,742
Not a compliment.

613
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:58,155
- Hey!
- Cool your jets, guv.

614
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:01,039
It's not a hate crime.

615
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:05,369
M.M.? All right.

616
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,793
Fucking brilliant.

617
00:33:09,835 --> 00:33:12,415
I'll meet you at the hospital
in half an hour.

618
00:33:13,923 --> 00:33:15,423
Let's hear it for Jesus.

619
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:17,836
Yes!

620
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:21,255
One more for the guy upstairs!

621
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:25,057
Oh, I love you guys.
Let me tell you something.

622
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,770
I am so thrilled to be here.

623
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,440
Truthfully. Are you?

624
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,059
Yeah?

625
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:33,645
A terrible tragedy
befell our nation this week.

626
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,282
Terrible.

627
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,279
And let's not mince words
about this.

628
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:41,581
We... were... attacked.

629
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:45,253
America was attacked.

630
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:48,918
Some people...

631
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:51,959
...they want me
to come out here

632
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:54,512
and speak empty platitudes
to you all.

633
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:56,716
A little bit of corporate talk.

634
00:33:56,757 --> 00:33:59,217
But I don't want to do that.

635
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,100
I can't do that.

636
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:02,506
You want to know why?

637
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:03,854
Why?

638
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:08,189
Because I believe
that what God wants me to do

639
00:34:08,227 --> 00:34:10,597
is get on over there,
find the filthy bastards

640
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:13,106
that masterminded this...
whatever cave they're in...

641
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:16,488
and introduce them to a little
thing called God's judgment!

642
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:18,527
That's what I think!

643
00:34:20,864 --> 00:34:23,244
Sounds like
the American thing to do!

644
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:26,124
Sounds like
the right thing to do.

645
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:29,081
But no. No, no, no, no, no.

646
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:33,423
Apparently, I got to wait
for Congress to say it's okay.

647
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:36,802
Right?

648
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,969
I say I answer to a higher law.

649
00:34:40,009 --> 00:34:44,469
Wasn't I chosen to save you?

650
00:34:44,513 --> 00:34:48,023
Is it not my God-given purpose

651
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:50,688
to protect the United States
of America?

652
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:57,903
Homelander! Homelander!

653
00:34:57,943 --> 00:35:00,653
- Homelander! Homelander!
- Psalm!

654
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:02,566
58:10!

655
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:05,084
"The righteous shall rejoice

656
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:07,867
"when he sees the vengeance

657
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,291
"and he will bathe his feet

658
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:14,040
in the blood of the wicked."

659
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:18,167
Homelander!

660
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:21,593
Homelander! Homelander!

661
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:26,305
Motherfucker.

662
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,780
Hey.

663
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,911
Maeve, what, uh...

664
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:49,157
- Sorry, what are you...?
- I was, um, stopping a mugging

665
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:51,913
nearby and I...

666
00:35:56,293 --> 00:35:57,673
It's good to see you.

667
00:35:59,963 --> 00:36:02,383
Can I come in?

668
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:05,434
Uh... okay.

669
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:14,017
Where's Freckles?

670
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:16,941
Freckles died two years ago.

671
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:21,154
Look, uh, I'm kind of busy,

672
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:23,453
so, um, maybe give me a call,

673
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:24,987
call first, next time?

674
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,280
Elena, you don't
have to be like this.

675
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:28,954
Well, you show up out of nowhere

676
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:30,702
asking about
the goddamn cat, so...

677
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:35,249
You've been drinking.

678
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,210
No.

679
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,341
You're not going
to meetings anymore.

680
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:40,918
Uh, listen...

681
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:42,553
Water under the bridge.

682
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,550
I miss you.

683
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:51,345
You don't get to say that to me.

684
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,270
Leave, please.

685
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:56,518
Elena, I haven't seen you
in years.

686
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:57,982
I mean...

687
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:01,281
- wouldn't it be nice...
- I see you every day.

688
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:03,186
Every time I walk through
Times Square

689
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:05,735
or turn on the fucking TV.

690
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:07,699
I'm out of your life.

691
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,319
You never left mine.

692
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,081
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm really sorry.

693
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:20,134
- I didn't mean...
- I don't want your apology, okay?

694
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:22,379
I want you to get out.

695
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:25,221
Okay? I want you to go back
to your ivory penthouse

696
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:28,757
where you can drink
and fuck whoever you want.

697
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:30,762
Go back to Homelander.

698
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,982
I can't go back.

699
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:46,994
Oh...

700
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:49,869
- Oh...
- Maeve?

701
00:37:49,907 --> 00:37:51,487
It's too hard.

702
00:37:53,494 --> 00:37:56,164
- What happened?
- It's just too hard.

703
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:58,325
Tell me what happened.

704
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:01,383
I keep thinking about all...

705
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:03,668
- all those people.
- It's okay. You'll figure it out.

706
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:05,712
Okay? You'll figure it out.

707
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:07,716
You always know what to do.

708
00:38:07,758 --> 00:38:09,798
You always know
what to do, okay?

709
00:38:09,843 --> 00:38:13,263
- I don't know. They don't...
- So just tell me what happened.

710
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:16,175
Tell me what happened.

711
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:21,809
Uh...

712
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:23,765
I don't know, Maeve,
if this is...

713
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:25,815
- Come on.
- No. No, this is...

714
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:29,699
You're obviously...
No, I said stop it.

715
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:40,669
All right, just...

716
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:43,627
just talk to me.

717
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:46,089
Okay? Just tell me
what happened.

718
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:52,089
Yeah, this, um...

719
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:53,925
this was a mistake.

720
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:56,601
No, just talk to me.
Just tell me what...

721
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,810
If you...

722
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,084
- Allo?
- They're coming.

723
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:16,157
They're on to you, babe.

724
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,251
Black Noir was outside
my apartment.

725
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,407
What location?

726
00:39:20,455 --> 00:39:22,285
Which addresses do they have?

727
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:23,632
If they got to my place,

728
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,997
all of them.

729
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:38,886
So, you want to pay me

730
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:40,932
the professional courtesy
and tell me

731
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,646
where the hell
you disappeared to before?

732
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:45,517
I just had to pop down
to the shop.

733
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:48,654
I was running a bit low on
mind your own fucking business.

734
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:56,325
This better be good.

735
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:57,616
I'm burned.

736
00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:59,369
What? Fucking hell,
Frenchie. How?

737
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:00,701
I don't know.

738
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,076
What about the rest of us?

739
00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:04,122
Your concern for me
is very sweet.

740
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,746
Maybe, maybe not.

741
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,922
So far, they only seem to be

742
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:10,511
hitting my places.
I'm taking off.

743
00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:12,757
- What about the girl?
- Fucking leave her.

744
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,894
God knows
what they'll do to her.

745
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:19,008
Supe-on-Supe violence
ain't our concern, mate.

746
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:20,556
Butcher.

747
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,519
I said fucking leave her.

748
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,439
Merde.

749
00:40:25,646 --> 00:40:26,936
Burnt.

750
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,409
It was the Heartland Beauties
"Luck of the Irish" pageant.

751
00:40:43,455 --> 00:40:45,455
The lights went out on stage

752
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:48,419
and this one lit up the room
with the glow from her hands.

753
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,380
The show must go on. Hmm?

754
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:52,961
That's so sweet.

755
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:55,426
- 15 minutes, Starlight.
- I'm sorry, could you, could you

756
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:57,087
just give us one minute, please?

757
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:59,345
Starlight will begin shortly.

758
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:01,178
Please go to the main stage.

759
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:06,185
Mom, I can't do this.

760
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:07,768
A-Are you sick?
What's wrong?

761
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:09,653
No, it just doesn't feel right.

762
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,980
- What does that mean?
- Honestly...

763
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:14,565
I really thought that being here
would feel like it used to,

764
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:16,201
but it doesn't.

765
00:41:16,238 --> 00:41:18,158
It's changed,
or maybe I've changed.

766
00:41:18,198 --> 00:41:19,948
But...

767
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:25,372
Mom, these past few months...

768
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,170
Mm-mm.

769
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:34,671
No, tell them I'm not going on.

770
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:36,335
Honey.

771
00:41:38,343 --> 00:41:40,723
I've waited 23 years for this.

772
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:43,473
This isn't...

773
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:45,135
this isn't about you.

774
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,893
Isn't it?

775
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:48,805
I mean, I-I kept your secret,

776
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:51,064
scrimped by selling houses,

777
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:53,276
took you to all the Supe events.

778
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,200
Please.

779
00:41:57,237 --> 00:42:00,117
All my friends
are gonna be watching on TV.

780
00:42:00,157 --> 00:42:01,947
Please?

781
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:09,579
They're coming for me,
mon coeur.

782
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:13,338
The Supes.

783
00:42:13,378 --> 00:42:16,008
I've been ordered to leave you
here for them to find.

784
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,297
And Monsieur Charcuter,
you know,

785
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:21,511
he knows I'll comply,
that's how he sees me.

786
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:23,603
Like this mad bastard,

787
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:25,638
only good for hurting
or killing, you know?

788
00:42:25,682 --> 00:42:27,392
Like a gun, he takes me,

789
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:30,314
points me in a direction
and fires.

790
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:32,653
It's not who I am.

791
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:35,983
It's not who you are, either.

792
00:42:36,026 --> 00:42:38,316
We're the same, you and I.
Like eggs.

793
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:41,281
Hard outside, soft inside...
or pineapples, perhaps.

794
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:44,945
Whatever those bastards
got planned for you,

795
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:47,333
you don't deserve it, mon coeur.

796
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,455
The Deep finds himself

797
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:38,092
in hot water following
a harebrained attempt

798
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:41,009
to free a dolphin
from Oceanland.

799
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:43,299
Insiders say when police
tried to intercept

800
00:43:43,343 --> 00:43:45,473
the hijacked van,
Deep lost control

801
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:47,682
of the vehicle and crashed,

802
00:43:47,722 --> 00:43:50,562
catapulting the dolphin
through the front windshield

803
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,140
onto the road,
where it was run over

804
00:43:53,186 --> 00:43:55,556
- by an 18...
- Hello there, Believe Expo!

805
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:04,452
I am so honored
to be here tonight.

806
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:07,119
Did you know
that my first public appearance

807
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:10,658
was right here
on this very stage

808
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:12,874
with Ezekiel
and the rest of the family?

809
00:44:19,546 --> 00:44:22,216
Today, I wanted
to share with you

810
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:24,927
how I accepted Christ...

811
00:44:24,968 --> 00:44:27,638
as my personal savior.

812
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,440
How His way is the only way...

813
00:44:44,988 --> 00:44:47,278
Uh...

814
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:48,784
Just...

815
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:51,865
just please stop the music.

816
00:44:51,912 --> 00:44:53,712
Please stop.

817
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,880
You want me to just suck it up
and do this for you?

818
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,762
Hmm?

819
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:10,933
You have no idea
what you're really asking.

820
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:17,148
You have no idea
what I've been through.

821
00:45:23,652 --> 00:45:28,282
Every single word that I say up
here, I'm reading from a script.

822
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,663
I didn't write
any of these words.

823
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,790
I don't even know
if I believe in them.

824
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:36,537
I mean, I believe in God,
I love God so much, but...

825
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:43,839
Honestly, it's...
it's just how goddamn certain

826
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,880
everyone is around here.

827
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:49,425
I mean, tickets start at,
what, 170 bucks,

828
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:54,139
so that these people can tell
you how to get to heaven?

829
00:45:54,182 --> 00:45:56,812
How do they know?
How does anybody know?

830
00:45:56,851 --> 00:46:01,271
When the Bible was written, life
expectancy was 30 years old.

831
00:46:01,314 --> 00:46:05,614
I mean, I'm not so sure you're
supposed to take it literally.

832
00:46:05,652 --> 00:46:08,702
It also says
that it's a sin to eat shrimp.

833
00:46:08,738 --> 00:46:11,158
What, if you're gay
or if you're Gandhi,

834
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,949
you're going to hell? I mean...

835
00:46:13,994 --> 00:46:16,164
And if you have sex
before marriage,

836
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:18,964
that's, that's not immoral.

837
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:20,629
That's human.

838
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:24,245
What's immoral

839
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:28,425
is the guy who shoved
his dick in my face.

840
00:46:30,635 --> 00:46:33,095
- Shit.
- Shit.

841
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:45,862
Here's the truth.

842
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,530
Anyone who tells you they know
the answers is lying.

843
00:46:50,572 --> 00:46:52,492
And I know, I know,
I'm supposed to be

844
00:46:52,532 --> 00:46:55,622
this hero-idol-symbol-whatever,

845
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,040
but I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

846
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:04,921
I'm just as scared and confused
as the rest of you.

847
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:08,591
I'm done pretending,

848
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:12,301
and I'm done
taking any more shit.

849
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:19,388
Thank you.

850
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:31,114
Excuse me.

851
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:46,339
Jackpot.

852
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:50,217
Compound V?
Oh, yeah, and lots of it.

853
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,760
Oh, my God.

854
00:47:59,307 --> 00:48:01,387
Jesus.

855
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:03,564
That's a fucking baby Supe.

856
00:48:09,192 --> 00:48:11,572
Chosen by God, my ass.

857
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:14,241
These cunts are made
in a fucking lab.

858
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:22,413
Hey.

859
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:23,665
Hey, easy.

860
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,666
That-that was a great speech.

861
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,630
I mean, come on... I mean,

862
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:31,461
know your audience,
but that was, like,

863
00:48:31,506 --> 00:48:34,756
that was Joel at the Garden.
That was...

864
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:38,561
I am so glad you enjoyed it.

865
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:43,056
I'm so glad. How was your
quality time with Ezekiel? Huh?

866
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:45,731
Any more VIP tickets
I can get for you?

867
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,150
Because I'm so here for you.

868
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,730
- It's not like that.
- You sure?

869
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:52,855
'Cause I can get you
a commemorative cup.

870
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:55,202
Or I can get you
an Ezekiel figurine,

871
00:48:55,238 --> 00:48:58,448
- or a goodie bag.
- My girlfriend died.

872
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:02,289
What?

873
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:04,708
Happened not too long ago,

874
00:49:04,747 --> 00:49:06,537
and I came here
looking for a way

875
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,843
to get out of the shit
that I'm in right now.

876
00:49:08,877 --> 00:49:12,507
And that wasn't fair to you,
and I'm so sorry.

877
00:49:18,428 --> 00:49:20,178
I really don't think
there's anything

878
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:24,181
that can help it anymore
or fix it...

879
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:26,635
or make it better.

880
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:32,733
And everything I heard here?

881
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:35,605
Well, that helped
a total of jack shit.

882
00:49:38,907 --> 00:49:40,697
Except for what you said.

883
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:45,002
I mean, you're right,
there's... nobody knows.

884
00:49:45,038 --> 00:49:47,016
And that's the only fucking
thing I've heard all day

885
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,000
that's made any sense at all,

886
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:52,883
and that is
the God's honest truth.

887
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:07,564
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

888
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:09,602
I'm sorry.

889
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:29,767
Okay, easy with that.
You get some air in there,

890
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,251
you could kill the kid.

891
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:33,342
Well, wouldn't that
be a crying shame?

892
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:35,708
All right.

893
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:37,335
Let's bugger off.

894
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:39,382
All right.

895
00:50:41,177 --> 00:50:42,677
Hey!

896
00:50:50,645 --> 00:50:53,265
Hey, keep them busy.

897
00:51:01,948 --> 00:51:04,408
Watch and learn, son.

898
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:17,507
Hey.

899
00:51:17,547 --> 00:51:19,047
Hey.

900
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:24,679
Holy fuck.

901
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:27,681
That was diabolical.

902
00:51:29,892 --> 00:51:33,192
You little fucking beauty.

903
00:51:38,484 --> 00:51:39,904
You done good, lad.

904
00:51:42,113 --> 00:51:44,703
- Come on, Butcher, it's time to go.
- Yeah.

905
00:51:47,368 --> 00:51:49,328
Now, you keep
your nose clean, sunshine,

906
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,870
or I'll come back and stomp you.

907
00:51:54,459 --> 00:51:57,499
Holy smokes, Starlight shocking
the Christian community

908
00:51:57,545 --> 00:51:59,915
during her address
at Believe Expo,

909
00:51:59,964 --> 00:52:01,764
when she questioned
her faith in...

910
00:52:11,434 --> 00:52:12,814
I see you.

911
00:52:14,187 --> 00:52:15,897
I know you're watching me.

912
00:52:15,938 --> 00:52:18,938
You've been out there
quite a lot lately.

913
00:52:20,193 --> 00:52:22,903
Always watching.

914
00:52:22,945 --> 00:52:25,695
So why don't you
just come on inside?

915
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,290
You afraid of me?

916
00:52:39,045 --> 00:52:40,875
Come in.

917
00:52:52,392 --> 00:52:55,192
Have I not been paying
enough attention to you?

918
00:52:56,437 --> 00:52:58,397
Are you lonely?

919
00:52:58,439 --> 00:53:01,979
It must be hard,
feeling so alone.

920
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:07,034
I'm sorry...

921
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:14,042
...but you cannot
give a speech like that.

922
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,500
You cannot be bad.

923
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:49,871
Come here.

924
00:54:17,226 --> 00:54:19,726
You have to be good.

925
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,730
And you have to listen to me.

926
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:26,533
And then we both
can get what we want.

927
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:38,499
That's good.

928
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:44,627
You're my good boy.

929
00:56:53,341 --> 00:56:56,011
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

930
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,990
A miracle.

931
00:57:57,947 --> 00:58:00,777
You are a miracle.
