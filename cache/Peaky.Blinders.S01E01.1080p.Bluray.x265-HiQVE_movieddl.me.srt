102

they've had messages coming up
from London to the brass.

108
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,720
And on that list was your name
and my name together.

109
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,360
What kind of a list would
have the name of a communist

110
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,400
and the name of a bookmaker
side by side?

111
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,800
Perhaps it's a list of men
who give false hope to the poor.

112

The only difference between
you and me, Freddie,

You're the law around here now, Tommy,
aren't you?

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,840
It must have fell out of me pocket.

163
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,040
He said he found it on the
sideboard of the betting shop.

164
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,280
With bullets in it.

165
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
I...

166
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I must have been drunk.

167
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,720
When are you not drunk?

168
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,960
Look, Aunt Polly, I'm sorry.

169
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,520
(STAMMERS) I'm... I'm sorry.

170
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
We'll keep this between ourselves

171
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,480
if you swear not to leave guns
lying around.

172
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,200
Look, I know having four kids
without a woman is hard,

173
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,080
but my boot's harder.
Now come on, were late.

174
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
Right!

175
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,800
I've called this family meeting because
I've got some very important news.

176
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Scudboat and Love lock
got back from Belfast last night.

177
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,240
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

178
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,520
They were in a pub on the
Shankhill Road yesterday,

179
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,600
and in that pub there was a copper.

180
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,240
Handing out these.

181
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,800
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

182
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,640
They're recruiting Protestant Irishmen
to come over here as Special.

183
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,280
-To do what?
-To clean up the city, Ada.

184
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,200
He's the Chief Inspector.

185
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,920
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

186
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,840
How do you know so bloody much?

187
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,320
'Cause I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

188
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,040
And why didn't you tell me?

189
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
I'm telling you.

190
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,400
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

191
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,160
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA.

192
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,920
And the Austin works, lately.

193
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,720
Now the papers
are talking about sedition.

194
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
And revolution.

195
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,000
I reckon it's communists he's after.

196
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,520
So this copper's gonna
leave us alone, right?

197
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,560
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away from him.

198
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,040
They say Catholic men who crossed him
used to disappear in the night.

199
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,400
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.

200
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,760
We bloody fought for the King.

201
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,120
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.

202
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,800
We're not scared of coppers.

203
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,680
-He's right.
-If they come for us,

204
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,360
we'll cut them a smile each.

205
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,640
So, Arthur. Is that it?

206
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,320
ARTHUR:
What do you think, Aunt Poll?

207
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,640
This family does everything open.

208
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,240
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

209
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
No.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,360
Nothing that's women's business.

211
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business

212
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,360
while you boys were away at war.

213
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
What's changed?

214
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
We came back.

215
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,080
And the Lord will smite the unholy

216
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,840
when the great judgement comes.

217
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
And judgement is coming, my friends.

218
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,920
Judgement is coming to this wicked city.

219
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,520
And your wickedness
and your fornication will be revealed.

220
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,560
You cannot hide from the Creator.

221
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,560
You cannot hide
from the Almighty himself.

222
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,720
The Creator sees all.

223
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,440
You cannot hide
from the true and living God.

224
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,400
Get off with ya!

225
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Ahh!

226
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,200
Fuck off.

227
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,400
(CHILD SHOUTING)

228
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
That's it. I don't go any further.

229
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,760
(CHILDREN SHOUTING)

230
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,640
I have ten minutes.
What do you want?

231
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,840
An explanation.

232
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,000
Always been able to tell
when you're hiding something.

233
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
People round here talk.

234
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,040
Some of them work at the BSA.

235
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,320
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

236
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

237
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,680
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

238
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Speak.

239
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,560
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

240
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,560
It was meant to be routine.

241
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,160
I had a buyer in London
for some motorcycles.

242
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,720
I asked my men to steal me four bikes
with petrol engines.

243
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,080
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

244
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,880
<i>Theres a still inside the factory
makes tramline gin.</i>

245
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,920
<i>They picked up the wrong fucking crate.</i>

246
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,320
<i>The boys dropped it
at Charlie Strongs yard, as agreed.</i>

247
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,360
<i>Must have taken it from the
proofing bay, instead of the export bay.</i>

248
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
Holy sweet baby of Mary.

249
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
Inside we found 25 Lewis machine guns,

250
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,880
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

251
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,080
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

252
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Jesus, Tommy.

253
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,880
All bound for Libya.

254
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,640
Sitting right there
in Charlie Strong's yard.

255
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,880
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

256
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,200
We put them in the stables
out of the rain.

257
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,400
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

258
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,520
So that's why they sent a cop
from Belfast?

259
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,280
Maybe, maybe not.

260
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,280
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man.

261
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,920
You're not a fool.

262
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,840
You sell those guns to anyone who has
use to them, you will hang.

263
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

264
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,800
Dump them somewhere
the police can find them.

265
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,000
Maybe if they know they haven't fallen
into the wrong hands,

266
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,800
this might blow over.

267
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,320
-Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.
-No.

268
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,440
He won't move contraband
under a full moon.

269
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
Three days until it wanes.

270
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Then you'll do the right thing?

271
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,680
You have your mother's common sense.

272
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,720
But your father's devilment.

273
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
I see them fighting.

274
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,400
Let your mother win.

275
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
I got tickets for the penny crush.

276
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,840
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

277
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
I'm not in the mood
for the pictures tonight, Ada.

278
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,280
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

279
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,680
Let's just walk a bit.

280
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,480
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

281
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,440
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

282
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,000
They have friends everywhere,
we'd have to walk to London.

283
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,200
I'm with you 'cause you're the
only man round here not scared of them.

284
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,360
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

285
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,200
But you love me
more than you fear them, right?

286
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't want to be
always sneaking about.

287
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
-Soon, we'll tell them.
-When?

288
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,680
How did the family meeting go?

289
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Usual.

290
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,600
-There's a new copper coming.
-I heard.

291
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,920
Mmm.

292
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,040
And Tommy says
he's after the likes of you.

293
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,640
So maybe you should burn your books
and stop making speeches.

294
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,520
Oh, my Ada.

295
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,000
The only princess of the Royal Family
of the kingdom of Small Heath.

296
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,520
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

Give me a kiss, Princess Ada.

I'm here about the job as a barmaid.

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
-Are you mad?
-Am I what?

301
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,760
-Do you know about this place?
-I saw it in an advertisement.

-Job's been filled.
-It was in yesterday's paper.

Believe me, love,
I'm doing you a favour.

304
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm not asking for favours,
I'm asking for employment.

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,480
You're too...nice.

(GASPS)

329
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,560
In Ireland...

330
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,840
my singing made them cry
and stopped them fighting.

331
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,440
Well, I hope you know a lot of songs.

332
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,760
Babies discarded

333
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,080
with the fish bones and egg shells.

334
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Girls,

335
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,400
11 years old,

336
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,760
pierced and punctured by old men

337
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,280
for thrupence a time.

338
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,080
Rutted upon like animals.

339
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,960
Degradation.

340
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,520
Fathers with their daughters,

341
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,360
brothers and sisters sharing beds.

342
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,680
Beggars and thieves
left to run in the streets.

343
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,520
And astride the whole stinking pile
of wounds and rotting flesh...

344
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,280
your masters!

345
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,320
The men who you touch your cap to.

346
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,440
The Peaky Blinders!

347
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
The vicious, merciless gangs

348
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,520
who blind those that see

349
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
and cut out the tongues
of those who talk.

350
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,080
You are worse than them!

351
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,160
Those of you who have taken their
bribes these years since the war.

352
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
Those of you who look the other way.

353
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,000
You are worse than them!

354
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,600
God damn you for soiling your uniforms!

355
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,280
And then...
there are the IRA Fenians.

356
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,000
And the communists.

357
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,720
Blacker hearts still.

358
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,920
They feed on the pus
of all this corruption.

359
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,760
Like maggots in a corpse.

360
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,320
And, like maggots, if left to swell
they will eventually swarm like flies

361
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,880
and spread their rotten philosophy
across the country and across the world!

362
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,240
Those then...

363
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,200
are our enemies.

364
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,800
A three-headed beast.

365
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,920
It is my job...

366
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,920
to decapitate each one,
and by God I will do it!

367
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,240
I don't trust any of yo use

368
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,520
until you earn my trust.

369
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,480
And that takes some earning.

370
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,000
These are the new men
who will bolster your ranks.

371
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
Good men,

372
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,680
from God-fearing families.

373
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,720
By the time the sun sets...

374
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,120
they will be sworn in
and in uniform.

375
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,880
And by sunrise tomorrow
they will be on the streets.

376
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
God help those who stand in our way!

377
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,200
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

378
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Right.

379
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,960
WOMAN:
Move out of the way for Mr Shelby.

380
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,560
-This way.
-Mr Shelby.

381
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,240
You see, ladies,
when you're out with a Blinder

382
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,520
you don't have to queue.

383
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,760
Right.

384
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,440
I want a blow job off both of you
before they let the ordinary people in.

385
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,840
Away you go.
Take your hat off.

386
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,360
What the fuck!

387
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,000
Who the fuck are you?

388
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,200
I'm Arthur fucking Shelby!

389
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Arthur Shelby.

390
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,440
Lead pack dog

391
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,200
of the Peaky Blinders.

392
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
(GROANS)

393
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,320
Look at me.

394
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
(COUGHS)

395
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,280
Bastard!

396
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,800
Your uniform?

397
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,200
Terrifying, I'm sure.

398
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,400
-Did he have a gun?
-No gun.

399
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,120
Knife in his sock.
Cosh in his belt.

400
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,240
Now, Mr Shelby,

401
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
I want you to see this
as me introducing myself to you,

402
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
you understand.

403
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,920
In all the world,
the only thing that interests me

404
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,320
is the truth.

405
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,680
What do you know about the robbery?

406
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,080
What robbery?

407
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
(GROANS)

408
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,240
I will ask you again.

409
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,680
What do you know about the robbery?

410
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,280
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

411
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,760
What fucking robbery?!

412
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,320
(GROANS LOUDLY)

413
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,640
After 35 years of dealing
with animals like you,

414
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,720
I can tell just by sniffing the air

415
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,640
whether or not you're lying.

416
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
I'm not fucking lying, all right?

417
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,680
I'm not fucking lying!

418
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
I know.

419
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,560
I see nothing of interest
behind the blood in your eyes.

420
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,000
And no blood in your veins
that could carry...

421
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,600
even a trace of cunning or guile.

422
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,640
But understand this.

423
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,880
It is well within my power

424
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,440
to have you
and the rest of your scum family

425
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,880
face down in the canal
before the year is out.

426
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
On the other hand...

427
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,520
we can help each other.

428
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,680
Is it always this busy in the day time?

429
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,280
Nah, these boys
are on their way to St Andrews.

430
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,680
-To pray?
-(LAUGHS) That'll be the day!

431
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,520
St Andrews is a football ground.
The Blues are playing.

432
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,000
That's the forward line there,

433
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,920
and that's the goalie,
believe it or not.

434
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Hello!

435
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,280
I need a bottle of rum.

436
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,560
Grace, whatever it is,
it's on the house.

437
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,320
-A whole bottle?
-Yeah.

438
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,160
-White or dark rum?
-Don't care.

439
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,280
HARRY: Right, lads, what'll it be? Two?

440
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,480
Thank you.

441
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,800
Harry said it's on the house.

442
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Are you a whore?

443
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,600
'Cause if you're not,
you're in the wrong place.

444
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,680
He's one of them you warned me about.

445
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,880
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl,
but be careful.

446
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,680
If I say something's on the house,

447
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,440
then say nothing
to whoever you're serving.

448
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,760
If they decide that they want you,

449
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,320
then there's nothing
anybody could do about it.

450
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,960
Lucky for you,
since he got back from France

451
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,840
Tommy doesn't want anybody at all.

452
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Yes, lads?

453
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
(GROANS)

454
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,000
John, wipe the blood out of his eye.

455
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,760
-Since when did you give orders?
-I'm a trained nurse.

456
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,840
(SCOFFS) Don't make me laugh.

457
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,800
-It hurts me face.
-I bloody am.

458
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,680
You went to one first aid class
in the church hall

459
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,080
and got thrown out for giggling.

460
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,560
Not before I learned
how to stop somebody from choking.

461
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm not bloody choking, am I?

462
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,800
You will be when I wrap this cloth
round your neck.

463
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,400
Let me see him.

464
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,400
All right, have this.

465
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Give me that.

466
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,720
(INHALES SHARPLY)

467
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
TOMMY: You're all right.

468
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,440
He said Mr Churchill sent him
to Birmingham.

469
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,880
National interest, he said.

470
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,440
Something about a robbery.

471
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,040
He said he wants us to help him.

472
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
We don't help coppers.

473
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,960
He knew all about our war records.

474
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,160
He said we're patriots.

475
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,080
Like him.

476
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,080
Wants us to be his eyes and ears.

477
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,560
I said...

478
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,280
(GROANS)

479
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,800
I said we'd have a family meeting,
take a vote.

480
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,080
Well, why not? Hmm?

481
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,880
We've no truck with Fenians
or communists.

482
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,800
What's wrong with you?

483
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,480
What the fuck is wrong with him lately?

I've set up a command network.

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,120
I've agents in place across the city,

who will act as my eyes and ears.

543
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,440
And I've begun to interrogate suspects

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,640
The Fenians or the communists?

549
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,800
If it is the IRA Fenians,

550
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,840
I will find them and find the guns.

551

If it is the communists,
I will find them and find the guns.

552
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,960
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

553
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
To me, there is no distinction
between any of the above.

Bodies thrown in the rivers

Their hand?

586
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,320
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

596
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,280
Is it another war
you're looking for, Tommy?

597
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,080
The tobacco wharf.

598
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,840
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

599
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,840
Are you in position?

600
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,200
I am, sir.

601
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,240

602
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,960
I'm quite shocked
at how these people live.

603
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,440
Have you found anything out
that might help me?

604
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,840
I interrogated the head
of the Peaky Blinders.

605
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,920
He didn't know anything.

606
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,520
A brute.

607
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,280
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur
who heads the Shelby family.

608
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,400
It's the younger one.

609
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,760
Thomas.

610
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,480
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

611
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,240
You sound fascinated.

612
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,840
However, my opinion has not changed.

613
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,800
The bookmaker gangs have other business

614
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,320
and the communists
are too weak to have planned this.

615
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,840
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

616
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,840
You must not let your personal history
cloud your judgement.

617
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,640
What history?

618
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgement.

619
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,960
If you see any guns,

620
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,840
check the serial numbers
against that list.

621
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,760
Your father...

622
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,960
was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

623
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,240
I know he'd be very, very proud of you.

624
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,400
Danny, as you know,
the man you killed was Italian.

625
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,040
Those two men over there
are his brothers.

626
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,800
If I let the Italians do this, Danny,

627
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,320
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

628
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
That's how those bastards do things.

629
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,560
So, to stop a war breaking out
between us and the Italians,

630
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,000
to save you from their barbarity,

631
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,960

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,840
I suppose I ought to pray now.

646
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,280
Those fucking guns,

647
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,640
they blew God right outta me head.

648
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,760
Is that boat for me?

649
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,000
We have to get your body
out of the city, Danny.

650
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,720
This new copper, you know.

651
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Don't bury me anywhere there's mud.

652
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
Okay?

653
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
Promise me.

654
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,080
Bury me on a hill,

655
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,240
and tell Rosie where.

656
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,400
You're a good man,

657
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,120
and a good soldier.

658
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,440
Yes, Sergeant Major.

659
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,800
In the bleak mid-winter...

660
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,600
ARTHUR: Where are ya?

661
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,360
It bloody won.

662
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,120
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

663
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,040
Yeah. It won.

664
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,000
And word will spread.

665
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,480
So the next time we do the powder trick,

666
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,680
it won't be just a garrison
that'll bet on the horse.

667
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,560
It'll be the whole of Small Heath.

668
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,160
And you know what?

669
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,800
The horse will win again.

670
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,400
And the third time we do it we'll have
the whole of Birmingham betting on it.

671
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,960
A thousand-quid bet on the magic horse.

672
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,680
And that time...

673
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,200
when we are ready...

674
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,640
the horse will lose.

675
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,280
Think about it.

676
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,400
CHARLIE: You okay, Danny?

677
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,640
I'm still in shock.

678
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,320
Are you sure this isn't heaven?

679
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,120
If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

680
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,680
Tommy wanted you to think it was real.

681
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,040
Try and knock some sense into you.

682
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,280
A shell full of sheep brains
hurts pretty bad.

683
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,640
Aye, it was meant to.

684
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,760
So, where are you taking me?

685
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,120
London.

686
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,920
Tommy has a little job for you.

687
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,480
Give you a chance to say thanks.

688
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,200
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

689
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,920
POLLY: Bad week?

690
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,840
Heard there was no moon last night.

691
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,760
-I checked. Did you do the right thing?
-Yes, I did the right thing.

692
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,920
<i># Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the track #</i>

693
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:54,944
