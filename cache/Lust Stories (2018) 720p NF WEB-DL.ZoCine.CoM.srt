00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,117
- Is there no one at home?
- Grandma is. She's hard of hearing.

3
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,499
Don't! That is her room. This is mine!

4
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,950
- Good night!
- Hush!

5
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,450
I will be right back.

6
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,242
Chetan Bhagat!

7
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,791
<i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower!</i>
You read it?

8
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,332
I read the book. Watched the film.
And I am one!

9
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,117
What are you? A wallflower or a perk?

10
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,874
You are a wallflower, aren't you?

11
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,332
You find yourself a corner.
Hear and see everything

12
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,325
but never do anything.
I need to do something.

13
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,700
You read <i>Sophie Kinsella</i>?

14
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,207
I tried but couldn't finish.

15
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,332
Why?

16
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:49,291
It's too difficult
Natasha asked me to read it.

17
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,916
You understood Wallflower
and not Kinsella?

18
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,367
That was an easy read.

19
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,950
A wallflower or a fly, it's the same.

20
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,242
You are smart!

21
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,783
What's wrong? Is this your first time?

22
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,992
- Really?
- Yes.

23
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,575
Let me teach you.

24
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,325
Tea?

25
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,033
What happened last night...

26
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,957
was good, right?

27
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

28
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,283
It was natural, right?

29
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,117
Don't ruin it by talking about it.

30
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,158
Don't talk about it.

31
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,492
I shouldn't have.

32
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,291
- You won't fall in love, right?
- No.

33
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:40,533
Don't overthink it.

34
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,617
- Okay.
- All right?

35
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,624
Mihir told me that guys

36
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,582
tend to get emotional after sex

37
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,992
and they fall in love.

38
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:09,700
They become possessive.

39
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,367
Sure.

40
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,825
What is it? Why are you smiling?

41
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,533
Do we share a secret?

42
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,033
Do we?

43
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,367
I was 26

44
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,700
when I got married to Mihir.

45
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,950
He was 12 years older than me.

46
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,249
I had never dated anyone.

47
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,367
But Mihir had dated many girls.

48
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:21,999
So marrying a much older guy
was an adventure for me.

49
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,291
My parents were against it.

50
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,999
He had so many stories to share!
Like he went somewhere,

51
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,207
met a girl there,
and they started talking.

52
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,075
His stories were straight out of a movie.

53
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,957
I didn't have any of that.

54
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,450
We talked and he made me understand

55
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,499
that I will resent him

56
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,166
if I did not live my life on my terms.

57
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,325
He urged me to examine my life.

58
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,700
She had a lover, Imroze,
who was younger than her.

59
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,624
Draupadi lived with five Pandavas.

60
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,874
She loved them and perhaps,
they loved her too.

61
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,075
They did not fight over her.

62
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,416
I'm married and I cannot be
with anyone else.

63
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,825
What if I fantasize about someone?

64
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,791
It's not okay.

65
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,749
How can you expect so much from a person?

66
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,367
You want him to be your best friend,
your lover and your wildest fantasy.

67
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,575
What do I do?

68
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:53,041
It's good that they are finally
speaking out.

69
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,707
But how can they prove it?

70
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,291
People play the victim card for publicity.

71
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,700
Did you read this?

72
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:05,666
The husband divorced her
as soon as he learned of it.

73
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,666
Things like that happen there often.

74
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:12,041
But it's wrong. It's not okay.

75
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:15,033
What is the student's age?

76
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,124
- He is 18.
- So he is an adult.

77
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:22,408
- Does that justify it?
- No matter how old he is...

78
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,749
- But he is an adult!
- How do you know it was consensual?

79
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,700
His silence means it was not consensual.

80
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,041
- Tejas Bhave?
- Yes.

81
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,408
I need to talk to you.

82
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,200
Don't you think she is weird?

83
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,582
Listen! How old are you?

84
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,707
Why?

85
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,666
- Just tell me your age!
- 21.

86
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,166
- Sure?
- Yes.

87
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,499
Does your admission form say that?

88
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,783
- No.
- People often do that.

89
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,207
- I'm not sure.
- Come on!

90
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,916
- Do you have your birth certificate?
- Yes.

91
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,124
Get it for me.

92
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,832
Take it from the college office.

93
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:18,075
How can I go and ask for it?
What if they ask me why?

94
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,408
Why do you need it?

95
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,783
Listen.

96
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,575
What happened that night

97
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,291
was consensual, right?

98
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,533
What do you mean?

99
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,283
Did I force you to have sex?

100
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,742
No. But...

101
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,957
What?

102
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,742
You made the first move!

103
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,325
Did you say no?

104
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,707
- No.
- Exactly.

105
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,033
So, it was consensual, right?

106
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,791
Say it. Say that it was consensual.

107
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,916
What do I say?

108
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,166
Say that it was consensual.

109
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,332
- What is that word?
- Consensual!

110
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,666
Yes. Say it.

111
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,867
It was.

112
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:01,242
"Whatever happened
between us was consensual."

113
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,242
- Whatever happened between us...
- Yes...

114
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,499
- Was consensual!
- Was consensual.

115
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,291
- Say it in one go.
- The complete statement?

116
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,249
- Yes.
- Whatever...

117
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,082
Say this. "Whatever happened between us,"

118
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,033
"Ms. Kalindi, was consensual."

119
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,791
- Whatever...
- "This is Tejas. Ms. Kalindi..."

120
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:20,158
"Whatever happened
between us was consensual."

121
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:24,158
Ms. Kalindi, this is Tejas.
Whatever happened between us...

122
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,707
- Was all...
- That was all consensual!

123
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,283
Now say it properly!

124
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,908
Ms. Kalindi, whatever happened
between us was consensual.

125
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,200
- I am Tejas.
- Okay.

126
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,450
It's my fault!
They have to hit me if I go home late.

128
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:56,124
Just go home. Shut the door.
Play some nice music.

129
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,950
Wash your hands

130

Think of Hrithik Roshan
and have a good time.

131
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:11,492
Now look at that girl.
I said masturbation and she hid her face!

132
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,825
- Ms. Kalindi!
- I came by to apologize.

133
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,124
Why?

134
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,374
I recorded your statement and scared you.

135
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,992
No. I did not understand anything.
What was that word?

136
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,450
Forget it.

137
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,200
- Listen, now we're friends, okay?
- Yes.

138
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:35,117
As in real friends...
who share everything.

139
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,825
Okay.

140
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,742
- But without benefits.
- What do you mean?

141
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,825
I mean I have a boyfriend now.

142
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,658
- Professor Neeraj!
- Yes.

- The Mathematics professor?
- Yes.

144
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,950
- Have you seen his hair?
- Cool, right?

145
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,825
He isn't like the other guys.

146

He is faithful. Do you know what he says?

147
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,450
Did you know that

148
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,408
penguins are monogamous

149
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,783
and that helps them survive
in the extreme cold?

150
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,033
He wants me to be only his.

151
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,325
And he doesn't find me weird.
Unlike what your Natasha feels.

- My Natasha?
- Yes!

Where are you?

160

- What happened?
- You tell me!

You said it was urgent.

164
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,325
I took care of it.

165
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,457
- So easily?
- It's not working out with Neeraj.

166
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,992
What happened?

167
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,867
I thought he was smart! Intelligent!

168
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,450
That he knows everything.

169
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,367
But not chemistry.

170
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,992
He doesn't know how to make a move.

171
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:12,117
It took him 17 days, 16 hours
and 32 minutes to say...

172
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,742
I asked him the same question.

173
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,332
Wait!

174
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,450
- Do you have a condom?
- In the drawer next to you.

175
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,075
- Should I wear it?
- No.

176
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,033
- What happened?
- Nothing!

177
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,408
What happened?

178
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,742
Found it!

179
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,325
- Answer it.
- It's alright.

180
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,200
- Who called?
- I don't know.

181
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,575
- Was it Natasha?
- No.

182
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,283
So are you guys together?

183
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,325
It's over.

184
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,742
Really?

185
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,158
Did you have sex with her yet?

186
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,533
No.

187
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,533
Liar.

188
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,658
Why do you care?

189
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,658
- Don't I share my stories with you?
- Do I ask you to?

190
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,658
You just vomit it all out.

191
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,867
What's happening between you and Natasha?

192
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,325
Nothing.

193
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,791
Now that you
and Professor Neeraj have broken up,

194
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:33,575
should we...

195
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,533
No?

196
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,117
Did you come here to text?

197
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,325
Give me your phone.

198
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,492
Passcode, please.

199
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,367
I have forgotten it.

200
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,575
Type the passcode.

201
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,492
See. I don't remember it.

202
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,950
Collect it from the office.

203
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,242
I am leaving.

204
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,283
Are you guys studying?

205
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,783
You sit with Rahul in the classroom,

206
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,707
with Akash in the cafeteria.

207
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,742
And now, you are with Tejas.

208
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,742
Your parents live in Dubai...

209
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,492
but they send you money, right?

210
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,450
Do you live alone?

211
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,200
Why did you do that?

212
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,533
Is she your girlfriend?

213
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,658
No.

214
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,533
Mihir, can you hear me?

215
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,700
No one is ever honest with anyone.

216
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,457
Even my parents were not honest
with each other!

217
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,707
No one is!

218
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,575
Although Mihir was with me,
I was feeling guilty.

219
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,117
Why do I feel guilty?

220
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,283
What makes me feel that way?

221
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,242
You must love selflessly.

222
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,408
Mihir loves me like that.

223
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,950
Nothing!

224
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,908
Where are you?

225
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:52,242
- No!
- I know you are dating Natasha.

226
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,033
Where are you?

227
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,742
Tell me.

228
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,450
You are, aren't you?

229
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,867
Tell me!

230
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,325
- Go to sleep. Good night.
- Tell me...

231
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,158
Mihir and I...

232
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,200
He calls me up and tells me everything.

233
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,624
I'm going to tell the truth too.

234
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,367
Something happened between Tejas and me.

235
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,207
We had something special.

236
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,200
So we owe this to each other.

237
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,158
I told him

238
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:57,408
about my affair with Neeraj.

239
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:01,825
I told him everything.

240
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,575
I told him when I got fed up.

241
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,408
I cannot be Mihir.

242
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:16,158
But Tejas lied to me
when I asked him about them.

243
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,867
He lied to me.

244
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,283
I don't like being lied to.

245
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,117
He shouldn't have lied.

246
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,367
Tejas!

247
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:23,242
Tejas?

248
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,825
He's inside.

249
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,908
Tejas!

250
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:35,742
Tejas!

251
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,742
Open up!

252
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,117
Open the door!

253
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:55,867
Come on!

254
00:28:56,875 --> 00:29:00,700
Tejas. Please open the door!

255
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,367
Are you listening?

256
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,950
- Grandma?
- Tejas.

257
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,242
Open the door!

258
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,575
Who is in there?

259
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,117
That crazy girl!

260
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,033
She just ran inside.

261
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:43,950
Open the door!

262
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:09,832
What are you guys up to?

263
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,041
- Whose is this?
- I don't know.

264
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,207
Whose is this?

265
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:15,200
- I don't know!
- Is it Natasha's?

266
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,450
No.

267
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,832
- I'm asking for the last time! Is it hers?
- How can it be hers?

268
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,916
- Why not? She may have forgotten it here.
- I don't know whose it is.

269
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,749
- Really?
- Yes.

270
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,783
- Really?
- I said I don't!

271
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,283
I will hit you!

272
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,450
- Don't you know?
- No.

273
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,992
Don't you? Wait.

274
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,117
- Don't break that!
- Why not?

275
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,916
- It's expensive.
- How much is it?

276
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,825
Fifty five thousand rupees.

277
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,867
How will I watch Raj Kapoor's movies?

278
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,742
I know you are sleeping with her.

279
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,950
I will catch you red-handed, one day.

280
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,950
You like <i>Boomerang, </i>isn't it?

281
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,742
You kiss like a child.

282
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,249
Eat her, why don't you?

283
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,200
You are lying to me.

284
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,582
You text her in my class.

285
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,742
You were glued to each other
at the Comedy Club!

286
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,749
Do you think I'm blind?

287
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,783
Did you play Raj Kapoor's songs
for her as well?

288
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,325
You did, right?

289
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,033
Don't mock me!

290
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,367
I didn't realize

291
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,283
you would be so hurt.

292
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:00,367
She is just using you!

293
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,617
She is just showing-off.

294
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,367
On Instagram, Twitter...
She wants to show-off.

295
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:11,992
She is using you like an Instagram filter.

296
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,249
You are the filter today.

297
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,158
Tomorrow, it will be Rahul.

298
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,950
Don't laugh.

299
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,783
You should break up with her.

300
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,408
Do what you want.

301
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,874
- I didn't realize you would be hurt.
- Why are you repeating yourself?

302
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:47,617
I didn't realize you loved me so much.

303
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,867
I want to be with you.

304
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:54,367
- I will leave her for you.
- Have you lost it?

305
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,492
I'm married!

306
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,742
Please hand me a towel.

307
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,367
Not going to shower?

308
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,908
Dirty bitch!

309
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,700
Naked dog!

310
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:15,783
How are you, Sudha?

311
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:18,033
- All good?
- Yes.

312
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,367
Bless you.

313
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,166
You look very pretty.

314
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:26,832
Ajit said you are taking
good care of the house.

315
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:29,117
- There are fragile things in that.
- Okay.

316
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,533
Okay?

317
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:34,158
The house is very clean.

318
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:42,242
- Do you need anything?
- First, I will take a shower.

319
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,575
Take it.

320
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:47,408
It's so humid here!

321
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:51,374
- Sudha! Put the water heater on.
- Okay.

322
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,533
Listen, should I give her these?

323
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,992
- Give her one.
- Okay.

324
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,033
Keep this bag inside.

325
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,617
This is for you.

326
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,908
Okay?

327
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,950
Come.

328
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:27,242
<i>Close the left nostril
and inhale using the right nostril.</i>

329
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:31,992
<i>Now close the right nostril
and exhale using the left nostril.</i>

330
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:37,242
<i>Again, close the right nostril
and inhale through the left nostril.</i>

331
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,957
<i>Now close the left nostril...</i>

332
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,874
<i>Four terrorists killed in Bandipore
district of Jammu & Kashmir</i>

333
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,200
<i>while attempting to attack a pilgrimage...</i>

334
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,325
- And?
- Three.

335
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,582
I have entered the number.

336
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,825
Wait for the password.

337
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,783
I'll get it.

338
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,749
- Come in.
- Greetings.

339
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,291
- Greetings!
- Welcome.

340
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,117
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

341
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,825
- Hi, dear. Come.
- Hello.

342
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,916
- Hello.
- Hello...

343
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,200
- Did you find parking?
- Yes.

344
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,492
Please sit.

345
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,700
- Please.
- Sit.

346
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:13,158
You guys are early.
People are always late in Mumbai.

347
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,082
We left after the peak hours
and the roads were empty today.

348
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,999
We've been to this neighborhood before.

349
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,117
- I see.
- I didn't remember earlier.

350
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,541
But when we entered

351
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,582
I remembered that her cousin
used to live here.

352
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,916
My cousin's wife's family.

353
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,207
- Sorry.
- I see.

354
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,617
- People are decent here.
- Absolutely.

355
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,707
You're lucky to find a house in
this kind of locality.

356
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,791
He has this one-bedroom flat
because he's a bachelor.

357
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,992
The other flats are nice too.

358
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:46,624
Yes.

359
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:50,541
He comes home just to sleep.
Look at the mess here.

360
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:53,416
I have asked him
to hang a painting at least.

361
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,999
I keep busy.

362
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,492
I am happy that he got the house painted.

363
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:04,908
Guys are always reluctant.
They deserve praise if they eat properly.

364
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,832
Will you have tea or cold drinks?

365
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,325
Lemonade?

366
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,825
Ma'am...

367
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,992
- Some tea for us.
- Yes.

368
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,207
Has Ajit taken you
on a tour of Mumbai yet?

369
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,374
Sudha.

370
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,957
Make six cups of tea

371
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:28,200
and serve some snacks in the new bowls.

372
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,166
I was posted here.

373
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,242
Where?

374
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,082
Dungarsi Road.

375
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,749
He has started with his stories!

376
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,450
We used to live in the same area.
Just behind the Opera House.

377
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,158
We moved to Andheri after we got married.

378
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,700
But Mumbai has changed a lot.

379
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,166
Everything has.

380
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,325
So has Meerut.

381
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:52,166
It's so green now.

382
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:55,416
Mr. Manoj, your area is nice too.

383
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:58,367
It's an old building
but there is greenery around.

384
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,617
Like, you have sea views.
We have tree views.

385
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,416
It's a good one!

386
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,457
You are a "Jokey" man.

387
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,166
The word is "Jovial".

388
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,499
They are the same.

389
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,707
My sister-in-law's family
speaks highly of you.

390
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:19,124
Your brother-in-law is married
into that family, right?

391
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,450
They are the reason we are here.

392
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,617
- Do you come to Mumbai often?
- Not really.

393
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,624
Once a year.

394
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:31,658
But Ajit comes to Meerut on festivals.

395
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:37,033
- Whenever he gets a break.
- Diwali must be spectacular in Meerut!

396
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:41,374
- Absolutely! We get new outfits made.
- I see.

397
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:45,075
- We hold Lakshmi puja...
- We do that too.

398
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:49,916
And they play cards.
It's a cosmopolitan kind of Diwali!

399
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:53,874
We have a Ram Leela performance there.
Ajit had played Ravana once!

400
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,166
Ravana!

401
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,207
He forgot some lines!

402
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,658
He was so nervous.

403
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,457
We will be right back.

404
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,874
Let me show her the house.

405
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,791
- My small flat.
- Sure.

406
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,867
Go ahead.

407
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:21,624
They talk constantly.

408
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,367
Aparna told me that they have met twice.

409
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:27,791
Nowadays, things are finalized
at coffee shops.

410
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,582
- Marriages, business deals.
- Right.

411
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:33,367
Even divorces!

412
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:37,117
- Why are you talking about divorce?
- Why not? It's a fact of life

413
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,291
We will not get divorced.

414
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:41,874
Come on!

415
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,783
Never!

416
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:45,749
They are a good match.

417
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,916
Similar lifestyles and values.

418
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:52,533
The same profession. It's great.

419
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,582
- But mutual understanding is vital.
- Correct.

420
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,207
- If they want to be together...
- That is very important.

421
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,450
True.

422
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:05,450
We saw Aparna for the first time
at Mr. Pramod's funeral.

423
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,700
- Were you there?
- Yes.

424
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,200
He was close to us.

425
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,082
He loved Ajit dearly.

426
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,374
He was a good man.

427
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,916
He introduced us to the astrologer.
We really believe in him.

428
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:19,575
You have faith in him.

429
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,666
We showed him our horoscopes.

430
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,999
- He told us so many things!
- Here comes the tea!

431
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,533
Please come.

432
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,742
Did you add sugar? One more.

433
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,075
- Let him.
- He has diabetes.

434
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:40,825
They are a great match.

435
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,450
Their horoscopes are compatible.

436
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:47,742
Serve them inside.

437
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,742
She makes very good tea.

438
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,617
It is very nice.

439
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,992
People prefer tea bags these days.

440
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,158
Does she cook?

441
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:05,117
She does, but not too well.

442
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,916
And do you cook?

443
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:10,367
- Yes, but not non-veg dishes.
- Are you a vegetarian?

444
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,825
Yes, but Ajit is a carnivore.

445
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,700
The guy has a small brain!

446
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,492
I'm good.

447
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,450
Put it there.

448
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,283
Ajit?

449
00:48:45,307 --> 00:48:56,907
<b>WwW.ZoCine.CoM
Watch Movies And Series!</b>

450
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:11,450
- Mom, should we go?
- Did you show her the house?

451
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:15,117
- What do you think?
- Are you ready to give up chicken?

452
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,033
Congratulations!

453
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:24,624
- Congratulations to you too!
- Congratulations.

454
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:29,033
I knew things would work out today,
so I got some sweets.

455
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:30,992
God bless you!

456
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,832
I will talk to my astrologer
and call you tomorrow.

457
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,166
- Yes, please.
- Definitely.

458
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,416
Ajit!

459
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:38,825
There is no need!

460
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,832
- We'll meet again.
- Sure.

461
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,166
- Congratulations once again.
- To you too.

462
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:46,416
- Keep in touch.
- Sure.

463
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,992
Call us, sometime. Okay.

464
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:59,124
Sudha, Ajit is going to get married!

465
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:03,249
We will finalize the date soon.
Congratulations to you too!

466
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,791
Such a good family.

467
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:08,700
Please take some sweets home.

468
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,624
Only one elevator is working, right?
It's a ten-minute wait if we miss it.

469
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:34,207
I was just about to leave
and Ms. Neha gave me some work.

470
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:37,874
"Dust the painting..." I did that
yesterday. She wanted me to do it again!

471
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:40,207
Am I to blame if someone
is renovating their home?

472
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:43,166
"Sweep the balcony, water the plants..."
Annoying.

473
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,158
Should I show you something?

474
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,908
Ms. Neha gave it to me.

475
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,450
Beautiful, isn't it?

476
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,950
Pure silk and fully embroidered.

477
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,416
I will fix it or drape a scarf over it.

478
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:12,492
It will look perfect.

479
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,242
- Absolutely!
- Isn't it?

480
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,492
I will wear it on my sister's wedding day.

481
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,533
You're not having one?

482
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:50,617
You seem to have had a good day.

483
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,742
Help!

484
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,492
Why can't you swim?

485
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:30,242
My dad wasn't a Country Club member.

486
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,867
- How do I look?
- Like a mother of two.

487
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,283
Tea!

488
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,742
I'm not that fat.

489
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,916
<i>A woman's heart is lighter?</i>

490
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:45,533
But it beats faster.
There are 11 more differences.

491
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:51,867
The girls didn't even call me once.

492
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:54,658
They binge-watching a show?

493
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,992
You are not going to be content...

494
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,666
Talk to me.

495
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,158
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

496
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:26,533
Sure.

497
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,533
<i>Where are you?</i>

498
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,450
I...

499
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,283
<i>Where are you?</i>

500
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,742
At the beach house.

501
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,533
<i>I'm coming over.</i>

502
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,325
Where are you, Salman?

503
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,992
<i>I'm coming.</i>

504
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:45,999
Now?

505
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,367
We decided that you will come
after the housewarming!

506
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,617
Did you send me an email?

507
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:54,325
What about?

508
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,916
<i>I will email you all the details.</i>

509
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:06,499
<i>- I will introduce you to Hardik.</i>
- Who is he?

510
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,874
<i>My lawyer.</i>

511
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,825
What do I say to him?

512
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,992
- Why are you laughing?
<i>- That is the issue.</i>

513
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,533
<i>What I mean is...</i>

514
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:24,249
<i>you will take care of the girls
after I am gone.</i>

515
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,908
What do you mean?

516
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:31,950
<i>Forget it, Sudhir!</i>

517
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:34,950
Salman!

518
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:39,332
<i>You will take care of them
after I am gone.</i>

519
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,908
Where are you going? Where are you now?

520
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,658
<i>On my balcony, drinking.</i>

521
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:49,242
<i>There is no one to give me ice
for the whiskey.</i>

522
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:53,283
Where are the girls?

523
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:57,325
<i>- Watching a movie with the nanny, I guess.</i>
- Did they have dinner?

524
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,450
<i>Why don't you ask their mother?</i>

525
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:05,867
<i>The girls could be starving!
Where is the mother? Who is she with?</i>

526
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,082
<i>And why is her location service disabled?</i>

527
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,999
- What are you talking about?
- <i>Sudhir...</i>

528
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,825
<i>Sudhir, Reena is bored of me.</i>

529
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:19,117
<i>- Got it?</i>
- Salman...

530
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,825
Listen to yourself!

531
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:32,825
<i>In 13 years of our marriage,
she was happy for only 11 months.</i>

532
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:41,700
<i>I bet, she will not answer my call.</i>

533
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:46,242
- Salman, stop the drama.
<i>- Sudhir, listen...</i>

534
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,242
<i>Listen...</i>

535
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,291
- Salman.
<i>- She will not take the call!</i>

536
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,200
<i>I bet.</i>

537
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,533
<i>What if I was in an accident?</i>

538
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,033
You have lost it!

539
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,867
<i>Let the boring husband die!</i>

540
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,075
<i>Are you listening?</i>

541
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,200
<i>Enjoy your beach life.</i>

542
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,992
Find out what's wrong.

543
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:05,408
Nothing is wrong.

544
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:06,825
He is pretending.

545
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,158
Don't tell him I asked you to.

546
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:37,825
What is it, Salman?

547
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:48,783
- You can call Sudhir up but not me.
<i>- He is my buddy. I have every right!</i>

548
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:52,117
I'm at Geeta's.

549
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:53,992
Have you gone nuts?

550
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,408
<i>Assume I have.</i>

551
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:58,325
<i>Tell me this.</i>

552
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:05,700
<i>Why did Geeta tell me
that things are not okay between us</i>

553
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:09,325
<i>and that you are not at her place?</i>

554
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,658
<i>Why did she say that?</i>

555
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:16,242
<i>Reena.</i>

556
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:25,200
He knows.

557
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:27,825
How?

558
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,117
How?

559
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,533
Geeta told him that I'm not with her.

560
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,999
What else has she told him?

561
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,117
How would I know?

562
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:48,325
We don't send each other
messages or emails!

563
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,707
We meet once in a while.

564
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,707
- Are we being followed?
- We are not.

565
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,867
Otherwise, he wouldn't have called Geeta.

566
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,742
What did you tell Geeta?

567
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:07,658
I texted her that I was going on a tour
with my HSBC colleague.

568
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:14,783
I feel guilty.

569
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,408
What have I become?

570
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:20,867
My children are hungry
and my husband is spying on me.

571
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,075
Not Geeta, I'm the bitch.

572
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,992
Tell him you are here.

573
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,242
Tell him you are here to talk to me.

574
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,124
What about?

575
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:41,950
About your fights. Okay?

576
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:46,575
End this Geeta chapter now

577
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,742
or you'll be caught in a lie.

578
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:52,117
Tell him that you came to me for advice.

579
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:58,742
<i>You hung up on me?</i>

580
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:06,033
- At Sudhir's.
<i>- What!</i>

581
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:09,825
- At his beach house.
<i>- What!</i>

582
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:13,242
<i>You're there before the housewarming?</i>

583
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,117
- I needed to talk.
- <i>About what?</i>

584
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,533
About us...

585
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:24,492
Our fights.

586
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:32,874
<i>Do I go to him and rat on you?</i>

587
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,367
<i>In 12 years of our marriage,
I didn't bore you for 10 months.</i>

588
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,408
<i>Do you know why?</i>

589
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,158
In a party.

590
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:49,617
<i>At the Kishore Thadani one, last week?</i>

591
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:51,582
Yes.

592
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:56,207
<i>Reena, Kishore came to our house</i>

593
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:58,158
<i>and you were seeking sympathy?</i>

594
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,666
<i>What else?</i>

595
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:02,200
<i>Kishore Thadani of Sunrise Capital!</i>

596
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:06,499
<i>He will invest 200 crore rupees
in my company!</i>

597
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,992
<i>12 years as a banker
and you have learned nothing!</i>

598
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:17,082
<i>Our daughters' education.</i>

599
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,950
<i>Dad's 10 crore rupees loan and the debt!</i>

600
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:23,332
You or I?

601
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,617
It's a 2 crore loan.

602
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,992
You have selfish motives.

603
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:35,242
Kishore, the beach house and me...
We are trophies for you!

604
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,492
I'm coming home.

605
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:45,283
<i>What if I don't?</i>

606
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:47,832
What do you mean?

607
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:51,575
<i>You said I like to collect trophies.</i>

608
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:54,242
<i>What will you do if
I stop collecting them?</i>

609
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,992
I will live my life.

610
01:04:58,625 --> 01:04:59,950
<i>What is it about?</i>

611
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,908
<i>Branch Manager, MG Road!</i>

612
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:09,117
<i>Tell me. What is its worth?</i>

613
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,617
<i>Your life is</i>

614
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,450
<i>what I permit it to be. Nothing more.</i>

615
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,408
<i>What kind of life will you have
without me?</i>

616
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,075
<i>The girls are hungry. Come home.</i>

617
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:42,283
<i>That's enough.</i>

618
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:43,658
<i>Come back.</i>

619
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:50,908
<i>Reena?</i>

620
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,158
Sudhir,

621
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,825
should we tell Salman?

622
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:17,617
About what?

623
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,450
Start working again.

624
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:34,950
Half of your problems will be solved.

625
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:41,117
What about the remaining half?

626
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:47,908
Salman told me that I should be happy
that he has granted me freedom.

627
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,742
Let's just tell him about it.

628
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,783
What's so complex here?

629
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:06,158
- It's not?
- This is life.

630
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,367
This is an allowance.

631
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:13,450
You know Salman.

632
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,742
- He talks shit and forgets about it.
- I don't.

633
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,533
He will be here soon.

634
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,283
- What?
- I told him to come over.

635
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:40,283
Who did you call?

636
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:44,242
You should have told me.

637
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:45,992
How could you do this?

638
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,783
Is this not about me as well?

639
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:53,325
- Get dressed!
- I am dressed!

640
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:57,117
He wasn't supposed to come here
before the housewarming!

641
01:07:58,292 --> 01:07:59,742
Why are you laughing?

642
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,658
Get dressed!

643
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,374
Wear them.

644
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,617
Why?

645
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,874
You always wear them at home.

646
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:18,742
- Not here.
- I don't want him to notice.

647
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:25,700
What has Salman got to do
with our relationship?

648
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,325
Stop being childish!

649
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,492
I knew that you had a crush on me
in college.

650
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:34,742
Did you ever talk to me?

651
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:39,457
If Salman didn't make a scene.
At Jamshed's party,

652
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:41,075
would you have dropped me off?

653
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:48,367
Would you have kissed me

654
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,700
if I wasn't Salman's wife?

655
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:56,783
Can we meet again if Salman
learns about us?

656
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,575
Sudhir,

657
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:04,908
if he learns the truth...

658
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,783
Our marriage will end.

659
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,582
What about your daughters?

660
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:21,416
Why do you always involve them?

661
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:23,457
- Am I not supposed to?
- No.

662
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:27,033
They will be raised as children
of divorced parents are.

663
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,200
I'm done, Sudhir.

664
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:40,700
I cannot take this anymore.

665
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:45,457
If you want a divorce,
what is the point in telling him?

666
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:48,658
When he sees us together
after our divorce...

667
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:54,117
Us together?

668
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,200
Yes.

669
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,867
Yes.

670
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,075
Forward the email to me.

671
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:29,700
Alright?

672
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:31,408
Okay then. Bye.

673
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,117
It's nice.

674
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:41,242
I repainted the walls.

675
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,916
The contractor's dog died.
So the work stalled.

676
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:45,457
It looks empty, doesn't it?

677
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,867
Empty is good!

678
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,450
We all need space.

679
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:52,117
- Get me a house like this.
- Yours is better, pal!

680
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:55,707
But I have no voice there.

681
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,700
Even this house belonged to a couple.

682
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,367
She looks pretty in your house.

683
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:17,075
How much did it cost you?

684
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:20,700
Not much. It belonged to a couple

685
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:24,158
and I got a good deal out of
the property separation.

686
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:30,700
- What does Kishore Thadani have to say?
- He's your friend. You will know better.

687
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:32,492
He is. Keep at it.

688
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:36,499
She is up to something.

689
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,075
- You provoke her.
- Really?

690
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:42,082
You just know her version.

691
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:44,957
- No one hears me out.
- Did she?

692
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,742
No!

693
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:48,575
She always talks back.

694
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:51,658
"I gave up my career for you and the kids!

695
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:53,908
I could have been something!"

696
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:56,874
She's the Queen of "Could Have Been".

697
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:59,408
Could've been a CEO,
a film star or an Olympian!

698
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:01,325
No matter what...

699
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:03,666
You must not use the word "Allowance"
with her.

700
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,200
But why did she lie...

701
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,575
So what? She is Reena!

702
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:09,957
Don't you get her?

703
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,874
She was the most
sought after girl in college.

704
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,992
No one had the balls to ask her out.

705
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,117
Except you.

706
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,367
Handling family matters is not my forte.

707
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:25,541
Talk to her lovingly and take her home.

708
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,408
Didn't you get married as well?

709
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:31,533
Don't you know?

710
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:33,742
How could I?

711
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:38,874
Your mom sent me the invitation card
six months after I got married.

712
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,749
I ate veg <i>Biryani</i> at your wedding.

713
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:44,916
You went away for a year and then
I heard about your divorce.

714
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:46,908
It has been ten years now! Forget it.

715
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,867
You have bigger worries.

716
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,617
Sometimes I feel like...

717
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:55,533
What did she say?

718
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,158
"She cannot live with me."

719
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,700
Should I divorce her?

720
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,242
Have you lost it?

721
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,158
Listen.

722
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,033
You will never find anyone better.

723
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:27,492
Everything! She loves your daughters.

724
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,950
- You cannot live without her.
- But

725
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,033
Kishore Thadani had come home

726
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:41,207
and she was crying.

727
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,124
When did that happen?

728
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,658
You were right there!

729
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,700
How could she?

730
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,457
Let's watch an action movie tonight.
What do you think, Reena?

731
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:00,075
Sure. Catch a late night show.

732
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,499
It's only a suggestion.

733
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,950
You only suggest
the things you want to do.

734
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:20,158
I sat through that boring movie
you took me to.

735
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:22,950
I didn't complain.

736
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,200
You had decided not to like it.

737
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,908
Who decided this?

738
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:33,033
A movie should entertain.
It should display patriotism or love.

739
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:36,658
You like open-ended movies
and I, black and white.

740
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,374
I'm tired!

741
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,783
Both of you are.

742
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,200
Eat and go to bed.

743
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,742
Am I an idiot?

744
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,124
I drove all the way here.

745
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:52,249
You're wise and I'm an idiot.

746
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,832
- Keep saying it.
- I will.

747
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,082
Remember that guy

748
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,992
- who would say everything three times?
- Yes.

749
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,992
He was so strange!

750
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:05,492
The waiter got three plates of food.

751
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,207
What would he say?

752
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,742
Thapar is going to...

753
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,166
- Where is he now?
- Dallas.

754
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:19,575
He sold his startup
and is living it up there.

755
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:23,283
Let's plan a reunion. Start a group.

756
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,658
Those were the days!
The coffee and the movies!

757
01:15:28,292 --> 01:15:31,492
This guy introduced me to black coffee.

758
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:34,492
- I was broke. He took care of me.
- Sudhir...

759
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,325
Can Salman and I talk?

760
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,117
- Here or...
- Yes.

761
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:50,367
- Is it comfortable here?
- It is.

762
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:10,408
He is right.

763
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:12,700
Wash your hands. Let's go home.

764
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:46,492
<i>Heart Matters. Your YouTube channel.</i>

765
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,367
<i>But how...</i>

766
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,624
<i>I always wanted to be an IAS officer.</i>

767
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,874
<i>My father taught in a Government school.</i>

768
01:16:56,875 --> 01:17:00,117
<i>That is where I went to study.</i>

769
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:04,533
<i>Maybe, that is why my English accent is...</i>

770
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:21,783
It's not that simple.

771
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,867
I get irritated with you.

772
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:30,992
How?

773
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,992
I feel stuck.

774
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:38,867
What does that mean?

775
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:44,117
Tell me what the problem is.

776
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,700
You need a mother, not a wife.

777
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,658
I can't do it.

778
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:00,908
Sudhir saw me crying at Jamshed's party

779
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:04,367
not at Kishore Thadani's.

780
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,283
Sudhir and I

781
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:13,492
have been together for three years.

782
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:23,075
Sudhir Batra? Indiabulls?

783
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,791
<i>My father suffered a stroke.</i>

784
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:34,908
<i>We could not afford the treatment.
He passed away.</i>

785
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:39,450
<i>That is when I decided
to be a heart surgeon.</i>

786
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:44,867
<i>So it all started with a tragedy.</i>

787
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,742
<i>Let me tell you...</i>

788
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:01,158
Sudhir?

789
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:29,783
<i>It is a reversible process.
Take care of it and you will be fine.</i>

790
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,908
<i>We are there to mend its flaws.</i>

791
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:36,408
<i>But I have been more concerned...</i>

792
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,825
Salman wants to talk.

793
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:10,783
Thadani texted.

794
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,367
<i>"Hi Salman."</i>

795
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,825
<i>"Take good care of my money."</i>

796
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,242
Yes.

797
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:50,575
I'm exhausted.

798
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,283
Crash here.

799
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,033
I'll show you the bedroom.

800
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,825
What are the plans for Saturday?

801
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:57,700
Your call.

802
01:23:58,458 --> 01:23:59,700
Golf?

803
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,617
Let's have lunch with Ranjeet after that.

804
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:04,450
Is he back?

805
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,992
How is he doing?

806
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,117
His profile on Tinder says...

807
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:15,658
He can't even catch a Frisbee.

808
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:18,874
- Salman.
- Thadani's team is visiting today.

809
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:21,200
I left my sunglasses inside.

810
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:22,700
Sudhir.

811
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,450
- Sudhir...
- Not now.

812
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,658
We will talk later.

813
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:48,117
Will I see you again?

814
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,533
He said two things

815
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:14,992
And he said...

816
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:21,908
you can't find out

817
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,533
that he knows about us.

818
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,325
- Did you say anything to him?
- No.

819
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,200
What did I say at Jamshed's party?

820
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,367
Nothing.

821
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,749
- So you guys were...
- He called me two days later.

822
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,117
I didn't take it.

823
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,999
I called him back after a week.

824
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,658
After we fought again?

825
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,992
No.

826
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,575
It was a peaceful day.

827
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:45,325
Libertina! The fish was outstanding!

828
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:24,908
Ms. Rekha...

829
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:26,825
Principal.

830
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,617
How's the library?

831
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,374
I got it cleaned.

832
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:34,624
- The books?
- The fans.

833
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,291
Who reads books these days?

834
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,416
The library is always empty.

835
01:27:38,417 --> 01:27:42,992
Come to my office for a cup of tea.
I have asked you several times.

836
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:46,575
I don't drink tea, sir.
I have told you this before.

837
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:48,658
Is that it?

838
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:01,908
The principal's eyes will pop out one day.

839
01:28:03,167 --> 01:28:04,908
Megha...

840
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:07,783
Are you having a tough time?

841
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,825
- I can't do it.
- I know.

842
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:12,992
Come. Let me.

843
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:18,783
Not every person can fire a bullet.

844
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:21,200
Look at me.

845
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:23,325
I am an acclaimed marksman.

846
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:27,658
Be ready to fire one.

847
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:31,658
- Is it too revealing?
- I wish it was.

848
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:35,249
You are too much!

849
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,791
Go! You'll be late!

850
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:38,533
Good luck, soldier!

851
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:41,283
- Megha Verma?
- Yes?

852
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:44,791
This is my daughter, Sanditi.
Sorry, I'm late for the meeting.

853
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,124
She never told me.

854
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:48,291
She is an excellent student!
I have no complaints.

855
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:49,533
I have some.

856
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:52,742
Thank God I checked her phone!

857
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:54,457
Look what she is up to!

858
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:56,457
- She's eating ice cream.
- I am...

859
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:58,749
Did you not like the flavor?

860
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,291
This is an all-girls school.

861
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:04,041
How could she do all this here?

862
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:06,582
She has uploaded it on telegram.

863
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:07,874
It's Instagram, Mom!

864
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:13,283
They participate in debates together.
That's how they have become friends.

865
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,416
Please, Ms. Rekha!

866
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:20,124
You will make them forget our culture!

867
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:22,624
Such a compliment!

868
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,117
Hold on!

869
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:26,499
Can you do something about her uniform?

870
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,617
This skirt is too short.

871
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:33,492
Why not ask them to wear
<i>salwar-kameez</i> instead?

872
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,700
It will keep their legs covered.

873
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:57,242
- Sorry for being late, Paras.
- No problem!

874
01:29:59,292 --> 01:30:01,283
I was hanging out with my friend.

875
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:13,533
So... how are you?

876
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,742
Should we make small talk
or get to the point?

877
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:25,867
Some small talk to start with.

878
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:30,166
Do you need to use a shawl now?

879
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:31,499
I am feeling cold.

880
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,908
Take it off. You are sweating.

881
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:42,658
You can keep it on, if you like.

882
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,158
I'm good.

883
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:54,867
This is our third meeting.
And this time, without our families.

884
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:58,041
So I want to speak openly.

885
01:30:58,042 --> 01:30:59,950
Sure.

886
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:05,200
I'm a little shy.
I have never asked a girl for her number.

887
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:11,242
- No, I did when I took her sari.
- What!

888
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:14,749
"I spilled my drink on her on the train."
So, I kept her sari with me.

889
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:17,124
- You took her sari off on the train?
- Yes!

890
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:18,908
No, I mean...

891
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:22,158
- The next day, I took it to get washed..
- I see.

892
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,783
But the stains were stubborn.

893
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:29,700
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course!

894
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:32,867
Did you spill the drink intentionally?

895
01:31:34,917 --> 01:31:36,700
Please, Megha.

896
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:42,999
I studied in an all-boys school.
I don't have game.

897
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,291
I have heard that all-boys school students

898
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:49,700
often treat all-girls school students
to ice creams.

899
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,283
What!

900
01:31:55,167 --> 01:31:57,450
You are smart, Megha.

901
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:01,867
You are trying to distract me
but it won't work.

902
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:08,450
Shall we get to the point?

903
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:10,950
- No.
- Why not?

904
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,082
He's a nice boy!

905
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:15,658
He has a good job! He has good values.

906
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:19,033
He is respectable and respectful.

907
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,033
He is not fair skinned

908
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,117
but you balance that out.

909
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,575
So what is the problem?

910
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,749
I cannot judge guys.

911
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,033
What do you mean?

912
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:36,658
I did not study in a coed school.

913
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:39,658
No freedom or allowance.

914
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:44,624
I wasn't brave enough to
meet boys from other schools

915
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,117
or hang out with them

916
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:50,492
or eat ice creams together.

917
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,825
That is why I want you

918
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:58,033
to get married.

919
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,700
You can have ice cream
to your heart's delight.

920
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:34,075
<i>This is amazing!</i>

921
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:56,408
- Looking for someone?
- Friends show up to prank us, I heard.

922
01:33:58,583 --> 01:33:59,992
No one did.

923
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:02,992
Please come in.

924
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:11,700
They must have gotten
wasted and gone home.

925
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:14,783
- Come on.
- What!

926
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:21,575
Sit.

927
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,749
If you could be an animal,
which one would you be?

928
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,408
What kind of a question is that?

929
01:34:41,792 --> 01:34:45,700
At work we ask silly questions a lot.
But, it's fun.

930
01:34:48,042 --> 01:34:51,033
- So tell me.
- Animal?

931
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,408
A cat.

932
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:55,783
A cat!

933
01:34:57,542 --> 01:34:59,325
They have nine lives.

934
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,825
Seven with me... and an another two!

935
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:04,742
Meow!

936
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:09,200
What about you?

937
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,533
An alligator.

938
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,367
The sleeping devil.

939
01:35:17,167 --> 01:35:18,658
Beware! He can bite!

940
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:23,166
Do you know anything about alligators?

941
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:24,332
No.

942
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,457
I have watched Nat Geo a lot.

943
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:30,992
Male alligators blow bubbles in the water.

944
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:32,867
Really!

945
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:34,492
Why?

946
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:37,200
To attract the females!

947
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,825
To excite them.

948
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:43,033
- Do you want some water?
- I'm fine!

949
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:46,950
Okay, I'll have some.

950
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,200
Congratulations.

951
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:03,575
Are you drying your hair?

952
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:13,742
Are you drying the clothes?

953
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,992
Are you chopping tomatoes?

954
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:57,450
No.

955
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:17,033
Mom is happy as long as the neighbors are.

956
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:23,332
I will be happy only when
I become a grandma of two.

957
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:26,332
Mom! You never fail to mention that.

958
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,825
Keep quiet.

959
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,999
Only us women will understand.

960
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,742
- What do you say?
- Right.

961
01:38:32,042 --> 01:38:36,367
You guys talk,
we are going to go get some air.

962
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:46,158
Listen to us, Megha.

963
01:38:47,042 --> 01:38:49,249
Look at my other daughter-in-law.

964
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:51,117
She is so happy.

965
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,658
She had two kids, one after the other.

966
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:59,457
She spends the whole day
looking after them.

967
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:01,541
She does not need to
break a sweat anymore.

968
01:39:01,542 --> 01:39:04,492
- Break a sweat?
- Yes.

969
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,742
Listen,

970
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:10,416
your mother-in-law squawks all day

971
01:39:10,417 --> 01:39:12,700
and the bed squeaks all night.

972
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:17,575
This will end once you have kids.

973
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:22,742
When desires are fulfilled,
the toil will end.

974
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:27,033
What if they are not?

975
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:28,742
Come on!

976
01:39:30,042 --> 01:39:31,367
Tell me something,

977
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:35,283
does a woman desire
anything more than a child?

978
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,033
No.

979
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,200
There you go.

980
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:50,950
So this is why you are upset. I noticed

981
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:53,992
what mom said upset you.

982
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:58,492
Don't worry about her.
We will have a kid later.

983
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,700
We must make love now.

984
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,617
Endlessly.

985
01:40:03,917 --> 01:40:06,416
You look so happy after marriage.

986
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,124
You are always excited!

987
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:09,207
Hey!

988
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:12,200
So are you.

989
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:14,450
You are happy, too.

990
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:21,200
Have you ever watched an adult film?

991
01:40:21,792 --> 01:40:22,950
What?

992
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:26,533
Have you?

993
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,624
Yes.

994
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,457
Back in college.

995
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,825
Even last month... Why?

996
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,783
When the guy says...

997
01:40:43,333 --> 01:40:45,158
And the girl says...

998
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:54,325
They have a good time together.

999
01:40:54,708 --> 01:40:56,117
Together.

1000
01:40:58,583 --> 01:40:59,825
Yes!

1001
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:02,117
I have never understood that!

1002
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:04,541
You either talk or have sex!

1003
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:06,582
Do either of the two.

1004
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:09,158
Why do it together?

1005
01:41:09,292 --> 01:41:11,325
At work,

1006
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,249
I either check the accounts or type.

1007
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,166
I never do both together.

1008
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:17,783
It doesn't make sense.

1009
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:19,575
Look! Birds!

1010
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:26,575
Take these birds for example.

1011
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:28,874
They either lay eggs or fly.

1012
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,825
Have you seen a flying bird lay eggs?

1013
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:41,283
What's wrong?

1014
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:43,541
Nothing...

1015
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:46,283
Megha, the Principal has called you.

1016
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:49,575
Go.

1017
01:41:53,292 --> 01:41:56,457
Tell me what to do.

1018
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:59,874
Look at the books in this school!
Why would you issue such a book?

1019
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:01,666
- It was not me...
- Hold on.

1020
01:42:01,667 --> 01:42:03,450
She did not issue the book.

1021
01:42:05,917 --> 01:42:09,158
Who else could it be?

1022
01:42:09,542 --> 01:42:12,783
No wonder. She's a divorcee after all.

1023
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,367
Let me take a look at it.

1024
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:20,492
I see.

1025
01:42:21,417 --> 01:42:22,658
What is it about?

1026
01:42:23,042 --> 01:42:24,992
- I have not read it, sir.
<i>- Lolita!</i>

1027
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:29,867
Read it.
It is about an incestual relationship.

1028
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:32,124
So you have read it.

1029
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:33,533
No!

1030
01:42:33,667 --> 01:42:37,908
I do not read such filthy stories!
She and her father have read it!

1031
01:42:42,042 --> 01:42:44,291
Call Ms. Rekha.

1032
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:45,624
Right.

1033
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:46,950
Jaswant!

1034
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,783
- Ask Ms. Rekha to come here at once.
- Sure.

1035
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:51,207
This is a wildlife book!

1036
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:52,291
I have no idea!

1037
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:53,499
I will fix it.

1038
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,200
Where is Ms. Rekha?

1039
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,617
Let me check on her.

1040
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,658
It's no big deal!

1041
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:05,700
Why in the library?

1042
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,825
I had two fantasies.

1043
01:45:10,042 --> 01:45:11,950
Let me tell you.

1044
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:15,075
An airplane toilet

1045
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:17,783
and in a library.

1046
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:21,867
I fulfilled one fantasy today.

1047
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:26,658
Men are selfish.

1048
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:29,283
They cannot make a woman happy.

1049
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:31,617
We have to do it ourselves.

1050
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:33,908
And the principal

1051
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:37,033
took away my happiness
and my husband as well.

1052
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:38,408
Husband?

1053
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:39,950
Yes.

1054
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:42,408
It's always with me.

1055
01:45:42,542 --> 01:45:43,950
It does not talk

1056
01:45:44,167 --> 01:45:46,283
and satisfies me.

1057
01:45:46,542 --> 01:45:48,575
It's the best husband ever!

1058
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:53,283
Anyway, see you later.

1059
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:06,742
What happened?

1060
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,408
It's Sunday.

1061
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,992
Hello, Grandma.

1062
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:19,992
- Have you seen the TV remote?
- No.

1063
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,325
Where is it?

1064
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:26,075
Megha!

1065
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:30,283
Megha! Something has happened to Paras.

1066
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:33,874
Sandhya! Get the First Aid kit!

1067
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:35,408
- Hurry up!
- Does it hurt?

1068
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:36,867
Paras!

1069
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,783
- Sit beside me.
- Easy, Paras.

1070
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:42,874
Are you all right?

1071
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:45,124
Forget about her! How did this happen?

1072
01:48:45,125 --> 01:48:48,950
It was my fault, Mom!

1073
01:48:49,333 --> 01:48:52,541
I felt like she needed me.

1074
01:48:52,542 --> 01:48:56,332
I took a rickshaw
and asked the driver to hurry.

1075
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:59,908
And we collided with a bull.

1076
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:05,783
It's my fault.

1077
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:09,700
The rickshaw toppled, throwing me out.

1078
01:49:10,083 --> 01:49:12,158
I lost consciousness for some time.

1079
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,450
People seek light in the dark

1080
01:49:18,042 --> 01:49:19,867
but all I wanted was you.

1081
01:49:20,458 --> 01:49:21,658
Megha.

1082
01:49:22,208 --> 01:49:23,700
Megha.

1083
01:49:24,208 --> 01:49:27,582
Go get him a glass of water!

1084
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:28,658
Look over here.

1085
01:49:32,417 --> 01:49:35,908
There it is!

1086
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:48,242
- Take it easy.
- Just blow on it gently!

1087
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,658
Why is this not working?

1088
01:51:39,292 --> 01:51:42,742
- Listen to me...
- Not at all!

1089
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:46,242
Tell me why we should accept her.

1090
01:51:46,875 --> 01:51:51,499
We'll tell our relatives
that she's epileptic

1091
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:55,283
to save face.

1092
01:51:59,042 --> 01:52:02,492
Please let's not speak of divorce.

1093
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:06,283
- I beg you...
- There is no need for that.

1094
01:52:10,292 --> 01:52:15,749
We do not want a child from her.

1095
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:18,283
Enough, Mom.

1096
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:20,783
This is between us.

1097
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:24,492
It would be if it happened in the bedroom.

1098
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:29,367
But, it didn't,
and so, it's a family matter!

1099
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:31,825
I have heard enough!

1100
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,075
Don't come home
if you can't live without her.

1101
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:38,867
Goodbye.

1102
01:52:39,833 --> 01:52:43,658
- Listen to me.
- I don't want to.

1103
01:53:27,292 --> 01:53:29,950
- Sorry for being late.
- It's all right.

1104
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:32,950
I always arrive early.

1105
01:53:33,042 --> 01:53:35,124
It was the annual day program at school.

1106
01:53:35,125 --> 01:53:36,450
How was it?

1107
01:53:36,917 --> 01:53:38,950
Should we get to the point?

1108
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:43,117
Megha.

1109
01:53:43,542 --> 01:53:45,825
Let's forget what happened.

1110
01:53:46,375 --> 01:53:48,200
We can start again.

1111
01:53:49,708 --> 01:53:52,575
I apologize for what my mom did.

1112
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:56,533
But I cannot divorce you.

1113
01:53:58,667 --> 01:54:00,742
- It was just a mistake...
- Paras!

1114
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:05,158
I didn't make a mistake.

1115
01:54:07,167 --> 01:54:09,325
What happened was not wrong.

1116
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:17,075
But it shouldn't have happened there.

1117
01:54:20,042 --> 01:54:22,658
Women desire more than just children.

1118
01:54:35,375 --> 01:54:36,867
So

1119
01:54:38,625 --> 01:54:40,367
What have you decided?

1120
01:54:43,125 --> 01:54:44,992
What do you want to do?

1121
01:54:46,417 --> 01:54:48,992
I don't know.

1122
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,742
But for now

1123
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:01,367
I want some ice cream.

1124
01:55:01,391 --> 01:55:21,391
