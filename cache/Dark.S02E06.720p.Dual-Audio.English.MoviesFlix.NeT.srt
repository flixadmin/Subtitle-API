1
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,838
Where did it all begin?

2
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:12,505
Where did things begin?

3
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,130
In the past?

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,713
In the future?

5
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:24,796
Who can say where it began?

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,005
Welcome to the future.

7
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:35,255
I want all this sick shit to stop!

8
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:40,421
Will we ever be capable of knowing

9
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,588
the origin of all things?

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,046
Or is there still an origin before that?

11
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,380
And before that?

12
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:50,588
And before that?

13
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:55,338
Do beginning and end even exist?

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,713
Or is it

15
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:00,921
all connected in an endless loop,

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,838
and are "beginning" and "end"

17
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:05,588
just different words

18
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,755
for one and the same moment?

19
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:09,421
Mikkel?

20
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,963
Mikkel!

21
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,171
Somehow, sometime

22
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,588
The future starts somewhere

23
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:51,005
I won't wait much longer now

24
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:56,921
Love is created through bravery
So don't think about it twice

25
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:01,296
We ride on fiery wheels
Towards the future through the night

26
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:26,338
Boo!

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,963
Good morning.

28
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,338
Good morning, sleepyhead.

29
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,255
So?

30
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:39,671
- What are your plans?
- I'm off to the lake with the others.

31
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,588
It's supposed to storm later, you know?

32
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:48,213
- Morning.
- Morning.

33
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,088
Don't forget
Katharina and Ulrich's party today.

34
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,755
- Don't be back so late again, okay?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,463
Sure you don't want to come?

36
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,171
Anyone want coffee?

37
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:13,588
Fuck.

38
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,713
Right. I've got to go.

39
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:37,671
You okay, Dad?

40
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,838
Yeah, I'm fine.

41
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:43,046
Everything's all right.

42
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:46,005
I just had déjà vu...

43
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:52,171
Okay. See you later.

44
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,505
Don't you think it'd be good
if you got out?

45
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:34,713
Won't you at least try?

46
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,796
For me.

47
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,296
I still have to finish my picture.

48
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,338
JUNE 20, 2019

49
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:22,088
THE DAY BEFORE
MICHAEL COMMITS SUICIDE

50
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:20,546
What's up?

51
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:25,796
I've got so much to do today.

52
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,546
I'm getting my period
and haven't shaved in ages.

53
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,338
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care.

54
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,963
- Sorry. I can't.
- You can.

55
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:38,130
- Ulrich, I can't.
- Couldn't you guys knock for once?

56
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:40,588
I think I'm sick.

57
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm covered in red spots.

58
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,296
Maybe I have dengue fever?

59
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,838
Come here.

60
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:54,505
Shit!

61
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,755
You've got rubella.

62
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:04,255
You had to pick
today of all days for this?

63
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:08,380
Come on, we're going to the doctor's.

64
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,255
MURDER IN MARBURG UNSOLVED
33 YEARS LATER

65
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:30,921
SEARCH FOR TWO FUGITIVE PERPS
STILL ON

66
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,505
Will you come by later?

67
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:41,796
- This afternoon, to the hotel for lunch.
- Yes, of course.

68
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,213
Is everything all right?

69
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:45,921
Yes.

70
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:47,755
Are you sure?

71
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:55,671
Till later then.

72
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:15,338
Hey!

73
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,671
Where are the kids?

74
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,296
I was at the nursing home.

75
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:39,296
Shall we just go on like this?

76
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,671
That you won't believe anything I say?

77
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:46,296
Say something!

78
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:59,171
Maybe this is why all this happened.

79
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:05,546
Because I get nothing from you. Nothing.

80
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,088
It's as if you're dead inside.

81
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,921
About tonight...

82
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:20,005
I think it's best
if I go to the Nielsens' alone.

83
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,921
Do you know
about the lady who drowned here?

84
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:44,421
Stop it!

85
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:48,630
When the water is clear
you can see her dress down there.

86
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,296
And sometimes you feel her hands
on your feet while swimming.

87
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,130
But that's not the worst thing.

88
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,713
The worst thing is, when she's hungry.

89
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,921
Then she drags people down to her.

90
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,255
Asshole!

91
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,255
Ha-ha, real funny.

92
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:36,671
You coming tonight?

93
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,046
I think so.

94
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:58,963
I sometimes wonder
if my parents are really happy together.

95
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,921
Or if people just make do
with what they have.

96
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,546
Are your parents happy?

97
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:15,963
No idea.

98
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:39,880
What's that?

99
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:43,630
Looks pretty old.

100
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:49,546
That's Saint Christopher.

101
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,046
The patron saint of travelers.

102
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:58,963
Don't ask.

103
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,255
Hey, Jonas.

104
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,505
Weren't you guys going to the lake?

105
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:40,130
Martha and Magnus left long ago.

106
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,671
Ultimate fist bump?

107
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,505
Don't touch that pestilent boy.
He has rubella.

108
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:52,546
Where's your bike?

109
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:54,630
Should we give you a ride?

110
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:56,546
See you tonight then.

111
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,588
I know one person who'd be really glad
if you came, and it's not Magnus.

112
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:02,921
- Ulrich!
- Why?

113
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,630
It's no secret Martha's nuts about him.

114
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:06,838
Stop it!

115
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:09,671
Come on, get in.
We'll drop you off at the lake.

116
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,755
No, it's okay. Really.

117
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,338
- All right.
- Okay.

118
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,005
Then see you later, Romeo.

119
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,588
Gosh.

120
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:00,296
Magnus?

121
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:02,338
You weren't moving and I...

122
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:06,463
I... I thought you were dead.
He said there was a dead body there.

123
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,046
Still plenty alive.

124
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:16,296
Cool.

125
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,088
ARIADNE
A STAGE PLAY

126
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,046
Something up?

127
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,505
I was...

128
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,588
I was just thinking...

129
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:55,421
Wouldn't you sometimes like to know
what happens next?

130
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,921
You mean in the future?

131
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:08,421
Yes, or...

132
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,963
maybe just in the next five minutes.

133
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:15,463
I...

134
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,505
sometimes get this feeling

135
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,296
that something is about to happen.

136
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,463
You know?

137
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,255
Attack!

138
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:41,671
Fuck!

139
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:44,463
What's up?

140
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,213
I've got to go.

141
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,630
Where?

142
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:54,421
We gave Grandma Ines
a tablet for her birthday.

143
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,130
- I'm supposed to show her how it works.
- Okay.

144
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:01,338
Then...

145
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,088
see you later.

146
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,505
Jonas?

147
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:11,546
Why do you have a raincoat?

148
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:15,088
Because it's supposed to rain later.

149
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,088
Well, then...

150
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:04,713
Weren't you leaving?

151
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,255
Everything okay?

152
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,588
I thought I still had time.

153
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:41,671
Why do people say that anyway?

154
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,463
"To have time."

155
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:50,838
How can you have time
when it clearly has you?

156
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,213
Has something happened?

157
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:08,005
You're different somehow.

158
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,421
I wanted to tell you something.

159
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:20,213
I've wanted to for a long time.

160
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,755
I think we're a perfect match.

161
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,921
Never think anything else.

162
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,963
I've got to go now.

163
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,921
- Hi.
- Hello.

164
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:19,213
Hey.
Did Captain Nielsen make you work too?

165
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,130
All the best on your wedding anniversary.

166
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:26,463
Crazy, isn't it? It's been 25 years.
Thanks for the glasses, Hannah.

167
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,796
No problem at all.

168
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,921
Well, who would have thought that?

169
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,213
25 years.

170
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,255
- I need to pee.
- Just go on the tree there.

171
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,588
Can he use your bathroom?

172
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,588
Hannah?

173
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:01,588
Hello?

174
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:07,046
- Right, then go in the woods.
- No, sure. Nonsense.

175
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,505
It's just across from the front door.

176
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:13,921
I just had déjà vu or something.

177
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,255
- Mikkel has gotten big.
- He eats like an ogre.

178
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,421
- He got that from his mother.
- Hey, now!

179
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:19,255
Want more?

180
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,296
- See you.
- Till tomorrow.

181
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,963
Martha...

182
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:28,296
Sorry I can't come over later, but...

183
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:31,796
we've got a party,
for my mother and the hotel...

184
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:34,046
I just couldn't get out of it.

185
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:35,713
I just wanted to tell you that.

186
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:38,838
No biggie.

187
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:40,255
And I...

188
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,588
I really like...

189
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,588
your hair that way.

190
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:48,213
I mean, you look good.

191
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,171
With that hair.

192
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:53,963
Shit. You know what I mean.

193
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:56,671
Well...

194
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,296
See you tomorrow.

195
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:01,671
Bye.

196
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:02,838
Bye.

197
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,130
MURDER IN MARBURG UNSOLVED
33 YEARS LATER

198
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,963
Wöller, it's me.

199
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,755
I need you to find something out for me.

200
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:39,005
Confidentially.

201
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:45,213
Give me your hand
I'll build a castle out of sand for you

202
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:50,255
Somehow, somewhere, somewhen

203
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:54,963
The time has come
For some tenderness tonight

204
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:59,213
Somehow, somewhere, somewhen

205
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,421
- Hello, Martha.
- Hi.

206
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:02,546
Hi.

207
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:04,921
Glad you made it.

208
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:08,296
Want a drink?

209
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,630
Yeah, sure.

210
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:11,755
Hey!

211
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,088
- Well?
- Hey.

212
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,963
It was meant to be a garden party,
but this is much cozier.

213
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:18,671
I brought tiramisu.

214
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:21,713
This is my favorite song. I have to dance.

215
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:26,588
- Where's the champagne?
- Under the table.

216
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:29,713
- Great. Thank you.
- We're so proud of you!

217
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:34,046
I guess you deserve
at least a driver's license for that.

218
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,130
- No!
- Yes.

219
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,213
- For real?
- I promise.

220
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:39,505
- Charlotte!
- Awesome!

221
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,255
- You have to dance with me.
- No.

222
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:43,796
- Yes!
- No. Katharina, please no.

223
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:46,630
- Hey.
- Hey.

224
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:47,755
Well?

225
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:51,421
Do you know where this goes?

226
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:52,796
Over there.

227
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:56,921
Where's Peter?

228
00:26:57,505 --> 00:26:58,796
Summer cold.

229
00:27:00,546 --> 00:27:01,755
And Michael?

230
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,296
Something similar.

231
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:06,963
- I'll take this over.
- Sure.

232
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:09,088
Champagne!

233
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,213
Thank you!

234
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:14,213
Hannah!

235
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,713
Come on, live a little.

236
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,171
Glad you came.

237
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:22,380
Glad you all made it! Cheers!

238
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:24,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

239
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:25,838
To our health.

240
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:31,796
- Now dance with me, old-timer.
- Sure.

241
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:03,713
Jonas?

242
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,880
I thought I heard something.

243
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:12,505
How come you're not at the Nielsens'?

244
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:21,005
Did something happen?

245
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,296
Hey...

246
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:36,296
Everything okay?

247
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:44,796
What's with your hair?

248
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,588
I know.

249
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,713
What do you know?

250
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,630
I know everything.

251
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:15,880
What?

252
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,546
Ultimate fist bump?

253
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:30,296
What?

254
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,005
Why did you just say that?

255
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,671
Because I know, Dad.

256
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:42,963
I know everything.

257
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:49,005
I know your real name is Mikkel Nielsen.

258
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:56,421
It's okay.

259
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:00,046
Forgive me.

260
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:20,713
Even younger and prettier.

261
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,046
- I thought you'd pop with the third.
- How mean!

262
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,630
What a sweet girl.

263
00:31:26,713 --> 00:31:29,463
Sweet girl? That's Magnus!

264
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,671
- What's wrong?
- I can't sleep.

265
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:36,421
Oh, no.

266
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:39,713
You're burning up.

267
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,546
- Look at these two ugly monsters.
- Let's get you upstairs.

268
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:47,005
I loved that dress.

269
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:49,130
You two are very sexy.

270
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:55,421
There you go.

271
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,963
- Sleep well. Night-night.
- Can you stay here till I fall asleep?

272
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,963
Slide over.

273
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:27,671
So you're from the future then?

274
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,755
And why are you here now?

275
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:40,921
Because I need to ask you for something.

276
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:44,713
What?

277
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,255
Not to do it.

278
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:50,588
Not to do what?

279
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,963
It's Ulrich and Katharina's anniversary.

280
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:58,338
You didn't go along, like always.
You stayed here.

281
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:02,005
But something was different.

282
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,630
I should've noticed something was up.

283
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:06,921
Jonas...

284
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:09,713
- I have no idea what...
- Don't lie to me!

285
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:12,505
I know! God fucking damn it!

286
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:16,546
I know you'll hang yourself in the studio.

287
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:22,255
Have you already written the letter?

288
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:24,296
What letter?

289
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,255
The letter you write to me.

290
00:33:28,296 --> 00:33:30,213
Not to me, to the younger me.

291
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:40,171
The one marked: "Do not open
before November 4, 10:13 p.m."

292
00:33:40,255 --> 00:33:43,255
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 p.m.

293
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:46,546
The very minute you vanish.

294
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,505
I'm here so you don't do it.

295
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,463
It's all intertwined.

296
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:08,005
Like an endless loop.

297
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,380
But you...

298
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:12,171
you killing yourself,

299
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:14,338
that's the start.

300
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:38,671
Promise me you won't do it.

301
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:43,588
Dad, you have to promise me.

302
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:45,630
Please.

303
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:47,088
Promise.

304
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,046
You forgot this at the lake.

305
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,755
I put it on a cord.

306
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:25,005
Thanks.

307
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:35,338
I thought about what you said at the lake.

308
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:41,630
About grandmas? And the internet?

309
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:01,505
I think you're right.

310
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:08,755
Okay.

311
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:53,380
The night you vanished,

312
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,213
you were there and then suddenly gone.

313
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:00,255
Did you go back to the cave?

314
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:02,796
How did you find the passage there?

315
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:06,421
I didn't find it.

316
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,296
Someone showed it to me.

317
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:11,963
Who?

318
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:16,213
You.

319
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,088
What do you mean?

320
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:28,380
We were by the caves.

321
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,546
- What'll you give me for it?
- A kick in the ass.

322
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,046
What's in here is easily worth 500.
It's yours for 200.

323
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,338
- Daddy's got plenty of money.
- Blah-blah-blah.

324
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,796
Stop the bullshit.

325
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,755
Just give it to me.

326
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:42,005
Jackpot!

327
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:43,421
There was this strange noise.

328
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:48,380
What is that?

329
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:51,213
We were all sure someone was there.

330
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,838
Someone's there.

331
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:54,463
Shit.

332
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,088
What was that?

333
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:03,630
- Shit.
- What's going on?

334
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:05,921
What's wrong with the damn flashlights?

335
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:08,463
Come on, run!

336
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:10,505
Now! Let's go!

337
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:21,421
We ran.

338
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:23,338
Then I lost you.

339
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:28,088
I turned around and you were gone.

340
00:38:31,796 --> 00:38:33,630
But suddenly you were back again.

341
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:35,796
Quick!

342
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,338
This way.

343
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:43,463
You said there was something there,
in the forest.

344
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:45,296
Something evil.

345
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:48,255
And that we had to return to the cave.

346
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,005
You brought me all the way to the door,
and through the tunnel.

347
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:55,671
I was so afraid.

348
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:57,630
But you held my hand.

349
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:02,130
And then you said,
"We have to stay here, all night,

350
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:05,921
but when morning comes
everything will be all right."

351
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:08,921
And when I woke up you were gone.

352
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,671
All these years I've tried to understand

353
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:18,088
why you did that.

354
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:22,838
But then,
at some point it all just faded away.

355
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:26,546
It became ever more unreal, like a dream.

356
00:39:30,296 --> 00:39:32,130
But that's impossible.

357
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,588
I never did that.

358
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,921
I saw myself today.

359
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,505
Mikkel.

360
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:45,921
It's all returning.

361
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:47,713
That coat, you.

362
00:39:48,463 --> 00:39:50,296
As if it's all falling into place.

363
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:55,338
Maybe you're not here to stop me at all.

364
00:39:56,921 --> 00:40:00,755
But rather to show me
what it is I have to do.

365
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,796
Maybe you only showed me the letter

366
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,171
so I know what's in it,
so I go and you live.

367
00:40:07,713 --> 00:40:09,338
No, that can't be.

368
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:11,130
That can't be.

369
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:13,463
He told me I could stop the origin.

370
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,380
If you don't kill yourself,
none of the rest will happen.

371
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:19,338
But if none of the rest happens,

372
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,296
you won't be born.

373
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,713
And maybe your role in all this
is much greater than you think.

374
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,213
And perhaps

375
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,213
I'm just a small part of a huge cancer

376
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:36,713
that is much greater
than any of us can imagine.

377
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,505
- Someone has said that to me before.
- Who?

378
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:45,880
Me.

379
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:52,421
God doesn't err.

380
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:54,546
He has a plan.

381
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:57,213
For each of us.

382
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,963
I've waited a long time
for the moment we'd meet again.

383
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,463
Who are you?

384
00:41:16,296 --> 00:41:17,796
Are you with Adam?

385
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,838
There are two sides out there.

386
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:23,963
He is the darkness.
I don't follow him, I follow the light.

387
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:25,963
He lied to you.

388
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:30,755
He brought you here to trigger everything
so it happens as it always has.

389
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:32,130
No, that can't be.

390
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:35,296
Adam wants this too.

391
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:37,713
No, he does not.

392
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:41,963
He doesn't want to fix things.
He wants to destroy them forever.

393
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:46,296
Your role in all of this
is much greater than you believe.

394
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,671
Only you alone can put an end to all this.

395
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:51,880
What does that mean?

396
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:56,005
We're at war,
and you have to wage it against yourself.

397
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:58,088
Against Adam.

398
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,213
But if I don't exist,

399
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,505
if I'm not born,

400
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,921
then Adam won't exist either.

401
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:08,130
I've seen the world without you.

402
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:10,630
Believe me,

403
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,880
it isn't what you're expecting.

404
00:42:14,796 --> 00:42:18,921
There are times in life when you must see
that the decisions you make

405
00:42:19,005 --> 00:42:21,296
affect more than your own destiny.

406
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:24,046
This isn't just about you and Mikkel.

407
00:42:25,213 --> 00:42:26,713
This is about everyone.

408
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:28,421
Your mother.

409
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,963
Your friends.

410
00:42:31,296 --> 00:42:32,421
Martha.

411
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:35,005
You alone can save them.

412
00:42:36,963 --> 00:42:38,380
What does that mean?

413
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:45,588
We all have to make sacrifices.

414
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:47,921
Your father must make sacrifices too.

415
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,921
It's okay.

416
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,130
Is this the apocalypse?

417
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,755
A bit disappointing.

418
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:30,421
I imagined it being louder.

419
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,255
More glaring.

420
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:45,546
If the world ended tomorrow
and everything started anew,

421
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,255
what would you wish for?

422
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:54,921
A world without Winden.

423
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:02,130
And you?

424
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:19,338
Dear Jonas,

425
00:49:19,963 --> 00:49:23,505
by the time you read this everything
will have already happened, irrevocably.

426
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:26,296
It can no longer be changed.

427
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:30,630
I would have liked
to explain things to you sooner,

428
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,046
but I hope once you understand
how everything is connected,

429
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:38,130
you will understand my decision.

430
00:49:39,296 --> 00:49:41,421
The truth is a strange thing.

431
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,713
You can try to suppress it,

432
00:49:45,421 --> 00:49:47,671
but it will always find its way
to the surface.

433
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,713
We make a lie into our truth
in order to survive.

434
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:56,255
We try to forget.

435
00:49:57,005 --> 00:49:58,421
Until we can't anymore.

436
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:03,005
We don't know
even half of the mysteries of this world.

437
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,755
We are wanderers in the darkness.

438
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:18,588
You could have told him.

439
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:21,880
You could have told him
what his task in all of this is.

440
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:24,421
What path you really sent him down.

441
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,880
Not much longer
until the last cycle begins.

442
00:50:39,046 --> 00:50:41,838
We all have to make sacrifices, Magnus.
