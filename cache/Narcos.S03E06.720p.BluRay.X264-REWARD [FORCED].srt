1
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,125
The guy is innocent.
He didn't do any of it.

2
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,629
Easy, honey, easy, OK?
Be careful.

3
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,800
- The glove.
- Screw the fucking glove, brother.

4
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,846
- That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
- He's an asshole.

5
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,474
- And he's been fucking the sister.
- Which one?

6
00:00:56,599 --> 00:01:01,645
The sister! I don't even know her name.
Geraldo is fucking her, too.

7
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,774
OK, guys, listen up.

8
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,070
Understood?

9
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,982
Good morning, gentlemen.

10
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,567
Good morning.

11
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,818
As many of you know,

12
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,488
since Córdova's resignation,
I am the head of security.

13
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:21,121
It's festival time.
That means the city will be crowded.

14
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:26,793
The festival is not an excuse
to party on the job.

15
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:32,090
One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

16
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,719
Let's make them feel welcome.

17
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,430
And help them any way you can.

18
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,935
That's all, boys. Get going!

19
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,819
Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

20
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,738
You're a natural.

21
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:01,161
Look, David, if we're going to work together,
we need to cooperate.

22
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,792
If you have questions or you want to talk
about your father's security...

23
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,670
I'm here.

24
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,922
Thank you.

25
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,508
I do have a question, Jorge.

26
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,802
How come none of your men
carry fucking guns?

27
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,391
Because we use our walkies
if we have a problem.

28
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:27,562
For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

29
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,940
Do me a favour, Jorge.

30
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,819
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right?

31
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,790
Boss, you didn't mention the DEA agents
that are in Cali.

32
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,500
That's something David
might be interested in.

33
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,086
Listen, the last thing we need right now

34
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,089
is David and his crew
killing a federal agent, no?

35
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,717
Well, that's true.

36
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,095
For now, we'll monitor the DEA ourselves.

37
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,932
Besides... I doubt they have much.

38
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,565
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

39
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,696
- Why, Chepe?
- My love...

40
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,949
I know you don't want to leave New York.

41
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,659
I know.

42
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,245
I don't either.

43
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,458
But if they connect this lab to us...

44
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,670
we're going to have every cop in the city
after us.

45
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,256
Hey, look.

46
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,134
- Here it comes.
<i>- Spokesmen for the DEA say</i>

47
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,511
<i>that the cocaine lab that exploded in Queens</i>

48
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,597
<i>was operated by a Dominican gang.</i>

49
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,809
Exactly! Thank you, lady.
Fucking Dominicans!

50
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:52,230
<i>But Manuel de Dios, editor of</i> La Prensa,
<i>has discovered another side to the story.</i>

51
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,858
<i>This lab, along with a number
of others in the area,</i>

52
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,612
<i>was recently seized
by Colombian gangsters,</i>

53
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,282
<i>led by a man going by the name
of Victor Crespo.</i>

54
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,909
- Motherfucker.
<i>- In the next few days,</i>

55
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,952
<i>we will be publishing
an investigative series</i>

56
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,496
<i>about this criminal enterprise,</i>

57
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,122
<i>including pictures.</i>

58
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,208
<i>This operation is much larger than it seems.</i>

59
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,084
"No speak Spanish" my ass.

60
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,546
So that means we have to leave,
right, Chepe?

61
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,799
No! No, my love.

62
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,176
This man, he knows who you are, Chepe.

63
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,512
Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere.

64
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,222
Is that so?

65
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,850
So do me a favour and fix this.

66
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,020
Did you hear me?

67
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,321
Motherfucker.

68
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,825
So a new surrender deal.

69
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,452
Three years in jail. All of you.

70
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,412
Turn in the illicit businesses,

71
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:53,124
and we can keep all of the legal assets,
as in the old plan. It's a good deal.

72
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,043
He would've told you himself,

73
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,671
but he thought it was best for me
to explain in person.

74
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,549
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

75
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,968
I understand.
Thank you for coming, Nicolás.

76
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,138
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

77
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,307
An update?

78
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,353
On our efforts to maximise business
before surrender.

79
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,857
So I can inform my father.

80
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,568
Tell your dad everything's
still on track here.

81
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,822
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

82
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,242
And this accident in New York?

83
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,707
Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

84
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm not worried.

85
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,545
Are we done?

86
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,089
One last thing.

87
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,595
Our friends in Bogotá
are concerned about their exposure.

88
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,930
Too many people know about the deal.

89
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,850
They worry about Mr Pallomari.

90
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,437
My father would like you to handle it.

91
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,273
"Handle it"?

92
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,233
Do you know what you're talking about?

93
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,277
Do you have any idea?

94
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,828
Pallomari's our chief accountant in Cali,
and not easily replaced.

95
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,955
He's too valuable to just kill.

96
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,584
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

97
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,211
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

98
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,550
Take care.

99
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,481
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

100
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,150
His father's orders.

101
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,614
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

102
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,075
Keep an eye on him.

103
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,455
You decide if you're coming tonight?

104
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,292
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.

105
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,670
It's important.

106
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:06,132
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

107
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,511
Which is exactly why you should go.

108
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,264
Dad, you're the new boss here.

109
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,934
Please, show them.

110
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,232
Or at least have a good time
before we have to roll over and play dead.

111
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,594
Cheers, gentlemen!

112
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,727
How would you like to be my date tonight?

113
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,647
Where would we go?

114
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,198
Let's go dancing.

115
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,867
Do you like dancing?

116
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,204
As you discussed with Don Miguel,
he'd like you to keep working from here.

117
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes, I know what needs to be done.

118
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,045
Come in.

119
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,599
Guillermo, what's this?
You've got to be kidding, right?

120
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,351
- You're playing me for a fool.
- What's this?

121
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,480
This is unacceptable.
I need to speak to Miguel.

122
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,482
Talk to whoever you want.

123
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,609
This is the biggest apartment
we have right now.

124
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,028
Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.

125
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,822
A/C. Kids seem to like it.

126
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,908
- Kids, do you like it?
- Yes!

127
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,911
Really, Patricia.
Are you going to smoke inside?

128
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,954
What's the problem? This is a dump.

129
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,792
- The boys are here.
- Oh, now you're concerned about the boys?

130
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,337
Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

131
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,974
Everything you've done for these people,
and this is how they repay you?

132
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,784
I'm telling you, they're done.

133
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,912
Gilberto's looking
for some new way to surrender.

134
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,999
And you heard about this thing in New York
with Chepe, right?

135
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,586
And Miguel's in charge of everything here.

136
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,923
<i>Better said, the Cali cartel is dead.</i>

137
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,758
And you intend to...?

138
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:40,805
To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

139
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,142
Which is why I'm talking to you.

140
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,025
It's funny how things change, isn't it?

141
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,403
So, Amado... what do you say?

142
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,952
I say you're no fucking fun,
that's what I say.

143
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,456
But we both see the future the same way.

144
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,708
<i>Look, starting next week...</i>

145
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:15,798
I'll only be shipping product
for my new North Valley friends. Good?

146
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:20,261
And what about the other thing
we discussed?

147
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,898
Look, I need you to make room here.

148
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,944
And I want you to take care of the guests,
get them everything they need.

149
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,363
I also want a bottle
at each of these tables.

150
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,740
But I want the good stuff.
None of that shit you serve here.

151
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,283
Understood?

152
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,954
I was told you needed me.

153
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,082
I need to talk about something.

154
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,584
Leave your bitch down here.

155
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,378
Come on.

156
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,226
You don't tell anyone about this, OK?

157
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,397
I was thinking about what you said...

158
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,191
if I ever need your advice, and...

159
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,986
I could use your help.

160
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,821
With your father's security.

161
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,073
He's coming to the party tonight.

162
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:23,908
He's coming here?

163
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,912
Unless there's another fucking party
I don't know about? Yeah, here.

164
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,376
What do you want me to tell you, David?

165
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,920
Public places are always bad.

166
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,297
I know.

167
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,007
Too many people.

168
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,261
When does he plan on arriving?

169
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,346
I was thinking around 11.

170
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,891
Well, what fucking time is best, then?

171
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,145
Well, I think ten is better.

172
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,065
It's less crowded.
Maybe I can take him up to the balcony.

173
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,734
You'll take care of it?

174
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,572
I knew I could count on you.

175
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,327
I just need this night to be perfect.

176
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,746
Everything has to go well.

177
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,916
You can relax.
I think we can manage that.

178
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,054
Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

179
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,847
Of course, you think he listened?

180
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,308
He's an imbecile.

181
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,102
Pull over here.

182
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,065
Pinchadito said there's
a bad phone tap or something.

183
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,821
Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

184
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,335
Hey. What's going on?

185
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,545
Nothing, boss.

186
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,005
- Is he bothering you?
- No, sir.

187
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,382
- I'm just buying fritters for my brother.
- Great, let's go.

188
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,134
- You want some?
- Sure.

189
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,888
- Let's see here.
- Zuelma prays every morning.

190
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,432
Very good. And here?

191
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,935
- The worm...
- ...Gotero.

192
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,020
- Dad!
- Hi, kids!

193
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,233
I need to speak to you.

194
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,861
OK. Girls...

195
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,406
please, go to your room
and finish your homework.

196
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,914
Something came up.

197
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,586
- What is it?
- I know how hard this has been for you.

198
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,506
I just want you to know
that I've almost got it figured out.

199
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,886
- All right.
- I'll tell you more tonight,

200
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,806
but for now, I want you
to get everything ready to leave.

201
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,184
Where are we going? How...

202
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,727
Do you trust me?

203
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,063
My love...

204
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:36,275
Paola... do you trust me?

205
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,278
Yes?

206
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,158
Everything will be all right.
I promise.

207
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,043
Done. I'm finished.

208
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,588
I love that length on you.

209
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,715
Thank you, I like it, too.

210
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,386
And... a little extra for you.

211
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,849
And I have a little extra for you, too.

212
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,147
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

213
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,719
You were the one
who approached my wife?

214
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,931
You enjoy it?

215
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,935
Using her to get to me?

216
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,707
You can say whatever you want.

217
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,878
- You can't scare me.
- No...

218
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,423
I can just ruin your life.

219
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,050
You know the brothers.

220
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,261
Pretty well.

221
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:31,432
What do you think will happen to them
without Gilberto running things?

222
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:36,228
You're young, Franklin.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

223
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,606
You really want to spend it in a cell?

224
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:44,111
Talk to me.
I'll get you a deal.

225
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,821
You and Christina...

226
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,949
can start over.

227
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,911
Have a new life.

228
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,330
In the United States.

229
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,085
I'm not going to say a single word...

230
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,048
until I see my wife.

231
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,266
Then you'll have your witness.

232
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,572
Stop. Stop here.

233
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,040
Turn around.

234
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,309
Manny.

235
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,145
Thanks for meeting.

236
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:47,401
Julia said you might have...
something on Crespo?

237
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,286
Well, yes.

238
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,081
It's something I hope you like.

239
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,003
How can I help you, Mr Crespo?

240
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,798
Or should I say, Mr Santacruz?

241
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,051
Well...

242
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,221
I was hoping I could help you.

243
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,682
Where are you from?

244
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,395
- Cuba.
- Cuba! Gorgeous.

245
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,857
When you were young,

246
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:32,321
did you ever think you would come
to this country and do something special?

247
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,617
Well, I did.

248
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:42,247
I imagined myself coming here
to the United States, to New York...

249
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,333
and building something important.

250
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,044
That was also my dream.

251
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,839
The dream of a young immigrant,
like yourself.

252
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:55,302
And that's why I want to help you,
to make whatever dream you have a reality.

253
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,845
Whatever it is.

254
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,973
Regardless how much it costs.

255
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,475
In dollars.

256
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,649
You think you and I are the same

257
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,318
because we came to this country
with dreams?

258
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,611
Well...

259
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:16,573
My family fled Cuba
because we believed in freedom.

260
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,244
You came to sell cocaine.

261
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,163
Yes, we are both immigrants,

262
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,042
but we have nothing in common,
Mr Santacruz.

263
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,257
My story is going to print.

264
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,474
OK. Thank you for hearing my proposal.

265
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,271
Can I ask you a question?

266
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:52,943
How long will it take
to get to the airport from here?

267
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,238
I have no idea.

268
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,324
An hour or so.

269
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,830
I'll miss a lot about New York.

270
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,916
But not the traffic.

271
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,959
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. How are you?

272
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,094
- Good evening.
- Hello. How are you?

273
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,306
Good evening. Welcome.

274
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,735
Good to see you, David. What's up?

275
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,237
Looks like the whole family showed up.

276
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,406
Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

277
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,548
You know what?

278
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,717
I don't want this many people up here.

279
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,296
Good evening!
Welcome to the Cali Fair!

280
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:25,345
Let's give a warm welcome
to a friend of the festival,

281
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,016
and our patron,
Mr Miguel Rodríguez!

282
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,688
Come. Come here.

283
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,648
Come!

284
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,275
Come here!

285
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,785
Say a few words.

286
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,090
Thank you all for coming.

287
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,594
Please, enjoy the party.

288
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,330
Your brother's a character.

289
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,042
His passion for tequila
exceeds his tolerance.

290
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,921
Well... my shift started already.

291
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,091
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
when you come back.

292
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,427
You're giving me a tip.

293
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,232
We aren't here for you.

294
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,819
Where is Pacho?

295
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:29,946
Pacho!

296
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:33,950
Pacho!

297
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,545
- I need to talk to you.
- Don't interrupt me.

298
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,964
We have a problem.
We have to leave, now.

299
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,091
- Relax. It's a fucking party.
- We need to leave now!

300
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,844
- I said calm down! I'll say when we go.
- What's going on here?

301
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,013
We have to leave, sir. Please.

302
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:04,898
Get down!

303
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,112
Go! Watch out!

304
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,405
Pacho!

305
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,764
Watch out!

306
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,309
Stay there!

307
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,896
- Keep going!
- Careful! Get out of the way!

308
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,232
- Keep going!
- Get out of the way!

309
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,484
Keep moving.

310
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,404
When I run...

311
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,284
Shit!

312
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,374
Give me the gun.

313
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,005
Go ahead.

314
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,635
Are you all right?

315
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,096
Motherfucker!

316
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:19,806
Álvaro!

317
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:36,781
Shoot them! Shoot them!

318
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,991
Go!

319
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,536
Over there!

320
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,603
- Careful!
- Head down, sir.

321
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,563
Head down!

322
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,566
- Slow down.
- Move it!

323
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,318
Motherfucker!

324
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,487
- Go!
- Let's go! Move it!

325
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,451
This shit...

326
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,001
Little brother! I need you to shoot.

327
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:33,004
Your gun. Keep shooting at them!

328
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,142
Head down!

329
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,894
I'll drive, Enrique. I'll drive!

330
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,813
Over here!

331
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,075
Who drove the car?

332
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,038
You got here by car. Who was driving?

333
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,873
- Me.
- Give me the keys.

334
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,418
Fuck you.

335
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,735
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

336
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,697
- Are we close?
- Yes.

337
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,033
It's just around the corner.

338
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,243
Thank you.

339
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,245
You saved me. Really.

340
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,582
Just tell your friends about me.

341
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,501
But only the ones with money.

342
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,438
Why isn't this imbecile moving?

343
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,361
When is this car gonna move?

344
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,410
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.

345
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,623
God!
Oh, my God!

346
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,694
Dad! Are you OK?

347
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,154
- Yes, I'm OK.
- Are you OK?

348
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,282
- Let's go inside.
- It's those North Valley motherfuckers.

349
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,619
- We got one of the shooters.
- They shot Álvaro, too.

350
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:15,995
Pacho is OK.

351
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,830
They're on their way back.

352
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,375
Are you OK?

353
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,377
Close the damn door.

354
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:23,962
What a fucking night.

355
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:25,922
Darío, please take her upstairs.

356
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,216
I'm coming soon.

357
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,558
What happened there?

358
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,103
It looked like...

359
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,606
you knew something was coming.

360
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:48,027
Jorge! You know what? I know why.

361
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,241
Because you are always working.

362
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:56,202
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

363
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,039
- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

364
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:05,211
From now on, I want you back in charge
of my personal security.

365
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,879
Only you, Jorge.

366
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,049
Of course, Don Miguel.

367
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:14,637
And if you allow me, we don't know
if this will be the only attack or not.

368
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,890
So I need to know where you are
at all times.

369
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,392
Tomorrow is another day.

370
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,486
<i>- Gilberto, it's me.</i>
- Thank God!

371
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,864
- How are you, brother?
<i>- We're OK.</i>

372
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,742
Look, Gilberto,
they tried to kill Pacho, too.

373
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:38,828
<i>- Pacho! No, it can't be...</i>
- No, he's OK. He survived.

374
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,289
<i>- He's on his way home.</i>
- Thank God.

375
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:45,001
These North Valley motherfuckers,
I'm going to kill them. Sons of bitches.

376
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:48,713
Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

377
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,132
Everybody's watching.

378
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:56,471
<i>- It could ruin everything.</i>
- Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

379
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:58,556
They tried to kill my son.

380
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,476
They tried to kill María.
They tried to kill Pacho.

381
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:03,644
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

382
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,566
for now, we can't afford to start a war.

383
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,651
Especially being so close
to the surrender.

384
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,904
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

385
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,032
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

386
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:20,787
- Brother, listen to me.
- OK, no war. I understand.

387
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,289
<i>You'll see.</i>

388
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,792
Everything is going to be OK, brother.

389
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,795
OK, Gilberto. Bye.

390
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:11,856
<i>Over 15 people were killed, with dozens
more injured and in critical condition,</i>

391
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:15,401
<i>in a deadly shootout tonight
at the kick-off party for the Cali Fair.</i>

392
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:19,238
<i>Police say it's too early to say
what caused the incident,</i>

393
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,532
<i>but several people
who were inside the club...</i>

394
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,452
- I was worried.
- I'm OK.

395
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,913
- We're safe.
- What happened?

396
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:31,000
It was the North Valley. I'm OK.

397
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,668
Where are we going?

398
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,713
Why do we have to leave?

399
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,423
What's going on?

400
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,051
Come with me. Come.

401
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,931
Tell me what's going on right now!

402
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,558
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay here.

403
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,810
You can't tell anyone, understand?

404
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,981
I'm working for the Americans.

405
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:57,693
It can't be.

406
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,905
It can't be.

407
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,531
I contacted the DEA.

408
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:04,450
I'm giving them Miguel.

409
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,203
In exchange, they will help us
get out of the country.

410
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:11,499
It's our only option.
There's no other way.

411
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,003
You're crazy.

412
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,465
They're going to kill all of us.

413
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,551
- You're insane. What were you thinking?
- Paola...

414
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:58,921
I want to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

415
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,591
I'm sorry it's under these circumstances.

416
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:05,136
North Valley attacked us.

417
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,305
Their intentions were clear.

418
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:13,060
They saw us as vulnerable
without Gilberto.

419
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,438
Weak, with me in charge.

420
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,733
They are trying to destroy us.

421
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,153
Take what's ours.

422
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,199
I...

423
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:33,581
All of us know there's only
one appropriate response to this.

424
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:38,169
One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

425
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,588
what we've worked so hard to build.

426
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,885
War.

427
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,976
This is Gilberto's decision?

428
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,940
It's...

429
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,068
mine.
