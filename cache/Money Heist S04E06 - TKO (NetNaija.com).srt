1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,250
<i>Gandía was an animal.</i>

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,958
<i>He could've taken shelter in his den</i>
<i>after hurting two of his prey,</i>

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,791
<i>but that would've gone</i>
<i>against his nature.</i>

4
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,208
<i>He was a predator.</i>

5
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,208
<i>And he wasn't going to stop</i>
<i>until he'd finished off the whole flock.</i>

6
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,250
Nairobi.

7
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,666
Fuck!

8
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,041
Rio, Denver, come with me, now.

9
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,541
This links to the bathroom below.

10
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,000
{\an8}Denver, are you up to crawling in there?

11
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,291
{\an8}-Sure.
-I'll go too.

12
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,208
{\an8}Go kill that son of a bitch.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,083
{\an8}Let's go.

14
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,000
{\an8}Don't move or I'll kill her!

15
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,458
{\an8}-Stay still all of you!
-Where did he shoot you?

16
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,583
{\an8}In my hand.

17
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,666
{\an8}The next one goes in her head!

18
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,250
{\an8}-Merry Christmas!
-Why "Merry Christmas"?

19
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,708
{\an8}This feels a bit like Christmas, right?

20
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,416
{\an8}Here we are, setting the table...

21
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,458
{\an8}the family is coming...

22
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,666
{\an8}Family? It's the support team:
Manila, the foundry workers...

23
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,416
{\an8}-But it's good to get to know one another.
-Yeah.

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,625
{\an8}They're like distant cousins.

25
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,208
{\an8}Know why I came back for this heist?

26
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,916
{\an8}Before you scattered us
all across the globe,

27
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,125
{\an8}this gang
was the closest thing to a family

28
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,708
{\an8}I've ever had.

29
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,375
{\an8}I've never had a Christmas
like the ones you see in commercials

30
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,291
{\an8}with the grandma
and the <i>turrón</i> and all that.

31
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,666
-With Axel's dad, didn't you celebrate--
-No.

32
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,041
You know? I...

33
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,500
I had already given up on...

34
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
having a family. Completely.

35
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,291
But now I think
there's another way of doing things.

36
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,875
I really want to be a mother.

37
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,833
Do it differently than before,
and have a bunch of kids

38
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,875
and a dog and whatever else.

39
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,500
What you're saying is beautiful, Nairobi.

40
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,291
Would you...?

41
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,791
Would you be the father of my child?

42
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,000
-Look.
-Sorry?

43
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,916
Genetics are very important.

44
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,583
I see you in class,

45
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,166
and I think...

46
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,500
"What a brilliant man.

47
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,333
He's so honorable.

48
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,041
So sensitive. So handsome.

49
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,541
And he has principles."

50
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,125
I believe in what you want to do.

51
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,291
That's very flattering.

52
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,333
And as for honorable...
well, that's one way of seeing it.

53
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,291
But... you're asking the impossible.

54
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,041
Why? Robbing the Bank of Spain
is impossible.

55
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,458
I'm not asking you to act like a dad,
unless you want to.

56
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,875
I'm asking you for a donation

57
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,375
so I can do things differently.

58
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,500
-No strings attached.
-Nairobi.

59
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,166
Look, I set up the Royal Mint heist

60
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,750
in my father's memory.

61
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:18,666
I've set up this one in my brother's.
I'm not the type to let go of attachments.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'd never be able to stop thinking

63
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,208
that I have a child out there,
somewhere in the world.

64
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,666
-OK.
-I'm sorry.

65
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,791
<i>You </i>set this family up,
and <i>you</i> taught us

66
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,625
to do anything for each other.

67
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,541
-But what you're asking--
-What I'm asking you is the same.

68
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,916
Family members help each other,
no questions asked.

69
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,416
Because it makes you happy
and your life depends on it.

70
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,416
You have your plan, I know.

71
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,625
Well, I have one, too.

72
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,250
You've taught me that we help each other.

73
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,791
That's who we are.

74
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,583
Ágata.

75
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:19,791
-I've asked more difficult things of you.
-Well, a bit more, yeah.

76
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:24,958
And... I've entered the lion's den,
no questions asked.

77
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,666
I know. I've asked you to do
some very risky things.

78
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,416
Very risky.

79
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,750
Riskier than what you're asking.

80
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,083
Is that a yes?

81
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,916
That's a yes.

82
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,583
Oh, my God!

83
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,750
Come here.

84
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,125
Thank you.

85
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,791
I swear, you'll never regret it.

86
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,000
We'll find the best IVF clinic
in the world.

87
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,791
Or we can do it the natural way.

88
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,666
-The natural way is out of the question.
-Fine.

89
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,250
-We'll leave it to the professionals.
-OK.

90
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,541
And once the heist is over.

91
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,250
OK.

92
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,375
This is going to be amazing.

93
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,166
You're doing really well, mutt.

94
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,333
You look like Jesus Christ.

95
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,375
-How's your hand? Does it hurt?
-I'm loaded with morphine.

96
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,958
-Did you find Tokyo?
<i>-</i>He still has her in the panic room.

97
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,375
We're making a lot of noise.

98
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,166
Let's take our boots off.

99
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,000
What was that?

100
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,041
No.

101
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,541
Shit.

102
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,375
Move!

103
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,625
Rio, Denver, you OK?

104
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,875
We have cover.

105
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,333
You can't escape.

106
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,250
Who says I want to escape,
you one-eyed queer?

107
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,833
All the fun is in here.

108
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,166
How many magazines do you have left?

109
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,875
Why don't you come in here and count them?

110
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,166
Bring the drills.
Start drilling holes in the wall.

111
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,083
For each hole,
I'll make another one in you.

112
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,791
He won't touch me.

113
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,250
If he kills me, you kill him.

114
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,666
-And he knows it.
-She's right. We have a chance.

115
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,583
He'll keep shooting her. It's too risky.

116
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,708
Gandía!

117
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,416
Do you know what?

118
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,666
You're going to be killed by two queers.

119
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,458
What's worse? Being killed by the Serbian
or the one-eyed Argentinian?

120
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,250
Helsinki,
promise you'll kill this bastard.

121
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,666
I promise, Nairobi. I swear I will.

122
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,083
What will your friends
at the shooting club say, Gandía?

123
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,125
You're gonna get killed by a little bear.

124
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,875
Nairobi, save your strength.

125
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,666
You're making my hostage nervous.
And I want her calm.

126
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,208
So we're going to sing.

127
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,083
I want to hear everyone
so I know where you are.

128
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,583
For each person I can't hear singing,
I'll shoot.

129
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,750
Right, Nairobi? Come on, you start.

130
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,541
Do you know "Lord, You Have Come"?

131
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,791
Stop fucking kicking me, for fuck's sake!

132
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:36,958
Sing!

133
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,250
Sing.

134
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,916
<i>You</i>

135
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,458
<i>Have come to the shore</i>

136
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,583
Come on!

137
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,500
<i>Neither searching for</i>

138
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,291
<i>The wise</i>

139
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,916
<i>Nor the rich</i>

140
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,791
I told you to sing!
And anyone who doesn't know it, hum!

141
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>Desiring only</i>

142
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:07,083
<i>That I should follow you</i>

143
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,541
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

144
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:15,166
<i>With your eyes set upon me</i>

145
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,125
I can't hear the choir!

146
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,250
<i>I left my boat</i>

147
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,833
<i>On the shore</i>

148
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,458
<i>At your side</i>

149
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,958
<i>I will seek another sea</i>

150
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:38,833
<i>I will seek another sea</i>

151
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,375
<i>That song had a funeral vibe to it.</i>

152
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,583
<i>Our own funeral.</i>

153
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,750
<i>And that slap of reality</i>

154
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,708
<i>began to wake up the Professor.</i>

155
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,666
We're up against the ropes.

156
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,791
Nairobi, TKO.

157
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,291
Tokyo, TKO.

158
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,375
Lisbon, TKO.

159
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,958
Professor.

160
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,208
I can't think.
I have too many emotional attachments.

161
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,958
I used to have
a gang with city names. Now...

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,291
now I could have a child,
not with one, but with two of the gang.

163
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,375
Mixing professional
and personal doesn't work.

164
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,500
Tokyo is in the panic room.

165
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,041
And that's precisely where...

166
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,083
Gandía...

167
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,625
wants to get to.

168
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,916
We have to find the room
and ensure there's no way out.

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Where would you put a panic room?

170
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,791
A place you need to protect.
Where the gold is.

171
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,791
No.

172
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:53,125
Panic rooms protect lives, not gold.
Whose life is most important there?

173
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,333
-The governor's.
-Exactly.

174
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,250
It must be close to the governor's office.

175
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,708
But why isn't it in the blueprints?

176
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,083
-Perhaps they renovated.
-No.

177
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,791
Palermo, don't answer.

178
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,250
<i>The panic room's</i>
<i>behind the governor's bathroom.</i>

179
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,333
<i>It's not in the blueprints.</i>

180
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:26,083
They must have falsified
the room measurements, but trust me.

181
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,375
I'm sure.

182
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,333
They're singing hymns.

183
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,375
That's a bad omen, right?

184
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,583
These people are eccentric like that.

185
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,083
However, those shots before...

186
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:49,125
could mean the gang is in dire straits,
don't you reckon, Governor?

187
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,500
How would you know?

188
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know.
The shouting, the grenades...

189
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,291
Also, that guy watching us...

190
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,375
I have no fucking clue who he is,
but he doesn't belong to the gang.

191
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,875
We should take advantage of this situation
and tip the scales in our favor.

192
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,583
Even a small push
could mean victory for us.

193
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,875
And if I may, Governor,

194
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,666
I think that small push
is our responsibility: yours and mine.

195
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,250
We must be the ones
to save all these people.

196
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,375
What we must do

197
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,875
is remain calm and wait.

198
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,333
Quiet! If you so much as sigh again,
I'll start shooting.

199
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm sorry to disagree with you, Governor,

200
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,500
but it's your responsibility.

201
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,333
You are the governor of the Bank of Spain.

202
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,291
It's your responsibility as a man,
damn it.

203
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,416
Make some decisions, face the problems.

204
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:51,208
As I always say... sometimes it's better
to get up and die on your feet

205
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,500
than to live forever on your knees.

206
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,000
-Know what I think?
-Tell me.

207
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
You're a clown.

208
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,833
You put us all at risk
with your little walks

209
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,625
and your snake-oil salesman spiel.

210
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,833
Leave us in peace.

211
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,500
If you want to die on your feet,
get up and do it.

212
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,416
Grenades, shooting...

213
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,250
All that in six minutes.

214
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,833
And here you are, so calm.
What am I missing?

215
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,250
-I know the same as you, Alicia.
-Liar.

216
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,166
-What's going on in there?
-I don't know.

217
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,875
Why don't we intervene?

218
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,458
If shots are heard,
protocol says we should intervene.

219
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,708
It's Gandía,

220
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,666
-the head of security.
-Shit.

221
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,875
He's on the loose,
armed and acting of his own accord.

222
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,458
Wait a minute. Did you talk to him?

223
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,125
Did you give him the green light
to wage war and kill everyone?

224
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,458
I officially ordered him not to do it.

225
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,458
He said balls to that,
he'd do it in self-defense.

226
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,500
If he wants to defend himself,
I can't stop him.

227
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,208
You're trash, Tamayo.

228
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:15,833
Out there, you're a saint,
worried about your public image,

229
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,583
holding an absurd truce,

230
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,583
while you send a lunatic
to do the dirty work.

231
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,833
If it goes well, you'll take the credit.
If not, you'll say,

232
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,291
"I told him, but he was a nutcase."

233
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,833
Us nutcases always do your dirty work.

234
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,291
Do you have a problem
with Gandía waging a guerrilla war?

235
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,416
Or with him sabotaging,
injuring, or killing them?

236
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,583
You don't, right?

237
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,916
Then keep your mouth shut.

238
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,708
Are you thinking?

239
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,208
Yes, I'm thinking.

240
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,083
-What about?
-When was the first time we lost control?

241
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,791
<i>When Gandía didn't go out</i>
<i>with the red boxes.</i>

242
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,208
-The second time?
-<i>I have a problem.</i>

243
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,250
When Lisbon couldn't climb the tree.

244
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,791
Those two mistakes
have put us up against the ropes.

245
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,083
And we need to go back...

246
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,750
and undo them.

247
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,000
I need to exercise to clear my head.
Palermo.

248
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,125
Hold on, you hear me?

249
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,541
<i>Hold on.</i>

250
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,750
Fucking hell!

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,416
Mr. Arturo.

252
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,125
I've got something
that may help with that push.

253
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,333
What?

254
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,083
-A phone.
-Hide it.

255
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,916
It's Nairobi's.
The one the police sent in.

256
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,875
I found it while cleaning.

257
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,083
You'll know what to do with it.

258
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,083
What the fuck's going on there?

259
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,666
If I hear so much as a sigh,
I'll shoot.

260
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,916
Sir, I need to use the bathroom. Now.

261
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,583
Now's not the time.

262
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,000
No one is leaving this place,
so sit down and relax.

263
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,041
After you.

264
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,666
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

265
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:01,500
-What's going on, Daniel? I was eating--
-No, not Daniel. Here, I'm Denver.

266
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,041
OK? Denver.

267
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,958
I'm sorry,
I'm not used to your new identity.

268
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,875
Well, about that...

269
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,500
There are a few things...

270
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,333
that I'd like to understand,
and it's not easy for me.

271
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,208
Ask away. I'm the same person.

272
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,750
You're not exactly the same person.
You have boobs now.

273
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,375
-Well...
-You have boobs.

274
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,125
-Yes, I do.
-You're a woman, I understand that part.

275
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,291
Are you gay as well? Or how does it work?

276
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:42,250
So what you're worried about right now
is whether I like men or not, is that it?

277
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,166
Yes.

278
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,250
I like men, to be honest.
I like them very much.

279
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,625
Mind you, not just any type of man.

280
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,083
I like them strong, you know?
The kind that go to the gym.

281
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,750
Tough guys, but well-read too,
so I can learn from them.

282
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,375
The type that watch football.
But in a macho way, you know?

283
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,208
Beer in hand, legs spread wide,
and their hand on their groin.

284
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,000
OK, I get it. It's clear.

285
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,625
But...

286
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,000
have you always liked men?

287
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,791
Or was this
a result of becoming a woman?

288
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,833
First of all,

289
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,666
I've always been a woman.

290
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,333
No.

291
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,875
No, you haven't.

292
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,541
I did robberies with you.
You weren't a woman.

293
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,375
How does a woman rob?
By scratching and pulling hair?

294
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,666
I'm not a caveman.

295
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,583
But, I mean, at the end of the day,
you can spot a woman.

296
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,833
When I did a robbery,
I went with Juanito, not a woman.

297
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,000
Maybe this thing about being a woman...
happened later.

298
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,416
Listen.

299
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,375
Juanito would finish a robbery with you...

300
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,416
and go back home, to his room.

301
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,916
He'd put some music on,

302
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,416
he'd roll a joint,

303
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,416
and he'd put some red lipstick on,
a wonderful lipstick I had.

304
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,666
It was Ferrari red.

305
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,416
He'd take his joint

306
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,333
and lie on the bed.

307
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,416
And right there, in those moments,

308
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,166
all alone, relaxed,
and looking gorgeous...

309
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,541
that was when I was really myself.

310
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,083
-You've always been a woman?
-Always.

311
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,166
And I never noticed?

312
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,541
Do you know who made me
really horny back then?

313
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,458
-Of course I do.
-Really?

314
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,583
David Beckham.
You talked about him all damn day.

315
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,375
Beckham made me horny too,
always has, but no.

316
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,166
You. You turned me on so much.

317
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,875
No, I didn't.

318
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,333
-I was in love with you.
-Don't joke about love.

319
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,708
Why do you think
I followed you around, doing jobs?

320
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,125
To be near you.

321
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,208
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

322
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,291
I used to grope you on the bike.

323
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,708
You didn't notice,
but I'd grab onto your leg and back...

324
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,291
And your scent drove me wild.

325
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,291
Don't you realize this is serious?

326
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,416
You were taking advantage of me.

327
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,541
I'm pulling your leg,
you dickhead. I mean...

328
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,625
Fucking hell.

329
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,291
Give me a hug, come on.

330
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,416
Excuse me, sir,
but I can't wait any longer.

331
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,375
Nobody move!
I don't want to hear a sound!

332
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,708
Miguel, listen.

333
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,000
We need to establish communication
with the outside.

334
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,083
OK?

335
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,666
Here, hide it.

336
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,000
They've got me in their sights. You're OK.

337
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,291
-What are you doing here?
-What the fuck?

338
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,958
What's happening? Where's Denver?

339
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,541
-He's fine.
-Who's there?

340
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,166
-It's a hostage.
-Take her away.

341
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,250
-Come on.
-Like hell, I'm staying.

342
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,166
Give me a gun.

343
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,500
You're not here for this, Manila. Go.

344
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,708
You're in trouble. Give me a gun.

345
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,291
Get out of here right now.

346
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,750
Come on, damn it.

347
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,958
Stay calm.

348
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,208
From now on, you and I will be
the backbone of the resistance.

349
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,208
My mouth went dry just hearing that.

350
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,166
<i>Denver.</i>

351
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,833
<i>It's four seconds at most.</i>

352
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,541
One advances,
the other provides cover fire.

353
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,791
<i>And we save Nairobi.</i>

354
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,583
<i>Tell us what you want, Gandía.</i>
<i>Let's negotiate.</i>

355
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,625
Negotiate?
Look, let me explain the situation.

356
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,125
Option one:

357
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:27,666
I come out with the gun to Nairobi's head.

358
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,916
You stay up against the right wall.

359
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,416
I let her go, and nobody dies.

360
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:37,375
It's a good deal for both of us.
Zero-zero. A tie.

361
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,125
Option two:

362
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,375
instead of me coming out, you come in.

363
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,708
I blow Nairobi's head off.

364
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,500
You shoot me.

365
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,375
But I'd still have a free hand
to shoot back,

366
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,458
and I swear,
I'll take out more than one of you.

367
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:56,041
You forgot option three:
come out on your knees, unarmed.

368
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,291
You surrender and give us Nairobi. 

369
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,958
That's a tie too. How's that?

370
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,583
I won't kneel,
not even before God Almighty.

371
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,666
I'll give you one minute.
Then, I start shooting.

372
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,416
I may well win six-zero.

373
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,916
What an asshole.

374
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,125
Gandía, darling, you couldn't do that.

375
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,041
You're an idiot.

376
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:19,416
The other day, I turned up with my friend,

377
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,250
and we got you good.

378
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,583
Shut up.

379
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:27,000
Tokyo really got you with the water trick.

380
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,458
Nairobi, shut up.

381
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,708
-The door handle hit you in the face...
-Shut up.

382
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,458
...and knocked you out.

383
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,458
Why is she doing that?

384
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,791
Where are your macho balls now?

385
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,000
-So clumsy.
-She wants to save Tokyo.

386
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,625
You're useless.

387
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,375
She knows if he kills her, we'll kill him.

388
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:52,125
You've spent your whole life
waiting for this moment, right?

389
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,583
With your well-trained little soldiers.

390
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,541
And two chicks show up
and get you real good.

391
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,250
-Should I shoot you now?
<i>-</i>Surprise me.

392
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,291
Should I put a bullet in your ass?

393
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,500
We have to get her out now.

394
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,625
If we let him out,

395
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,791
<i>he'll do whatever he wants.</i>
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

396
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,583
-We have to hold on.
-<i>Why do you want to?</i>

397
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,708
She's there because of you.
You freed that butcher.

398
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,375
<i>We have to get her out.</i>

399
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,166
<i>Do you all agree?</i>

400
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:38,916
OK, Gandía.

401
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,166
We're letting you out.

402
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:43,041
OK, good.

403
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,708
This is how it'll go:

404
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,208
you'll see Nairobi the whole time.

405
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:51,291
We'll walk forward with my gun to her head

406
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,333
once she confirms you're all
up against the wall on the right.

407
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:59,333
Starting with
those two fucking kids up there!

408
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,083
Did you hear that? You have to come down.

409
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,291
OK.

410
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:22,333
Earlier you asked me
if sleeping with me made my husband sick,

411
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,541
and I didn't reply.

412
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,833
No. I didn't make him sick.

413
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,333
Because I wasn't a bitch then.

414
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,375
But now I am.

415
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,041
And yes, we had sex.

416
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,291
Everywhere.

417
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,625
And highly creative sex.

418
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:52,500
I guess you and the Professor are
more the type to do it once every 30 days.

419
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:55,541
Missionary position,
even though you're billionaires.

420
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,958
All that poison inside you
is eating away at you, Alicia.

421
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,208
I can see it in your face.

422
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,625
What's wrong with it?

423
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,458
You're a caricature of yourself,
going on about sex. What's wrong?

424
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:16,333
Is it the hormones?
Try downloading an app.

425
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,833
There are tons of perverts
who want to fuck pregnant women.

426
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,875
I like to get to know them first.

427
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't go off with the first hipster
who comes along,

428
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,041
gives me his number, and says,

429
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:30,750
"Hey, gorgeous,
why don't you come to my storehouse

430
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,000
to try my cider? It's very tasty."

431
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,083
Know what it is?

432
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,333
No, tell me.

433
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,791
If your mask slips, you crumble.

434
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:43,333
You're in danger of collapse.
And I get it.

435
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,500
I'm not the one in a mask.

436
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,083
Let's see, earlier, we had a deal.

437
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,291
You were holding the phone,

438
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,291
and you backed out.

439
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,625
What happened?

440
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:03,083
I made you waste your time
while you were questioning me.

441
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,750
I pretended
you were slowly wearing me down,

442
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,333
that I was giving in.

443
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:12,000
In the meantime, the Professor
escaped your cordon.

444
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,833
It's called "diversion tactics."

445
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,625
And it worked.

446
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,875
Do you know what I think?

447
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,333
Your little shepherd
somehow made it in time.

448
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,083
I'll find out.

449
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,291
Come on.

450
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,500
<i>-Think.</i>
<i>-I knew we weren't in Spain.</i>

451
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:54,208
<i>-I could hear the call to prayer.</i>
<i>-Think, you can do it.</i>

452
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,208
<i>Fly with me.</i>

453
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,500
Shakir.

454
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,791
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

455
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,750
Yes, Shakir speaking, Professor.

456
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,458
I need you to track Rio's flight to Spain.

457
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,666
It's a Spanish Air Force
Beechcraft Air King 250.

458
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,333
The flight landed at 16:30 on April 4.

459
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,083
Check all the air navigation satellites.

460
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,708
<i>I need the exact point of origin.</i>

461
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,875
Does it have battery?

462
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,708
-It does.
-And signal?

463
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,833
Yes, sir.

464
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,750
OK, go to the call log.

465
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,875
Miguel, you need to keep a cool head, OK?

466
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,208
They don't suspect you at all.

467
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:54,083
-Yes, but my fingers are sweating.
-Stay calm.

468
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,916
-There's a call from a hidden number.
-Go to contacts.

469
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,000
There's a number.

470
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,458
Call it.

471
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,375
I hope nobody answers.

472
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,333
It's Nairobi's phone.

473
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,833
-What are you doing?
-I won't talk.

474
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,791
-Fuck.
-They hung up.

475
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,208
I'm leaving my fingerprints.
I'm not calling the cops.

476
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,125
Listen.

477
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,750
You just need to leave the call connected

478
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,166
and hold a normal conversation,
between hostages.

479
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,791
They'll know what to do.

480
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:36,916
Understood?

481
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,875
They're calling again.

482
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,208
<i>-Speak.</i>
<i>-So...</i>

483
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,166
we're here,

484
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,625
<i>in the library.</i>

485
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,541
<i>All the hostages.</i>

486
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:57,750
Being watched by just one of the gang,
a guy called Matías.

487
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,708
-Turn the volume up.
-I think it's Arturo Román.

488
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,916
There's no one in the lobby, right?

489
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,208
No one.

490
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,708
I've lost my voice.

491
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,875
And since Gandía is free,

492
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,833
<i>it'd be the perfect time</i>
<i>for the police to go in.</i>

493
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,583
Because, I repeat,
there's no one in the lobby.

494
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,958
<i>They've been decimated.</i>
<i>There have been shots, grenades,</i>

495
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,416
shouting, and hymns, right, Miguel?

496
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,333
That's right.

497
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:29,458
Sorry.

498
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,833
-We have to go in.
-The Presidency says no more armored vans.

499
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:40,458
They're looking the other way.
We'll catch them off guard.

500
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,708
I can't.

501
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,208
What the fuck are you doing?

502
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,583
It's this kid.
He's very nervous. He's lost it.

503
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,208
Poor guy, he was praying.

504
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,666
-He seemed... I don't know.
-Come on.

505
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:56,041
Over here, in silence and close to me.

506
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,625
You, hands where I can see them.

507
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:03,208
Lower them an inch, and I'll shoot you.
Move an inch, and I'll shoot you.

508
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,458
Say a fucking word...

509
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,666
-And you'll shoot me.
-That's right.

510
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,416
-I might just shoot you anyway.
-Come on.

511
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,916
Behave.

512
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:20,291
Suárez! Prepare an intervention unit.
We'll go in through the lobby.

513
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,958
Call Gandía in the panic room
to coordinate.

514
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,875
Thank God.
You're finally showing you have balls.

515
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:39,916
<i>Professor.</i>

516
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,458
<i>The Beechcraft Air King 250</i>

517
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:47,833
that brought Rio to Spain
took off from Algeria at 15:03 hours,

518
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,041
<i>from a town called Timimoun.</i>

519
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,666
<i>It's in the Atlas Mountains.</i>

520
00:34:58,916 --> 00:34:59,875
Good.

521
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:03,541
Minutes earlier, they'd have driven him
to the aircraft.

522
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,625
Find that car.

523
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,250
<i>I see it's a desert. No trees.</i>

524
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,625
So you can go back through the images

525
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,833
-to see where the car came from.
-<i>OK.</i>

526
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,000
We'll use the weather satellites.

527
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,000
Very good.

528
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,708
Go to Algeria.
I want you in Timimoun in four hours.

529
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,625
I can't fly with weapons.

530
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,333
I know. You'll get backup once you arrive.

531
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,541
The plan was to not leave you.

532
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,958
The plan has just changed, Marseille.

533
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,750
I need to bring together
the Serbs and Benjamín's team

534
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,250
and go on the offensive.

535
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,041
We'll strike them everywhere,
so hard and fast,

536
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,208
they won't know which way is up.

537
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,041
How are you?

538
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,750
My stitches...

539
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,125
have come undone.

540
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,166
Where is he?

541
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,458
I don't know.

542
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:18,708
Where is he?

543
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,125
Denver...

544
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,666
I don't know.

545
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:35,375
We're here, fucking scumbag.

546
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,791
Where's the other one?

547
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:39,791
{\an8}I'm here.

548
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,166
Very well.
I'll start cutting Nairobi loose.

549
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,083
Mutt.

550
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,666
Want to say anything before the dance?

551
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,416
No? Well...

552
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,708
-Party time?
-Party time.

553
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,750
Nairobi.

554
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,916
<i>Sleepyhead.</i>

555
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,125
You're brave, asleep up here

556
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,958
with everyone at the table
waiting for you.

557
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,333
Come on, wake up.

558
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,291
Hey.

559
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,458
What?

560
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,625
He said yes.

561
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,000
The Professor.

562
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,916
He said yes.

563
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,875
-You're going to be an aunt!
-An aunt!

564
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,250
-I'm so happy for you.
-I can't believe it.

565
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:48,416
Hey.

566
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,958
-What?
-You'll have a little genius.

567
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:53,041
<i>Yes. We're going to name them...</i>

568
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,833
<i>What?</i>

569
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,208
Ibiza.

570
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,458
My God, I love it. Ibiza.

571
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:04,750
<i>I love it.</i>

572
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,000
<i>Call them Ibiza...</i>

573
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,958
and you know
you'll have so much fun together.

574
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,750
Fuck, they'll be so popular at school.

575
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,125
<i>But it's not a city, it's an island.</i>

576
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,416
Do you know what other rule
we're going to break?

577
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,916
Not seeing each other.

578
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,541
You'll be their aunt.

579
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,958
<i>Look, you know what?</i>

580
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,708
You'll be their godmother.

581
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,541
Yes, darling.

582
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,250
-I'm so looking forward to it.
-So am I.

583
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,541
So am I.

584
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,250
I can't believe it.

585
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,166
What?

586
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,250
-Ibiza, right?
-Of course.

587
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,250
No more spending Christmas
alone with Helsinki.

588
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,541
He doesn't know any Christmas carols.

589
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,833
From now on,
Christmas will be spent with family.

590
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,208
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

591
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,875
Party for a single mother.

592
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,083
Are you pregnant?

593
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:06,625
-Yes! No, after the heist.
-I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

594
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,125
Me neither.

595
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,333
-What?
-It's a friend with benefits.

596
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,208
Want to know the baby's name?

597
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,458
-Ibiza!
-Ibiza!

598
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,250
<i>Mutt.</i>

599
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,916
I want you all against the wall.
Lower your weapons.

600
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,000
I'd ask you to put them on the ground,

601
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:50,250
but I know myself. If I see you unarmed,
I might get carried away.

602
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,000
So let's show some mutual respect.

603
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,458
Lower them.

604
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:56,791
Come on.

605
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,083
I'm aiming at her head.

606
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,208
I have a bulletproof vest.
She's tied up.

607
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,208
You won't get me.

608
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,583
Come on, let's go.

609
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,250
Lower the fucking gun, idiot!

610
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,583
Didn't you hear me?

611
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,125
That's it.

612
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:24,833
Slowly.

613
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,708
Shall we dance?

614
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,250
Come on, let's dance.

615
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,583
You're falling, darling.

616
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,416
Sorry.

617
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,666
Look at your big man. Hello, big man.

618
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,416
That's enough.

619
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,583
Let her go now.

620
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,875
Take it easy.

621
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,083
Easy.

622
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,875
I'm about to let her go. Take it easy.

623
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,458
I'm about to let her go.

624
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,041
Here we go.

625
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,041
That's it.

626
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,833
Mutt.

627
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,708
I said I was going to kill you.

628
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,166
No!
