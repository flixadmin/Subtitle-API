1
00:00:01,177 --> 00:00:04,265
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:07,699
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,943
Survive.

4
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:11,761
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:13,947
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,748
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,900
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:23,087
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:27,325
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,410
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:31,963
Hi, I'm looking for Detective Hall.
I was told he works in Vice.

12
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,748
Oliver?

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,459
McKenna Hall.

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,093
I live to surprise.

15
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:39,262
I want to find Walter.
My stepfather.

16
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:41,130
I'll help you rescue
him, but that's it.

17
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:43,349
That's my offer.

18
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,284
Ok.

19
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,874
Jerry.

20
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:10,526
Jerry, you ok?
Yeah.

21
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,878
You look a little
peaked, man.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,297
I'm fine. It's, uh,
Mrs. Hill wants us

23
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,798
to move the Sherwood
into the vault.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,750
Now? It's mid-day.

25
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:19,585
I know. She says
it's a security threat.

26
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,971
It's, uh, all
the robberies lately.

27
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:23,756
Right, right.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,530
Take this thing
off me, all right?

29
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:49,582
I got it
like you asked.

30
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:50,750
Here.

31
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:54,336
Take it off me!

32
00:01:57,174 --> 00:02:00,326
Were--were you--

33
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,744
were you bluffing? I mean,
would the thing have detonated?

34
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:06,298
Violently. Don't worry, though.
You did exactly as I asked,

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,050
so it's just
unconsciousness for you.

36
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:10,686
Unconscious?

37
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,564
You might want
to take it easy

38
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,866
if you plan on taking
someone off that list tonight.

39
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,367
This is me taking it easy.

40
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,955
So who's our
lucky guy tonight?

41
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:34,576
Ken Williams. His pyramid scheme
stole millions.

42
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:37,513
People didn't just lose their homes.
Their lives are ruined.

43
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:38,947
Why don't you call it
in early tonight,

44
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,799
I'm not expecting
much trouble.

45
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:03,739
Felicity!
Did you just...

46
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,408
Computer override
your lock.

47
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,160
Maybe a little.
What are you doing?

48
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,245
I pulled up some information
on Mr. Williams.

49
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,948
Did you know he's a widowed father
of a 10-year-old boy?

50
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,616
I told you.

51
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,201
I'm only in this
to help Walter.

52
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:18,454
Not to be an accessory
to orphaning little kids.

53
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:20,255
I'm just giving him a warning.
Has it ever occurred to you

54
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:22,374
you could do some
real good in the city?

55
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,476
Beyond just recovering
people's stock portfolios

56
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,501
and their saving accounts.

57
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,855
You're not the only

58
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,838
one who knows how
to reboot my system.

59
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,553
I made a mistake.
Getting in my way?

60
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,971
I don't disagree.
No.

61
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:39,108
Signing on with you.
Even provisionally.

62
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,478
Hey. Hey.

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,730
Drink.

64
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:00,218
That tastes like dirt.

65
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,904
You got to stay
hydrated, ok?

66
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:03,822
Hydration is not my problem.

67
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:04,993
My problem is getting
a bullet dug out of

68
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:06,937
my arm with a dull blade.

69
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:10,062
Let me take a look.

70
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:15,200
It's infected.

71
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:18,420
Go figure.

72
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:20,172
Yeah, uh...

73
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,008
I got to stop that
before it spreads.

74
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,079
When you swing past the
drugstore for those antibiotics,

75
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,214
you want to get me
a copy of "Maxim",

76
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,850
or maybe a "Sports Illustrated"?

77
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:35,220
Yao Fei had these super
herbs back in the cave

78
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:37,189
that'd heal anything.

79
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:41,060
I'm going
to go get them.

80
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:44,363
You're not going to last
an hour out there.

81
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:45,835
Well, I guess you
better hope I get back

82
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,461
in 45 minutes, then.

83
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:53,946

85
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,981
Ahh.
Thank you for coming.

86
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:08,587
It is so good
to see you, Frank.

87
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:10,823
Ohh.

88
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:12,792
It's been far too long.

89
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:16,495
Yes. My interests in China
have kept me away

90
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,297
more than I'd like.

91
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,633
But with The Undertaking
approaching,

92
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:23,352
I thought a return
to Starling City was in order.

93
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:24,770
Hmm.

94
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:26,505
Actually, Frank,

95
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:28,441
it's The Undertaking

96
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:31,477
that I wanted
to talk to you about.

97
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,697
I want to get out.

98
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,867
Is this because of what
happened to Walter?

99
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,285
With Walter,

100
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:41,454
with Robert.

101
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:44,990
Last week the Vigilante
nearly made my children orphans.

102
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:47,326
I've reached my limit, Frank.

103
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:51,664
That's, uh,

104
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,868
a lot to confide in me, Moira.

105
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,003
Robert did.

106
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,706
I know
he reached out to you;

107
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,858
whether I was supposed
to know it or not.

108
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,762
He had misgivings.

109
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:10,015
He sought you out because
he knew you did, too.

110
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,852
But then he was murdered.

111
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:16,388
And that should be
a cautionary tale for both of us.

112
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,491
Yes, I know. And I've
gone along with this

113
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:21,193
for as long
as I can stomach it.

114
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:24,730
We started this

115
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:27,116
to fix the Glades,
Frank.

116
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:30,169
To cure the city,
not lay it to waste.

117
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,687
You got into this

118
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,907
because of what happened
to your daughter.

119
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,911
Frank...

120
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,413
What would Amanda
want you to do?

121
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,859
Well.

122
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,996
Maybe we should
come back later.

123
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:59,129
No, maybe we should wait,
Oliver. This is really serious.

124
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,876
What if her next attack
of conscience

125
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:02,103
leads her right to the police?

126
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:03,570
Oh, she won't
say anything.

127
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:05,038
I know I had to make
the same calculation

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,707
when you found out
about me.

129
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,442
Mm-hmm. And what would you
have done if you were wrong,

130
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:12,830
and I decided to make
a call to detective Lance?

131
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,466
I would have put
an arrow in you.

132
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,450
Ha!

133
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,255
Really--really--you really
would have done that, really?

134
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:22,890
Hmm.

135
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,424
I had a bet
going with myself

136
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,343
on how quickly
you two would visit.

137
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,761
Tell me not
to reveal your secret.

138
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:29,012
Looks like I won.

139
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,981
Actually, Felicity,
I was hoping

140
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,733
that I could get you
to change your mind.

141
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,685
I was worked up on
adrenaline last night,

142
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,737
and I didn't exactly put
my best foot forward.

143
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:39,158
I was hoping you'd
give me the opportunity

144
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,492
to do that now.

145
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,443
How about you start
with Ken Williams?

146
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,412
Did he also get to enjoy
your adrenaline last night?

147
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,281
No, he returned
the money that he stole

148
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,316
just in time
to put his son to bed.

149
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,818
Like I said, Felicity,
just a warning...

150
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,653
At this time,
we'd like to remind the public

151
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:55,622
that we are coordinating
our efforts with Interpol

152
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:58,491
as the Dodger operates
primarily in Europe,

153
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,294
and they have advised us
to warn the public

154
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,429
that he is to be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

155
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,164
You know, I heard about this guy.
They call him the Dodger

156
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,833
because he avoids
getting his hands dirty.

157
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:09,102
He uses hostages to do
his stealing for him.

158
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:10,304
How?

159
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:12,523
Puts a bomb collar
around their necks.

160
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,456
Last year, a guy
in Madrid didn't steal

161
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:15,509
what the Dodger told him to,

162
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,761
and it took his head off.
Literally.

163
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,180
And now the psycho's
in Starling City?

164
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:21,865
It's too bad his name's
not in your notebook.

165
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,850
You know, not all the people
that I target are on the list.

166
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,870
Every once in a while,
I make an exception.

167
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:29,990
A hostage-taking jewel
thief, for example.

168
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,478
So, why don't you help us
take him down?

169
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:41,240
He's late.

170
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,665
Never.

171
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:05,030
I maintain a Swiss account
for financial transactions.

172
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:07,266
Here's the number.

173
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:09,602
Thanks.

174
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:12,204
I'll wire you the money.

175
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:15,757
Assuming I don't
misplace the numbers.

176
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,245
My bookkeeping method
is a little sloppy.

177
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,306
Really?

178
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:22,974
Clearly you're under
the impression

179
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,310
that you can have the
Sherwood Ruby for a steal.

180
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:28,813
Well, you're new
here in town.

181
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:32,517
We're not as refined
in Starling City.

182
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,352
I'm getting that impression.

183
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,194
Don't worry.

184
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:45,196
Your men are merely unconscious.

185
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,665
In about 17 minutes,

186
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,667
they'll wake up
with the ability

187
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:51,052
to tell every other
fence in this town.

188
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:54,506
That I am not to be trifled with.

189
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:57,375
What about me?

190
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,728
I don't know.

191
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,815
What about you, indeed.

192
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:06,226
So to catch this guy,
we need to either

193
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,811
figure out where he is,
or where he's going to be.

194
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,106
Is this really how you guys figure
out how to get your target?

195
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,657
Over burgers and shakes?

196
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,943
Sorry it took me so long.
I'm waiting on a bunch

197
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:18,396
of particularly
rowdy customers.

198
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:20,031
You need me to handle that?

199
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:23,368
I appreciate it,
but I'm a pro by now.

200
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,420
I'll be here if you need me.

201
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:28,740
Girlfriend?

202
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:31,793
No, it's my sister in law.

203
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:33,345
Hmm.
Sort of.

204
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:35,847
Carly was married
to Dig's brother.

205
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:37,265
And he passed away.

206
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,967
Hmm. Well,

207
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:40,635
looks like
she's hot for you.

208
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:42,854
Ah. Can we get back
to crime fighting, please?

209
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:44,639
Actually, Dig,
I was thinking,

210
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,974
you probably should
ask her out.

211
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,809
Really?
Mm-hmm.

212
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,477
I'll do that just five minutes
after you ask out McKenna.

213
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,763
Ooh, the detective
on the Dodger case.

214
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:54,282
You have a thing for her?
Yes.

215
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:59,287
I don't see you
asking Carly out.

216
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,210
Felicity, this guy,

217
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:07,245
he's targeting a very specific
type of jewel.

218
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,264
We figure out why,

219
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,750
and that'll give us
the how to catch him.

220
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:13,117
I have an idea.
Mm-hmm?

221
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,754
Your crush object with a badge

222
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:17,555
said they were
working with Interpol.

223
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:18,344
Yeah.

224
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:19,792
Why don't I work
a couple of little tech,

225
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,893
you distract her
with a little flirty flirt,

226
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:23,728
slip said tech onto her phone.

227
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,130
It'll turn into
a micro transmitter,

228
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,465
and boom, we'll learn
everything she knows.

229
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,234
Hmm.

230
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:31,236
It's not how I typically get
my information.

231
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:32,937
How do you typically do it?

232
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,489
I find the person.

233
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:36,658
And then I put the fear of God
into them until they talk.

234
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,444
But we can try your way.

235
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:42,146
You know, Carly,
I don't want this to, um,

236
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,982
you know, to come off
weird or anything,

237
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,485
it's just...

238
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,173
Would you like
to have dinner?

239
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,958
How about tonight?

240
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,493
Tonight?
What...

241
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,796
We haven't waited long enough?

242
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:04,836
Mmm.

243
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:08,005
Who knew street meat
could taste so good?

244
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,892
I had a feeling you needed
a break from the office.

245
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,144
Hank was
my first client.

246
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,012
I kept his son
from being sent away

247
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,698
for a mugging
that he didn't commit.

248
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,818
And how did that not
score you free hot dogs for life?

249
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,455
CNRI gives low income people access
to the legal system.

250
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:26,791
Without them, his son could have
gone to prison forever.

251
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,660
I could have gone
to prison, too.

252
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:32,864
He couldn't afford a dream team
of super lawyers.

253
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,966
So I'm supposed to feel guilty

254
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:37,469
because I'm lucky enough
to have a rich family?

255
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,804
No. You are lucky.

256
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:42,807
And hopefully CNRI
will show you that.

257
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,375
Hey!

258
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,352
Give us the purse,

259
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:57,856
and we won't press any charges.

260
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,918
Yeah, you're right.

261
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,204
I really do feel lucky.

262
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,741
This got snagged
as he bolted over the fence.

263
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:18,877
Looks like a chain
from his wallet.

264
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:32,140
I thought you gave up crime fighting.
What?

265
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,893
Well, the business
with your sister. I figured...

266
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:37,395
Ohh.
You'd stay out of police precincts.

267
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,399
Yeah, I...I saw you
on the news

268
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,234
and I realized that
I never thanked you

269
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,603
for everything
that you did, so.

270
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,206
Thank you.

271
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,941
So you got promoted.

272
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,776
Major Crimes.
Wow.

273
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,361
And they assigned me
to the Dodger case.

274
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:56,080
He extorts people
into stealing for him.

275
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,750
How's that going?

276
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:00,301
Slow.

277
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,300
Well...

278
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,136
It was nice
seeing you

279
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:21,973
the last time
that I saw you.

280
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:23,658
Yeah. It's good
seeing you, too.

281
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
It was like old times.

282
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:27,812
Except the PG version.

283
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:30,081
How do you mean?

284
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,534
Well, you and I always knew
how to have a fun time.

285
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,786
Something that's been
missing from my life lately.

286
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,421
So how about a drink?

287
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:38,156
Not now.

288
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:41,042
Would you maybe--
I'll take you for a--

289
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:43,160
would you like to have dinner
with me, McKenna?

290
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,829
I don't know
if you heard,

291
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:46,432
I was on a deserted
island for five years

292
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:47,966
and I am totally out of practice
with this whole...

293
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:51,719
Hmm. Well--well,
dinner would be nice.

294
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:56,608
In fact, I can make
myself free tonight.

295
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,894
Yeah.
Great.

296
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:01,446
So I'll grab you
at eight?

297
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,681
That's perfect.

298
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,617
All right.
Ok.

299
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,453
I'm lingering. I'm going to go.
Ok.

300
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:30,308
Who's there?!

301
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:37,214
Help me.

302
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:49,261
Lance.

303
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:51,496
Sergeant,
it's Detective Hall.

304
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,215
I have an update
on the Dodger case.

305
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,803
A body was found in an
art gallery shot point blank.

306
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,336
There were
three other men there,

307
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,188
all rendered unconscious
by a highly focused

308
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,246
electric current to the heart.

309
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,803
Same M.O. as that
guard at the museum.

310
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:03,522
Got an ID on the vic?

311
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:05,673
His name is Cass Derenick.

312
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,758
Pause.

313
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,676
Who's Cass Derenick?

314
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,545
Arrest, possession
of stolen goods.

315
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:13,297
Arrest, conspiracy.

316
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,550
Conviction, attempted
sale of stolen goods.

317
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:18,101
This guy's a fence.

318
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,387
The Dodger's looking to unload
the Sherwood Ruby.

319
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,889
Which means he'll be
in the market for a new fence.

320
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,309
One he hasn't,
you know...killed.

321
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:29,929
So we find the fence
and we find the Dodger.

322
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,898
Anyway, I saw online
that you sell

323
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,201
a chain wallet with
an eight ball on the chain.

324
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:37,270
I was wondering
if you could give me

325
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:40,741
a name of one of your customers
if I gave you a description?

326
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:43,827
Yeah, sure, you can
call be back.

327
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:46,880
Like every other used clothing
and leather good store

328
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,915
I've called today.

329
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,451
What was that about?

330
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,253
What's up with the fancy fancy?

331
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:56,673
What? Oh, um,
I have a date.

332
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:59,459
Contrary to popular opinion,
I do have a life.

333
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:03,330
Then why do you seem
so nervous?

334
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:04,564
Is it obvious?

335
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,933
Just be your charming
and brooding self.

336
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,668
I mean, the girls
seem to dig that.

337
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,321
This girl is different.

338
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,808
She knew me before the island,
before I was...

339
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,111
That's CNRI.
I've got to take this.

340
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:21,498
I'm working on a very important
purse snatching case.

341
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,316
Yeah.

342
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:25,285
Hello?

343
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,920
Yes, I called you this morning.

344
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,756
Yeah, he might have been
wearing a red hoodie.

345
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,309
Kind of Abercrombie-looking.

346
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,461
His face, not the hoodie.

347
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,496
Really?

348
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:38,765
You wouldn't happen
to have his name?

349
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,520
Thank you so much.

350
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,343
Hey, Laurel.

351
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:53,847
Does your dad still
like arrest people?

352
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,699
I found the dirt bag.

353
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,819
His name is Roy Harper.

354
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:01,371
I can't remember
the last time I was here.

355
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,907
It's so beautiful.

356
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:08,662
Yeah, this was the place
to take a girl in high school.

357
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:12,299
Hmm, I was never
lucky enough to experience that.

358
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,469
I had braces and terrible bangs
back then.

359
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:19,089
I'm sure you looked amazing.

360
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,708
I'm glad we finally
got around to doing this.

361
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,727
Me, too.

362
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,931
You know, Andy set
a pretty high bar

363
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,100
when it came to first dates.
Hmm.

364
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:32,436
You know, he'd face down
armed gunmen for a living

365
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:33,961
but I've never seen him
as scared as he was before

366
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:35,986
that first date with you.

367
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,328
Ohh, Carly, I'm sorry.

368
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,914
That wasn't good
first date etiquette, was it?

369
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,750
Bring up Andy when we are having
a romantic night?

370
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,251
Probably not.

371
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:51,404
Look, Carly, this is
difficult and complicated.

372
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:54,007
It's not like there's
a manual, you know?

373
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,625
You know...

374
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:57,611
For a moment,
I--I felt like

375
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:59,412
a girl who likes a boy,

376
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:01,581
and nothing else
mattered.

377
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,084
But if this is
too hard for you,

378
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,304
or too complicated,

379
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:08,889
then please,
just get out now,

380
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,557
because I've already
been hurt too much.

381
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,892
Carly, listen, I'm sorry--

382
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:13,276
Can you just please
take me home?

383
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,036
Mmm.

384
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,704
No, no, no, no,
it is not possible

385
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,823
for something
to be this good!

386
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,742
Right?
Ohh!

387
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,247
So you must have
missed soufflés.

388
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:36,449
What do you mean?
Five years on an island,

389
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,718
away from civilization.
Ah, what did you do?

390
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,421
What did you eat?
Where'd you sleep?

391
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:44,457
How did you make it?
McKenna...

392
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:46,476
Sorry.

393
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,179
Didn't mean to drill you.
It's ok.

394
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:50,680
It's just I haven't
had a conversation

395
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:52,966
with a guy in a while
without it resulting

396
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:55,468
in me reading him
his rights.

397
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,854
So. Yeah,
but those years,

398
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:00,807
they must have
changed you.

399
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:07,480
From a guy I used
to party with to who you are now.

400
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,950
Yeah.

401
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,118
Because I had to make
some tough choices.

402
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,089
You're right.

403
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,425
It changed me.

404
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,427
What kind of
tough choices--

405
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,347
I don't want to talk about
those experiences, McKenna.

406
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,022
Saved by the cell.

407
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,641
Hall.

408
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:37,060
Ok, put what the C.I. told you in
the warrant application.

409
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:40,864
I'll be right there.
It's work, I got to go.

410
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:56,162
Felicity, listen, please.

411
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:57,831
I need you to activate
the bug in McKenna's phone.

412
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,700
I think the police
just got a lead on the Dodger.

413
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:03,202
Ok.

414
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,923
Who are you?

415
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:10,427
My name is Alan Durand.
I'm an exchange student.

416
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,746
I was on a fishing
excursion with my class.

417
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:17,517
We got lost and our boat
caught fire.

418
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,853
It was some mechanic malfunction.
We had to jump ship.

419
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:21,554
When?

420
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:23,556
Two days ago.

421
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,559
It was awful.

422
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:30,864
I thought I was
going to die.

423
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,700
Where are the other students?

424
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:36,586
Where's the boats crew, huh?

425
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:41,908
I think I'm the only one
who made it.

426
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,010
I managed
to get to shore.

427
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,912
I thought I was
lucky, but...

428
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:50,083
What? Somebody found you?
Soldiers, or...

429
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,085
Yes!

430
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,388
Yes.

431
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,891
They had these masks on

432
00:21:57,893 --> 00:21:59,893
and they attacked me
and beat me.

433
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:02,112
They left me here!

434
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:05,615
Who are they?!

435
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:11,287
You can untie me
at any point, by the way.

436
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:20,279
Nice place
you have here.

437
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:22,749
Oh, thank you.
Tell me.

438
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:24,951
Does every fence
in this town hire muscle?

439
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:27,620
I did
as soon as I heard

440
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,472
about what you did
to Cass Derenick.

441
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,124
Oh, yes, Cass.

442
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:33,677
God rest his soul.

443
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,762
He wasn't
a very nice man.

444
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:38,348
He tried to steal from me.
Oh.

445
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,467
I've heard that you have a better
sense of judgment.

446
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:44,804
And that you have no
trouble in moving this.

447
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:47,273
Well, it's only a recession

448
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:50,443
for some people.

449
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:57,352
I take a 15% commission
off the top.

450
00:22:57,452 --> 00:23:00,070
Let's call it
at 12, shall we?

451
00:23:00,072 --> 00:23:01,672
Obviously I don't
have to remind you

452
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:02,509
about what what happened
to the last person

453
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,374
who tried
to screw me over.

454
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,310
SCPD! Grab the floor!

455
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,467
Come quietly!

456
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,885
I'm afraid
I'll have to decline.

457
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,921
Then I'm afraid
you won't be going to jail.

458
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,291
I heard on the news
the Dodger got away.

459
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,374
Hopefully the night
wasn't a complete waste.

460
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,542
Your dates.
How'd they go?

461
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:35,460
Great.
Awesome.

462
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:37,095
You two suck
at lying.

463
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:38,930
The police and I busted it up

464
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:40,498
before the Dodger
could get himself paid.

465
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,933
Don't change
the subject.

466
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:45,637
Is your hacker chip
still working?

467
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:48,673
You two
are no fun.

468
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:49,841
Yeah.

469
00:24:49,843 --> 00:24:51,393
Still getting
a strong signal.

470
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:53,278
You should pull up
the police records.

471
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,814
Everything the Dodger's
stolen so far.

472
00:24:55,816 --> 00:24:58,066
What are you thinking?
We know the Dodger has a taste

473
00:24:58,068 --> 00:25:02,537
for a very specific
type of antiquity.

474
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,323
Yeah.

475
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:06,158
These all look like
they're from the ominous decade.

476
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,211
The last ten years
of King Ferdinand's reign.

477
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:11,029
And she says
we have no lives.

478
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,664
Are there any other
places that sell

479
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,533
or display items
from the ominous thing?

480
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:17,969
Decade.
Not really.

481
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:19,504
I guess people
in Starling City

482
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:21,006
prefer the Elizabethan era.

483
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,257
The Starling City
Cancer Society.

484
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,541
It says right there
they're holding

485
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:25,344
a fundraising auction
tomorrow night.

486
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:27,896
We could lure him
out into the open.

487
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:30,015
With what? A fake?

488
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:32,901
No. The Dodger clearly has a
trained eye for this sort of thing.

489
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:35,787
He's not going to fall for anything
less than the genuine article.

490
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,259
Where are we

491
00:25:37,284 --> 00:25:39,242
going to get our hands
on a rare Spanish antiquity?

492
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:42,728
You really have no idea how rich
his family is, do you?

493
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,739
Roy William Harper Jr.

494
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:59,442
Where's senior?

495
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:02,610
Norris cemetery.

496
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,583
Sorry to hear that.

497
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:10,468
You and an army of bookies.

498
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,953
Can I go?

499
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:13,621
No. You've been
IDed as a suspect

500
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,223
in a purse snatching.

501
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:18,276
It's quite a résume
you've compiled here.

502
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:20,628
Petty theft, B&E,
robbery,

503
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,180
petty theft.

504
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,249
Stolen car. Well, it's nice
to change things up

505
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,967
once in a while.
And petty theft.

506
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:27,769
You got something
against banks?

507
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:29,854
Well, it is hard to run with one
under your arm.

508
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:33,091
Well, maybe you'll learn a few
new skills in prison.

509
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,643
Look, I don't want to steal.

510
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:38,163
Ok? I don't have
any other choice.

511
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:41,116
My mother, she...

512
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:43,001
She has a problem.

513
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,819
Yeah, her son's a moron.

514
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:47,422
No.

515
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,808
Vertigo.

516
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:55,864
She got hooked
on Vertigo last year.

517
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,299
She kicked it,

518
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:01,369
but I guess
she'd done enough that...

519
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,641
It messed her up.

520
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:07,809
Hmm.

521
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:09,811
She hasn't been the same,

522
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:11,730
and her medical bills--

523
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:15,817
look, I'm...I'm just trying
to help her get out from under.

524
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:21,189
Look, we're not privileged enough
to have as much as other people.

525
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:22,523
Ok?

526
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:24,492
Fine.

527
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:26,428
Let him go.

528
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,998
It's just a damn
purse, right?

529
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,175
They'll meet with you.

530
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:42,344
It has been arranged.

531
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,431
Thank you for this.

532
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,318
There's one more thing
I need you to do for me.

533
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,910
Malcolm's the only one
who knows where

534
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,935
Walter's being kept.

535
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:55,907
I just...I just need a clue.

536
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,560
Some lead to follow.

537
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:01,279
If our plan works,

538
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:05,333
I can't let it damn
Walter to hell.

539
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:08,503
No.

540
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:13,174
That's the fate that's in store
for us, I'm afraid.

541
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:47,542
The police
are here, too.

542
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:49,610
Your bait's attracted them,
at least.

543
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:52,580
That's not exactly
who I'm looking to catch.

544
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,625
So I'm getting a good
signal from the GPS

545
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:06,344
I put in
your family's broach.

546
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:07,896
I can track it on my phone.

547
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,681
Speaking of,
have you given any thought

548
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:11,966
to what might happen
if this doesn't work

549
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:15,437
and the Dodger absconds
with your family jewels?

550
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,907
I'm sorry, that
came out very wrong.

551
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:22,643
Let's just keep our eyes
open, Felicity.

552
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:27,482
Hey, isn't that...

553
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:30,585
You can just follow him
over there, ok?

554
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:35,173
Mm-hmm. I would rather take my
chances with a deadly jewel thief.

555
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:36,958
Right.

556
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:55,276
Hey!

557
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,395
That broach was donated
by the Queen family.

558
00:29:57,397 --> 00:30:00,014
If you want it,
you're going to have to bid.

559
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:01,232
Actually, love,

560
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:03,818
I thought
I'd just take it.

561
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,408
Maybe I should
check out front,

562
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,327
see if the security
guards had any problems.

563
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,879
That's a good idea. I'm going
to go check on the bait.

564
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:19,442
I think I have a problem.

565
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:25,173
Get away from me!
If this thing blows...

566
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:27,124
Not going to happen.

567
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,399
The Dodger said if I called
the police, he'd--

568
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:31,819
I'm going to get decapitated,
aren't I?

569
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:32,640
The tracker's on the move.

570
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,679
If I find him, I can
get him to disarm it.

571
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:37,891
Talk me in. Stay calm.

572
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:40,060
Too late.

573
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:44,164
Go. Just go. Go, go, go.

574
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,037
Talk to me, Felicity!

575
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,538
Ahem.

576
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,924
Heading towards
Adams and O'Neil.

577
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:56,293
At the clip he's going,
he's got to be in a vehicle.

578
00:30:56,295 --> 00:30:59,380
Hey. I need
your bike.

579
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,849
Are you kidding me?
No.

580
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:17,455
I'm mobile.
Where is he?

581
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:24,506
Talk to me, Felicity.

582
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:25,685
Come on.

583
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:28,143
First time anyone's ever been
grateful for traffic cameras.

584
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:30,777
He's one block
from your position.

585
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,299
If you cut through Harris Plaza,
you'll end up right behind him.

586
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:46,556
Where is he now?

587
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:48,108
Got it.
I got him, I got him.

588
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,727
Gray sedan driving north.
At the light ahead of you.

589
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:57,567
Ok, hard right.

590
00:33:05,668 --> 00:33:07,503
Hey!

591
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:10,305
Don't do anything stupid.

592
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:12,131
I had the foresight
to collar up

593
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:14,516
a particularly
inquisitive blonde.

594
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:16,301
I assume she's
a friend of yours.

595
00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:19,053
Touch one hair on my head
and she loses hers.

596
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:22,506
You've got quite
the choice to make, don't you?

597
00:33:22,508 --> 00:33:24,475
Not this time.

598
00:33:24,477 --> 00:33:26,694
Your median nerve's
been severed.

599
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:29,230
You couldn't push
that button if you tried.

600
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:39,407
Oh, thank God.

601
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,792
Why are you doing this?

602
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:42,994
I'm exactly like you.

603
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,529
I only steal
from the rich.

604
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,910
I'm not Robin Hood.

605
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:58,632
I don't know when
these men are coming back!

606
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,864
You have to believe me.

607
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:01,948
Untie me, please!

608
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:09,422
What, do you think
these men,

609
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:13,510
they planted me here,
some kind of trap or something?

610
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:17,097
I...Well, why'd they
tie you up like that

611
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,431
and then just leave you?

612
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,133
Huh? Why not just kill you?

613
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,601
They were going to!
They got called away

614
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,303
at some--some altercation

615
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:25,605
somewhere else
on the island.

616
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,141
If they come back,
they will kill both of us.

617
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:29,676
Please! You have
to believe me.

618
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:30,810
Please.

619
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:32,395
All right, turn--

620
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:35,232
all right, turn around.

621
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,451
Thank you.

622
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:43,189
Thank you.

623
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,030
I'm sorry...

624
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:04,075
But I can't.

625
00:35:04,078 --> 00:35:05,527
What? Why?!

626
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:07,296
Why not?

627
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:15,304
Because I don't know you.

628
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,539
Are you out
of your mind?!

629
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,207
Please!

630
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:21,593
You can't do this!
You can't just leave me here!

631
00:35:27,548 --> 00:35:29,299
You know, last night
all I could think about

632
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,167
was how pissed off
Andy will be;

633
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:34,387
how hurt he'll be
if he saw us together.

634
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:39,109
But that's nothing
compared to how he'd be

635
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:41,978
if I did something
to hurt you, Carly.

636
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,348
Believe me when I tell you
that war is easier than dating.

637
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,335
In a war, you act

638
00:35:48,337 --> 00:35:50,653
or you die.

639
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:54,124
No time to think, no time
to second guess yourself.

640
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:56,910
Maybe that's
your problem.

641
00:35:56,912 --> 00:35:58,411
With me,
you're thinking.

642
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,997
Not feeling.

643
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,668
You're right.

644
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:39,169
How did you know
where I live?

645
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:41,554
A little thing
called the Internet.

646
00:36:41,556 --> 00:36:45,408
Look, could we not
do this with a door between us?

647
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:57,520
So I guess you're not
pressing charges

648
00:36:57,522 --> 00:37:00,923
'cause you feel like--
you feel like you can change my life?

649
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:02,809
And so you can run and tell your rich
prep school friends

650
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:05,645
what a Saint you are and how
you're helping the disadvantaged?

651
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,782
You don't know
a thing about me.

652
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:12,202
Thea Queen.
Trust fund brat.

653
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:14,904
Totaled her car, which she got
as a birthday present.

654
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:17,073
Loves designer labels

655
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:19,075
and is usually in the tabloids
for partying too much.

656
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:21,694
Did I--did I leave
anything out?

657
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:23,496
Yeah.

658
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:26,382
Dead father,
missing step dad,

659
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:28,051
damaged brother,

660
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:30,970
and almost served
jail time for that car accident.

661
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:35,975
Plus, she really
wants her purse back.

662
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:39,479
You know, you showed some
real sack coming down here,

663
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:41,798
the Glades in the middle
of the night.

664
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:45,267
You must not know the value
of a vintage purse.

665
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,549
Don't worry,
it's all there.

666
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,750
Except for these. Ahh.

667
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,086
You know, it's a really
filthy habit you got there.

668
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:13,006
Yeah, tell me about it.

669
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:15,508
Hey, can I give you
some advice?

670
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,262
First, stay out
of the Glades.

671
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,930
And second?

672
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:23,706
Don't fall
for every sob story

673
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:27,176
a guy like me
tells the police.

674
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:30,596
You have
a great evening now.

675
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:51,450
Do you ever take time off?

676
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:54,236
I do.

677
00:38:54,238 --> 00:38:57,206
In fact, last night
I went on a date.

678
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,626
The guy was
kind of a jerk.

679
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:02,578
Really?

680
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,863
He might have
had a reason.

681
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:10,469
McKenna,
I didn't just lose

682
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:12,922
five years
on the island.

683
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:16,375
I lost the part of
me that enjoyed...

684
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:19,929
Being alive.

685
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:23,432
Listening to music
and, uh...

686
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:28,654
eating a soufflé
with a beautiful girl.

687
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:30,940
It's the easy things.

688
00:39:30,942 --> 00:39:33,993
But when you asked me
about the island,

689
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:37,329
it reminded me
of all the hard things

690
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:40,666
and the hard choices that
I had to make that

691
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:42,785
still stay with me.

692
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:46,088
Made me question
how I can trust,

693
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,124
and even
if I'm worthy of...

694
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:49,959
being with anyone.

695
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,694
You are.

696
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,229
Mmm. Hmm.

697
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:11,730
Can I take you
to a dinner?

698
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:14,116
That I promise not
to cut short.

699
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:15,934
Um...

700
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:17,570
Throw in a soufflé
and you're on.

701
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:20,072
McKenna!

702
00:40:20,074 --> 00:40:21,874
Glad you're still here.

703
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:24,827
Queen.
Mr. Lance.

704
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:26,712
Actually, I was just leaving.
Is everything ok, sir?

705
00:40:26,714 --> 00:40:28,964
Yeah. I'd like you
to, uh,

706
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:30,749
work with me on
the Vigilante investigation.

707
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:32,384
Thank you, sir.

708
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,786
Well, don't worry,
we'll bring him in.

709
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:38,007
Oh, yeah.

710
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,428
Ah. Ready to go?

711
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,962
Yep.

712
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:45,764
Ok.

713
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,472
Ahh. It tastes like an ashtray.

714
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:56,692
But it does the job.

715
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,579
I owe you one.

716
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:06,818
You didn't get into
any trouble out there, did you?

717
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,371
Hmm?

718
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:14,376
No. Not a bit.

719
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:20,850
Frank Chan recommended you.

720
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:23,552
He said you could
help us with our problem.

721
00:41:25,188 --> 00:41:28,774
He appreciates you
agreeing to meet with me.

722
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:32,780
Anything for a friend.

723
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,248
So...

724
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:37,432
How can we be of assistance?

725
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:40,668
Malcolm Merlyn.

726
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:42,689
I want you to kill him
for me.

727
