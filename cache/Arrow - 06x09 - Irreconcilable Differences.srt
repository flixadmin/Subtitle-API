1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,833
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,228
After 5 years in hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:07,162
with only one goal--
to save my city.

4
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:09,364
Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.

5
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:11,767
By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor,

6
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:14,036
but by night, I am someone else.

7
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:16,104
I am...Something else.

8
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:18,707
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:21,176
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:22,945
Hi, Ollie.

11
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:25,347
SCPD!

12
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,251
His name is
Vincent Sobel.

13
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:30,752
He's my old partner.

14
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:32,955
We have to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

15
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,856
The police are coming.
You should go.

16
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,526
Will you marry me?

17
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:39,161
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:41,063
You're the very
best part of me.

19
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,899
I'm a better human being
just because I've loved you.

20
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:45,167
No matter what life
throws at us,

21
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,835
our love can
conquer it.

22
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:49,338
Oliver Jonas Queen,
Felicity Megan Smoak,

23
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,608
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,243
Please kiss your bride.

25
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,048
There he is.
Hey, buddy.

26
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,783
Aunt Thea said I can
have some champagne.

27
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:05,687
I said a sip and only
during the toast.

28
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,222
Mom and dad used to
let us do that.

29
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:08,423
That--that's just fine.

30
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:10,192
Yeah, and we turned
out all right.

31
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:12,427
I think that they
would be pretty impressed

32
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,730
with this party
and the groom.

33
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:17,532
- Think so?
- Yeah. Of course.

34
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:19,468
Why? Is
everything ok?

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,037
Felicity was supposed
to be here by now, so...

36
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,373
What's there to be nervous
about, Ollie?

37
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,208
You guys are
already married,

38
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,111
and it's not like you invited
anyone but John

39
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,712
to the ceremony.

40
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:32,080
Well, you were still
in the hospital,

41
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:33,482
and it was just a little
last-minute, ok?

42
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,916
Yeah. I know,
I know.

43
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:36,785
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

44
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:38,720
Lyla apologizes
for not being able to make it.

45
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,555
A.R.G.U.S. missions do
not stop for weddings.

46
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:44,159
Well, she was hoping
that they would for...this.

47
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:46,528
Congrats, man.

48
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,863
So where is
the bride?

49
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:49,264
I don't know.
Donna said that she had

50
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,233
a plan, but I...

Mom insisted
that we make an entrance

57
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,627
since we didn't have
a traditional wedding,

58
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:19,661
which I'm sure I'll
never stop hearing about

59
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:20,896
for the rest of my life.

60
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,230
Welcome
to the family.

61
00:02:22,232 --> 00:02:25,300
- Oh!
- Son! Ha ha ha!

62
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:27,235
I can call you
that now, right?

63
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,671
- Sure. Yeah.
- Great!

64
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:31,273
I want you to know

65
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:33,442
that I have forgiven both
of you for running off

66
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,478
and eloping
and for waiting

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,746
to propose
to my daughter

68
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,247
until you were
under indictment.

69
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,216
Oh, actually, Felicity
proposed to me.

70
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,251
Come on, Donna.
Let's let them have their day.

71
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:45,287
They did have their day,
and we weren't part of it, remember?

72
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,422
I guess she's keeping a tradition
of the Smoak women

73
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,291
not having traditional
weddings.

74
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,560
What are you talking about?
We had a wedding.

75
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,296
No. Getting married
by a Tom Jones impersonating rabbi

76
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:55,597
isn't exactly traditional.

77
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,232
I thought that you
loved Tom Jones.

78
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,934
No, I don't. You love Tom Jones.
You know what?

79
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,635
At least we had
a Jewish wedding.

80
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:01,837
Seriously, you guys,
would it have killed you

81
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,706
to get a rabbi
or a chuppa?

82
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,475
I'm gonna steal
Felicity for a moment.

83
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,310
- Oh, yes, of course.
- I'll bring her back.

84
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:10,145
Just a chuppa.

85
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,980
Those whack jobs are
already your in-laws, so if you're having

86
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,515
second thoughts,
it's too late for you.

87
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:15,784
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

88
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,853

love me.

you guys would end up together.

- Didn't I say that, honey?
- She did.

98
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,249
Even when I saw on the news
that your engagement was off,

99
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:50,352
I kept telling this one,
"Adam, Felicity and Oliver

100
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:51,820
"are meant to be together.

101
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,221
They're going to
work it out."

102
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,823
- Didn't I say that, honey?
- You did.

103
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,091
- I did.
- Well, we're so glad you guys

104
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,325
could make it.

105
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,927
It's great to
see you again.

106
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:01,129
I'd tell you guys
to move back to Ivy town,

107
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,732
but I guess being mayor of Star City
would make that kind of tough, right?

108
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:07,402
We love Ivy town,
but Star City is our home.

109
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:11,573
Best part
about weddings--free booze.

110
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,275
Salud.

111
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:15,343
Unh. Ahh.

112
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:18,046
Paul and I had,
um, specialty cocktails made

113
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,981
at our wedding.

114
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,784
The Holtini and the Peach
Paul Sangria.

115
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:26,955
We also wore
matching white tuxes.

116
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:30,058
♪ wrong in all
the right ways... ♪

117
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,460
Can I have a glass
of champagne, please?

118
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:33,628
You ok?

119
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,031
Me? Oh, yeah.
Of course.

120
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,999
Just because I'm
divorced doesn't mean

121
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:40,569
that I can't handle
celebrating people getting married.

122
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,970
Well, I'm not that
into weddings either.

123
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:44,372
- Shocker.
- Well, the idea of spending

124
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:47,242
the rest of your life
with one person seems pretty unrealistic,

125
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,544
and, uh, also
pretty boring.

126
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:50,812
- Hmm.
- That's probably why I've had

127
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:52,614
so many busted
engagements.

128
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,449
- Say what?
- What?

129
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:58,386
- Be right back.
- What? You just gonna leave

130
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:00,322
on that bombshell--that's
what you're gonna do?

131
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,723
Hmm.

132
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:04,059
Is it me, or has she
been acting weird lately?

133
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,027
Oh, no. She's definitely
been on Upswipz.

134
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,097
She's been secretly
texting with somebody for weeks now.

135
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,632
Good for her.

136
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:12,567
You know, maybe you
should start dating, too.

137
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,671
Oh. Heh. Yeah.
I date plenty.

138
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:18,240
Oh, really. Who?

139
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,809
Hmm. Who? Oh, man.
You know, so-- so many guys.

140
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,444
- Wow.
- There's one guy in particular

141
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:24,079
who I'm dating.

142
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:26,615
Uh, his name is...
Dom Perignon.

143
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,817
He is smooth
and expensive,

144
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,253
and he's really nice,
uh, but there's, like, other guys, too.

145
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:33,021
I'm not trying to be
tied down right now, you know.

146
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:34,623
I'm trying to live
that single life.

147
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,691
Who? Like, Tom Collins,
Rob Roy?

148
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:39,294
Not actually
a gin guy.

149
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,998
Congratulations,
Mr. Mayor.

150
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,799
Come on, Quentin.
It's Oliver tonight.

151
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,635
Matter of fact, it's
always Oliver.

152
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,838
Well, I got a, uh--
I got a little something for you, Oliver.

153
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:55,477
Yeah. I know.
It doesn't look like much--

154
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,680
heh heh--but, uh...

155
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,849
My dad gave that to me
on my wedding day.

156
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,617
Quentin, I can't
accept this.

157
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,853
It's not like I got
anybody I can give it to, is it,

158
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:09,057
and besides, it's not

Oh, boy.

173
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,173
It is not tangible,

174
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:00,308
so who's to say
it's not just made up?

175
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,411
I mean, there's
no hard-core proof

176
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,580
that it actually exists.

177
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:09,150
I mean, look.
I love a lot of things--

178
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:12,520
sweaters, math, coffee,
but, you know,

179
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:14,723
I'm not gonna
marry that stuff.

180
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,658
What is marriage anyway?
Like, what is it?

181
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,160
Like, is it--it's
a paper that says,

182
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:21,496
"oh, I'm owed to you
forev"--I don't--no.

183
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,531
I can leave like that,
so what is marriage really

184
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,533
when it boils
down to it?

185
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:27,168
I have some more stuff
to say.

186
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,237
And everybody give Curtis
a round of applause.

187
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:33,208
Thank you, Curtis.
Thank you.

188
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,944
Um, I--I think what
my friend is trying to say is,

189
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:41,750
um, true love is so special
that we all dream about it,

190
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,018
and when I look
at Oliver and Felicity,

191
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,554
I'm reminded of how I felt
about my wife

192
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,590
on our wedding day.

193
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:52,193
We were so in love.

194
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:56,564
We would do anything
for each other, I mean, no matter what,

195
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:59,401
and that is the epitome
of Oliver and Felicity.

196
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,569
Yeah. I mean, you guys have
had your struggles,

197
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:04,072
but you always work
through it.

198
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:07,575
These are two of the most
genuine people in the world,

199
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,778
and they deserve
all the happiness,

200
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,983
and I'm so fortunate
to call them my friends,

201
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:19,621
so please raise a glass
to true love.

202
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,556
Oliver and Felicity.

203
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:24,292
To Oliver
and Felicity!

204
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,995
It's time now for
the couple's first dance.

because your speech
was so sweet.

209
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:54,622
I have
my moments.

210
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:56,391
You ok?

211
00:08:56,393 --> 00:09:00,462
Yeah. You know, just,
um, thought a friend might have come.

212
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:02,464
Would have been
nice to see him.

213
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,032
Oh, it's a him?

214
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,568
I'm guessing he's more
than just a friend then.

215
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,138
Weddings make you
nostalgic for the ones you love.

216
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,041
I definitely miss
my wife and my family.

217
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,843
You know, for what
it's worth, I did see

218
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,344
the DJ checking you out.

219
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,847
Oh, no, no.
I don't do DJs.

220
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,616
I had a thing once.
It did not work out.

221
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:25,453
Can you believe
our daughter is married?

222
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:27,522
- Oh, my gosh.
- I really can't.

223
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:32,360
Thanks for letting me
back in her life.

224
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:35,630
I made a mistake
asking you to stay away.

225
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:39,267
Seriously. Felicity
needs her father in her life,

226
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:41,302
and just
for the record,

227
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:44,672
I think Tom Jones
is actually--

228
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,341
he's pretty good.

229
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:48,810
- I kind of like him.
- Hey.

230
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:50,912
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. Is this awkward?

231
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,580
You two
know each other?

232
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:57,051
No. It's, um--we--I--

233
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:58,720
Well, then this is
awkward.

234
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:00,722
I'll go get myself a drink.

235
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,862
Wow. You look, um...

236
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,365
You look really good.

237
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,501
- You mean I look sober.
- Yeah.

238
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:15,670
I'm sorry. The last
time I saw you, I was in--

239
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,372
You were going
through a nightmare.

240
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:24,712
Uh, it's Jean Loring.
This is Oliver's lawyer,

241
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:27,749
and I got to take it.

242
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:28,950
I-I-I'm sorry.

243
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:31,185
Oh, yeah. No.
Sure, sure.

244
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:33,588
I was never the girl
who dreamed about her wedding,

245
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,524
but I have to say
this was the perfect evening.

246
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,126
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

247
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:42,263
Uh, so sorry.
We--we got a problem.

248
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:44,098
I think I
jinxed it.

249
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,435
Come on. Come on.
Ahem.

250
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:49,137
- What's going on?
- Well, listen.

251
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,705
I really did not want
to do this right now,

252
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,373
but Jean Loring
just called,

253
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,208
and she said I got
to tell you right away.

254
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,777
- It's ok. What's happening?
- I told her you were

255
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,211
in the middle of
celebrating your wedding--

256
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,447
Quentin!
What's going on?

257
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:05,587
The prosecution's
smoking gun.

258
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,221
It's a witness who is
willing to testify

259
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:09,991
that you are
the Green Arrow.

260
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,726
- Who?
- Well, that information's

261
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:14,996
still under seal, but it's
someone on the team.

Hey. Hold on a second.
We do not know

266
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:34,081
this is an Evelyn Sharpe
situation yet.

267
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:36,269
It's a betrayal.

268
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,371
I never should have
trusted them.

269
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,039
It's not a them.
It's a one,

270
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,641
a one who wants to
out you to the FBI

271
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,176
that would lock you
away for life.

272
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:44,511
That's an awfully
long time.

273
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:45,945
I'd wait for you.

274
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:47,380
Hey. Just got
your message.

275
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:48,948
Usually, a bride
and groom like to be

276
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,650
alone on their
wedding night. What's up?

277
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,652
Somebody on the team gave
me up to Samanda Watson.

278
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:53,953
That's impossible, Oliver.
No one would do that.

279
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:55,688
Lance got it
from Jean Loring.

280
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,791
Jean Loring got it from
district attorney Armand.

281
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,193
I'm running surveillance

282
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,961
on Curtis, Dinah,
and Rene,

283
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:03,663
and I have worms
crawling through their texts and e-mails.

284
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,633
- You're spying on them?
- I'm not spying on them.

285
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,501
I'm, like,
keeping tabs.

286
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:10,637
Oliver, why not just
confront whoever this is

287
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,438
and give them a chance
to come clean?

288
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,841
What makes you think
they're gonna be forthcoming?

289
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:16,342
How do we know that this
isn't just the--

290
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,311
the surface
of this betrayal?

291
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:20,413
Look, John. I don't want
to spy on them,

292
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:23,016
but if you have
a better idea,

293
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:25,618
I'm all for it.

294
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,620
No.

295
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,556
If someone goes
somewhere suspicious, we'll know.

296
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,391
Felicity, we were all
just at the wedding.

297
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:33,393
The most suspicious place
they can go is out for late-night pizza.

298
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:37,163
John, either Curtis,
Dinah, or Rene gave me up.

299
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,033
We need to know why,
we need to know who.

300
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:42,802
Otherwise, when you
put the hood back on,

301
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,871
you could be next.

302
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,546
All right, all right,
all right.

303
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:55,048
Where do you want to go,
bathroom or couch?

304
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,883
Hey, hey, hey.
I am perfectly capable

305
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:59,719
of walking myself--
ohh! Ugh.

306
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:03,690
No, no. That was not
because I was drunk.

307
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,959
That is just because
I am very clumsy.

308
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:08,194
Wow. So this is
the dog house. Ruff!

309
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:12,865
Ha ha! It's actually
way cleaner than I thought it would be.

310
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:16,069
Oh. You have flowers.
Why do you--why do you have flowers?

311
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:19,005
Are you seeing some
lady friend or something?

312
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,707
It's not like that.

313
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,709
You know who I am
gonna see when I get

314
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:24,177
to my place
in the morning?

315
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,645
Some hot dude?

316
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,113
Myself.

317
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:29,082
In the mirror.

318
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:30,717
Alone. Heh.

319
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:33,119
Do you think it was
the vigilantism

320
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:34,954
that drove Paul away,

321
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:39,492
or did--did I just lose
my charm or--ugh.

322
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:44,297
Do you--do you ever
feel like life

323
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:49,168
would be easier if there
was never a team Arrow?

324
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,338
Only all the time.

325
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,307
You know what, though?

326
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:58,311
Oliver and Felicity got
their happy ending,

327
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:03,216
which is all that matters
to Oliver at least.

328
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,952
That's just the booze talking,
Hoss, all right?

329
00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:07,787
I mean, you're gonna
find someone new,

330
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:10,356
but until then,
you got all of us.

331
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,862
That's what I get
for being nice.

332
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:35,315
You have to stop
contacting me.

333
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:38,384
I've done all I'm
willing to do for you.

334
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:40,853
I'm not here to
ask for a favor.

335
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,658
Then what do you want?

336
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,493
I miss you, D.

337
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:50,196
That dress
reminds me

338
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:52,098
of the one you wore
for the Guzman Op.

339
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,136
Don't do that.
Don't try to dip me in nostalgia.

340
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,739
I don't even know who
you are anymore, Vince.

341
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:03,042
The man I knew
would never,

342
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:06,412
could never kill
an innocent person.

343
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:09,849
The people I've killed
weren't innocent.

344
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,818
Oh, no? Well,
what about that cop

345
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,453
you accidentally shot
last month?

346
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,988
- Collateral damage.
- What?

347
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,358
Are you trying to tell me that there
hasn't been any

348
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,259
in the war
the Green Arrow's fighting?

349
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,662
No. No.
There hasn't.

350
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:25,164
Sounds like I'm
not the only one who's changed.

351
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,833
The Dinah Drake
I knew

352
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:28,735
was never
this naive.

353
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:34,040
Oliver brought me back
from a very dark, very bad place.

354
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,842
He stopped me
from becoming you.

355
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:38,177
The only difference
between him and me

356
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:42,415
is that I don't lie
to myself about what I'm doing.

357
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:47,220
Look. I may not
be a Saint,

358
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:49,155
but I do know this.

359
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,057
I care about you.

360
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,128
I always have
and always will.

361
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:03,236
Don't contact me.

362
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:05,071
Leave town,

363
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:09,075
and if I catch you
out in the field again,

364
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:11,411
I won't let you get
away a second time.

365
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:15,982
You didn't have to
walk me all the way home, Quentin.

366
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:18,251
You know I can take
care of myself.

367
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:20,119
You are still recovering from
6 months in a coma, Thea.

368
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,922
Let me be a little
overprotective here.

369
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,492
Hello, Thea.

370
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:29,262
Congratulations on not
being comatose.

371
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,230
Cayden James would like
a word with you.

372
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:33,232
- Get away from him.
- Thea.

373
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:35,334
You just got out
of the hospital.

374
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:37,770
Are you so eager
to go back?

375
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,475
Thea!

376
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,143
Laurel, you ca--uh!

377
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,488
Next time, I'll put you
back into a coma...

378
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,123
Speedy.

379
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,715
- Can we get audio on this?
- No. I tracked her

380
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:07,716
to this location,
then accessed street cams.

381
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:09,751
Guess we know how
vigilante escaped the cops last month.

382
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,419
There's no way we can tell
what she's saying to him.

383
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,921
It doesn't matter what
she's saying to him.

384
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:14,789
She lied to the team.
About this.

385
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,625
- Oliver, listen.
- What else has she lied about?

386
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:19,145
- Let's not get paranoid here.
- Well, it's not paranoia

387
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:19,910
if it's
a legitimate fear.

388
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,712
I mean, vigilante
tried to kill Oliver last year.

389
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,069
He wants to out
him to law enforcement,

390
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,299
he's virtually doing
the same thing--it puts him away for life.

391
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:26,901
Ok. I don't think Dinah
would do this.

392
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,623
She cares way too much
about this team. Oliver, listen.

393
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,484
She--she supported me
through my injury

394
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,619
- and as the Green Arrow.
- I know,

395
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,988
and I appreciate that,
but after what happened

396
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,658
with Evelyn,
we need to protect ourselves.

397
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,129
-Thea? You ok?
-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

398
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,999
- It's ok.
- Well, what happened?

399
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,368
Evil Laurel.
She took Quentin.

400
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,637
- Oh.
- I tried to stop her, Ollie,

401
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,973
but I--I'm not
strong enough anymore.

402
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,941
It's ok. It's fine.
I'm just--I'm glad you're ok.

403
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,676
Yeah, but how
are you all right?

404
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,445
Not--not that I'm not
glad that you're ok,

405
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,347
but it's not like
evil Laurel to leave loose ends.

406
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,782
She needed
a messenger.

407
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,218
What are the chances
that that's gonna ring, like, right--

408
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,121
Fantastic. That's not
creepy at all.

409
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,827
Hello.
This is Cayden James.

410
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,864
- Where's Lance?
- Now why would I tell you that?

411
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,301
- What do you want?
- A nanoaluminum amplifier.

412
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,836
I don't know what
you're talking about.

413
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,304
Well, that's all right.

414
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,806
I'm sure you can
research it,

415
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:34,378
and when you do,
you'll find that it's secured at A.R.G.U.S.

416
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,381
Deliver it to me
or Quentin Lance dies.

417
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,017
The last time we spoke, you
vowed to destroy the city.

418
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,720
I'm guessing this amplifier gets you
one step closer to completing that goal,

419
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,556
so why should I help you?

420
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,525
I did float the concept
of Mr. Lance dying, didn't I?

421
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,694
Now you listen to me--

422
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,930
At nightfall tomorrow,
I will text an address

423
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,464
to this phone.

424
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,667
You'll be there
with the amplifier,

425
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:02,039
or Quentin Lance
shuffles off this mortal coil.

426
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,908
Oh, and please don't breathe a word
of this to your friends at A.R.G.U.S.

427
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,379
It's safe
to say there are no good reasons

428
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,114
that Cayden wants
that amplifier.

429
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,450
- It sounds like a trap.
- He has Quentin.

430
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,185
It doesn't matter.
He has leverage.

431
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,187
Can you and Curtis make
a--a replica of this thing,

432
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,556
a fake to pass off
to Cayden James?

433
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,125
No. I mean, we're good,
but we're not that good. It's one of a kind.

434
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,528
Isn't this guy some type
of genius hacker?

435
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,897
He knows it's at A.R.G.U.S.
why doesn't he just hack in there himself?

436
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,865
A.R.G.U.S. is 100%
air-gapped.

437
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,834
I mean, you can't
access their network unless you're on site,

438
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,436
and I doubt he wants
to cross paths with A.R.G.U.S.

439
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,171
Since they held him
prisoner for 8 months.

440
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,039
He's using us instead.

441
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,075
A.R.G.U.S. isn't just
gonna hand over this amplifier.

442
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,811
They have a longstanding
policy of not negotiating with terrorists.

443
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,847
- Let's bring in Curtis and Rene.
- No Dinah?

444
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,750
Until we know where
her loyalties lie, she's out.

445
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,860
Oh, Dan, I can't
tell you how much I appreciate this favor.

446
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,862
I know it's not exactly protocol
letting me in here,

447
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,264
but I wanted to
leave this little surprise for Lyla

448
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,833
for when she
gets back.

449
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,402
Not letting protocol
get in the way of romance.

450
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,938
Yeah. Well, thanks
for helping keep the flame alive.

451
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,907
I, uh--I forgot
my card.

452
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,909
It's back at security.
I'm an idiot. I'll go get it.

453
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,645
No, no. I'll grab it.
Don't need everyone

454
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,947
to see you roaming
around without clearance.

455
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,649
Good idea.

456
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,154
Overwatch.

457
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,795
You're up.
Talk to me.

458
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,664
Ok, you guys. I'm working
on locating the amplifier.

459
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,265
Just stand by.

460
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,933
Oh. Ok, you guys. I got it.
It's in the east wing.

461
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,335
I'll shut down security
when I access the panel.

462
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,170
Does everybody copy?

463
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,938
In position.

464
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,461
Still don't understand
why the brown guys

465
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:45,130
got to be
the janitors, though.

466
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:46,865
Janitor is a very
honorable profession.

467
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:49,201
They clean up after
you puke, which is something I might

468
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:50,035
do very soon.

469
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:51,535
- Why the hell isn't Dinah here?
- Is it possible that

470
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:52,837
she could be more
hungover than I am?

471
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,038
Definitely not.

472
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,073
Guys, focus.

473
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:05,021
Overwatch, I'm in position.

474
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:06,957
How long until security
is down?

475
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,425
That depends on Curtis.

476
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:14,497
We're clear. Ohh.
Also, leaning over-- not a great decision.

477
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,366
You are not
throwing up.

478
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:17,934
I'm already spending
my honeymoon in a garbage can.

479
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:19,936
- I'm not wearing your puke!
- You slapped me.

480
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:21,871
Oliver, I can only
buy you 60 seconds

481
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,007
before the security
around the amplifier turns back on.

482
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,542
That's more than enough
time for me.

483
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,510
The floor is
still pressure sensitive.

484
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,179
If you touch it, it will
retrigger the alarm.

485
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:31,081
Roger that.
On your count.

486
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,550
3, 2, 1. Go.

487
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,319
Almost there.

488
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,266
Guys, you're about
to get company.

489
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,967
We need more time.

490
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,805
Ahh. Sorry.

491
00:21:55,807 --> 00:22:00,744
I got it. Clear in 3, 2, 1.

492
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:05,915
Got it.
Come on.

493
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,787
How you guys doing, huh?

494
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:19,396
Good news is this
is exactly what Cayden wanted.

495
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:22,132
- Bad news is it's--
- Exactly what Cayden wanted.

496
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,067
- Yeah.
- At least, now we know what

497
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:26,136
he's gonna use
it for.

498
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,004
What? He didn't want to
supercharge his Christmas lights?

499
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:29,706
Remember that thermobaric
bomb that Cayden stole?

500
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,276
Well, this will
multiply the blast radius 20-fold easily.

501
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:34,978
That's the entire
city and then some.

502
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,680
Look. I want to save
Lance as much as anyone,

503
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:38,315
but he wouldn't
want this.

504
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:39,816
I mean, he wouldn't want
us to just hand over

505
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,751
something so dangerous
to some psycho.

506
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:43,687
Yeah? Well, that's
exactly what we're going to do.

507
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:46,323
- Curtis is gonna sabotage it.
- Curtis is gonna do what, now?

508
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,291
The amplifier doesn't
have to work.

509
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:49,793
We just need Cayden James
to think that it works

510
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,461
long enough for us
to get Quentin back.

511
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:52,929
I could back-channel
a path into the circuitry.

512
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,798
If you hide it behind
the existing board,

513
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,700
it might buy us enough time to get Lance,
get the hell out of there.

514
00:22:57,903 --> 00:23:00,303
Hey.

515
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:03,973
Did you guys just get
back from the field?

516
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:05,675
Why didn't I get a call?

517
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,878
We should speak
in private.

518
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,513
That's a bit dramatic,
don't you think?

519
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:14,617
Ok. Ahem. I know that
you've been meeting

520
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,853
with the vigilante
in secret.

521
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,825
- You followed me?
- I did.

522
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:24,661
Whatever business
I have with Vince is none of yours.

523
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:26,696
It is when it threatens
to put me in prison

524
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,398
and keep me away
from my son.

525
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,066
What the hell are
you talking about?

526
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:31,668
I'm talking about being
arrested off the statement

527
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,571
of someone who knows
my identity,

528
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,639
somebody on this team.

529
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:39,242
And you think it was me?
What, because I didn't tell you about Vince?

530
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:43,279
I think you have given me
no reason to trust you.

531
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:45,715
Pfff.

532
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:50,587
And you?
What about you?

533
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:52,589
You don't trust me
either, John?

534
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:56,059
Dinah, I'm sorry.

535
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,529
Wow.

536
00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:03,099
No. Uh, no, no. Hey.
I'm the sorry one.

537
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:05,869
Yeah, I'm...
I'm the sorry one

538
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,138
for having your back
all those times.

539
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:11,541
- Screw you guys.
- I'm not finished.

540
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:14,110
- I am!
- Hey. Guys, can we--

541
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:16,279
can we all just please
calm down for a second?

542
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,348
Look. I know everyone's
stressed because

543
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,583
Cayden's threatening to
blow up the city

544
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,452
and Lance is kidnapped,

545
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,020
but let's just--all
just take a breath.

546
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:25,922
Now, I'm not saying
that it's me,

547
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,657
but it can literally be
any one of us.

548
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,127
Dinah, you were
the only one with something to hide.

549
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:33,797
Everyone else
checked out.

550
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,965
- What does that mean?
- Yeah.

551
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:37,700
What does that mean,
John?

552
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:40,904
It means we had
you under surveillance.

553
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,906
- What? All of us?
- Yeah.

554
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:48,144
And by all of us,
you mean all of us.

555
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:50,113
So just the newbies.

556
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,515
We're out there risking
our lives just like the rest of you are!

557
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:54,751
Stop.

558
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:56,653
Dinah isn't
the witness, Oliver.

559
00:24:56,655 --> 00:25:00,623
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do

560
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,059
because it's me.

561
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:05,295
I'm the one who's
testifying against you.

562
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,388
Agent Watson came to me.

563
00:25:12,395 --> 00:25:14,340
She said she had proof
that I was Wild Dog

564
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:16,208
and that she was gonna
use it against me

565
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,943
to make sure that I
never saw Zoe again.

566
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:21,046
She said she had
a solid case against you

567
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:24,416
and that she was
gonna arrest you either way.

568
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,418
You were going down.

569
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I just couldn't make
the trip with you.

570
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:29,921
You should have
told us, Rene.

571
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:31,423
We could have figured
something out.

572
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:33,391
There was nothing
to figure out, Hoss.

573
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:36,261
Right? There is
no other way.

574
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:38,496
Yeah.
Now we'll never know.

575
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:41,433
Rene...

576
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:43,001
Get out.

577
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:49,674
Get out.

578
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:04,055
Oh, good. You're awake.

579
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:07,259
I wanted us
to have a little daddy-daughter time.

580
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,494
Because of what
happened on Lian Yu?

581
00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:12,097
You make it sound
like I should be over it by now.

582
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:14,599
You shot me and left
me for dead.

583
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:16,468
You seem to have
bounced back.

584
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,803
Yeah. Thanks
to Cayden James.

585
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:20,839
He sent someone
for me.

586
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:23,341
I'm sorry. I made
a mistake shooting you.

587
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:24,976
I'm glad you're ok.

588
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:26,511
Heh. Then you're
an idiot.

589
00:26:26,513 --> 00:26:29,147
Heh. You're probably
right.

590
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:32,150
You're probably right.

591
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:36,888
Listen. When you, uh--
when you look at me,

592
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,359
do you see your own
father at all?

593
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:42,994
No.

594
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:47,499
Because my father died
when I was 13.

595
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:49,067
What happened?

596
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:51,469
It was my 13th birthday,

597
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:55,907
and he left to go get my birthday cake,
like he did every year,

598
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:58,376
and then
the phone rang.

599
00:26:58,378 --> 00:27:00,679
There was an accident.

600
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:03,715
A drunk driver ran
through a red light.

601
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:06,718
Head-on collision.

602
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
I'm sorry.

603
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,222
I used to pick up
Laurel's cake, too,

604
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:15,527
yellow with
chocolate frosting,

605
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,563
from her favorite
bakery.

606
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:20,532
Carlye's.

607
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:23,368
Sorry you didn't get to
know your father.

608
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,570
I guess you're
stuck knowing me.

609
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:29,240
Ok. It's time.

610
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:35,046
Remember, if Green Arrow
reneges on our deal, you kill him.

611
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:44,923
How can you
eat this?

612
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:46,624
You ask me that
every time.

613
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:48,493
He means
at a time like this.

614
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:50,562
Stress makes me hungry.

615
00:27:50,564 --> 00:27:53,131
So does guilt.

616
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:57,502
I just--I screwed up.

617
00:27:57,504 --> 00:28:00,972
You know, Oliver was
right to kick me off the team.

618
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,741
You were in
an impossible position.

619
00:28:02,743 --> 00:28:04,709
Yeah, and when
you're in an impossible position,

620
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:08,446
that's why there's
a team, D.

621
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:10,181
Just like Dig said.

622
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:15,320
You're uncharacteristically
quiet, Hoss.

623
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:18,223
Just hungover,
doing some processing.

624
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:20,492
I'm actually doing
a lot of processing.

625
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:22,961
Oliver spying on us,
you mean?

626
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:24,929
Not gonna pretend there's not a difference
between the three of us

627
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:27,599
and the three of them,
you know, the original 3, but--

628
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:29,567
Spying on us?
I mean, come on.

629
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,870
- It crosses a line.
- Yeah,

630
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,173
and I just don't like
the way that it makes me feel.

631
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:40,111
Now I'm stressed.

632
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:48,486
Wow. It's good.
It's real good.

633
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:59,163
- Hey.
- Hi.

634
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:01,866
Felicity told me
what happened.

635
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:05,970
- Yeah.
- Would ask if you're ok,

636
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:09,173
but I think I already
know the answer.

637
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:12,443
Thinking
about what Rene did.

638
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:14,044
What did he do really?

639
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,480
He kept a secret,

640
00:29:16,482 --> 00:29:20,184
and he--he put his daughter
ahead of the team.

641
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,554
And I feel betrayed.

642
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:26,157
How can I feel
betrayed

643
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,960
by somebody doing
the exact same things that I've done?

644
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:34,365
Because you've never
sold anyone out on the team, Ollie,

645
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:38,702
and if you're convicted,
you could end up spending

646
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:41,705
a really long time
in jail.

647
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,777
But having said that,

648
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:49,780
you're doing
the right thing, looking

649
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:52,349
at things through his
perspective,

650
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:55,586
and having done that,
maybe you can see

651
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,955
your way to
forgiving him.

652
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:59,623
Seriously?

653
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,393
Well, Rene is a--

654
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:05,262
a very desperate guy
who just did

655
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,032
a very desperate thing,

656
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:11,235
but he's also the same guy
who just last night

657
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:14,238
was giving such
a heartfelt, sweet speech

658
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,740
and--and calling
you his friend,

659
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:19,410
and I really think
that he meant that.

660
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:22,446
It was a betrayal,
no question,

661
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:25,583
but since you've been
able to see things from his point of view,

662
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:31,422
you...You should also
be able to see your way to forgiving him.

663
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,391
Listen to you.

664
00:30:34,393 --> 00:30:37,228
Quentin needs the team
right now, Ollie,

665
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,430
but he needs
the whole one.

666
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:44,668
It's almost nightfall.

667
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,971
Let's have the team
suit up.

668
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:49,173
John...

669
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:51,308
The whole team.

670
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,977
Copy that.

671
00:31:01,698 --> 00:31:03,264
Thanks for having me
back, man.

672
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,581
Let's get our
friend back.

673
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,816
This is where Cayden James wants
to make the exchange?

674
00:31:07,818 --> 00:31:09,518
Yep. It's a no-brainer
he picked this place.

675
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,953
It's a digital black hole.

676
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:12,588
There's no cameras,
insulated walls.

677
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,089
Once you guys get inside,
I'm totally blind.

678
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:15,758
But that means
so is he.

679
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,493
- Get the amplifier working?
- I hope so

680
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,428
because otherwise
we'd be handing

681
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,197
a crazy psychopath
the means to crater the entire city.

682
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,966
I mean yes.
Yes, it's ready.

683
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:26,001
I will handle the exchange.
You 3 be my eyes and ears.

684
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:28,337
The priority
is extracting Quentin,

685
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:31,607
but if we get a chance to take Cayden
James into custody, we take it.

686
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,276
Whatever we're going through,
whatever issues we have,

687
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,845
let's put it aside
and get the job done.

688
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:39,548
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

689
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,550
Agreed.

690
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:43,052
Ok. Let's go.

691
00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:52,428
So we meet again.

692
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,696
Where's Lance?

693
00:31:53,698 --> 00:31:56,665
Oh, somewhere handy.

694
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,801
I'll be taking that
amplifier now.

695
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:03,105
You will be telling me
where Lance is.

696
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:05,674
A fair request.

697
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:09,645
Equally fair, lay
down your bow.

698
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:11,714
I'll let you speak
with him.

699
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:16,485
I am a man of my word.

700
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:18,053
If I wasn't, there
wouldn't be much point

701
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:22,024
in vowing to destroy
this city, would there?

702
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:29,832
We can't see anything
from up here.

703
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,433
Let's search
the building.

704
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:34,203
Green Arrow said stay put
until he makes the exchange.

705
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:35,671
What? We're--we're
his eyes and ears,

706
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,339
and we can't
even look around?

707
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,241
Guys, we need
you as backup.

708
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:40,709
Well, maybe if you bugged
Lance like you bugged us,

709
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:41,944
we'd know where he was.

710
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:43,679
Whoa. We didn't bug
you guys.

711
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:45,547
We tracked your GPS.
It's totally different.

712
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,182
- Bugging me now.
- You know I can hear you

713
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:48,751
through Wild Dog's comms.
You know that, right?

714
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:52,521
Screw it. I'm not gonna
sit around here

715
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,823
and wait for Oliver
to decide to trust us again.

716
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:10,406
See? Wasn't
that easy?

717
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,746
Are you all right?

718
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,982
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Accommodations could be nicer,

719
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:21,517
but, yeah, I'm fine.

720
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,318
Yeah? Well, sit tight.

721
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,354
- I'll be there soon.
- Yeah. Just don't compromise

722
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:27,623
the city's safety
for me, all right?

723
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,758
Now there's a dedicated
civil servant.

724
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,660
I wish there were
more like him.

725
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:34,129
Proof of life
as requested.

726
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:37,433
Your turn now, I think.

727
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,435
Take what you wanted.

728
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:44,473
I think not.
You see, what I wanted

729
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:47,609
was a nanoaluminum
amplifier,

730
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,446
one that hasn't been
sabotaged.

731
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:54,817
He knows. That makes no sense.
How could he know?

732
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:58,420
I'm disappointed,
though not nearly as much,

733
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:00,956
I imagine, as your
friend, Mr. Lance.

734
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,492
Kill him.

735
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:05,794
And kill him.

736
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:21,009
Team, everything's
gone south.

737
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:22,044
Back up Green Arrow!

738
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,861
Wild Dog, terrific,
where are you guys?

739
00:34:38,863 --> 00:34:40,629
- We're on our way.
- On your way?

740
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:42,164
Why weren't you
in position?

741
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,433
Haven't got time
for that now, Hoss.

742
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,105
We've got eyes
on Lance.

743
00:34:57,448 --> 00:34:59,548
Ugh!

744
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,383
Unh!

745
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:09,491
James is gone.
His men are down.

746
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:11,426
Where the hell is
everybody?

747
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:12,694
I've got Lance and Laurel.
They're exiting

748
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:13,929
the north side
of the building.

749
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:15,864
I'm on my way.

750
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:18,167
Laurel's getting
away with Lance.

751
00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:20,269
And we've got
company.

752
00:35:26,844 --> 00:35:29,745
- Ok. One last stop.
- Ugh.

753
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:37,719
Run.

754
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,426
Laurel.

755
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:03,879
- You all right?
- Yeah.

756
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:05,781
Thanks for coming
to get me.

757
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:13,288
- Can I get a sitrep?
- Is everyone ok?

758
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,025
Yeah. We're good here.

759
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:24,346
How's Lance?

760
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,281
He's fine.
Sleeping it off.

761
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:28,583
Any sign of Cayden James
or Black Siren?

762
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:30,252
Nada. They're completely
off the grid.

763
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,686
But we got
Quentin back.

764
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:33,522
That was
the objective, right?

765
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,925
Right. You and Rene were
supposed to be backup.

766
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,426
Where'd you go?

767
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:41,396
We were looking
for Lance,

768
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:43,899
and from what I
can tell, we found him.

769
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,301
Moving off of
your position, was that

770
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:47,903
your call or Curtis'?

771
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,738
Look. I was
right there beside--

772
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,239
It was my call,

773
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:53,041
and it turned out
to be the right one.

774
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,076
You got lucky, Rene.
Doesn't make it the right call.

775
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:58,346
Look, man. I know
you're pissed at me,

776
00:36:58,348 --> 00:36:59,814
and I don't care

777
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:01,583
because you left us
blind out there,

778
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:03,151
and I wasn't gonna
let Lance die

779
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:04,719
just because you
didn't trust us enough

780
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,288
to go off leash
and look for him.

781
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,123
When we are in the field,

782
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,091
there is a clear
chain of command

783
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:11,793
plain and simple.

784
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:13,295
I've been the same guy
tonight that I've always been

785
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,096
since you brought me
onto this team.

786
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:16,498
Rene, yes, that's true.

787
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,233
You have--sometimes,
you go your own way.

788
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,168
- That's right.
- And I put up with it

789
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,836
because I trusted you.

790
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:23,338
What's that supposed
to mean?

791
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,240
You got a second chance
tonight, my friend,

792
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,777
and you broke
our trust again.

793
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,913
You don't get a third.

794
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,216
- You're off the team.
- Just like that?

795
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:37,819
Just like that.

796
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,624
It's been real, y'all.

797
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,165
Yeah, I hate to say it,
but Oliver is right.

798
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,769
We're a team. We need to--
we need to trust each other,

799
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:57,872
need to believe
in each other.

800
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:01,109
I don't
believe in you anymore.

801
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:04,546
- Dinah.
- Don't.

802
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:08,416
It's too late.
I'm out, too.

803
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:27,068
Guess we should both
be glad I didn't

804
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,770
leave town
like you said.

805
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:31,172
Oh, thanks. That's
really what I needed right now,

806
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:32,807
an "I told you so."

807
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,777
You ok?
You don't look it.

808
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:40,181
I don't really want
to talk about it.

809
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,850
Then why'd you
reach out?

810
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,918
Because I had no one
else to call.

811
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,121
I'll try not to be
insulted by that.

812
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:55,063
I really needed someone
who believed in me.

813
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:57,165
I needed a friend.

814
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:02,871
Friends.
I can do that.

815
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,347
Sunflowers!
My favorite!

816
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:15,250
Well, I wanted it
to feel like home.

817
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:20,221
I'm not gonna have
to leave again, am I?

818
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:25,093
Hey. I won't let anyone
split us up ever again.

819
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:27,162
I promise.

820
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,204
I'm just gonna say this.
I don't think there's

821
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,907
anything that has been
said or done that can't be undone.

822
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,310
I don't think
I agree, John.

823
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:45,880
I agree with Felicity.
We need to move forward.

824
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:48,216
Sorry I'm late.
Um, I think I

825
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:50,318
probably might
still be a little hungover.

826
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,723
I've also been
thinking about a few things.

827
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,492
Oliver, you and
Dinah were right.

828
00:39:57,494 --> 00:40:00,428
No trust, no team.

829
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:05,600
You all spied on me,

830
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:08,103
invaded my privacy.

831
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:12,273
Whether you couldn't
trust me or not,

832
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:14,075
it means that
I can't trust you.

833
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:16,411
Curtis, what's
that supposed to mean?

834
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:19,447
I'm still a part
of Helix Dynamics, Felicity.

835
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,282
That's separate,

836
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:23,818
but this...

837
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,692
I'm done.

838
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,671
Ahem. Like I said,
we need to move forward.

839
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,707
- Oliver.
- Cayden James knew that we

840
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:49,144
sabotaged the amplifier
last night.

841
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,146
We need to find out how.

842
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:59,954
When you had me raid their bunker
and plant that minicam two months ago...

843
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:01,990
Is this the outcome
I had in mind?

844
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,892
Quite so, Ms. Lance,

845
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,728
although I must confess,
things have worked out

846
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,297
even better than
I anticipated.

847
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:11,266
Hardly impressive.

848
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,701
Left to his own devices,

849
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:17,672
Oliver Queen will always
push away those closest to him.

850
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:20,341
So we've got them
fighting with each other

851
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:22,277
instead of fighting us.

852
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:27,015
Please tell me
that isn't your whole master plan.

853
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,050
Oh, not at all,
Mr. Diaz.

854
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:32,620
In fact, I think it
fair to say that this...

855
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,056
Is only the beginning.

856
