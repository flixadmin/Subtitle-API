1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,250
Holy Shit!

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,170
We are going to hold hearings
on Vought and Compound V.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,670
I'm the world's greatest superhero.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,880
You're my greatest failure.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,550
I do like you. You got spunk.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,390
You'll be a big help to me.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,520
What the hell does that mean?

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,730
That's Lamplighter.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,440
These people are test subjects.
Trying to stabilize the V.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,610
Anytime, you get a solid Supe.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,490
- Why would Vought do that?
- We are in a war for the culture.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,070
But we can fight back

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,820
with an army of supermen, millions strong.

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,580
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,250
And then I found you.

16
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,670
We found each other.

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,970
Thirty percent
of the public is hardcore aware now,

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,050
and know how the system works.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,350
And we don't do anything about it.

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,350
And that's why superterrorists
continue to invade America.

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,480
Illegal immigrants
pour into this country every day.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,570
Any one of them
could be a superterrorist.

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,900
Many are calling for more superheroes,

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,610
in order to counter
the superterrorist threat

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,240
and protect Americans.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,740
- I gotta go. I'm late for class.
- Thanks.

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,290
- Have a good day, hon.
- All of us need to stand up.

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,870
I'm sick of waiting
for some executive to finish racquet...

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,580
We are going to hold hearings
on Vought and Compound V.

30
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,000
That's $1.45.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,460
I'm gonna tell you something I shouldn't.

32
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,220
Something the government
doesn't want you...

33
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,430
And they want more superterrorists.

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,260
People are pointing out,
the rush to judgement by the left...

35
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,810
- Victoria Neuman's accusation...
- No offence...

36
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,890
Have a good day, hon.

37
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,190
Why does it matter
what some supervillain-loving snowflake...

38
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,110
Every minute we waste,

39
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,860
one superterrorist
has already gotten through.

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,150
- More Will come.
- $12.45.

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,160
And, I mean, for all we know,

42
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,700
these maniacs
could've already flown over our borders.

43
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,250
- And be standing next to you.
- You all right, pal?

44
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,580
- Waiting for the chance to kill.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,500
Keep America safe again.
I am so glad that I was there this time.

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,340
- I am counting on you.
- Have a good day, hon.

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,550
- Every minute we wait...
- No, it's up to us.

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,050
We have to make our voices heard...

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,570
I am counting on you to show us the way.

50
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,530
Don't let me down.

51
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,690
Hey.

52
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,200
I saw the light in your eyes.

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Take the money.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,500
You one of them? Fucking supervillain?

55
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,210
- What?
- Are you bullet-proof?

56
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,290
No, please.

57
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,000
I have a family. Please.

58
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,100

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

61
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,860
Look, I told you. Stormfront
gave the orders. I just executed them.

62
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
It was, um...

63
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,030
It wasn't easy.

64
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,200
We can all agree
that you're the real victim here.

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Let's cut the shit.
Go over it again from the start.

66
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,960
I just left The Seven.
Mr Edgar invited me to his club.

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,000
Put away that petulant look
before you hurt someone with it.

68
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,920
I should be chuffed we're pissing away
the best asset we ever got.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,630
- Your plan would be?
- Same as always.

70
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,720
Squeeze the cunt
till he gives up the next cunt.

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,090
Kill the fuck when we're done.

72
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,300
I've no doubt you'd be happy
with that unending cycle of brutality.

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,680
How can you
not want blood for what he done?

74
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,390
He's willing to speak
against Vought at the hearing.

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,690
We've never had Congress on our side.

76
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,110
Congress? Please.

77
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,570
What a bunch of corrupt cunts they are.

78
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,320
You're not the first person
to call me a cunt, Mr Butcher.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,780
I'm starting to think
it's a badge of honor.

80
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,740
Term of endearment where I'm from.

81
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,700
Well?

82
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,870
Opposition will have afield day with him.

83
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,160
Disgruntled ex-Supe.

84
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,500
I'm sure he's fucked
half the Sacred Heart cheerleaders.

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,250
But, yeah, he'll be a good witness.
It's not enough, though.

86
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,880
Not enough? If torturing and burning
a bunch of mentals on Vought's say-so

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,800
ain't enough for you,
then what are you good for?

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,930
A strongly worded tweet?

89
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,800
You're a wanted felon. We don't need you.

90
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,260
Yes, we do, Lisa.

91
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,640
Mr Butcher has fought Vought
harder than we have.

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,230
But I would like a turn,

93
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,060
if we can trust each other.

94
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,270
I think we can.

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,860
- Trust each other.
- Hold still.

96
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,320
What do you need?

97
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,570
We know what they were doing
at Sage Grove, but we don't know why.

98
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,740
Why test Compound V on patients?

99
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,200
What do they want?
I need the full picture.

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,700
If we take a shot at the king,
we can't fucking miss.

101
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,880
We know someone
who might know the full picture.

102
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,540
Well, that's fucking rich.

103
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,630
Who is it?

104
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,220
Like you said,
we're gonna have to trust each other.

105
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,300
Would you like a coffee?

106
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,890
Um, no, thanks.

107
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,600
How about a white chocolate unicorn frap?
They're really good.

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,310
- No.
- I'll get one to share.

109
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,400
Mom, I don't want
a fucking unicorn frappé.

110
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,230
Okay, sorry.

111
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,530
Just nervous.

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,990
When did you get to town?

113
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,160
I never left.

114
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm staying at the Days Inn in Newark.

115
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm not leaving until we talk this out.

116
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,920
I know what I've done to you.

117
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,250
Believe me, I know.

118
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,340
Mom, it's not just you.

119
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
It's...

120
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,390
Do you remember that...

121
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,520
cross you gave me for confirmation?

122
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,060
Before every save that I went on,
I would touch it.

123
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,980
Like a football player
leaving a locker room.

124
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,780
I thought that God
was sending me on a mission.

125
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,030
I feel so stupid.

126
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,450
I gave my whole life to nothing.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,160
- That's not true.
- Mom.

128
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,670
The good guys don't win.

129
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,710
The bad guys don't get punished.

130
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,300
What we do means nothing,
it's just all for money, and...

131
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm in the middle of all of it.

132
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Alone.

133
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,140
Honey, you're not alone.

134
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
You're not.

135
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,980
Let's go away. You and me.

136
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,770
Let's get away from all of this.
Get away from Vought.

137
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,480
Escape for a while.

138
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,780
I cleared it already.

139
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,950
You cleared what?

140
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,660
With Ashley at Vought.

141
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,030
You called them?

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,620
About an hour ago. Why?

143
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,870
They could be looking...

144
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,250
Mom!

145
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,680
Colonel, you think
the congresswoman is in danger?

146
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,300
She has her security detail.

147
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,850
Which will be useless if a Supe drops in.

148
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,100
She's our best chance to nail Vought,

149
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,810
but only
if you keep her alive until the hearing.

150
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
And Serge?

151
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
No abandoning your post this time.

152
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,290
Hey.

153
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,250
I'm all right. I'm coming with you.

154
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,340
You're in no shape to go anywhere.

155
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,880
Besides, we got
a very important job for you.

156
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,550
We need you
to look after our star witness.

157
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,680
Hey, you guys wanna watch
Deep Does It in the Blowhole?

158
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,850
Ready to get wet?

159
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,350
- I don't wanna watch that film.
- Yeah, you are.

160
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,270
It's a classic. You'll love it.

161
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,270
Butcher, let's go.

162
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,070
Hello, Mum.

163
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,490
Hey, Billy,
you ain't been picking up.

164
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,530
We're in a meeting.

165
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,570
I'm in New York.

166
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,370
Look, I told Judy
to tell you not to fucking come.

167
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,420
- Language.
- It's a bleeding expensive plane ticket.

168
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,670
- I ain't got time to just...
- Billy.

169
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,250
He's dead.

170
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,760
Your father's dead.

171
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,430
You there?

172
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,890
When did that happen?

173
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,350
Can I see you, please?

174
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,270
I need to see you right now.

175
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,040
Let me out!

176
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,790
Come on.

177
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,430
Please, let me out.

178
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,140
Please, let me out.

179
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,810
Please.

180
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,890
Come on, man, stop. It's not cool.

181
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,520
Guess you should've made
your wife cum, snowflake cuck.

182
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,860
You don't need the discs.

183
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,870
- You can download...
- What do you wanna watch next?

184
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,990
Translucent the Invisible Cock.

185
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,290
Queen Maeve Pleasure Slave.

186
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,250
Big Black Noir.

187
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,170
Starlight Pulls an A-Train.

188
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,590
I'm good, I'm good, thank you.

189
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,170
Okay. Different strokes, man.

190
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,970
Don't say that in this context.

191
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,930
I should just get up and leave.

192
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,010
But you like watching
Homebanger fuck me, don't you?

193
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,970
Look, this isn't healthy, man.

194
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,980
You can't watch porn while the sun's out.

195
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,650
If I get up at that hearing, I'm dead.
What difference does it make?

196
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,440
Okay.

197
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,360
Drop the remote,
or I'll burn your face off.

198
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,500
Fuck your wife like she deserves, cuck.

199
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,160
You know I was a prodigy?

200
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,080
A fucking prodigy.

201
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,380
I lit my first fire at 4,
burned my whole house down.

202
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,630
My dad,

203
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,510
he was so proud.

204
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,140
"My son's a Supe."

205
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,850
I was gonna do great things.

206
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,810
I almost did.

207
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,560
Now look at me.

208
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,280
I'm like the cuck in the porn,
sitting on the sidelines,

209
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,740
while the heroes are out there,
doing the fucking.

210
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,370
Know why they left me to babysit you?

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,870
Because you're useless?

212
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,210
My mom, she...

213
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,210
Never mind.

214
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,260
After she was gone,

215
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,890
I watched my dad
do nothing his whole life.

216
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,810
But, me, I thought
I'd finally found something.

217
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,570
I thought I found what I was meant to do.

218
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,410
But it turns out,
I'm shit at that as well.

219
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,450
You're not the cuck.

220
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,660
I'm the cuck.

221
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,750
Actually, you're worse.

222
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,460
You're the cuck—fluffer.

223
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,920
Hey.

224
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,630
What's up?

225
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,850
How are you doing out there?
Good to see you.

226
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,890
All right.

227
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,480
Hey, do me a favour.

228
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,650
Who's the real heroes?

229
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,650
You are.

230
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,900
Heck, yeah. I want to be clear.

231
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,360
No one condones the tragic shooting
at the convenience store.

232
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,410
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to Kuldeep Singh's family.

233
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,660
We are making a donation
to Samaritan's Embrace in his name.

234
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,080
Absolutely.

235
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,710
Thoughts and prayers.

236
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,580
But that doesn't change facts.

237
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,840
This used to be a beautiful country.

238
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,260
- Remember?
- Yeah.

239
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,260
One nation under God, remember?

240
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,550
Right before these godless,
inhuman supervillains

241
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,100
started pouring across our borders,

242
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,560
and dragging us down into their mud.

243
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,070
What do SJWs,
like Victoria Neuman, want us to do?

244
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,110
Just let them in,
and give them a cup of iced tea?

245
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,860
- Then punish us for trying to stop them.
- Right.

246
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,870
Has there been anyone in history

247
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,080
more persecuted
just for trying to protect their own?

248
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,450
- No!
- That's right!

249
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,080
We are at war.

250
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,080
- Yeah!
- We need more Compound V.

251
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,170
...Absolutely.
- We need more Supes.

252
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,670
- More Supes.
- We need more superheroes.

253
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,050
More Supes...

254
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,800
Now, I've always been honest with you,
you know that.

255
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,260
I gotta be honest with you now.

256
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,350
Brings me no pleasure to tell you this,
but we also had a mole in The Seven.

257
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,190
That's right. One of our own.

258
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,230
Starlight.

259
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
I know, I know. It's okay.

260
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,650
She's been apprehended
and she can't hurt anyone else.

261
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,530
I can't believe this.

262
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,790
Put them in. All of them.
I want all of them in at the same time.

263
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,040
Okay, this is insane.

264
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,160
- Hey.
- No.

265
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,960
Fuck, yeah.

266
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,460
Starlight has been conspiring
with the people

267
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,420
who murdered,
in cold blood, my brother.

268
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,340
- Your hero, Translucent.
- My God, fuck.

269
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,760
- If you're just tuning in...
- Okay.

270
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,720
I bet you she's in 42D.

271
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,680
You have reached the voicemail...

272
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,770
Butcher, where are you?

273
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,310
- If she's still alive.
- Wait, what's 42D?

274
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,980
At the Tower. Supe-proof, mostly.
Steel walls, 6 feet thick.

275
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,900
How do I get in?

276
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,520
Into the Tower? You don't.

277
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,820
Sorry, man, but she's probably dead.

278
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,030
There's gotta be something.
A secret entrance?

279
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,950
Maybe one or two.
But forget it, man, it's crazy.

280
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,080
Show me. Come with me.

281
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,580
You're still fucked up.

282
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,870
- Exactly why I need your help.
- Get your friends.

283
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,420
Butcher isn't picking up.
The others are across the state.

284
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,880
We gotta go. Now.

285
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,250
Listen, Vought screwed you over, right?

286
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,550
They're trying
to do the same thing to her.

287
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,300
This shit is over for me.

288
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,550
My whole life is over, okay?

289
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,520
This is your last chance
to be a hero again.

290
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Come on, do you wanna be the cuck,

291
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,150
or do you wanna be
the guy who fucks the wife?

292
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,780
Okay, yeah, yeah.

293
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,240
Let's go fuck the wife.
Consensually. Come on, come on.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hello, Mum.

295
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,890
You come with me.

296
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,310
Now don't hate me.

297
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,860
Why would I hate you?

298
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,990
I'm sorry. It was my idea.

299
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,200
But you wouldn't come any other way.

300
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,830
No, no, no, don't.
He hasn't got much time.

301
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,460
Not my problem, it's yours,
because you stayed with the cunt.

302
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,960
Have I ever asked you for anything, ever?

303
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
William.

304
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,280
What, no hug?

305
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,280
You step one inch closer,

306
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,030
and I'll kill you quicker
than that fucking ass cancer.

307
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,280
I'll bet you would.

308
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,950
I seen on the news,
you topped that Stillwell slag.

309
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,410
It weren't me,
but thanks for your support.

310
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,960
Hey, please, please.

311
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,090
I just wanna talk.

312
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,340
Two minutes.

313
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Ooh.

314
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,100
Been following the Ashes?

315
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,020
You wanna talk about fucking cricket?

316
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,650
You remember the '83 World Cup?

317
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,940
I took you to every match.

318
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,860
Leeds, Old Trafford.

319
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,030
You loved it.

320
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,530
Did you know why I loved it?

321
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,250
You'd get on the piss
with your loser mates.

322
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,500
I could fuck off for hours,
and you'd never know.

323
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,080
Let's not do this, then.

324
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,590
Yeah, let's not.

325
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,050
I know I was no perfect father.

326
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,510
I know I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny.

327
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,840
I don't want that with you.

328
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,350
Didn't have a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny?

329
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,640
You're the reason he's dead.

330
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,480
Let me tell you something, William.
It's a shit world out there.

331
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,310
You can't rely on no one but yourself.

332
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,860
You either sink, or you swim.

333
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,240
And in Lenny's case, he chose to sink.

334
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,950
You don't have the fucking right
to mention his name.

335
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,160
I fucking loved Lenny.

336
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,750
But he wasn't hard like you.
That's why you're here, and he's dead.

337
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,830
You beat the fucking shit
out of the both of us.

338
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,380
Maybe I pushed you a bit hard.

339
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,130
But look at you.

340
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,630
- Get off.
- You afraid of anything? No?

341
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,510
Are you
the strongest bastard you know?

342
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,590
Yeah.

343
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,970
Tougher than I ever was.

344
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,560
You're welcome, asshole.

345
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,870
Lenny stuck that gun in his mouth
when you couldn't hack it anymore,

346
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,620
and you pissed off
to join the SAS, like a right cunt.

347
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,080
You're the one who abandoned him, not me.

348
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,630
You're a fucking monster.

349
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,050
- It takes one to know one.
- Billy, for Christ's sake.

350
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,720
Pack it in. Pack it in.

351
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,350
Stop.

352
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,060
Jesus Christ.

353
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,270
What have you done?

354
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,770
See?

355
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,730
Lenny could never have done that.

356
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,690
Christ, Billy.

357
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,780
Jesus.

358
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,740
- Sorry, we gotta go.
- All right, guys.

359
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,580
Thanks very much. Take care. God bless.

360
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,500
God bless.

361
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,370
- It's a mistake.
- What is?

362
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
Keeping fucking Starlight alive.

363
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,170
Yep.

364
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,930
I underestimated her before.
I will not do it again.

365
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,010
"Starlight is a Traitor"
is trending number one.

366
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,560
We've got a million tweets
in support of Compound V.

367
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,810
A common enemy rallies the base.

368
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,480
Just trust me.

369
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,770
All right.

370
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,980
And if I can
get my hands on Hugh Campbell,

371
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,780
maybe pull his spine
out the back of his neck.

372
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,820
You okay?

373
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,660
Yeah, I just, um...

374
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,780
Your daughter?

375
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,080
Yeah.

376
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,080
Eighty years ago,
she looked exactly like that.

377
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,420
Sometimes it feels like yesterday.

378
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,380
I got something I want to show you.

379
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,140
Want to finish up the backyard?

380
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,680
Okay, I'm gonna put this person...

381
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,980
Hey, guys.

382
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,310
Hello.

383
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,480
This is Stormfront.
Stormfront, this is Rebecca.

384
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,660
Very nice to meet you.

385
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,030
And this, my son.

386
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,030
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

387
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,790
Listen, um...

388
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,710
I know last time, I screwed up bigtime.

389
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,460
And I just want you to know,

390
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,380
I'm never gonna
push you that hard again, okay?

391
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,640
All right, Ryan,
I'd love you to meet my girlfriend.

392
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,140
Stormfront.

393
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,720
- Wow, he looks just like you.
- You think?

394
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,980
Are you serious? Those eyes.

395
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,310
Hey, Ryan.

396
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,480
Your daddy told me all about you.

397
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,980
You have superpowers, huh?

398
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,740
That makes you very, very special.

399
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,870
You are the first natural-born superhero.

400
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,450
Can we not?

401
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,040
That's right. Um...

402
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,870
Ryan does have powers,

403
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,290
but his mom doesn't like
to talk about them, or use them.

404
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Can you also let me know
before you just pop by?

405
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,010
He's Ryan's father.
He has a right to see his son.

406
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,010
That's very true, but look.

407
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,380
We all just have
Ryan's best interests at heart, right?

408
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,300
Yes, we do.

409
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,470
I'm sorry I haven't been here enough.

410
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,270
Ryan, I'd really like you
to get to know Stormfront.

411
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,270
I would.
She's someone I care about very much.

412
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,730
And I think you will too.

413
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,780
So I think we'll be around more.

414
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
A lot more.

415
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,070
I want us to be a family.

416
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Hey.

417
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,790
Empire Wok.

418
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,670
Hi.

419
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,010
That was a fraught "hi."

420
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm going to my sister's for a while.

421
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,470
I have a plan.

422
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,520
You don't need
to be scared of Homelander...

423
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,890
That little girl.

424
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,190
On the plane.

425
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,780
What she must have gone through
in those last few moments.

426
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,820
I lie awake every night
thinking about that.

427
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Me too.

428
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,070
Then I start snowballing,

429
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,450
and wondering,
how many other people have you killed?

430
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,330
- What else have you done?
- I had no choice.

431
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,080
I'm not blaming you.
I'm not. It is not your fault.

432
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,580
Will you just...? Will you sit down?

433
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,540
It's not fair.

434
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,840
- Will you sit down?
- I wish I were as strong as you.

435
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,130
But I'm not.

436
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,550
I just need time.

437
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,310
Over and over...

438
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,190
you said you wanted to see the real me.

439
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,700
This is the real me.

440
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,030
I know.

441
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,740
I'm sorry.

442
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,970
Yes?

443
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,840
I'm here to see Jonah.

444
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,510
He's not taking any visitors.

445
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,310
Tell him it's Grace Mallory.

446
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,030
Goddamn.

447
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,410
We're on the wrong team.

448
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,530
Moral compromise
does have its privileges.

449
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,910
Grace, I thought you retired.

450
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,580
Dr Vogelbaum. I thought you were taller.

451
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,800
Sonia, can you get some tea?

452
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,130
Thank you,
but we won't be staying long enough.

453
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,840
Yes,
there's that Waspy patrician tone.

454
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,760
All business.

455
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,640
What do you know about Sage Grove Center?

456
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,390
Never heard of it. Should I have?

457
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,600
Considering Vought's
been doing illegal tests there

458
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,640
since you were the CSO,
and they're still doing them to this day.

459
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,520
- Seems like you should've.
- Horrible.

460
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,860
Maybe it was
Sonnenshine's project over in R & D.

461
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,070
Prick always had a real God complex.

462
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,030
Do you recall the deal we made?

463
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,490
In exchange for me graciously dropping
certain involuntary manslaughter charges?

464
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,120
I recall it was a long time ago.

465
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,700
Doesn't expire
until the statute of limitations does.

466
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,750
Then I guess I'm turning myself in.

467
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,540
We don't have to do this dance anymore.

468
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,380
We're both out.

469
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,430
Just a couple of retirees,
shooting the shit on the back nine.

470
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,720
We both know Vought fucked you.

471
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,640
Probably put you in that chair.

472
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,850
Help us fuck them back.

473
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,980
Testify to Congress.

474
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
That's my daughter.

475
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,690
She took time off from her practice

476
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,820
to help a bitter old invalid.

477
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,150
I'm sorry to say this, Grace,

478
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,820
but you're the very last person
who should be asking me for help.

479
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,120
After what you lost?

480
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,500
Do what you like to me.

481
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,420
But some things
are more important than the right thing.

482
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,760
He's right, of course.

483
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,880
You should listen to him.

484
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,430
- Ma'am?
- Go back to your wife and daughter.

485
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,260
Nah, I'd just be putting them
in more danger.

486
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,520
Yes, the self-martyring bullshit
of the special ops soldier.

487
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,190
I'll get you all on a flight to Nicaragua.
No one sees you again.

488
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,860
When this is done,
I'll take you up on that.

489
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,030
But that's the point, Marvin.
It's never done. You just let go.

490
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,870
No justice for your father,
no revenge against Vought.

491
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,450
You get nothing, except your family.

492
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,540
Go, and never come back.

493
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,710
I Wish I had.

494
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:40,260
An angry scene today outside of
Congresswoman Victoria Neuman's residence

495
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,390
as pro- and anti-Vought protesters clashed
just two days before

496
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,310
the House Judiciary Committee's
scheduled...

497
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,980
Another. And a pint of bitter.

498
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
M.M.

499
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Yeah, good.

500
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,990
How'd it go with Vogelbaum?

501
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,250
I'll take care of it.

502
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,380
Send her back.
Send her back. Send her back...

503
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,890
Life has always been hard,

504
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,680
but I don't remember it
being quite this crude.

505
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,430
I get it.

506
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,810
What she's doing with her daughter.

507
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,690
My papa, when he lost his mind,

508
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,490
my mama,
she kept me cooking with her.

509
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,570
Cassoulet, confit de canard,
all the mother sauces.

510
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,870
Cooking, it has this way
of giving port in a storm.

511
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Did your...?

512
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,340
Your mama, she cook?

513
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,590
You know,

514
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,180
Irvin Yalom once said, you die twice.

515
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,600
Once when you stop breathing,

516
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:11,600
and again when somebody
utters your name for the last time.

517
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,270
I'd like to hear about your family,

518
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,820
keep them alive a bit longer.

519
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,360
If you'd ever like to teach me.

520
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,960
Point is taken. Never mind.

521
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,310
Gun?

522
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,980
I'm saying "gun"?

528
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,830
- How's it going?
- Good.

529
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,790
Look, I brought you something.

530
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,960
Just to make up
for all the shit I used to do to you.

531
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,720
- He knows my name.
- Yeah, okay.

532
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,050
Hey, meet my new bride, Cassandra.
A—Train.

533
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,060
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

534
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,930
- Thanks, man. It means a lot.
- Yeah, of course.

535
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,850
A lot.

536
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,140
- Yeah, man.
- A lot.

537
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,600
Sweet.

538
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,560
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

539
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,190
- Glad you came.
- Happy birthday.

540
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Happy birthday.

541
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,860
- Happy birthday. Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

542
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,240
So great news.

543
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,620
I've got a meeting
with Stan Edgar next week.

544
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,540
- Seriously?
- With Congress up their ass?

545
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,250
And all the shit with Starlight?

546
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,460
Vought needs trusted,
proven commodities right now.

547
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,380
- They need you two.
- Yeah.

548
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,290
Still got a few deal points
to talk through,

549
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,880
but let's just say,
they should be getting your rooms ready.

550
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,510
- For real?
- Honey, this is amazing.

551
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,130
Thank you so much.

552
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,300
- You're welcome.
- Awesome.

553
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,600
By the way, what do you guys think
of Eagle the Archer?

554
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,810
He's like a brother to me.

555
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,100
He was there for me
when I was at rock bottom.

556
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,100
The most kind, loving person...

557
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,150
He's a toxic personality,

558
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,110
and no church members are
to have any contact with him whatsoever.

559
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,490
Right, yeah, no, now that you mention it,
he did seem pretty toxic, yeah.

560
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,240
What did he do?

561
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,540
Well, he claims
the program had failed him.

562
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,960
But, actually, he failed the program.

563
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
- He doesn't exist, understand?
- Of course.

564
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Come on.

565
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,380
I think they're gonna do the limbo.

566
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,260
- Come on.
- Yeah?

567
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,470
♪ I like it, ♪

568
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,720

569
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,980
Me and Mr Marathon used
to sneak college girls in this way.

570
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,020
College girls? Really?

571
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,110
They were applying. Yeah.

572
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,900
That does not make it better.

573
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,290
All right, moment of truth.

574
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,330
I'm either still in the system,
or we'll be swarmed by guards with AKs.

575
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Wait, what?

576
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,220
And boom, bitches.

577
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,220
All right, let's go.

578
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
Maeve?

579
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,890
Hello?

580
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,900
What the fuck is this?

581
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,740
This is not lesbian. This is not on-brand.

582
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,200
We need you ready for Congress,
with Elena sitting proudly behind you.

583
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,200
She's gone.

584
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,660
- What do you mean, she's gone?
- Elena's gone.

585
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,450
Okay, okay.

586
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,670
Elena will be back.

587
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,420
She will be back in your arms,
and you Will be totally fine.

588
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,380
You're America's second-favourite
lesbian couple after all.

589
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,720
You know what?
Let's just take a deep breath, okay?

590
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,260
Let's just take a deep breath here, okay?

591
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,890
We curated a coming-out story
that America loves.

592
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
- It would be really good...
- Ashley.

593
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,070
For once in your life,
be a fucking human being.

594
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,570
I'm really sorry, Maeve.

595
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,340
Michael, that's holding.

596
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,050
We're in the middle
of practice, Leigh Anne.

597
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,550
Ooh! You can thank me later, Burt.

598
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,930
This team is your family.

599
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,720
Tony here is your quarterback.

600
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,770
You protect his blind side, okay?

601
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,020
When you look at him, you think of me.

602
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,480
How you have my back. How you have his.

603
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,690
Okay?

604
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,360
Yes, ma'am.

605
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,190
Wow.

606
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,660
That... That's really something, Ryan.

607
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,370
I've done The Blind Side,
Dances With Wolves,

608
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,870
Terms of Endearment.

609
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,580
All my mom's favorites.

610
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,040
So are you into any things that,
you know, kids are into?

611
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,460
- Yeah.
- Like NBA 2K.

612
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,710
PewDiePie?

613
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,050
What's that?

614
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,550
Or what about one of your dad's movies?

615
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,350
You're in movies?

616
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm in a bunch of movies, man. Let's see.

617
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,020
There's Homelander: Origins.
Homelander: Rise of a Hero.

618
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,560
Homelander: Darkest Day.
Homelander: Brightest Night.

619
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,110
Your dad is so good

620
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,570
- in Homelander: Brightest Night.
- Thank you.

621
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,400
- Mom, can I see them?
- When you're old enough, we can talk.

622
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,280
They're PG. He can see them now.
You're old enough.

623
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,820
You're absolutely old enough.

624
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,620
For sleepovers, and baseball games,

625
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,330
and visits to Vought Land.

626
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,620
Yeah.

627
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,210
Did you know that
your dad has his own roller coaster?

628
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,130
Wanna ride your dad's roller coaster?

629
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,800
- Can I, Mom?
- We can talk about it.

630
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,970
Whenever you want.

631
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,180
I need to speak with you.

632
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,390
- We're having a good time here, right?
- Outside.

633
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Now.

634
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,900
That's a great idea. You two, stay here.

635
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,150
- Get to know each other better.
- Okay.

636
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,740
I'll show you Dances With Wolves.

637
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,990
- I know what you're doing.
- Nope, you don't.

638
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,200
- Yes, I do. I can see...
- No, you do not.

639
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,540
You could not possibly understand.

640
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,670
I was raised the same way as him.

641
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,630
That kid
doesn't know anything about anything.

642
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,630
When he sees the outside world,
he's going to panic.

643
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,050
That's gonna fuck him up.

644
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,140
I do not want my son to have
to go through what I went through.

645
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,560
His life is different.

646
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,520
He has a mother.

647
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,480
I know that
that means something to you.

648
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,820
If you take him away from me,

649
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,110
this world will feel
so confusing and frightening.

650
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,780
Yes, but, Rebecca,

651
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,910
you are lying to him.

652
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,910
Because I love him.

653
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,330
I know a part of you loves him too,
and you want what's best for him.

654
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:32,080
But what's best for him is
to be here with me, with his mother.

655
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,050
Look, we have this opportunity
to give him a childhood you never had.

656
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,300
We can do that if he's here with me.

657
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,600
Please. I'm begging you, please.

658
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
Yeah.

659
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,320
I'm sorry, he's very tired.

660
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,780
I understand
he's had a few surprise visitors today.

661
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,990
But you tell him he's got one more.

662
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,910
The name's William Butcher.

663
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,340
Mr Butcher, I can't apologise enough
for what I've done.

664
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,300
But I can't give you the information...

665
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,060
But I can't give you the information
you or Grace came for either.

666
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,780
What was he like?

667
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,950
Who?

668
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,410
Homelander. Growing up as a lad.
What was he like?

669
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,460
I'm sure you
don't want to talk about this...

670
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,960
There is nothing I wanna talk about more.

671
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,840
And who knows better than you?

672
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,970
When he was a little boy,
5 or 6, he was quite sweet.

673
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,640
He'd cuddle up to me.

674
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,400
He loved stories about
Davy Crockett, Teddy Roosevelt.

675
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,030
Loved the idea of the woods,
the forest, manifest destiny.

676
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,990
But I needed him
to be the strongest man in the world.

677
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,830
So I went to work on him.

678
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,620
He didn't even want it.

679
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,630
It was for me.

680
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,680
And that wasn't your only sin...

681
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,220
was it?

682
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,270
It wasn't Homelander
who hid my wife away all them years.

683
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,020
It ever occur to you...

684
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,240
the pain you cause sorry bastards like me?

685
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,410
At the time,
it was barely a blip on my radar.

686
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,790
Tell me, doctor.

687
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,380
What's your radar telling you now?

688
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,380
Do what you want to me,
but I can't help you.

689
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,340
My family would be in...

690
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,840
Your family's already in trouble.

691
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,850
Because I'm about to go into
that room next door, to your daughter,

692
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,470
and I'm gonna bash her brains out.

693
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,350
And then I'm gonna find your two sons,

694
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,610
and their wives, and their little kiddies.

695
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,360
Your whole fucking family dies today.

696
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
Or...

697
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,120
you help me.

698
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,840
What's it gonna be, doc?

699
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,250
How...?

700
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,090
How can you be so...?

701
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,350
Look at this.

702
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Thank you.

703
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,770
Do you know,

704
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,860
I can't remember the last time
I had a good cup of chai?

705
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,410
You're a doll.

706
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,130
Starting to bleed through.

707
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,010
Shit.

708
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,720
This is it, 42D.

709
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,010
She's gonna be there?

710
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,910
Wait, wait, wait.

711
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,540
This is the conference room.
She's not here.

712
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,460
They moved my statue?

713
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,670
What?

714
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,560
- I wanted to do it in front of my statue.
- Do what?

715
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,570
I just wanted to make my dad proud.

716
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,200
No, no. What the fuck?

717
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,370
What the fuck?

718
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,040
My God. My God. My God.

719
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,130
My God. My God.

720
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,470
Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.

721
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,270
Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.

722
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,450
Mom?

723
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,500
Fuck you, man.

724
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,710
Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.

725
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,050
Shit, I need his hand.

726
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,600
Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.

727
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,730
Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately...

728
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,240
Come on, come on, come on.

729
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,510
Was that an Almond Joy?

730
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,060
He has a tree nut allergy.

731
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,780
Come with me.

732
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,540
...to the main floor immediately.

733
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,710
Help! Is anybody there?

734
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,420
Help!

735
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Where's Annie?

736
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,390
Aren't you
that sweaty young man from Believe?

737
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,730
Hi, Mrs. January.

738
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,730
Is that a human hand?

739
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,230
Yes, it is. Come on. We gotta go.

740
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
Hughie?

741
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,910
Annie, Annie, Annie.

742
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,830
- Mom. Thank God.
- Annie.

743
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,210
Hey.

744
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,840
What are you doing here?

745
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,850
How are we gonna get out of here?

746
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,270
I know a way.

747
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,950
All right, dinner's ready.

748
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,450
Assholes.

749
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,040
Hey, bud. You ready for dinner?

750
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,500
What's wrong?

751
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,130
You're a liar.

752
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,260
- You lied to me.
- What do you mean?

753
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,470
They flew me up and showed me.
This house is fake.

754
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,220
The neighbours are fake. You're fake.

755
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,050
Boy deserves to know the truth.

756
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,180
Hey, listen to me.
We can talk about this, okay?

757
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,560
You must feel confused.
There are reasons...

758
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,020
No, just don't touch me. I hate you.

759
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,860
I think he just needs a little space.

760
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,070
Come here, son.

761
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,400
No. No.

762
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,820
All right, he needs his mother.

763
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,910
Don't worry, he'll still have a mother.

764
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,200
Hey, Ryan. Ryan!

765
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:36,620
Hey, Ryan, no.

766
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,960
Ryan, no!

767
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,840
My God, no, please.

768
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,090
Kid, you are fucking unbelievable.

769
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,510
All you had to do was watch porn.

770
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,390
I didn't know he'd set himself on fire.

771
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,310
- Hey.
- What are we gonna do now?

772
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,310
Butcher? It's me.

773
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,020
No, I'm afraid Hugh let our star witness
burn himself to death.

774
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,860
Thank you.

775
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,110
Well, I don't know.

776
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,200
- What do you mean, no worries?
- I mean, I got it sorted.

777
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,380
You gonna stitch me up again?

778
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,010
He's at the airport.

779
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,970
I promise.

780
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,060
You got a right bloody nerve, you do.

781
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,140
I didn't mean for it to go so bad.

782
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,230
I'm sorry.

783
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,020
You won't have to see him again.

784
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,730
He ain't got much longer.
Couple of months.

785
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,070
Tell me when it happens.

786
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,700
I'll piss on his coffin.

787
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,570
I didn't do it for him.

788
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,740
He's a cunt.

789
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,710
I just thought,
when you saw how helpless he is now,

790
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,420
you'd let it go.

791
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,930
He wouldn't have this hold over you,
and you wouldn't become like...

792
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,730
Yeah, well...

793
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,060
Billy.

794
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,640
I told him,
I wasn't gonna cut my mom out of my life.

795
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,720
That's it.

796
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,760
And then the Church
and their "Internal Research Bureau"

797
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,220
leaked all this ♪♪♪♪ on me.

798
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,100
Eagle contends
the Church released a home video,

799
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,110
where his partner was dressed as a deer

800
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,480
that Eagle hunted and mounted.

801
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,820
What?

802
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,110
Church Spokeswoman Carol Mannheim
had this to say:

803
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,320
He's been spreading slanderous
and defamatory rumors about our religion

804
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,120
in a desperate attempt to stay relevant.

805
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,200
Yeah, fuck him.

806
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,620
Thought he was your friend.

807
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,750
Can we change the channel?
The hearing's almost on.

808
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,130
Thanks.

809
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,720
...internal investigations,
but we also hired...

810
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,760
Would everyone please take their seat?

811
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,520
- Starlight?
- Nothing. She's off the grid.

812
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,390
- Well, fucking find her.
- Okay.

813
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,020
This bipartisan committee
is called to order.

814
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,690
Investigating Vought International,

815
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:54,700
and its production
and distribution of Compound V.

816
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,950
- I hereby present to the committee...
- Okay, this is it.

817
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,410
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

818
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:04,710
The testimony we'll hear today
will prove that Vought is guilty

819
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,500
of corporate malfeasance
and multiple felonies.

820
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,750
And it'll come from someone
that has witnessed these crimes directly.

821
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,380
The chair calls former CSO of Vought,

822
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,260
Dr Jonah Vogelbaum.

823
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,600
Okay, okay, quiet, everybody.

824
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,770
Quiet.

825
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,990
Gotcha, cunt.

826
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,330
Dr Vogelbaum,
thank you for joining us today.

827
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,750
Raise your right hand.

828
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,120
You swear that your testimony today
will be the truth,

829
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,000
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

830
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,800
- I do.
- Thank you. You have five minutes...

831
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,130
Oh, God.

832
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,190
Do something. What the fuck?

833
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,200
Shit.

834
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,070
What the fuck do we do now?

835
