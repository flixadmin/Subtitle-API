1
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>What have you done?</i>

2
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:43,461
Still at it?

3
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,130
I think I figured out how to track
the thing that attacked us.

4
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,945
So, what are we looking at?

5
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,530
A spectrograph
from the scene of the attack.

6
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,597
That is a rare geothermic isotope

7
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:56,849
that I reprogrammed
our satellites to scan for.

8
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,476
If we get a hit...

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,229
Then we can track our target.

10
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,398
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:08,069
Barry, you've been at this all night.

12
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,613
Maybe you should take a break,
get some rest.

13
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:13,700
I'm not gonna rest
while that thing is still out there.

14
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:18,037
Besides, with Ralph overseas for a while
and Frost still recovering...

15
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,040
Oh, I'd say she's more
than just recovering.

16
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,837
Check out this frosty twist.

17
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,848
Are my back meds still wearing off?
I'm seeing double.

18
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,766
Yeah, you and me both.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,310
I know this is a lot to take in.

20
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,394
Told you they'd freak.

21
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,980
<i>Cecile.</i>

22
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,619
<i>Cecile.</i>

23
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:57,011
Who are you? What do you want?

24
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,640
It's time to come home now, Cecile.

25
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,704
Get away from me.

26
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,398
You cannot control me!

27
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:11,192
You never did learn your lesson.

28
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,131
Babe!

29
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,133
Cecile! Cecile.

30
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,802
What's wrong? You were screaming.

31
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,096
No. No, no, no. I saw someone.

32
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,599
I saw someone there, right there,
and then they... And then they...

33
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,602
There's no one here.
No one else here, except us.

34
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,699
You've been working
too hard on those cases.

35
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:50,892
You must have fallen asleep.

36
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,900
It felt...

37
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:58,573
But the danger, it was...

38
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,450
It was so real. It was so real.

39
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,537
I'm sure it was, babe,
but nightmares can't hurt you.

40
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,816
So, you remember when Mirror Monarch

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
- blasted me with her gun?
- Mm-hm.

42
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,888
Well, ever since that blast,
we had these crazy headaches.

43
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:27,101
Last night, everything gets fuzzy,
Caity passes out.

44
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,062
And then we wake up totally fine.

45
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,689
But there's two of us.

46
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,781
Eva's mirror gauntlet
contained a reflective mirror-chip.

47
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,617
I think it forced Frost's cryo-genes
to rapidly replicate

48
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,661
and create a whole new form,
so that she could survive.

49
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,371
Crazy, right?

50
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,709
Can you still hear
each other's thoughts?

51
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,378
Nope. Just sweet, sweet silence.

52
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,839
And I got to keep my powers.

53
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,984
Caity got to keep the doctor stuff
and science know-how,

54
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,301
which is fine by me.

55
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,678
You always have felt
like two different people.

56
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:05,556
Now, you just have
two different... bodies.

57
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,742
But don't worry.
I'm gonna figure out a way

58
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,535
to get us back together
as quickly as possible,

59
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,437
because I'm afraid the longer we wait,
the harder it'll be.

60
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,525
I mean, shouldn't we be focusing
on that berserker

61
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,652
who killed Abra Kadabra instead?

62
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,737
Frost has a point.
Where are we with Fuerza?

63
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:28,579
<i>"Fuerza."</i> Spanish for strength.
Look, "She-Hulk" was taken, okay?

64
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:33,167
Well, still no sign of her, but Barry
has figured out how to track her.

65
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,336
- Oh. Good.
- Yeah.

66
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,172
Because if Fuerza can survive
an anti-matter blast,

67
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,300
that kind of puts her
on a whole other level of baddie.

68
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,135
Like a wet-your-pants level.

69
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,350
Satellites detected
an isotopic signature.

70
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,477
That's Fuerza. Where's she headed?

71
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,355
Here. Right now.

72
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,296
What's with all this thunder
and lightning?

73
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,572
Is Fuerza a speedster, too?

74
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,325
Barry.

75
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,622
Who is that?

76
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,604
Help me.

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,149
Help me.

78
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,878
I just got the Speed Force restarted.
Now, this happens.

79
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,590
And what about your speed?
Has it been affected?

80
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,216
No. At least, not yet.

81
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,249
I'm still trying to figure out
how this is even possible.

82
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,932
I have no idea.
I've never seen biometrics like this.

83
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,850
You've never had a god for a patient.

84
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,395
The Speed Force took this form
right after H.R.'s funeral.

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,275
It's like Zeus coming down from Olympus
disguised as a mere mortal.

86
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:24,195
Okay, but why would a god
be asking for our help?

87
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,280
Whatever the answer is,
I need to figure out a way

88
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,990
to accurately monitor her recovery.

89
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,538
Holy mother...

90
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,832
- You good?
- Yeah. Just give me a minute.

91
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,669
She's wearing my Speed Force Gauge now.
Right now it's red.

92
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:40,670
If it changes, hopefully,

93
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,481
that'll tell us her power levels
are recharging.

94
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,465
And if that's the case,

95
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,677
maybe she entered a comatose state
to help heal herself.

96
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Makes sense.

97
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:53,433
And once she recovers,
she can tell us who did this to her.

98
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,309
It.

99
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,605
Maybe it's the same thing
that can rip through

100
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,607
an anti-matter bomb
like it's tissue paper.

101
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,883
Those are residual geothermic isotopes.
They're all over her.

102
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:09,740
You think Fuerza did this?
That must have been one hell of a fight.

103
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,410
Not as big as the fight
we're gonna take to Fuerza.

104
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,579
Okay. But this isn't just some

105
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,165
run-of-the-mill meta
we're talking about here.

106
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,084
Whatever Fuerza is,
she's powerful enough

107
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,628
to hurt the freakin' Speed Force.

108
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,340
And what if she doesn't wake up?
What happens to you?

109
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,176
Look, we've faced big threats before.

110
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,180
Crisis, Savitar, Thawne,
we beat them all.

111
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,351
If Fuerza did do this,
she should be afraid of us.

112
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,607
All right.
I'll keep looking for isotopes.

113
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,531
Yeah. And I'll keep monitoring
the Speed Force.

114
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,867
You think Fuerza's gonna come back
and finish what she started, don't you?

115
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,872
I already watched
the Speed Force die once.

116
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,540
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

117
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,674
Yeah. Yeah. Just call me
when you know something.

118
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,843
All right. Thanks. Bye.

119
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,054
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

120
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:17,141
Dad, what do you know
about the robbery at CC Mercantile?

121
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,120
Robber waltzed in and out
because the night guard

122
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,104
was catching Z's at his desk.

123
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,982
Why the interest
in an open-and-shut case?

124
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:28,027
The guard told <i>The Citizen</i>
a different story this morning,

125
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,361
and I figure I can

126
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:32,823
help him get his job back
if I can break the real story.

127
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,825
He didn't doze off, Dad.

128
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:39,163
He had a vision of his abusive
stepfather stalking him in the bank.

129
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,807
Realer than any nightmare he's ever had.

130
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,543
The robbery went down
at 11:09 last night,

131
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:48,881
around the same time that Cecile
was having a nightmare, too.

132
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,676
Damn.

133
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,597
If we got some kind of Freddy Krueger
meta on our hands...

134
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,849
we'll find him.

135
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,060
I'll get Korber to pull
any calls about weird visions.

136
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,478
Ah.

137
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,023
Kristen Kramer.

138
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:08,210
I'm with the Governor's
Municipal Logistics Commission.

139
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,945
I wasn't expecting you
until this afternoon.

140
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,698
- It's good to finally meet you.
- Yeah. I like to get a head start.

141
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,867
In my experience,
if you're not early, you're late.

142
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,413
You must be the Captain's daughter.

143
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,546
I read about
how you survived the abduction

144
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,674
into that mirror dimension, was it?

145
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,842
Sounded terrifying.

146
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,721
- Uh, I've survived worse.
- Impressive.

147
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:41,350
Didn't mean to interrupt.

148
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,352
We can chat tomorrow, Captain.

149
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,437
Lunch is on the Governor.

150
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:46,647
Sounds good.

151
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,611
Where'd she say she was from?

152
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,616
State Logistics Commission. Why?

153
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,621
Just another hunch.

154
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,172
Pretty dope belt buckle.

155
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,227
Not a belt buckle.

156
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,384
This is the Firestorm Matrix.

157
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,302
Okay.

158
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:21,599
I helped Thawne build it to combine
Ronnie and Stein into Firestorm safely.

159
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,519
And that's going to help
put me and Caity back together.

160
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:27,771
You can thank Caitlin.
She figured it out.

161
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,860
All we have to do is just
reset it to her DNA and your RNA.

162
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,071
We're basically just
resetting fusion to fission.

163
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:40,534
This baby just needs
a few hours to charge, and... that's it.

164
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:44,788
We can get you back to your
normal two minds, one body existence.

165
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,956
That's a Tuesday for you.

166
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,669
Wow. That was fast.
It's not so bad being separate.

167
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:56,550
For Caity. I mean, you know,
she can finally watch <i>This Is Us</i>

168
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,514
without me screaming "Turn it off!"
in her head.

169
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,513
Frost, what have I said about
disparaging <i>This Is Us?</i>

170
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,848
They're so weepy.

171
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,392
That cast is too precious
for this world.

172
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:11,774
Listen, based on how relieved
Caitlin was to figure out this fix,

173
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,151
I'm guessing she actually misses

174
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,946
hearing your frosty tones
inside her head.

175
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,699
Okay, I'm done with you.

176
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,746
Now, we wait.
I want to keep checking the satellites

177
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,083
to make sure we don't get hit with
another isotopic signature surprise.

178
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,022
Whoa.

179
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,817
So, that's the Speed Force.

180
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,570
Iris already texted me about everything.

181
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:02,949
What's wrong?

182
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:09,164
I had a nightmare,
but it was more like a vision.

183
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,710
I don't know. I thought,
maybe with my powers expanding lately,

184
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,295
Caitlin could check out my noggin.

185
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,885
- Hey. Are you okay?
- No, it's happening again.

186
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,596
It's like someone's stabbing my brain!

187
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,641
- I'm gonna get Caitlin.
- No, no. Barry, Barry, it's...

188
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,604
It's not medical. It's my powers.

189
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,816
It's like they're picking up raw fear.

190
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,156
There's a robbery downtown.

191
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,616
It's okay. Really. I'm fine now.

192
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,536
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, you should go.

193
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,417
Hey. I'll keep an eye on her. Go.

194
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,224
It's gonna crush us to death!

195
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,813
Flash! Thank God!

196
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,897
You have to stop that creature!
It's gonna kill us!

197
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,696
Uh...

198
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,992
There's...

199
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,947
Where are you...

200
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,373
Oh. Do you gotta go so soon?

201
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,568
So, let me get this straight.

202
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,822
You made those guards hallucinate

203
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:51,100
some kind of Godzilla rip-off
that almost squashed them?

204
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,394
Well, I suppose that is an accurate,

205
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,022
if not immensely reductive
assessment of the situation.

206
00:14:57,106 --> 00:15:00,025
So, yes. I scared the hell out of them.

207
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:03,195
And that was after showing them
a vision of a dozen bystanders

208
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,906
getting eaten alive
by a very hungry <i>kaiju.</i>

209
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,743
It's horrifying
when you think it's your turn.

210
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:13,914
Hey, look, whoever you are,
I really don't have time for this.

211
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,041
My, my, how rude!

212
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,586
And from a superhero.
Is that actually allowed?

213
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:25,467
Okay, I apologize for the rudeness,
but I hope you enjoy Iron Heights

214
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,469
because I really do have
bigger problems today.

215
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,014
Not yet. But you're about to.

216
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,368
Hey, I just got another

217
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,269
geothermic isotope reading.

218
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,731
It's coming from your location.

219
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,780
Scared yet?

220
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:49,992
You will be.

221
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,007
You can't stop me, Flash.

222
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,842
And you never will.

223
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,471
No. I'm not afraid of you anymore.

224
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:14,141
This is just a hallucination,
which means you can't hurt me!

225
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,143
Time to repent.

226
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,791
You lose, Barry.

227
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,012
<i>Barry?</i>

228
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,890
<i>Barry!</i>

229
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,900
Your vitals were spiking,
but they seem to have stabilized.

230
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,152
Your speed healing kicked in.

231
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:09,279
What the hell happened out there?

232
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,741
Uh... I was hallucinating.

233
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:19,373
Thawne, Savitar...
they were trying to kill me.

234
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,706
It was like...

235
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,585
Like a nightmare come to life?

236
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,296
Yeah, like the guards in the truck.

237
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,801
Wait, like you.
You had a nightmare last night.

238
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,344
Yeah.

239
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,473
Someone is broadcasting fear
into their victims,

240
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,767
and I'm tuning into it like an antenna.

241
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,893
Fear, I get.

242
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,188
Hallucinations can make you freak out,
but not bleed out.

243
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,942
Whoever's doing this must be inciting
extreme psychosomatic reactions.

244
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,385
Barry's mind literally tricked
his body into hurting itself.

245
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,198
So, if you die in the hallucination...

246
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,783
Then you die in real life.

247
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,911
But he carried traces of
the same isotopes we linked to Fuerza.

248
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,595
That means we can track him,
too, right?

249
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,626
Right. And it means that Fuerza
and Psych must be connected somehow.

250
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,043
Psych?

251
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,674
He's a psychic psychopath
causing psychosomatic symptoms.

252
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,550
I mean, the guy
practically named himself.

253
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,761
He's only dangerous
because he got inside my head.

254
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,406
Cisco, do we still have
the mental dampeners

255
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,430
we used to fight Grodd?

256
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,309
We can try and re-purpose them
to repel Psych's hallucinations.

257
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:24,354
Do it. If we can keep Psych
out of our heads, he can't hurt us.

258
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,149
What?

259
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,754
That must have been terrifying,
being trapped in that nightmare.

260
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,699
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

261
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,787
We beat those Big Bads already.
Psych's no different.

262
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,956
Barry, I...

263
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,511
You did a background check
on a public official?

264
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,513
I've only ever heard of one other person

265
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,516
using the phrase
"If you're not early, you're late."

266
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,477
<i>Citizen's</i> go-to military source.

267
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,770
Kramer served.

268
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:08,106
Yes, she served. But I think
she's also lying about why she's here.

269
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,110
Dad, I found her file
in the DOD database.

270
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:16,198
Half of it's redacted.
What if she's not here to help?

271
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,574
Iris...

272
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,496
are you sure this isn't a reaction
to what happened with Eva?

273
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,122
She lied to you for weeks.

274
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,959
Dad, I am not afraid of being deceived.
I'm afraid of not trusting my gut.

275
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,129
Something is off with Kramer. I know it.

276
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,675
Please, read the file.

277
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,928
Okay, okay.

278
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,813
These rapids are hard core.
Can Caity swim?

279
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,940
What if when she and I split,

280
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,817
I got swimming,
and now, she needs floaties?

281
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:55,153
No one's going to
need floaties, all right?

282
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,173
You two are gonna be
peanut butter and jellied again

283
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,616
by the time we tear up that river.

284
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,909
Frost!

285
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:03,994
Or not.

286
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,416
The Firestorm Matrix has been sabotaged.

287
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,769
Only someone tried to make it look like
it short-circuited.

288
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,420
Before you go blaming Frosty...

289
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,630
I ran the adapter
through an infrared scanner,

290
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,259
and guess what the temperature was?
Negative 162 degrees.

291
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,303
Fine. I broke your stupid
precious Matrix.

292
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,387
Oh.

293
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,265
Why? Why would you do that to us?

294
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,727
It will be weeks before we can even
consider another fusion attempt.

295
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,410
Because maybe
I don't want to re-combine!

296
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,565
Why not?

297
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,443
Well...

298
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,699
Call me when you figure it out.

299
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,004
You know, this actually
reminds me of that scene

300
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,173
where Rebecca and Jack are fighting...

301
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,135
Oh, look at that.
Let's go! We gotta go!

302
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,307
Satellites picked up
Psych's isotopic signature

303
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,225
downtown at the Cleary Capital offices.

304
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,870
Time to put these
mental dampeners to work.

305
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,520
And kick some psychic butt.

306
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,653
5.3 trillion gone. It's all gone.

307
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,822
Oh, God, I'm ruined.

308
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,619
It'll bounce back.

309
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,246
The Dow only dropped 789 points.

310
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,499
It'll bounce back. It has to.

311
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,628
Oh, I could do this all day.

312
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:43,720
Oh, it's you again.

313
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,014
Well, that's disappointing.

314
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,228
We're not going to let you
hurt any more people.

315
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,060
Oh, I haven't hurt anyone today.

316
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,771
I have freed them
from a system that brings

317
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,816
fortune to the fortunate
and dooms the rest.

318
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,484
Pretty poetic, don't you think?

319
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,737
What is this guy's deal?

320
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,739
I think he's overcompensating.

321
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,367
I don't like your friends, Flash.

322
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,537
Also, if you think your
flimsy dampeners can stop me...

323
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,957
Perhaps you all
could use some freedom, too.

324
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,638
Killer Frost, you're under arrest
for your crimes against the city.

325
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,266
What? No, no.
I'm one of the good guys now.

326
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,310
Tell it to Judge Tanaka.
We have a witness.

327
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,729
One who told us everything you've done.

328
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,023
Who turned me in? Was it Mark?

329
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,107
No.

330
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,652
It was Caitlin Snow.

331
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,865
No. No, no, no.

332
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,075
How could she...

333
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,580
No.

334
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,625
This can't be how it ends.

335
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,251
How could she...

336
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,275
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

337
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,027
Someone's back for seconds.

338
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,906
You already showed me my greatest fear.
It won't scare me twice.

339
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:30,035
Oh, Flash, those Big Bads
aren't your greatest fear.

340
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,245
This is.

341
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,223
No, no.

00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,736
No. No, please, no.

No, no, no, no.

00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,705
No.

345
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,753
Sweet nightmares, people.

346
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,193
First, Fuerza, then the Speed Force
shows up. Now this, too?

347
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,820
Why can't I stop shaking?

348
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:50,615
Your biometrics are all elevated.
Your amygdalae are in overdrive.

349
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,367
Wait, we had panic attacks?

350
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,078
Extreme ones.
Psych doesn't just manipulate your fear,

351
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,413
he elevates it.

352
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,666
But your cortisol levels
are slowly stabilizing, which means...

353
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,751
Psych's powers have a residual effect.

354
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,115
And Barry has had a double dose.

355
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,382
- Where's Frost?
- She wanted to be alone.

356
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,301
Even the Ice Queen was freaked out
by whatever she saw.

357
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,970
The mental dampeners didn't work.

358
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,347
Psych must have
overpowered their circuitry.

359
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,435
Which means the next time you fight him,
we won't be able to protect your mind.

360
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,770
The next time?
How are we supposed to anticipate him?

361
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:21,812
Stake out the banks?

362
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,607
No, he's not after money.

363
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,528
Remember? He said he wants to free
people from the power it has over them.

364
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,865
So, what?
He has an ax to grind with the system?

365
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:36,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It explains why
he attacked the Cleary Capital offices.

366
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,414
He doesn't want cash. He wants chaos.

367
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,915
Well, he got it.

368
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,296
What exactly did he make you see?

369
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,635
Just Kamilla in danger.

370
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,512
What about you? Who did you see?

371
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,013
It doesn't matter.

372
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,141
What if it does?

373
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,268
What if there's a clue or something

374
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,936
- in what you saw...
- There isn't.

375
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,022
But you don't know that.

376
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,608
Look, you're going to have to
face him again, eventually.

377
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,276
What if I can't, all right?

378
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,154
What if he's too powerful
and I can't stop him?

379
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,573
- Barry, no one said...
- You didn't have to.

380
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,676
Maybe Psych's gonna destroy
this whole city and everyone in it.

381
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,327
There's nothing I can do about it.

382
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:38,515
Trying to reconnect the transmitter
to the output circuit?

383
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:43,645
Turns out I'm better at breaking things
than I am at fixing them.

384
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:49,067
Do you want to tell me what scared you
so much when Psych whammied you?

385
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,738
Come on. We used to share a brain.
I know you don't scare easy.

386
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:03,414
I was under arrest for all the crimes
I committed as Killer Frost.

387
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,920
And you were the one who turned me in.

388
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,464
I would never do that.

389
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,634
I know.

390
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,806
Look, ever since
you let me take the wheel,

391
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,266
I got to live my life.

392
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,686
Not just half the time,
but all the time.

393
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,438
And I really liked it...

394
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:33,111
and I don't want to go back
to living my life just half the time.

395
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,199
And I was afraid
you'd hate me for saying that.

396
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,328
I would never hate you.

397
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:47,000
You're my sister.
You can always tell me how you feel.

398
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,879
I don't know how.

399
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,673
I mean...

400
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,595
I may be the strong one,
but you're the brave one.

401
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,597
I mean, you're fearless.

402
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,391
I mean, ever since I got in touch
with my feelings, I just...

403
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:08,813
I'm scared all the time.

404
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,524
Sometimes, I don't even know why.

405
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,819
You think you're the only one
who gets scared sometimes?

406
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:19,240
Ever since we separated,
there's been this deafening silence

407
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:23,953
inside my head where you used to be
and it terrifies me.

408
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,625
That's why I've been so desperate
to put us back together.

409
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:33,004
Why I got so upset
when you broke the Matrix.

410
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:39,677
It's 'cause my biggest fear in life
is living without you.

411
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,265
Mine, too.

412
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,144
Then why don't we face
that fear together?

413
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,563
You mean...

414
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,734
Maybe two Snows
really is better than one.

415
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:59,739
My apartment has an extra bedroom.
I could use a roommate. What do you say?

416
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,953
I say...

417
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,039
"This is us."

418
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:26,224
Cecile, I'm sorry.
I just... needed a minute.

419
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:27,517
Okay.

420
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,147
You do know that you're not the only
one who's been whammied

421
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,233
with more than one dose
of Psych's fear, though.

422
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,113
You've been picking up his energy
every time he shows up.

423
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,572
Last night, I saw...

424
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:49,789
I saw a nightmare
where I couldn't control my own powers.

425
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,583
It was terrifying.

426
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,629
It's been really hard
to keep my own fears at bay today.

427
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:01,426
I spent last year so afraid
of losing everyone I loved in Crisis,

428
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,262
I never thought
I'd have to face that fear again.

429
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:07,974
Psych showed me...

430
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,729
people I love, dead.

431
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,399
Fuerza had killed them.

432
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:23,865
We've taken on the impossible
so many times.

433
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,412
Something about
these new threats feels different.

434
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,830
Bigger.

435
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,625
And for the first time since Crisis...

436
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,757
I'm scared.

437
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:48,056
Sometimes, when I'm scared,
I ask myself, "What would the Flash do?"

438
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,558
Seriously.

439
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,353
Barry.

440
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:58,816
You run through fear
every time you save this city...

441
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,987
and you just got to find
some of that courage for yourself.

442
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:10,787
<i>Guys, we just detected
Psych's isotopic signature.</i>

443
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,664
<i>It's expanding all over
Sandoval Heights.</i>

444
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,128
Cecile,

445
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,256
you sent your own fear into Top.

446
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,428
Do you think you could
do that on a bigger scale?

447
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:29,305
Me... No... way.

448
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,017
Barry, I could barely broadcast
one emotion across a room.

449
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,521
Then let's get you some help.

450
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:46,030
Barry, are you insane?

451
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,492
I know it sounds crazy,
but DeVoe built this chair

452
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,911
to expand his mental capacity
on a massive scale.

453
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:55,581
Yeah. Yeah, and it turned him
into a supervillain.

454
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,793
But you won't, because you're
gonna use it to save the city.

455
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,978
I can feel all your fear, Central City.

456
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,898
And it feels exquisite.

457
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:33,244
No... Please let me out.

458
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,745
Let me out of here, please!

459
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,747
It's too much.

460
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,419
I can't take it!

461
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:47,842
Mom... Dad. Please don't leave me here.

462
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,553
Why won't you come home?

463
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:03,941
Cecile, you good?

464
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,860
Nope. Not even close to good.

465
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,446
I am sitting in a death machine.

466
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,448
What if this thing fries my brain?

467
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,242
What if this chair turns me evil
like the Top?

468
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,326
What about that?

469
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:18,039
As a medical professional,
I promise you will be okay.

470
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,790
- Okay.
- Probably.

471
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,210
<i>Flash, where you at?</i>

472
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:24,462
I'm approaching Psych's radius.

473
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,257
Okay.

474
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:30,676
Do it.

475
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,808
<i>I can't breathe!
Make it stop!</i>

476
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,939
It's working. I can...

477
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:47,276
I can... feel... people's minds...

478
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,571
thoughts, all over the city.

479
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,699
I can feel Barry.

480
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,820
His amygdalae is spiking.

481
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,973
Barry, can you hear me?
Cecile is connected to your mind.

482
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,975
Whatever you're seeing,
fight through it.

483
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,354
This isn't real.

484
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,527
It's not real. It's not real.

485
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,740
It's not real.

486
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,040
You got us all killed, Barry.

487
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:55,386
I trusted you. Why didn't you save me?

488
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,988
When you let me die,
you killed our children, too.

489
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:24,832
Barry can't hear us.
He's caught inside his nightmare.

490
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,375
He's lost.

491
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:32,423
I'm diverting
all satellite power to the comms.

492
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:40,473
Listen to me, Barry.
You have to get through this.

493
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,350
Cisco, I don't know if I can.

494
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,809
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

495
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,520
You are strong enough. I know you are.

496
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,482
<i>We can't do this without you.</i>

497
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,359
You're a coward, Barry Allen.

498
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,485
You'll lose us again.

499
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,778
All because you're too afraid.

500
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,989
Too afraid to open your eyes.

501
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:06,332
You're right. I am afraid.

502
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,669
But I won't let that fear control me.

503
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,930
He broke through. Cecile, now!

504
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,101
Barry, I can feel your courage.

505
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,804
You're too late, Flash.

506
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,029
<i>Guys, it worked.
Cecile did it.</i>

507
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:20,156
I did it.

508
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,239
You did it.

509
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,494
- I did it.
- You did it.

510
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:31,625
Guys, I think I need an energy bar.

511
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:43,947
Your frontal
cortex is healing,

512
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,532
but the part that controls motor control

513
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,433
is still falling behind.

514
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:50,269
No trace of Psych or Fuerza.

515
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,564
Either way, at least now
we have proof they're connected.

516
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,109
When I struck Psych with my lightning...

517
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,029
he shook it off easy.

518
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:05,326
But just for a minute,
the lightning, it stayed with him.

519
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,787
- Was it glowing?
- Yeah.

520
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,260
Same thing happened
when you fought Fuerza.

521
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:14,794
I threw everything I had at them.
We all did.

522
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,576
They just kept coming for more.

523
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,341
Luckily, your powers
are getting stronger, too.

524
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:23,844
The chair did most of the work,
but thanks.

525
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,764
I don't know, you kicked some
pretty serious psychic ass out there.

526
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,974
Might have to teach
Martian Manhunter a thing or two.

527
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,102
Barry!

528
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:33,186
Is it Psych?

529
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,232
No. No. This is something else.

530
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,150
I'm getting the same readings
I got off Nora.

531
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,913
I need to heal myself.

532
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:52,748
Open the cryo-pod.

533
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,432
No, Barry,
that will put you into a coma.

534
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,836
It's the only way.

535
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,149
"Logistics Compliance."

536
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,593
Is that what you were doing
when you were working in Gotham?

537
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,989
I've made a few trips there.
I'm a big Knights fan.

538
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:30,995
And I called my buddy who'd been working
the Gotham beat for more than a decade.

539
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,621
Pretty high-stakes game you played.

540
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:34,999
And...

541
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,835
there is this.

542
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,382
So, I don't know what your goal is here,

543
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,384
but if you're gonna be in my precinct...

544
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:49,597
how about we cut the bull
and you be honest with me?

545
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,435
Fair enough.

546
00:39:57,688 --> 00:40:00,816
I wasn't planning to announce this
until I got my bearings.

547
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,028
On the orders of the Governor,

548
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:08,032
I'm here to locate and apprehend
a rogue meta-human, whatever the cost.

549
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,660
And quite frankly, it's about time

550
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:15,873
someone addressed the longstanding
issue this precinct ignored.

551
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,792
You want to arrest the Flash?

552
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:22,004
No. He's clean. So far.

553
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,674
I'm here for someone far more dangerous.

554
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,722
The meta-human fugitive
known as Killer Frost.

555
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:47,571
How is he?

556
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:50,699
Better, I think.

557
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,910
Barry's system was overwhelmed

558
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:55,663
with the same strange signatures
that I found in Nora's system.

559
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:59,208
His vitals have stabilized a bit,
which is good news,

560
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:03,337
but as to when he'll be fully healed,
it's difficult to say.

561
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:07,132
If Psych or Fuerza
were to attack right now...

562
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,094
we're totally on our own.

563
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,428
Because I wasn't fast enough.

564
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:15,599
Nora.

565
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,435
This physical form is new for me.

566
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,563
I didn't know its limitations.

567
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,775
I can feel how weak he still is,

568
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,277
how weak we both still are.

569
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,155
What happened to Barry?

570
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,367
He was attacked
by a powerful meta-psychic.

571
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:36,495
Who showed him his greatest fear.

572
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,208
That same psychic
was the second of my attackers.

573
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,336
Fuerza and Psych? They both hurt you?

574
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,547
Who are they?

575
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:49,967
I think...

576
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,928
they're just like me.

577
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:59,952
