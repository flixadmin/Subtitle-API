1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,527
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,651
After five years in hell, I have come home
with only one goal:

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,370
To save my city.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,569
Now others have joined my crusade.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,842
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,209
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,364
I am something else.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,522
Previously on Arrow and Flash:

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,206
- Hello?
- It's Barry. Barry Allen.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,330
I woke up. I could use some advice.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,042
I don't think that bolt of lightning
struck you. I think it chose you.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,886
You can inspire people.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,525
In a way that I never could.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,200
- What are you doing in Central City?
- Working a case.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,364
Suspicious homicide in Starling
where the murder weapon...

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,885
...is a boomerang.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,560
- Partners?
- Partners.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,365
Barry has superpowers.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,885
Oliver has a bow and arrow.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,403
If I had a DNA sample I was unable
to breakdown, think you could...

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,086
...isolate genetic markers?
What's the sample from?

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,401
The Canary's murder.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,807
In position?

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,407
In position.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,404
In position.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,086
Neighborhood's clear.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,447
I probably should have
brought this up before...

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,491
...but if this doesn't belong to the killer
you chased to Central City and back...

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,722
...we're gonna have a lot of explaining.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,767
It's his.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,003
Why? The residue S.T.A.R. Labs found
on the boomerang says so?

32
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,650
Because the whole place is rigged.

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,607
I can see tripwire connected
to pressurized gas.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,325
Front door will be the same.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,761
Our new friend doesn't want
any surprise visitors.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,927
Well, he's gonna get a surprise.

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,043
Looks like we interrupted his dinner.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,043
We just missed him.

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,360
Drop your guns.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,683
Sure thing. Right when you learn
how to count.

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,569
You're outnumbered, jerkwad.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,165
You're not S.C.P.D.

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,483
Unless police uniforms have gotten
interesting, neither are you.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,321
A.R.G.U.S.

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,006
Your flanking patterns haven't changed
in years.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,486
Why is A.R.G.U.S. in on this?

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,247
The man who was killed by the boomerang,
he was an A.R.G.U.S. agent?

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,404
Which makes this an A.R.G.U.S. matter.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,444
Bug out. Target's not here.

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,083
Let this go.

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,409
Are we gonna let this go?

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,602
What do you think?

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,844
What about this A.R.G.U.S. angle?

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,571
A.R.G.U.S. wiped all evidence
of their agent's death...

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,200
...after he was killed,
or they thought they did.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,409
Our boomerang victim, Kai Wu.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,450
Man's profile is so clean,
I should have known it was a cover.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,729
Now that we know Wu was A.R.G.U.S.,
maybe Lyla can get us a lead.

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,366
If this is A.R.G.U.S.,
Lyla's gonna want it to stay that way.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,205
Tell her to stop letting people get killed
in my city.

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,282
You really don't care about my marriage,
do you?

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,760
Well, I Would...

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,729
...if you and Lyla were still married.

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,721
Thank you for coming.

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,803
Like I had a choice.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,209
- I see you made a new friend.
- This is Katsu Cheng.

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,291
Mr. Cheng fancies himself something
of a munitions specialist.

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,764
According to H.K.P.F., Cheng planted
an explosive device somewhere in Hong Kong.

69
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,083
I need you to talk to him,
find out the bomb's location.

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,005
I'm just gonna talk to him,
he's gonna give me information?

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,571
It won't be easy.

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,328
That's why I brought you your tools.

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,322
What tools?

74
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,562
We recovered these from the freighter
when we recovered you.

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,410
You're welcome.

76
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,331
You want to torture this guy
to find out where the bomb is?

77
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,444
I want you to find out where the bomb is.

78
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,843
How you do so is of little interest to me.

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,601
Almost done here, Gerry.

80
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,604
- You should have gone home hours ago.
- Who's Gerry?

81
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,367
- This place is bigger than my apartment.
- What are you guys doing here?

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,121
You asked us to analyze the DNA
of the arrow that killed Sara.

83
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,328
I was just gonna mail you the sample.

84
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,041
- We had some vacation days coming...
- We wanna see the Arrow Cave.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,809
We don't call it that.

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,720
Even

87
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,882
But I want to see the toys.

88
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,003
I need to see the toys.

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,490
Do you guys have an Arrowmobile?

90
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,320
Don't touch that.

91
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,251
Or that.

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,880
It's a jettisoning arrow.
It uses compressed...

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,090
Compressed CO2 to jettison
high-tensile strength polymer cables.

94
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,321
Yup.

95
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,484
Since when did we start selling admission
to the Arrow Cave?

96
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,926
It's...

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,406
You see what you've done?

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,251
Incredible.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,882
I have so many ideas for improvements.

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,327
And this.

101
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,606
Oh. Oh, man.

102
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,448
This is the bomb. And I mean, red is
so much cooler than green. Am I right?

103
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,449
I'm really starting to like this guy.

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,931
Hey, what's that for?

105
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,524
Distracting me from work.

106
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,091
So where's Mr. Diggle?

107
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,691
He's running down a lead.

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,931
- We have this handled, Johnnie.
- I told Oliver that already.

109
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,283
- Seriously, it's an internal A.R.G.U.S. matter.
- I told him that too.

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,566
Listen, sweetie.

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,449
A guy who kills with boomerangs?

112
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,602
That's outside you guys' wheelhouse...

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,610
...while exotic killers are more...

114
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,121
...our thing.

115
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,171
You only call me sweetie
when you want something.

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,286
Is it working?

117
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,966
Hang on a second.

118
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,241
Is there a problem?

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,449
Something strange with your ID.
I'm gonna have to detain you.

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,566
Hmm. If that's a problem,
I really don't care.

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,960
You know, you should be careful
how to treat people, my friend.

122
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,481
After all...

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,686
...what goes around comes around.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,685
I appreciate the offer, Johnnie.

125
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,207
But really, we have it handled.

126
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,444
Is that your "we have it handled" alarm?

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,163
We have a breach.
Initiate lockdown protocols.

128
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,041
Diggle.

129
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,690
We have a situation here.

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,888
Our man's at A.R.G.U.S., Lyla's here.

131
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,847
And Oliver, this guy is the real deal.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,685
Our target is storming A.R.G.U.S.
and Lyla is there.

133
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,051
Mm-hm. Badass.

134
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,403
- So cool.
- It'll be over by the time they get there.

135
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,206
Clear.

136
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,285
Eyes up.

137
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,167
Sweetie.

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,806
You only call me sweetie
when you want something.

139
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,206
Get down!

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,126
Uh... Chase, just because we kissed,
it doesn't mean anything, okay?

141
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,409
- Are you sure you're okay?
- What was that?

142
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,921
Who attacked you?

143
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,323
And don't tell him
it was an internal A.R.G.U.S. matter.

144
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,607
His name is Digger
Harkness, former A.S.l.S.

145
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,923
His specialty is weapons and technology
before he went rogue.

146
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,765
Started selling his services
to the highest bidder.

147
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,285
We caught him three years ago.

148
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,086
- Well, looks like he escaped.
- Not exactly.

149
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,847
Harkness' skills made him an ideal recruit
for Task Force X.

150
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,280
You mean, the Suicide Squad.

151
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,202
They had an op in Tanzania.

152
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,408
The assassination of a local warlord.

153
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,087
But the warlord had bigger guns,
the mission went south...

154
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,242
...and the team had to be sanitized.

155
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,245
You mean killed, Lyla.

156
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,124
Waller couldn't be reached. It was my call.

157
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,124
The microbomb in Harkness' neck
must have malfunctioned.

158
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,443
We need to consider that
every A.R.G.U.S. facility is compromised.

159
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,721
There's only one place
we can keep you safe.

160
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,483
How often does Oliver do this?

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,244
At least every Wednesday.

162
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,609
There's a lot of sweating.

163
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,607
I don't see what's so hard about that.

164
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,448
I'm not sure she should have called you.

165
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,128
Oliver doesn't play well with others.

166
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,124
Come on.
Barry and Oliver kicked ass last week.

167
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,648
- Yeah.
- They were in, like, a league of their own.

168
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,610
Yeah, that was, like, a one-time thing.

169
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,446
The dude was tossing around
exploding boomerangs. They needed backup.

170
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,161
And I need some dinner. That salmon
ladder made me hungry for sushi.

171
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,001
And I need to
get some paperweights down here.

172
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,841
- Should have warned you about that.
- Yup.

173
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,326
Are you okay?

174
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,366
You can't work for A.R.G.U.S.
without making enemies.

175
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,525
I'm sorry to involve all of you in this.

176
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,966
- Is that A.R.G.U.S. property?
- It's evidence.

177
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,044
Hey. Secret identity?

178
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,531
- They're married.
- We're not married.

179
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,201
Or together. Whatever.
He told her about me.

180
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,524
- You didn't?
- I keep secrets for a living, man.

181
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,969
- Ah. My bad.
- You're... You're...

182
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,487
The Flash. Sushi?

183
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,087
We need a location on the man who's after
Lyla. His name is Digger Harkness.

184
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,720
The first step is to work the evidence...

185
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,531
Barry, can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

186
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,083
I appreciate your help back at A.R.G.U.S.,
but we have this handled.

187
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,084
- You don't wanna team up again?
- Things work differently here.

188
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,765
Starling City is meaner.

189
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,003
I remember helping you pretty
good last year, without powers.

190
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,367
I've been practicing everything
you taught me.

191
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,450
I'm casing new environments,
I'm not running in blind.

192
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,929
- We do this my way.
- Yes! This is gonna be awesome.

193
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,924
- What's our first move?
- We need to reassemble the evidence.

194
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,287
It will take some time, but it'll...

195
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,770
But it'll be Worth it.

196
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,804
Rad! These are a bit more teched out than
the one you guys brought to Central City.

197
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,122
3D printed polymer with a circuitry weave.

198
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,203
Some of Harkness' boomerangs exploded.

199
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,931
Yeah. There are grooves
that could pack a C4 charge.

200
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,801
Maybe if we figure out where Harkness
got the supplies, we can track him.

201
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,806
- These weren't made by Ka-Boom-Boomerang.
- Ka-Boom-Boomerang?

202
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,725
Yeah, you know, he has exploding
boomerangs.

203
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,281
- Is that your best?
- Really? It makes perfect...

204
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,728
Cisco. If Harkness didn't make them,
we need to find out who did.

205
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,167
- And who he made the buy off of.
- Markos.

206
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,722
You see this collapsible-node design?
Dead giveaway. That's his signature.

207
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,325
- We need a location on this...?
- Klaus Markos.

208
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,331
No known home address
or place of employment for Markos.

209
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,007
But he was arrested last year
by an Officer Quentin Lance.

210
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,406
Dad, I understand...

211
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,605
...but my boss wants answers about the
rash of B-and-E's on the Southside.

212
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,162
Tell him I got a whole squad in there,
but they can only move so fast.

213
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,961
Hey, Laurel. Detective. Captain.
Captain. Sorry.

214
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,487
- Don't worry. It's been a while.
- Everything okay?

215
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,961
Oh, it's fine. This is, uh...

216
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,929
Bart Allen, right? Got hit by a bus?

217
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,209
Barry. Uh, it was lightning.

218
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,285
- Huh. We worked together on a case last year.
- Barry's a friend.

219
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,011
He's in town with the
Central City Police Department.

220
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,685
I was hoping you could help him.

221
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
- He'll explain.
- Sure.

222
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,285
- Oliver, can I talk to you for a moment?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,451
- The Arrow was in Central City.
- This is a follow-up.

224
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,369
Kind of.

225
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,201
I'm looking to track down a suspect
you apprehended last year. Klaus Markos?

226
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,001
You know where we might find him?
None of his last-knowns are checking out.

227
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,164
Well, I don't really keep up
on the skels I busted, you know.

228
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,250
- I'm not real sentimental that way.
- Okay.

229
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,482
What did you arrest him for?

230
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,485
Uh... Identity theft.

231
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,248
He was using some gizmo to steal credit-card
numbers for the Bratva, Russian mob.

232
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,404
Okay.

233
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,410
I cannot believe
you're a member of the Russian mob.

234
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,360
Former member, probably.
We had a falling out last year.

235
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,761
This is where they run
their cyber-crime operation.

236
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,285
Hey, nice outfit, by the way.

237
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,604
This place looks like a fortress.

238
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,404
Kalashnikovs everywhere.

239
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,208
Roy, take the southeast corner.
Barry, scan the perimeter.

240
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,051
_Digg__
I got northwest.

241
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,611
Are you going to be okay?

242
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,084
You think I'll lose it
because Harkness is after Lyla?

243
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,685
I'm good.

244
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,765
I had eight seconds to kill.

245
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,246
Was that wrong?

246
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,645
What?

247
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,486
My friend wants to have a conversation
with you.

248
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,483
You made this for Digger Harkness.

249
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,644
- I wanna know where he is.
- Go to hell.

250
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,162
The only thing that hurts worse than an
arrow going in is an arrow coming out.

251
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,601
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Getting information.

252
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,007
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

253
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,640
- But he said he doesn't know!
- He's lying.

254
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,687
If you wanna be able to raise your
arm again, tell me where he is!

255
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,605
Here. Harkness gave it to me.
It's encrypted.

256
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,161
I had an order ready for him.
I called, he came.

257
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,763
I don't know where he is, I swear. I swear!

258
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,809
Felicity can crack the encryption.
Use this to track down Harkness.

259
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,884
You tortured that guy.

260
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,811
I interrogated him.

261
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,520
My friend said
your tactics made you a criminal.

262
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,650
I defended you
because I thought you were a hero.

263
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,567
I thought we were supposed to be
better than them.

264
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,846
Barry...

265
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,722
...you live in Central City...

266
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,322
...where it's sunny all the time
and your enemies get cute nicknames.

267
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,848
- You're not in Central City.
- Yeah.

268
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,401
I live in a city
where my best friend was murdered.

269
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,884
Where a woman that I loved was shot full
of arrows and sent tumbling off a rooftop.

270
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,084
Where my mother was murdered
right in front of me, so before...

271
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,084
My mother was murdered in front of me too.

272
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,244
But I don't use my personal tragedies as an
excuse to torture whoever pisses me off.

273
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,084
I'm sorry, Barry.

274
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,005
I'm not as emotionally healthy as you are.

275
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,084
- What's wrong with you?
- When we agreed you were staying...

276
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,527
...we decided that it would be on my terms.

277
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,526
If that is proving too difficult for you,
you know your way back to Central City.

278
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,246
Everything all right between
you and Speedy?

279
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,971
What? Roy? Yeah, we're fine.

280
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,201
I meant him.

281
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,249
Oh. We had a difference of opinion
about the way the world works.

282
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,767
Yup. I know what that's like.

283
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,609
Sometimes they don't see it.

284
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,411
There are people in the world
who deal only in extremes.

285
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,929
And it would be naive to think that anything
less than extreme measures will stop them.

286
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,289
Sometimes bravery isn't enough.

287
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,284
Sometimes the world requires us to be bold.

288
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,124
Whatever the personal cost.

289
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,643
I got him. He's in a warehouse
at the corner of lnfantino and Adams.

290
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,010
- Is that...?
- A.R.G.U.S. by satellite, yeah. Maybe.

291
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,009
- Thermographic imaging shows 10 bodies.
- Harkness knows we're coming.

292
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,003
I can track his cell phone's position.

293
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,049
Cisco, you're with Diggle and Roy.

294
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,690
I'll race you there.

295
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,085
Where's the bomb?

296
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,929
My Chinese sucks.

297
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,128
But that doesn't sound like a location.

298
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,804
Last chance.

299
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,121
Your hands are shaking.

300
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,850
I knew.

301
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,204
You don't have it in you.

302
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,362
You've killed, but torture is different.

303
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,722
For those with a conscience, inflicting pain
is more difficult than inflicting death.

304
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,201
- I'll figure it out.
- No, you won't.

305
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,204
- You don't have the stomach for it.
- I do.

306
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,809
To save all those people, I do.

307
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,565
Where's the bomb?

308
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,562
Where's the bomb?

309
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,087
You Okay?

310
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,768
My daughter's mother tried to detonate a bomb in
a man's head, and now he's trying to kill her.

311
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,244
- So that would be a no.
- Look, you don't know me that well.

312
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,246
I'm the type of guy who's only thought about one
thing, how do I keep the people I love safe.

313
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,522
You seem to me to be pretty good at that.

314
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,727
Maybe before.

315
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,202
I remember a world where people didn't kill
each other with boomerangs.

316
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,248
- Or walk on water?
- Barry can walk on water?

317
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,291
You guys, Harkness has been around
long before people like Barry.

318
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,604
I mean, this world was crazy before all
these metahumans and superpowers, right?

319
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,888
What's your point?

320
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,570
Well, maybe metahumans and superpowers
were given to us to deal with the crazy.

321
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,964
You mean, by God?

322
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,808
No. By a dark matter wave released from
a failed particle accelerator reaction.

323
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,282
Either way, I think people like Barry...

324
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,486
...are the hope for saving people like us,
people like your wife and daughter.

325
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,967
- She's not my wife.
- She's not his wife.

326
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,284
Okay.

327
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,489
Anyway, you see my point, right?

328
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,445
Plus, you gotta admit...

329
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,807
...it's all pretty freaking cool, right?

330
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,811
You're late.

331
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,723
I knew he was there.

332
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,002
He's not dead, right?

333
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,966
Tranq arrow.
Same thing I used on you in Central City.

334
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,209
- Cisco has the van running.
- You've met Harkness' hired muscle.

335
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,600
Harkness isn't here.

336
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,444
Hey! Where's Digger Harkness?

337
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,170
Never met him.

338
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,721
But he paid us 10 G's to give you this.

339
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,368
Ten'll get you 2O that belongs to Harkness.

340
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,569
- What does that mean?
- That Harkness played you.

341
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,569
- I swore I turned that off.
- What?

342
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,371
Markos' phone.
I shut it down after I decrypted it.

343
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,683
- Could someone turn it back on remotely?
- And back-trace the trace?

344
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,043
We have to get out of here now!

345
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,644
Hello, Lyla.

346
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,683
It's been a long time.

347
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,251
- Guns!
- Third drawer!

348
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,164
Know what I like most
about boomerangs, Lyla?

349
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,765
They're proof that things can come back
to haunt you.

350
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,851
You had a bomb for the back of my head.

351
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,930
I have a little something special
for the back of yours.

352
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,410
Lyla, get down!

353
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,041
No!

354
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,404
Caitlin! Caitlin!

355
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,967
Stop the bleeding. I need lidocaine.

356
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,203
- We have epinephrine.
- That will work.

357
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,651
- Hey, stay with me.
- Hey.

358
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,405
Just try and keep her awake.

359
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,050
Can you hear me, Lyla?

360
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,969
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

361
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,770
Lyla? She's not breathing!

362
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,085
Lyla?

363
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,285
Lyla.

364
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,207
She's not moving.

365
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,170
I've got her stabilized,
but I can't operate on her here.

366
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,690
- Barry?
- Starling General's at 8th and Wilcott.

367
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,724
H.K.P.F. lD'd her as Sumilu Kang.

368
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,406
She was a student
at the University of Hong Kong.

369
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,281
Biology textbook in her backpack.
She was studying to become a veterinarian.

370
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,046
He would have told me.
I just needed more time.

371
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,646
No, Mr. Queen,
what you needed was conviction.

372
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,571
The men who do things like this have it.
You didn't.

373
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,728
- I thought I could...
- You thought what?

374
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,803
You could reason with him?

375
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,201
Look around you, Mr. Queen.

376
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,730
Look around and tell me that the men who
do this type of thing understand reason.

377
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,723
There are people in this world
who deal only in extremes.

378
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,451
It's naive to think that anything
less than extreme measures will stop them.

379
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,009
The bomber was Katsu Cheng,
but make no mistake...

380
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,282
...this blood is on your hands.

381
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,047
Cheng said I didn't have the stomach
for torture. He was right.

382
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,886
Because you need to practice.

383
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,883
Torture is an art form.

384
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,520
It's a skill one must cultivate.

385
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,371
- Why would I do that?
- I think Cheng was wrong.

386
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,570
I think you not only have the stomach
for this work, you have the talent.

387
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,890
This feels wrong.

388
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,050
Being here, it feels wrong.

389
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,567
Oliver needed to be alone.
He made that clear.

390
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,724
Three doubles, straight up.

391
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,731
- Are you guys okay?
- We're just having a tough night.

392
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,090
- Anything I can do to help?
- No, we're good.

393
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,402
But thanks for the night off.

394
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,765
Yo, who was that hottie?

395
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,206
- Oliver's sister.
- My ex-girlfriend.

396
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,603
- So stay away, that's what you're saying.
- Yeah.

397
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,411
She's in surgery. Mr. Diggle is with her.

398
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,366
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I hope so. She's strong.

399
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,486
How do you guys do it?
How do you guys live like this...

400
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,450
...where anyone you care about
could be struck down?

401
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,241
We haven't been taking this seriously.
It's all been a game.

402
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,402
We give the bad guys code names.

403
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,610
I think the fact that we go up against
metahumans made it all kind of clean.

404
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,721
Like, the fact that they've got these
powers makes what they're doing less...

405
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,410
Real.

406
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,408
This is all my fault.

407
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,288
It's really not.

408
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,762
I tortured Markos to give up that phone.

409
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,164
None of this would have happened
if it wasn't for me.

410
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,202
I get the feeling you don't say that often.

411
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,285
To do what I do, Barry, takes conviction.

412
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,806
But...

413
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,485
...more often than not,
it's the will to do what's ugly.

414
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,209
Every time I do that, I'm...

415
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,282
I'm trading away little...

416
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,206
...pieces of myself, so...

417
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,683
You asked what's wrong with me,
that's what's wrong.

418
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,686
Because the part that I'm trading away...

419
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,161
...is Oliver Queen.

420
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,529
And lately I've been
feeling like there is...

421
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,529
...nothing left except the Arrow.

422
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,242
I think you're full of crap.

423
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,886
Look, you've convinced yourself...

424
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,929
...that everything you've been through
took away your humanity.

425
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,044
I think it's because of your humanity
that you made it through.

426
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,331
You wouldn't have survived,
much less come out the other end a hero...

427
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,206
...somebody who wants to do good,
if you didn't have a light inside of you.

428
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,250
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting.

429
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,930
I ran facial recognition on Harkness,
and I have a match.

430
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,771
Where is he?

431
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,970
Get on the ground!

432
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,289
Now, why would I wanna do that?

433
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,169
You hurt a friend of mine.

434
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,291
You really think there's anywhere in the
world you could run and we won't find you?

435
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,249
Hmm. Probably not...

436
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,244
...which is why I have
a contingency in place.

437
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,967
Five bombs planted throughout Starling.

438
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,571
You can stop me,
or you can stop the bombs...

439
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,445
...but you can't do both.

440
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,928
Bombs are armed.
In 90 seconds, this city will be on fire.

441
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,765
Go.

442
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,891
Guys, Harkness just triggered five bombs
throughout the city. We don't know where.

443
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,801
- To blanket the entire city, you'd have to use...
- Radio-controlled lED's.

444
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,483
- But if we key into the detonator frequency...
- We can pinpoint the location of the bombs.

445
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,405
I need a location! I need five locations.

446
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,403
The five receivers.

447
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,131
Nearest one is behind a restaurant
at Faith and Flower.

448
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,728
Okay. Guys, I found it.

449
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,644
- I'm gonna run it out of the city.
- Barry, wait.

450
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,411
- That's not an option.
- The bombs might be linked.

451
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,686
What?

452
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,050
Press the emblem on your suit.
I installed a mini-cam there.

453
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay. You see the secondary trigger?
It's not just a receiver.

454
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,891
- It's a transmitter.
- If you try to defuse the bomb...

455
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,090
...the trigger will transmit a signal and
the rest of the bombs are gonna explode.

456
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,922
- We're running out of time.
- Defuse all the bombs at the same time.

457
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,766
You're thinking of multiplex.
I can't be in five places at once.

458
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,604
But I don't have to be.

459
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,280
- Stop the countdown.
- Go to hell.

460
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,044
- Last chance.
- Or what?

461
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,768
You'll inflict pain?

462
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,440
You've done it before,
so let me ask you this...

463
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,803
...why are you hesitating?

464
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,651
Yaah, uh, whoa!

465
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,524
Ten more seconds,
and we should be able to see at least...

466
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,684
...ah, three explosions from here.

467
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,011
Okay.

468
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,285
Everyone has to cut their wires
exactly on three.

469
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,447
One...

470
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,331
...two...

471
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,686
...three.

472
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,123
Oh, screw you, Captain Boomerang.

473
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,203
You think
you've accomplished something here?

474
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,731
You think you not killing me
makes you strong?

475
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,002
It just means...

476
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,810
...you're weak.

477
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,321
It means I have some humanity left.

478
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,245
You just couldn't resist, could you?

479
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,010
Hey, sweetie.

480
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,644
You only call me sweetie
when you want something.

481
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,091
I do.

482
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,483
I want you to marry me.

483
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,487
I can't believe I waited this long to ask.

484
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,483
I need you, Lyla.

485
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,886
Now, forever, official.

486
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,602
- I need you...
- Will you please stop talking...

487
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,724
...so I can say yes?

488
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,929
Some of the STR markers on the DNA sample
have degraded...

489
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,402
...but I've got a computer
that I think will help fill in the gaps.

490
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,282
- Thank you, Caitlin.
- I'll let you know as soon as I have the results.

491
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,845
I'll call this time.

492
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,044
- It's cool. You guys are fun.
- So are you guys.

493
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,047
Well, you could be if you realized
you were working under a nightclub.

494
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,927
Oh, hey, you guys take care of business?

495
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,085
Digger Harkness is now cellmates
with one Slade Wilson.

496
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,490
We've got a pipeline,
he's got a gorgeous tropical island.

497
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,162
- With the landmines. Hm, hm.
- What?

498
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,686
It's a long story.

499
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,687
What's this?

500
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,764
Oliver had me put that in
while you guys were at the hospital.

501
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,685
- Wait, this is for me?
- For the next time you're in town.

502
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,483
- There'll be a next time?
- I'm still calling the shots.

503
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,529
- We'll talk about that.
- Yes, we will.

504
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,523
And then I'll call the shots.

505
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,088
We got a gift for you too, Oliver.
Early Christmas present.

506
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,211
Turns out S.T.A.R. Labs' industrial
fabricator's based out of Starling, so...

507
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,810
Polymer Kevlar weave.

508
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,282
It's 25 percent lighter
and can carry 15 percent more gear.

509
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,683
I got designs I'm working up
that I'm really excited by.

510
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,444
It's, uh, subtle.

511
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,970
I wanted to replace the hood,
but Felicity said it had sentimental value.

512
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,961
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

513
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,286
You guys headed back?

514
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,923
It's possible that Dr. Wells didn't
sign off on us leaving town.

515
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,805
Hey, do you still, like, take the train?

516
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,881
Yeah, sure, if I feel like taking a nap.

517
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,687
But Oliver and I have some
unfinished business to take care of first.

518
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,565
You guys aren't gonna punch each other,
are you?

519
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,120
Why'd you summon me here?
To make me feel worse?

520
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,523
No, I summoned you here
to give you a second chance.

521
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,524
- Is this a joke?
- No.

522
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,842
This is Li Khuan Hui.

523
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,968
That name should sound familiar to you.

524
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,051
- You work for China White.
- Chien Na Wei.

525
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,730
Yes, Mr. Hui is on her payroll.

526
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,124
He's Chinese triad,
and he knows her agenda here in Hong Kong.

527
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,648
Fortunately, Mr. Hui has been
less than forthcoming with the details.

528
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,123
Fortunately?

529
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,291
You get a stab at redemption.

530
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,567
You could have invited everybody.
They'd like this.

531
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,644
No, they would love this,
but this is just for the two of us.

532
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,928
You mean the one of you.
This was your idea.

533
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,449
You can't expect me to believe that
you don't wanna know once and for all...

534
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,450
...who would win, me or you.

535
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,246
- If you don't shoot me in the back.
- Get over that.

536
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,882
Okay, I have superpowers,
you have arrows that run out.

537
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,203
I have strategy and tactical awareness.

538
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,489
When I'm fighting you,
it's literally like you're standing still.

539
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,490
- Tough talk. You ready to back it up?
- Oh, yeah.

540
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,011
Hey, by the way...

541
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,247
- Yeah?
- ...you were wrong.

542
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,568
When you told me I could inspire people,
you said you couldn't.

543
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,165
But you were wrong.

544
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,771
You can inspire.

545
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,366
Not as the Arrow, that guy's a douche...

546
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,890
...but as Oliver Queen.

547
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,201
Thank you.

548
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,048
Since we're sharing, you were wrong too.

549
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,089
- When?
- Right now.

550
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,242
Because you think you can kick my ass.

551
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,561
I can tell.

552
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,803
Well, if you think you can kick mine,
you better do it fast.

553
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,088
I get it, Barry, I get it. You're fast.

554
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,851
Ready.

555
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,729
Set.
