1
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,340
Today we sing together ...

2
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:38,281
... Life and premature death 
 of 'one great legend.

3
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:43,877
Relax, enjoy your calorie 
 popcorn and other snacks ...

4
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:48,727
... We will tell you it amazing 
 story of a hero ...

5
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,120
... Still on his own story 
 to start.

6
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:08,962
Charlie hit the slow lazy butcher.

7
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:12,228
Guys, we start at 'the beginning:

8
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,646
The curtain rises. 
 There is "one threat in the air.

9
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:21,027
In her room to the princess 
 itself from 't live rob:

10
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:24,923
Better food for the worms 
 than to live without love.

11
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,841
She reaches for the cup of poison.

12
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:30,317
Meanwhile the evil preys Malvolio 
 on the throne ...

13
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,567
... While her father 
 seriously ill.

14
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:35,297
Yes, I am seriously ill.

15
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,290
Hear Who's there?

16
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,909
I got it, the long-awaited hero ...

17
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:43,767
... That his sensitive tar lady junk 
 from evil.

18
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:49,168
Let her go 
 or taste the bitter sting of my revenge.

19
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,364
The sting of my ...

20
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:57,475
Doctor Marx 
 I get no response.

21
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,626
Is not this discussed? 
 Acting is reacting.

22
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,898
Victor, you're so stiff.

23
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,799
Mr. Timms? You did it well.

24
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,905
Maybe too good.

25
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:13,256
What? My one-dimensional character? 
 Absurd.

26
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:17,892
I know who I am. 
 I am the protagonist, the hero.

27
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:20,098
Each story has one required.

28
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:25,522
And who more appropriate to get 
 let by praising his comrades?

29
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:48,697
The stage awaits. The public 
 longs for adventure.

30
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,156
Who am I?

31
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:55,017
I can be whoever I want.

32
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:58,926
The captain who returns 
 After a long journey ...

33
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,494
... For its mechanical arm to pick.

34
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:07,208
Whether the villainous anthropologist 
 against pythons fighting in Congo.

35
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:08,828
Occasionally, Chongo.

36
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:11,937
And if you want romance ...

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,080
... I am the best lover in the world.

38
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:19,627
<i> Hola. </ i>

39
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:26,738
I noticed that you noticed 
 you struck me.

40
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:30,327
The females find me 
 too attractive.

41
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,016
But you like it not to touch.

42
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:35,061
Stop. No, really.

43
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,454
Well, here we go. What are you doing?

44
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,433
That tickles. Are they real?

45
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:45,038
Of course. Conflict. You were right. 
 I was one-dimensional.

46
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:50,251
Suddenly I see to light: the hero 
 can not exist in 'n vacuum.

47
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,259
An abrupt event is needed ...

48
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,932
... To the hero in the story to swing.

49
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:51,037
Mr. Timms?

50
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,639
<i> Oye. </ i>

51
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,685
Exactly. You.

52
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:37,862
Not so shy. Come on. 
 Nothing wrong.

53
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:39,976
Exactly. Closer.

54
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:42,634
Nice.

55
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
I do not bite.

56
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,724
Can you help me?

57
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:50,852
Are you okay?

58
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,545
I have to go across.

59
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:56,466
Across ... 
 Well you have just crossed the road?

60
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,959
Hence the ...

61
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:03,182
Why did you do that? 
 -That's my mission. He's waiting for me.

62
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,560
Who?

63
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,098
The Spirit of the West, <i> amigo. </ I>

64
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:12,473
He drives a coach alabaster, 
 gold protected by guards.

65
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:14,212
What are you talking about?

66
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:17,413
Lighting. We can not do without.

67
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:20,975
That delusion of your 
 has destroyed my life.

68
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:26,331
I had a large network of cultured 
 friends. I was very popular.

69
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,950
Friends? I see no friends. 
 -Well, the ...

70
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
You're a lonely lizard.

71
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:37,924
Help me up. I'll help you 
 to find what you want.

72
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,859
Really? 
 Hup-. I must return to my mission.

73
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:44,256
Did you like this then before? 
 -Yes, often.

74
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,924
Come on. Good. Pull my finger.

75
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,240
The Spirit is waiting for me.

76
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,062
That will not work. 
 -I have to go across.

77
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:04,527
Why do not you wait 
 until there is no traffic?

78
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,144
Not that simple.

79
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:08,748
It's a metaphor.

80
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:38,946
Another one.

81
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:41,829
I knew it.

82
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:54,751
Help, <i> amigo </ i>

83
00:08:54,871 --> 00:09:00,271
The metaphor has ruptured my spleen. 
 The road to knowledge is full of pitfalls.

84
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,047
Yes. I seek only 
 towards the water.

85
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:08,206
If you want to find water, 
 you must look for Dirt.

86
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,854
Dirt.

87
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,850
Fate is your good mood.

88
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:15,993
Tomorrow is Wednesday. 
 Then comes the water.

89
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:20,317
At noon, the villagers 
 together for 's ritual.

90
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:24,209
A village? With real people and stuff?

91
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:28,438
Where? 
 -On one day trips. Follow your shadow.

92
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:33,971
Do you want me walking in the desert? 
 That is the side-on.

93
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:39,976
According to you there is a village. 
 A real village, not a metaphorical village.

94
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,417
Go ahead. It's okay.

95
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:45,052
Well, I'm going.

96
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,464
I now turn off the road.

97
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,282
I walk into the desert.

98
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:56,058
Alone. 
 -Everyone follows his own path.

99
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,196
See you on the other side.

100
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:15,841
welcome, amigo

101
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:18,867
in this bone-dry land

102
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:25,477
Grim Reaper's his shadow 
 in this burning sand

103
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,290
his courage is praised 
 In this wonderful song

104
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:37,325
but mark my words 
 because he does not live long

105
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:44,714
his sun-bleached bones 
 burns to his intestines grit

106
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:49,659
Look, that bird eagerly picks 
 <i> el señor </ i> in his crotch

107
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,511
Here in the Mojave have animals 
 millions of years had the time ...

108
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:03,596
... To adapt 
 the circumstances.

109
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:05,066
But the lizard ...

110
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,921
That is it.

111
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:10,044
87 years ago, the founders ...

112
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:11,473
Do not move.

113
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,865
Do not move. 
 -I 'm not.

114
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:22,821
I do not move. 
 -Try not to notice.

115
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,538
Unnoticed? Why?

116
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,478
Not fall.

117
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:30,896
What do you mean?

118
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:36,603
Too late. 
 I fall-if not more.

119
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:39,945
Hey, easy. What are you doing? 
 <i> Tranquilo. </ i>

120
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,109
Stand still.

121
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,111
Try not to notice.

122
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,270
Hey, what are you doing?

123
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:56,815
I'm not into. 
 -Do that somewhere else.

124
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,269
Lead me down. 
 -Come first-served.

125
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,688
It is art. 
 -Find your own shelter.

126
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:04,588
This is fine. 
 -Here she comes. Run, <i> mojitos. </ I>

127
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:07,907
Do not move, you said. 
 -That was before. Now you run.

128
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:11,743
<i> Adios, amigo. </ i>

129
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,020
Hey, beak.

130
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:56,851
Grumpy.

131
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,180
Do not. I'm afraid of heights. 
 My glands swell up.

132
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,478
Please, no ...

133
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,242
<i> Madre de Dios. </ i>

134
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,790
You. I kill you. 
 Stupid lizard. Get it.

135
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,735
I squeeze your huevos <i> </ i> nice. 
 -Bird.

136
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:34,126
Wait. Come back. 
 It was just a joke.

137
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:36,665
Are not we friends? 
 -I do not know you.

138
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,991
Find your own place. 
 -We are family.

139
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:43,021
Come first served basis. 
 -Then you can kiss my sister.

140
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,887
Dirty, dirty ...

141
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,698
Where are your friends now, <i> amigo </ i>

142
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,490
Help.

143
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:19,422
Get your slimy branches 
 of my boots.

144
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,230
I got a bullet for you, 
 stranger. Get up.

145
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:27,645
Or do you head back 
 puzzle together?

146
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:28,862
No, ma'am.

147
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:30,887
Who are you? 
 -Who am I?

148
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:36,843
I ask the questions. Our village dries out. 
 But someone dumps water in the desert.

149
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,800
And I want to know what your role in it.

150
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,269
Role? 
 -What are you doing?

151
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:50,028
I'm glad you asked. Two one-act plays, 
 a mystery and a musical.

152
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:52,645
The melody goes like this:

153
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,274
It is' n Western.

154
00:15:56,376 --> 00:16:01,896
I have an aunt in Morocco 
 and coming, hip, hi

155
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,315
You come not from around, huh?

156
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,392
It's not finished yet.

157
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,802
What's yours?

158
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,843
Boontje. 
 -Funny name.

159
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:19,638
My dad was fond of beans. 
 Fortunately, not asparagus.

160
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,761
Why? 
 -I love puttanesca.

161
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:26,748
As a child you're not happy if you're so hot. 
 -He was a great man.

162
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:30,222
Though he was fond of legumes. 
 -Spicy.

163
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,435
You eat on its axis.

164
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,975
Do you have his remains with you? 
 -Z 's axis. He smoked like.

165
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:39,991
They never found him. 
 Fixed-express.

166
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,864
What do you mean? 
 -Nothing.

167
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:45,423
He never went to the mine shaft. 
 He drank all 's not months.

168
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:51,877
Your insinuation that he took his parental duty 
 failed,'s a insult to ...

169
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,040
Miss Bean?

170
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,795
... And if those guys from Andromeda 5 
 bring him back ...

171
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,989
... Do not I sell my ranch.

172
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:27,191
What are you doing? 
 -What are you doing?

173
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,082
What I do? 
 -You hugging me.

174
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,961
You were petrified. 
 Wind down.

175
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:34,361
You said nothing. 
 -A defense.

176
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:36,822
That many lizards. 
 -That you make up.

177
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:43,047
Want dying here or you want a ride? 
 -No, no. Yes, please.

178
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:47,189
It's Wednesday. 
 Then it all happens.

179
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:51,212
Who are you? 
 -I have many names:

180
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:56,233
Stage name, pen name, avatar. 
 I got a pseudonym had ...

181
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,260
How to find the stranger, 
 looking for companionship ...

182
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:04,896
... The woman who, 
 like the ancient Greek Sirens ...

183
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:09,023
... Attracted to his certain doom.

184
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,360
... And I am one of the few men 
 with 's maiden name.

185
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,060
Here we are.

186
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,380
Exactly. Well ...

187
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:28,242
Very kind of you and if there ever ... 
 -Hortsik.

188
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,603
All right.

189
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,480
Goodbye, Boontje.

190
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,146
WELCOME IN DIRT

191
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:52,094
Leaving you, Jim? 
 -We did our best.

192
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:56,246
The tent is sold. 
 Without water, nothing grows.

193
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:05,157
What is that?

194
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,971
Why did they do? 
 You look-out crazy.

195
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:15,113
You look crazy out there. 
 -What a crazy shirt.

196
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,966
Crazy dress. 
 Mad-Eye.

197
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:18,325
Funny face.

198
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:23,424
You're a stranger. 
 Who love it here not long in coming.

199
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:27,728
Your beans, Boontje. 
 -And I need food, Willie.

200
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,680
You owe me for three quarts. 
 No more credit.

201
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,873
For 12 hours I have.

202
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,740
It is because Mr. Merrimack, from 
 the bank. He does not take out loans.

203
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,390
You know that guy over there?

204
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,023
Oh, yes. Try not to notice.

205
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:23,697
Can I have a glass of water?

206
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,322
He wants a glass of water.

207
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,979
Give him a double. 
 -Give him the spittoon.

208
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:37,671
Cactussap. We do.

209
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:06,251
Hey, fruitdruifje. You're 
 pretty far from home, huh?

210
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,648
Who are you?

211
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,735
Who am I?

212
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,815
I can be who I want.

213
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:20,203
MADE IN DURANGO

214
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:25,704
What is it? Do you miss the mangoes 
 of your mommy?

215
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
That's right, yes.

216
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:31,796
But not so bad 
 if your dad's cooking.

217
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:36,017
And where did you come from?

218
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:39,415
I? I come from the West.

219
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:43,274
Beyond the Horizon. 
 Beyond the sunset.

220
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:45,068
The Far West.

221
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,559
That's right, <i> hombres. </ I>

222
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:53,409
All before breakfast we make 
 someone off the appetite.

223
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,939
Salt and pepper 
 and smothered in clarified butter.

224
00:22:57,979 --> 00:23:00,339
And then we eat him.

225
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:02,198
Do you eat him? 
 -I said.

226
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:06,547
I have seen things which a man 
 incontinent of hitting.

227
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:09,502
Just you go three days 
 in 'n cadaver sitting.

228
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:12,335
That changes you. Absolutely.

229
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:19,163
There are a couple more aces in this game. 
 Just my style.

230
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,889
No, my nagging, furry friend. 
 I'm not from this neighborhood.

231
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:28,218
I'm home where troubles are on the brink 
 and where I can make fuss.

232
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:31,831
I am actually a piece of fuss.

233
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:34,674
The name is ...

234
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:36,744
... Rango.

235
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:42,954
Do you have the Jenkins brothers diverted?

236
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:46,098
With a bullet.

237
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,239
Yolk not get them.

238
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:50,317
All seven?

239
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,677
That's right.

240
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,555
All seven.

241
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:59,571
What have you done exactly that, 
 Mr. Rango?

242
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:05,329
I'm glad you asked me. 
 And I like to tell.

243
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:07,765
But attention, please.

244
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:10,491
For now, the ...

245
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,689
... Complicated.

246
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:17,425
Your account has been lifted: 
 and two sips' n sip.

247
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,940
Stay away, Mordecai. 
 So much of your scholarship.

248
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:25,229
I have no choice, Boontje.

249
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:29,173
In these difficult times we can 
 no credit anymore.

250
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:32,312
This is a bank. 
 Here you store the water.

251
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:39,393
Boontje. You're like a cousin to me 
 since your father ...

252
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:44,514
... Not drunk in the shaft 
 dropped.

253
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:49,008
I protected from you and others 
 certain facts.

254
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:53,143
But it is getting worse ... 
 -Mr Merrimack?

255
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:56,916
Are you okay?

256
00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,645
Bean, I want to show you something.

257
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:11,395
Is that all there is? 
 -And this is the stock.

258
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,476
On Wednesday there will be no more 
 a deposit.

259
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:22,277
If I get no water, I reach for my ranch 
 lost. Is this all there is?

260
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:30,036
That is not to me. Listen. 
 Someone dumps water in the desert.

261
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:32,754
I saw it with my own eyes.

262
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:39,095
Water in the desert? Was that 
 during one of your special moments?

263
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:44,396
We can all dream, 
 but this is reality.

264
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,950
Why do you think so many people 
 the tent sale?

265
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:50,359
What should I do?

266
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:56,527
We can work with the Mayor 
 talk. It helps in time of crisis.

267
00:25:56,446 --> 00:26:00,526
The mayor? 
 -Maybe he is our only hope.

268
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:04,595
The ball bounced through the shovel 
 to number three, the roof fell in ...

269
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:06,666
... With the ethanol in flames flew ...

270
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:12,456
... And only show a charred body 
 and show a high-pitched noise remained.

271
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:21,972
That was six. 
 What has happened with number seven?

272
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:27,573
Number seven? Donders 
 who died of an infection.

273
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,805
Seven men. 
 -A ball.

274
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,966
A tour of the whole place.

275
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,620
Dance for me, soepkip. 
 Put a chicken dance.

276
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:42,802
Dance. 
 <i>-Si, baila, baila. </ i>

277
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:47,828
Are you deaf? If your loan 
 not pays off, the country is not yours.

278
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:51,062
So it is with real estate. 
 Quid pro-quo.

279
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:56,044
When I see your face here again, 
 I cut it off ...

280
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:59,838
... And I wipe it off my crotch. 
 -Beware of the bill.

281
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:03,386
And do not return.

282
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:08,376
What are you crouching?

283
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,201
Bad Bill, I must tell you something.

284
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:24,519
What is this? 
 -You know who that is? That is Rango.

285
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:28,091
Yes, he is not afraid of you. 
 For anyone not.

286
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:31,179
He has the Jenkins brothers killed. 
 -With a bullet.

287
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,089
All seven.

288
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,607
Oh yeah?

289
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:13,028
Come here ...

290
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,266
Just wait. Here.

291
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:25,894
I suppose that's just go for you.

292
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:28,073
So. That's better.

293
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,739
Time out, hold on.

294
00:28:56,334 --> 00:29:00,934
Listen. I give you another chance 
 to reconsider.

295
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:07,852
If you do not want to think ...

296
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,240
... I think about it myself 
 for me to imagine.

297
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:24,024
Exactly what I meant.

298
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:30,191
Listen. Everything is different, 
 Rango now in town.

299
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:35,078
New rules: I want my shoes? 
 and cleaned my coffee hot.

300
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,798
And whatever you do: look at me. 
 Stay out of my sight.

301
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:41,586
Rango. 
 -What does he do?

302
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,840
Who is not afraid. 
 He reads the lesson that bird.

303
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:46,662
Pull over if I can find.

304
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:51,749
I do not want in your 
 body fluids on my boots.

305
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,660
But violence is not necessary ...

306
00:29:57,653 --> 00:29:59,733
... As long as we work together, 
 as a team.

307
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:05,323
So come out and form a glance, 
 I will take a break.

308
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:10,612
What is he doing now? 
 -A big message, I think.

309
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,970
Never mind.

310
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,891
Come take a look.

311
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,939
Look. 
 He is the hawk-chase.

312
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,569
Give it swallows the bait.

313
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,391
Did you know? 
 -He finished it.

314
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:55,636
What do you think, Doc? 
 -This hawk is dead.

315
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:58,252
Which may be in the soup.

316
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,379
And with a bullet. 
 -Just as he said.

317
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:05,619
A hero. 
 This four-not between shelves.

318
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:11,974
Time he met the mayor. 
 -You will meet the mayor.

319
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,541
Three cheers for Rango.

320
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:22,832
And as late as the alien is 
 by praising his new friends ...

321
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:28,275
... And he sinks deeper 
 the guacamole from his self-deception.

322
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,820
When is he coming? 
 -Quick, <i> compadre. </ I> fast.

323
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:49,874
My country is not for sale.

324
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,899
I came to save my country, not sell. 
 -We will arrange something.

325
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:57,425
If you just talk to us.

326
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,206
Bean, where are you going?

327
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,020
The mayor can see you now.

328
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:11,367
Water, Mr. Rango. Water.

329
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:14,898
Without water 
 there's only dust and decay.

330
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:16,748
But with water ...

331
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:18,875
... There is life.

332
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:25,633
Look. So like they live. 
 They follow it everywhere.

333
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,203
The iron law of the desert:

334
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:34,265
Who is in charge of the water 
 over all the boss.

335
00:34:34,262 --> 00:34:39,542
This is from my private stock. 
 Rainwater from the great flood.

336
00:34:39,484 --> 00:34:43,924
Not that of Noah, 
 am I so old it does not.

337
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,750
Power has its advantages. 
 -That's right, boy.

338
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:54,659
But it also includes 
 responsibilities.

339
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,009
I was already mayor 
 Dirt existed before.

340
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:02,224
I am a sentimental turtle ...

341
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:07,333
... But I see a future 
 for this village. With you there, I hope.

342
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:11,569
On Dirt. 
 -Exactly.

343
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:17,866
You see them, Mr. Rango? 
 All my friends and neighbors?

344
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:22,527
Life here is hard. Very hard.

345
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:26,112
You know how they talking every day 
 still insist?

346
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:30,881
They believe it is better.

347
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:34,335
They believe that water will come.

348
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:38,951
They believe against all odds 
 that it will be better tomorrow than today.

349
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:43,518
People need to believe in something.

350
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:47,742
And now they believe in you.

351
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,057
Help yourself, Mr. Rango.

352
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:53,594
Your destiny awaits.

353
00:35:56,584 --> 00:35:59,624
People need to believe in something.

354
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,161
This is not right.

355
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Only the mayor 
 is not affected by the drought.

356
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,093
Do you have no suspicion?

357
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:16,373
And that water in the desert? 
 I have seen them.

358
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:19,758
Hits the lot is not. I examine it.

359
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:23,456
If you think there is 
 of a conspiracy ...

360
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,140
... Talk to the new sheriff.

361
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Excuse me, Mr. Rango.

362
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:34,812
I bang that ugly sneer on your head. 
 -I want ...

363
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:39,529
You want 's comment. 
 -I do not come for fun.

364
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,729
There's a bullet into. 
 -I know of the party.

365
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:45,751
Hence new garb. 
 -I want a complaint ...

366
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,660
You too? 
 -Do a search ...

367
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:51,696
If you would do your best, 
 you were quite handsome.

368
00:36:51,997 --> 00:36:54,757
To school, eat your vegetables 
 and read Shakespeare.

369
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:58,798
Who is Shakespeare? 
 Sheriff-Rango. If you're really hot.

370
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:05,948
I try to save my ranch, while 
 Here you doing with that hand clap lellebel.

371
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:11,347
Sad child, eh? Such a crowd.

372
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:13,105
Why does she do that?

373
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:16,255
It's a survival tactic. 
 -The button is broken.

374
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:17,964
Difficult.

375
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,329
It is not rash. 
 It's a birthmark.

376
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:24,406
I've done it again, eh? 
 -What?

377
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:30,450
Has anyone told you 
 what happened with the previous sheriff?

378
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:10,047
May I ask you ...

379
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:14,354
Sorry, may I ask ... The previous sheriff.

380
00:38:14,603 --> 00:38:17,123
Where is everyone going?

381
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:10,994
Fine folk dance. 
 I still need to practice.

382
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:17,524
Is this normal here? 
 -Every Wednesday. Dry and secure.

383
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:22,083
You have slain bird. 
 -Yes. That's right, yes.

384
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:24,534
Dead bird. Hose.

385
00:39:24,586 --> 00:39:27,466
Snake? 
 Rattlesnake-January, he means.

386
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:31,022
Who was afraid of that hawk. 
 Maybe he is now.

387
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:33,392
Can I have your boots when you're dead?

388
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:37,841
I'm not afraid of Rattlesnake January 
 -It also said Amos.

389
00:39:38,015 --> 00:39:39,375
Amos?

390
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,809
Do you have gold fillings?

391
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,210
Citizens of Dirt.

392
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:10,936
Welcome to the big day 
 for your redemption. Hallelujah.

393
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:15,295
Disciples, like the holy tap ready.

394
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,610
We have a newcomer 
 among us, friends.

395
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:31,302
I do not need to imagine.

396
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,426
So thorough was his first appearance.

397
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:38,133
Mr. Rango, you come forward?

398
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:40,055
Give. 
 -From me.

399
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:49,082
The time has come, friends. 
 The moment was predicted.

400
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:51,508
The sacred moment.

401
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:56,167
The moment of our destiny.

402
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,722
The moment of our salvation.

403
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,900
This is the moment of hydration.

404
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:22,604
His guilt. 
 On-the stake.

405
00:41:22,643 --> 00:41:25,083
He's a devil. 
 -I get his boots.

406
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:31,417
Friends, temper your frustrations. 
 We are hard times ahead.

407
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:37,435
We must sacrifice. 
 But if I can help, my door is ...

408
00:41:37,338 --> 00:41:42,098
Wait. This whole thing 
 stinks three hours in the wind.

409
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:44,618
First, the bank dry 
 and now that tap.

410
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,227
Is the bank dry?

411
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:49,036
In its 
 the bank has no water.

412
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,647
I want my cash.

413
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:58,511
We can not give away anything. 
 -Lift crane my current bill.

414
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:03,745
No civil disobedience 
 in my village.

415
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:09,042
Glad you're here. 
 The case got out of hand.

416
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,170
Yeah, come on.

417
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:15,255
A look at the source 
 of discontent.

418
00:42:19,696 --> 00:42:24,656
Listen, everybody. I've been thinking. 
 And I've discovered something:

419
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:27,002
You have 's water problems.

420
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:31,491
Pay attention. I put something out.

421
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:36,552
Suppose this guy here 'n sip of water 
 takes. Small sip, nothing wrong.

422
00:42:40,031 --> 00:42:44,231
And you. Parched 
 like a rabbit in the desert in July.

423
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:46,773
So you take it fast 'n sip or two.

424
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,999
Remain vigilant.

425
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:53,008
What happens then, do you think?

426
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:58,193
Then everyone takes a sip. 
 Then the water would soon run out.

427
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:00,181
Where are we?

428
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:05,319
Then we thirsty. Very thirsty.

429
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:08,111
Then we meet 
 like a set of creatures to attack.

430
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:15,614
Look. We have 
 six days before water ...

431
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,540
We have five days ...

432
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:28,327
As long as we have water, 
 we have a village.

433
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:34,211
Sheriff Rango's right. 
 Until we have water, there is hope.

434
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,210
Believe me: 
 From now I spend all my time ...

435
00:43:39,194 --> 00:43:43,194
... Aan 't protect 
 of our precious resources.

436
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:47,383
Rango and no one pulls a tango.

437
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:01,092
Good evening, ladies.

438
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:05,967
Let me see thee no more. 
 -Wait, Gordy.

439
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:11,575
Go back and stand up for your rights. 
 The people here are surprisingly friendly.

440
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:14,419
What? Not you again.

441
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:17,444
Mistake.

442
00:44:23,317 --> 00:44:25,637
This is the bank. 
 -I said, Jedidiah.

443
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,376
Wait. 
 -It is the sheriff.

444
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,500
Hands where I can see.

445
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:35,527
Just what I thought, looking for gold 
 approved without tools.

446
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:37,734
Gold panning?

447
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:45,590
Shovel, pickaxe, aspirin, 
 puzzle books ...

448
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,290
Now one license.

449
00:44:47,642 --> 00:44:51,482
Ezekiel, Jedidiah. 
 Donders, what's going on?

450
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:54,799
I have had polyps 
 smarter than you.

451
00:44:55,201 --> 00:45:00,121
This is not the bank. 
 -Pappy, the sheriff is here.

452
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:03,633
He helps us. 
 -With 's license to look for gold.

453
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,360
Right. Just doing my duty.

454
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:11,308
To watch the lonely sheriff 's eagle 
 and outwits the villains.

455
00:45:11,737 --> 00:45:13,977
Does he look like he sounds?

456
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:20,762
Suppose we find the main vein, 
 because we are after prospectors ...

457
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:23,637
... Where we can 't gold 
 then deposit?

458
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:28,895
The best financial institution 
 this side of the Missouri.

459
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:32,915
Monitored around the clock 
 by the undersigned.

460
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,286
Thank you.

461
00:45:36,676 --> 00:45:39,396
The bank was robbed.

462
00:45:39,592 --> 00:45:41,872
My goodness, the bank is robbed.

463
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:44,718
What is it? 
 -The water is gone.

464
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:46,732
What did he say? 
 -The bank is robbed.

465
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:50,429
Doctor Marx, I am on fire. 
 Embrace me.

466
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:53,418
the bank is robbed 
 The city is dry

467
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:55,601
the people trodden 
 the need is high

468
00:45:55,668 --> 00:45:59,988
He has not fulfilled his duty 
 all the water, it is his fault

469
00:46:00,618 --> 00:46:04,018
Backward. This is now 'one crime scene.

470
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:06,711
Turn off the area, 
 looking prints, fibers and DNA.

471
00:46:06,757 --> 00:46:09,557
Take urine samples and get coffee.

472
00:46:09,596 --> 00:46:10,956
And those two are not interchangeable.

473
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:15,534
Gold Search license. 
 -Here. That is evidence.

474
00:46:15,504 --> 00:46:18,184
What now? 
 -We have water.

475
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:23,309
We're all going to. 
 -We know what to do.

476
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:26,855
Right. We all know 
 what to do.

477
00:46:26,938 --> 00:46:28,658
Namely?

478
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,090
Form an opossum.

479
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:34,755
<i> Form a posse. </ I>

480
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:38,914
We do this in an orderly manner.

481
00:46:39,177 --> 00:46:44,417
Is there someone here 
 who can handle a firearm?

482
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:48,026
Good.

483
00:46:48,117 --> 00:46:49,597
What do we do now, Sheriff?

484
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Now we ride.

485
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,370
Where are we going?

486
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:10,098
Where are we going?

487
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:20,601
As my deputy 
 you go looking for the crooks.

488
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:23,495
Using your eyes seeing red skin.

489
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:27,561
Which way did they go? 
 Want to show a bison chat?

490
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:33,011
You're good.

491
00:47:35,424 --> 00:47:39,864
I'm counting on you, Spoons. 
 There's some tobacco in your beard.

492
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:45,357
Always good to show a doctor purchasing. 
 Reptiles support each other, eh?

493
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:48,045
I am an amphibian. 
 -Nobody is perfect.

494
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,670
Are you sure that you see there?

495
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,054
You have a little thing in your eye.

496
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,700
That is conjunctivitis. 
 It's in the family.

497
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:04,789
Fortunately it is not contagious.

498
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:08,765
Tito <i> Momen, </ i> <i> a posse </ i> 
 s not like a ...

499
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:11,431
Never mind.

500
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:16,814
No, little girl. Someone needs 
 watch over the village while I'm gone.

501
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:22,659
Can I have one in his pin shooting? 
 -We're still here.

502
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:28,287
Sheriff, you bring back the water. Right? 
 -There you can count on.

503
00:48:30,597 --> 00:48:34,157
Which way we go? 
 -There are tunnels everywhere.

504
00:48:34,165 --> 00:48:35,845
The village abound.

505
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:38,970
How they bank 
 Found it?

506
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,560
At the lesson continued, gentlemen. 
 Sheriff, here.

507
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,800
Look.

508
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:50,941
Whether you are the face of God sees. 
 -Amen.

509
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:56,011
Every Wednesday he water. 
 Golden-years.

510
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:58,198
But why now?

511
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,780
Whatever the reason is, 
 someone has mastered the water.

512
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,550
What do you think, sheriff?

513
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:07,513
The thieves came from this direction.

514
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:12,465
We traced the line to go to the start point 
 and to keep the rabble.

515
00:49:12,418 --> 00:49:14,538
What did he say? 
 -Take the lead.

516
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:16,845
Follow the lead, he said.

517
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:32,367
Whatever you do ... 
 Do not look down.

518
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:37,603
What is this here? 
 A-aquifer.

519
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:42,625
What is an aquifer? 
 -Well, for aqua.

520
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:45,181
Now he is otherwise empty.

521
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,970
That is a lot.

522
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:10,546
That was it. 
 Here, it stops.

523
00:50:10,622 --> 00:50:14,182
Something or someone is messing around 
 with our water supply.

524
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,750
That leadership has to do. 
 We searched the bank robbers, right?

525
00:50:17,758 --> 00:50:20,078
That's a very different approach.

526
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:22,817
Keep your door or I put you somewhere.

527
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:28,579
Quiet, brutes. 
 So I can not think.

528
00:50:30,957 --> 00:50:32,357
I got it.

529
00:50:32,453 --> 00:50:33,813
Make the torches.

530
00:50:39,475 --> 00:50:42,355
Good idea. 
 Slim-conceived, dude.

531
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:45,582
Climbing. 
 -Get your foot out of my face.

532
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:49,173
Not bad, huh? 
 -Your brain is becoming overheated.

533
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:51,622
If you're on a roll ...

534
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,574
Hot.

535
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:07,887
All they needed 
 had some water.

536
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:11,025
One dried cactus. Bad sign.

537
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,610
Look.

538
00:51:13,008 --> 00:51:15,448
I saw it first. 
 Water.

539
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,139
Enter.

540
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:21,067
He's empty. 
 -I knew that.

541
00:51:21,065 --> 00:51:25,065
Where did you find? 
 Sheriff, you gotta see.

542
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:30,272
Mr. Merrimack, from the bank.

543
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,590
What is he doing here? 
 -Reverse.

544
00:51:32,652 --> 00:51:35,532
Let me there. 
 -He was shot in his back.

545
00:51:36,336 --> 00:51:38,456
This man is not shot.

546
00:51:38,522 --> 00:51:39,642
He drowned.

547
00:51:39,865 --> 00:51:42,065
Drowned? 
 -In the desert?

548
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:43,969
What an ending.

549
00:51:46,772 --> 00:51:49,292
Whose tracks are those?

550
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:58,469
Interesting. The ground is still wet. 
 -We should bury him.

551
00:51:58,397 --> 00:52:02,237
Birds also need to eat. 
 -Circle of life.

552
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:05,561
What does the damn Indians?

553
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:12,151
You see the ghosts, I see.

554
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:15,809
I'm in the moult. That means 
 I'm ready to mate.

555
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,530
I'll remember.

556
00:52:19,077 --> 00:52:20,757
Prickly pear.

557
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:26,402
The ancient prickly pear. This 
 you bring your food to taste.

558
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:28,289
Also a natural laxative.

559
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,510
I got a trace. 
 Three men, to go to the west.

560
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:38,183
One blind, one with an enlargement 
 prostate, driving in the amazonezit.

561
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:41,108
What did he say? 
 They drive-in amazonezit.

562
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:43,964
We whisper. 
 -Thermostat Problems.

563
00:52:44,016 --> 00:52:46,816
Who would need a little research?

564
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,740
Embarrassing.

565
00:52:50,193 --> 00:52:53,273
What exactly are we doing?

566
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,440
Now we ride.

567
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,260
That means we now ride. 
 At this time.

568
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,780
I think of marshmallows at camp 
 with my dad. I ate them all night.

569
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:54,708
Before breakfast 
 I had to regurgitate them.

570
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:59,508
I've been my whole dalmatian 
 vomited.

571
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:03,415
That's nothing. I have a whole tribe of pygmies.

572
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:09,310
Who looked at me so strangely. 
 -I remember. Those were very nice.

573
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:12,647
I once 'n human spine 
 in my stool.

574
00:54:15,772 --> 00:54:18,132
Let yourself explore.

575
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:21,059
Can I use the beans, bean?

576
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,539
Sheriff?

577
00:54:22,988 --> 00:54:27,468
Mr. Rango, tell me 
 the Spirit of the West.

578
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:30,583
Tell me. 
 -Is it true what they say?

579
00:54:31,011 --> 00:54:37,171
Yes, the Spirit of the West. 
 The eternally unattainable ideal.

580
00:54:37,459 --> 00:54:41,579
He drives a coach alabaster, 
 gold protected by guards.

581
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,200
He appears to those 
 that 's quest over with.

582
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,769
And reached the other side.

583
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:57,133
The other side of what? 
 -It is a metaphor.

584
00:54:57,151 --> 00:54:59,711
My eye. 
 -That it heals.

585
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:03,599
Sheriff, what are you doing 
 Rattlesnake in January?

586
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,999
What? Where?

587
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:10,788
Your paths 
 has already been crossed.

588
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:14,945
Oh yes. January My brother, you mean.

589
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:16,681
Your brother? 
 -I said.

590
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:20,014
But he's a snake 
 and you're a lizard.

591
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:22,732
Mommy regularly.

592
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:27,745
Has he ever bitten you? 
 -Sure. Look.

593
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:32,543
It's okay to feel here. 
 -Interesting. A navel.

594
00:55:32,503 --> 00:55:35,943
I'm immune to its poison. 
 It gives my coffee 'n <i> bite. </ I>

595
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:41,437
Is it true that he is afraid of hawks? 
 -That is its natural enemy.

596
00:55:43,097 --> 00:55:46,017
Of that snake to my feathers 
 upright.

597
00:55:46,053 --> 00:55:49,253
I do not sleep. 
 -No worries.

598
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:53,317
We find the water 
 and get home a hero reception.

599
00:55:54,152 --> 00:55:59,512
Before we go to sleep, I 
 we hold hands ...

600
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:01,889
... For the Spirit of 'the West 
 thanks.

601
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:03,531
Good idea.

602
00:56:05,552 --> 00:56:08,472
I'm not always correct 
 you've been to.

603
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:14,773
But tonight, thank you 
 Sheriff Rango you gave us.

604
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:19,791
We lead a hard life. 
 Sometimes I do not know how to save.

605
00:56:20,138 --> 00:56:23,458
Rango but gives me hope 
 that we succeed.

606
00:56:24,322 --> 00:56:27,402
You have sent us a hero.

607
00:56:28,045 --> 00:56:30,685
Glad to be back on someone 
 be believed.

608
00:56:31,193 --> 00:56:35,353
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

609
00:57:07,812 --> 00:57:09,692
Just testing.

610
00:57:12,149 --> 00:57:14,029
It's a cold night.

611
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,901
Do you ever 
 they look at you?

612
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:24,661
That is the Spanish Bayonet. We call 
 him the Wandering Cactus.

613
00:57:24,662 --> 00:57:29,422
Walking? 
 According to legend, he seeks water.

614
00:57:29,422 --> 00:57:33,222
As a girl I held them in the eye 
 to see if they moved.

615
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:37,141
I thought she was me 
 would lead to an oasis.

616
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:40,776
A place where enough water was 
 for everyone.

617
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:46,798
Night long I kept an eye on them. 
 But I never saw them move.

618
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:50,934
But you still look. 
 Who would not like an oasis?

619
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:54,696
We find the water is. 
 I promise you.

620
00:57:57,788 --> 00:57:59,828
What a lonely sound.

621
00:58:00,706 --> 00:58:04,266
Have you ever been lonely? 
 -Sometimes.

622
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:08,635
I believe nothing. You're a charmer. 
 Everybody likes you.

623
00:58:08,805 --> 00:58:12,085
I found quite difficult to make friends.

624
00:58:12,682 --> 00:58:17,842
We sit there isolated on the ranch. 
 As if you show a box is.

625
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:21,147
I never met many people.

626
00:58:21,203 --> 00:58:23,363
Anything I can imagine.

627
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:28,163
Is there someone special in your life? 
 -I used to.

628
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,990
She could not keep her head. 
 Now I walk too much danger.

629
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:37,269
Life is lonely on the prairie. 
 At a gallop over the plain and all.

630
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:40,461
Bean?

631
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:02,047
I vil you alive. 
 -It was my fault.

632
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,519
Temper. 
 Difficult-family. Intervention is necessary.

633
00:59:08,454 --> 00:59:09,814
What is that?

634
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:13,275
It is the water.

635
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:19,175
I have a plan. 
 And we all have a role.

636
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:22,004
What do I do? 
 -The most important task.

637
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:27,802
You stay here and if something goes wrong, 
 you give us the sign.

638
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,641
What size is that dress?

639
00:59:40,812 --> 00:59:43,492
He has it.

640
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,818
He has the water. 
 -You did.

641
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:48,359
Well ... 
 -Why are not you as smart?

642
00:59:48,413 --> 00:59:53,293
I gotta tell you something. 
 -Quiet. There comes one.

643
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:58,795
Value gentlemen. I wish you, 
 you and you have a good day.

644
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:03,603
This is Madame LuPone's junk 
 touring <i> thespiënnes. </ i>

645
01:00:05,225 --> 01:00:07,345
What is that? 
 -Thespiënnes.

646
01:00:07,413 --> 01:00:10,493
It is illegal in seven states.

647
01:00:10,522 --> 01:00:14,242
The curtain rises: the princess 
 wants from her life on rob:

648
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:15,685
I yearn for love.

649
01:00:15,781 --> 01:00:18,661
A sentinel surveillance 
 the castle gate.

650
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,619
Hear Who's there?

651
01:00:21,692 --> 01:00:24,892
Predictable. 
 -Quiet. My favorite piece.

652
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,475
Under trumpet 
 her father arrives.

653
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:32,621
Touched by Cupid.

654
01:00:33,706 --> 01:00:39,666
Please, my beautiful daughter, 
 and insert ...

655
01:00:40,193 --> 01:00:42,553
Text? 
 -Put your hands up.

656
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:48,538
What was that? 
 Certainly, participatory theater.

657
01:00:48,907 --> 01:00:53,067
You're surrounded. 
 So the whole family: hands up.

658
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:56,143
My whole family?

659
01:01:00,883 --> 01:01:04,563
barley with snot and kale

660
01:01:04,836 --> 01:01:08,436
intestine stew, pus bowl

661
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:12,537
Grandma's bone in polecat blood

662
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:16,062
cheese toes and clubfoot

663
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:20,907
We have a full house.

664
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:24,582
So that is a 
 old-fashioned showdown.

665
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:28,737
This is not our whole force.

666
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:39,389
What does that mean? 
 -That is the sign.

667
01:01:39,382 --> 01:01:42,782
The sign. Something went wrong.

668
01:01:46,982 --> 01:01:50,102
Should something happen now?

669
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:53,671
Ideas are welcome.

670
01:02:01,261 --> 01:02:02,821
Run.

671
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,910
Jump on the wagon.

672
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:18,291
Are we going to throw down, guys?

673
01:02:18,842 --> 01:02:24,402
Delicious, if they flee. 
 -Maybelle, but screaming.

674
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:33,165
We escaped. 
 The public-lived it.

675
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:35,917
Yes. Bunch of inbreeding.

676
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:03,419
Bats Invasion.

677
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:05,846
Then you can drive.

678
01:03:13,732 --> 01:03:18,132
Tonight we're having soup. 
 -Come on, eropaf.

679
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,863
Not on the water shoot.

680
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:35,649
Jedidiah. Time for the Alabama-squeezebox. 
 -All right, Dad.

681
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:45,290
I sense some hostility. 
 -From below.

682
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:05,109
Throw your lasso to that pig.

683
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:28,268
Let's escape. 
 Valve-closed and shooting.

684
01:04:28,274 --> 01:04:30,634
Where's the sheriff? 
 One-appointment.

685
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:33,489
Boseefus, they let their lust.

686
01:04:39,444 --> 01:04:42,124
What was that? Check it out.

687
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:45,267
What is it? A problem?

688
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,803
You might say.

689
01:05:35,255 --> 01:05:36,255
Headache.

690
01:05:38,825 --> 01:05:40,825
Was that all?

691
01:05:57,902 --> 01:06:00,382
It was not unpleasant.

692
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:02,626
Suit.

693
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,399
Here, hold on.

694
01:06:24,656 --> 01:06:26,376
Get off me.

695
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,240
Jump.

696
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,680
It is impossible.

697
01:07:05,877 --> 01:07:08,917
This can not. It is empty.

698
01:07:08,881 --> 01:07:10,361
There is no water.

699
01:07:10,608 --> 01:07:14,328
No water? 
 -Where we fought for?

700
01:07:14,249 --> 01:07:17,969
You have the means of our existence 
 squandered.

701
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:23,131
In that Sunday dress is the sheriff. 
 Of the gold-seeking authorization?

702
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,480
The what? 
 -Irrelevant. Astray.

703
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:27,555
I love you for 'one bank robbery ...

704
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:33,257
... And the murder of John 
 Merrimack Joe or Fluffy.

705
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:36,896
We have not killed anybody. 
 The safe was empty.

706
01:07:36,813 --> 01:07:38,773
The bank had been robbed.

707
01:07:38,803 --> 01:07:43,883
How do you then that bottle? 
 -Found in the desert.

708
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:46,401
Why did you bring him over here?

709
01:07:46,387 --> 01:07:50,787
Wait. So the bottle was empty 
 when you found him?

710
01:07:50,704 --> 01:07:53,024
Right. 
 -I believe in nothing.

711
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,820
We hang them up.

712
01:07:55,912 --> 01:07:59,552
Who dumps water in the desert? 
 That's not for the first time.

713
01:07:59,636 --> 01:08:02,876
It's a puzzle. A <i> sodejudoku. </ I>

714
01:08:02,899 --> 01:08:05,739
What's going on? 
 -I do not know.

715
01:08:05,778 --> 01:08:09,818
I go to the hole 
 this enigma.

716
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:12,369
You go with me.

717
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,738
They're coming.

718
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:19,232
There they are.

719
01:08:20,635 --> 01:08:22,395
They are the thieves.

720
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:45,836
Where's the water?

721
01:08:48,812 --> 01:08:50,732
There was no water.

722
01:09:04,205 --> 01:09:06,125
Where is he going?

723
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:09,299
To the Mayor.

724
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,959
There he established happy with it, eh? 
 -Nice hit, boss.

725
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:25,285
Interesting.

726
01:09:25,396 --> 01:09:31,956
Apologies for the shoes, Mr. Rango. 
 This game requires a certain predetermined etiquette.

727
01:09:31,845 --> 01:09:33,845
And I'm a stickler-precise.

728
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:38,638
Nice. I have some questions 
 and I have my own etiquette.

729
01:09:42,785 --> 01:09:45,665
Why would you dump water 
 in the desert?

730
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:49,663
However naive bank robbers 
 their word for it.

731
01:09:49,657 --> 01:09:53,217
If they are suspended 
 is your job done.

732
01:09:53,227 --> 01:09:54,827
Bravo. 
 -Good work.

733
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,756
Suppose that the bank had already robbed?

734
01:09:57,796 --> 01:10:02,196
Who will? 
 -I was hoping you could tell me.

735
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:06,972
That sounds almost like an accusation. 
 -Take it as you want.

736
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:15,589
Something that you said keeps 
 rattling in my frontal lobe.

737
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:17,128
What then?

738
01:10:17,335 --> 01:10:21,175
Who is in charge of the water 
 over all the boss.

739
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:26,711
Come on, Mr. Rango. 
 You close to me divine powers.

740
01:10:26,664 --> 01:10:29,744
Why I am the boss 
 the water?

741
01:10:32,076 --> 01:10:38,676
You clearly have this game in the fingers. 
 -I play it for many years.

742
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:41,684
I had been here before 
 The highway was.

743
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:46,712
I saw progress and I have 
 a few things from her classes.

744
01:10:47,048 --> 01:10:50,208
Check it out 
 from 's broader perspective.

745
01:10:50,234 --> 01:10:54,234
Understand the movements 
 of history.

746
01:10:54,457 --> 01:10:59,337
Look, kid. 
 You can almost see how the time goes by.

747
01:11:02,327 --> 01:11:07,887
What you build there? 
 -The future, Mr. Rango. The future.

748
01:11:07,816 --> 01:11:11,416
Soon it all fades 
 to show a myth:

749
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:14,103
The Wild West town, the sheriff, 
 the gunslinger.

750
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:17,789
There is no place for it. 
 Now we are civilized.

751
01:11:17,797 --> 01:11:20,237
Correct, civilized.

752
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:25,532
That is the future. Join us, 
 or stay longer in the past.

753
01:11:25,474 --> 01:11:29,514
Mr. Merrimack was sometimes 
 longer in the past?

754
01:11:29,544 --> 01:11:34,184
Beware, Mr. Rango. You forget 
 but you're a lizard.

755
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:38,230
You forget apparently 
 that I represent the law.

756
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,960
Our new sheriff has come to believe themselves 
 in his hero.

757
01:11:46,124 --> 01:11:48,724
Rattlesnake come late January.

758
01:11:48,924 --> 01:11:53,444
January is the angel of death. 
 Wherever he goes, fall thaw.

759
01:11:53,413 --> 01:11:54,613
Do it.

760
01:12:08,605 --> 01:12:12,925
Sit still. You have to look presentable 
 when it pops its clogs.

761
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:17,581
<i> ha llegado la muerte </ i>

762
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:21,247
death is coming

763
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:25,106
<i> Dónde estan between huevos </ i>

764
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:29,959
our hero goes about it now?

765
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:38,502
The mayor has been the land 
 bought in the valley. Except for your country.

766
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:42,405
Why? Without water 
 country is useless.

767
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:46,923
Unless he has power over the water. 
 If the bladder of a monkey.

768
01:12:46,893 --> 01:12:49,133
Once the land is his, 
 there will be water.

769
01:12:49,194 --> 01:12:51,194
How does he do that?

770
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,194
Sheriff, we have a problem.

771
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:03,839
Wait, Boontje. It is not necessary.

772
01:13:06,919 --> 01:13:10,039
Hang him upside down to see blue. 
 -Hang on.

773
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:12,621
Calm. Let me talk.

774
01:13:12,673 --> 01:13:15,513
They paid the price. 
 -Calm down, everyone. Come on.

775
01:13:15,551 --> 01:13:17,471
Here with them, then we emasculate them.

776
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:19,684
You too, Spoons?

777
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:23,011
They've stolen water. 
 Everything we had.

778
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:27,232
Here, nobody hung. 
 -It is his fault.

779
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:29,693
You would the water back.

780
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:34,104
Without water there is no hope. 
 -Nothing more to believe.

781
01:13:34,656 --> 01:13:36,136
See that sign there?

782
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:41,369
As long as 'Sheriff' state, 
 the laws are respected.

783
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:45,331
In a lawless situation ... 
 Think about it.

784
01:13:45,398 --> 01:13:48,598
It begins slowly, 
 like a fungus.

785
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:53,899
An insult. Allegations. 
 And soon we eat our children ...

786
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:58,037
... And get cats and dogs 
 together the craziest mutants.

787
01:13:58,672 --> 01:14:01,912
Looking for something to believe 
 Spoons?

788
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:03,899
Believe in me.

789
01:14:05,577 --> 01:14:07,297
Believe in that sign there.

790
01:14:08,224 --> 01:14:12,104
As long as it hangs there, 
 We have hope.

791
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,720
Hello, brother.

792
01:14:38,744 --> 01:14:40,024
Thirsty?

793
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,320
That was long ago, brother.

794
01:14:53,344 --> 01:14:56,904
How are you? 
 -Oh, you know ...

795
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:03,380
You have all the brothers Jenkins 
 deflected, I hear.

796
01:15:03,428 --> 01:15:05,548
With a bullet, eh?

797
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:07,652
Is not that right?

798
01:15:08,222 --> 01:15:12,422
The good people here 
 believe those stories of yours, huh?

799
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:16,073
They think 
 you're a tough killer.

800
01:15:16,298 --> 01:15:19,218
These people trust you.

801
01:15:19,352 --> 01:15:22,232
They think 
 that you are going to save their village.

802
01:15:22,444 --> 01:15:25,524
They think you are going to save their souls.

803
01:15:29,516 --> 01:15:31,716
But we know better.

804
01:15:31,835 --> 01:15:33,595
Right?

805
01:15:38,444 --> 01:15:41,964
Let your friends to see 
 how brave you are.

806
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,800
Let me see your true nature.

807
01:15:44,765 --> 01:15:47,405
Pull out your revolver and shoot me dead.

808
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:50,399
You do not need all.

809
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:52,361
Just one, huh?

810
01:15:54,448 --> 01:15:57,848
Come on, hero. 
 Pull the trigger on it.

811
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,790
Do you have the look of a killer, boy?

812
01:16:04,766 --> 01:16:06,646
I see nothing.

813
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:14,514
It was bragging, right? You 
 The Jenkins brothers are not diverted.

814
01:16:14,299 --> 01:16:17,059
You will not even get out to the West. 
 Or does it?

815
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,320
Come on.

816
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:24,673
Harder. Your friends here 
 have not heard.

817
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:33,032
You've just lied to them. 
 You're a crook and a coward.

818
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:34,283
Is not that right?

819
01:16:35,813 --> 01:16:36,853
Harder.

820
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:47,723
Listen well, dirty liar. 
 This is my village.

821
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:52,352
If I see you again, 
 I send your soul straight to hell.

822
01:17:08,402 --> 01:17:09,973
Who are you?

823
01:18:46,028 --> 01:18:47,343
Who am I?

824
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:50,443
I am nobody.

825
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,920
Golden guards.

826
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,300
The alabaster coach.

827
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:42,786
The Spirit of the West.

828
01:20:47,628 --> 01:20:51,259
Excuse me ... 
 Mr. Ghost ... Sir?

829
01:20:53,817 --> 01:20:58,256
That's a good one. Sometimes you 
 dig deep to find what you want.

830
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:01,296
So you did it.

831
01:21:02,931 --> 01:21:04,388
Is this heaven?

832
01:21:04,633 --> 01:21:07,734
If so, we ate 
 a biscuit with Kim Novak.

833
01:21:08,594 --> 01:21:10,105
Absolutely.

834
01:21:11,085 --> 01:21:14,474
What are you doing here? 
 -I am looking. Like you.

835
01:21:15,428 --> 01:21:20,077
I do not even remember what I seek. 
 I do not remember who I am.

836
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,800
They called the man without a name.

837
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:27,804
Now they have 
 a name for everything.

838
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,373
No matter how you call. 
 No words but deeds.

839
01:21:32,914 --> 01:21:36,189
My actions make everything worse. 
 I'm a crook.

840
01:21:36,413 --> 01:21:40,495
My friends believed in me, 
 but they have a hero is needed.

841
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:44,406
Then be a hero. 
 -No, you do not understand.

842
01:21:44,472 --> 01:21:46,482
I would not be here. 
 That's right.

843
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:50,217
You come from far 
 looking for something that is not here.

844
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:54,139
Do not you understand? 
 It's not about you.

845
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:56,300
It's about them.

846
01:21:59,308 --> 01:22:03,388
But return is impossible. 
 -You have no choice.

847
01:22:06,692 --> 01:22:09,492
Nobody can run away 
 from his own story.

848
01:22:21,385 --> 01:22:23,065
So you did it.

849
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:28,387
Yes, <i> amigo. </ I> 
 The other side of the road.

850
01:22:30,231 --> 01:22:32,671
Did you just now?

851
01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:38,914
We see what we have to see. 
 Is not it beautiful?

852
01:22:50,077 --> 01:22:53,477
Yes, indeed.

853
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,080
Come on, buddy. I want to show you something.

854
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:05,729
Years ago there was <i> agua </ i> 
 in this whole valley.

855
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Now there remains only one question:

856
01:23:10,846 --> 01:23:12,486
Where did it go?

857
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:47,532
They follow the water.

858
01:23:47,846 --> 01:23:50,926
They follow the water. Come on.

859
01:24:24,654 --> 01:24:29,134
That is nonsense. 
 Without water, the land useless.

860
01:24:29,615 --> 01:24:31,535
What you build there?

861
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,532
The future, Mr. Rango.

862
01:24:33,654 --> 01:24:38,054
Join us, 
 or stay longer in the past.

863
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:43,070
I was here 
 Before the highway came.

864
01:24:45,885 --> 01:24:50,885
I saw progress and I have 
 a few things from her classes.

865
01:24:55,923 --> 01:25:00,723
Who is in charge of the water 
 over all the boss.

866
01:25:06,962 --> 01:25:11,002
Come on, Mr. Rango. 
 You close to my divine powers.

867
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,200
Why I am the boss 
 the water?

868
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,040
EMERGENCY VALVE

869
01:25:48,598 --> 01:25:50,398
What now, <i> amigo </ i>

870
01:25:57,731 --> 01:26:00,931
Nobody can run away 
 from his own story.

871
01:26:02,105 --> 01:26:03,785
I go back.

872
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:06,308
But why?

873
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,240
Because I'm like this.

874
01:26:21,098 --> 01:26:25,618
You dare do, Sheriff. What do you want?

875
01:26:26,585 --> 01:26:30,065
Pappy and the boys 
 innocent are hung.

876
01:26:31,382 --> 01:26:32,902
But I have a plan.

877
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:05,734
I know how difficult this is for you, 
 Boontje. But is it right decision.

878
01:27:05,647 --> 01:27:08,327
Decisions, decisions.

879
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:11,451
It is not necessary 
 to suffer any longer.

880
01:27:17,618 --> 01:27:21,058
The family ranch is now a wasteland.

881
01:27:21,379 --> 01:27:26,179
Sign the deed. Then you are freed 
 the burden of your father.

882
01:27:28,093 --> 01:27:30,653
My father was not affected.

883
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:33,021
Keep your blood money. I love my country.

884
01:27:38,799 --> 01:27:41,879
In all hell fire. 
 Do what he says ...

885
01:27:41,907 --> 01:27:45,627
... If I press those beautiful brown eyes 
 out of your skull.

886
01:27:46,396 --> 01:27:49,756
Wait. You do not ... 
 -Let me do my job.

887
01:27:49,773 --> 01:27:53,493
You have brought me there. 
 Now we 't limit.

888
01:27:54,032 --> 01:27:58,312
Ticks rotakte, woman. 
 -Go to hell.

889
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,731
Where do I come, you think?

890
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:03,251
Look at me.

891
01:28:03,356 --> 01:28:05,796
I want to die.

892
01:28:14,982 --> 01:28:16,942
I dare you.

893
01:28:20,815 --> 01:28:25,255
This day is 
 still a lot more interesting.

894
01:28:51,089 --> 01:28:52,409
Put her down.

895
01:28:52,509 --> 01:28:55,989
Or else, kid? Let me finish?

896
01:28:56,001 --> 01:28:57,681
That's the bottom line, yes.

897
01:29:00,221 --> 01:29:03,101
Keep your dirty paws home. 
 Closed-right gear.

898
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:06,177
All right, Sheriff. 
 Let's see something.

899
01:30:34,191 --> 01:30:35,351
Now, <i> amigos. </ I>

900
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,020
Draw.

901
01:30:59,017 --> 01:31:01,377
That was a bad idea.

902
01:31:05,425 --> 01:31:06,585
Thirst, brother?

903
01:31:10,221 --> 01:31:12,381
Here it comes.

904
01:31:19,123 --> 01:31:21,923
It's a miracle. 
 -Beware.

905
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:30,167
Look. 
 -What is that?

906
01:31:31,977 --> 01:31:33,657
That is our salvation, Dad.

907
01:31:33,742 --> 01:31:36,902
We escape, boys. 
 We break out.

908
01:31:46,174 --> 01:31:50,094
I shoot so many holes in your 
 that your bowels leak lead.

909
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:53,128
Then it is good 
 I still have troops.

910
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:12,234
That's no hawk. 
 Those are just bats.

911
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:18,290
Stick to the plan. 
 Let him shoot the gun empty.

912
01:32:29,686 --> 01:32:33,886
A bullet is enough. 
 -That you dare not.

913
01:32:35,058 --> 01:32:36,338
Try it.

914
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:44,219
Mr. Rango. Are you forgetting something?

915
01:32:49,332 --> 01:32:51,332
Give me your weapon, sheriff.

916
01:32:54,052 --> 01:32:55,572
Nu, Mr Range.

917
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,690
Hold on. No worries, I have a plan.

918
01:33:10,321 --> 01:33:14,601
Help. Open the door.

919
01:33:15,578 --> 01:33:16,738
Good. Plan B.

920
01:33:18,033 --> 01:33:19,073
Clearer talk.

921
01:33:19,376 --> 01:33:23,656
All my problems solved. 
 Except one.

922
01:33:24,134 --> 01:33:28,174
There is no place 
 for gunfighters, January

923
01:33:28,163 --> 01:33:31,403
We are now businessmen. 
 With new-hats.

924
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:34,980
Where I come from, 
 we call this improvisation.

925
01:33:36,183 --> 01:33:37,823
You're back.

926
01:33:45,929 --> 01:33:46,929
What was that?

927
01:33:47,042 --> 01:33:49,442
Do not panic. You have plan B swallowed.

928
01:33:52,068 --> 01:33:53,588
Time to panic.

929
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:58,600
You and the sheriff are the same: 
 you guys are legends.

930
01:33:58,553 --> 01:34:02,193
Soon no one believes 
 that you existed.

931
01:34:05,114 --> 01:34:08,714
One last shot 
 the last bandit to kill.

932
01:34:10,026 --> 01:34:11,866
Is that just beautiful.

933
01:34:44,521 --> 01:34:46,361
If we work together ...

934
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:50,519
... We stuck 's good solution 
 for this situation.

935
01:34:50,507 --> 01:34:53,147
You must consult with him.

936
01:35:03,821 --> 01:35:05,541
A bullet.

937
01:35:06,622 --> 01:35:11,782
Respect from one legend 
 for another.

938
01:35:13,721 --> 01:35:15,721
What did you say?

939
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:20,313
Soon no one believes 
 that you existed.

940
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:40,610
The water is back. 
 As you promised.

941
01:35:40,695 --> 01:35:42,415
You're a hero.

942
01:35:43,573 --> 01:35:48,253
If you're a hero, then ... 
 -Not spoil it.

943
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:53,291
I do not know what you do, 
 but I'll take one dive.

944
01:35:56,581 --> 01:35:59,701
That 's the end of the journey 
 of the lizard.

945
01:35:59,727 --> 01:36:03,607
Van't simple beginning 
 to the legend that we now sing.

946
01:36:03,603 --> 01:36:08,123
And even though he once dead, 
 who knows by 's accident at home ...

947
01:36:08,092 --> 01:36:11,172
... As in 65% of all unnatural 
 deaths ...

948
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:18,000
... Yet the inhabitants of the name 
 continue to remember their savior ...

949
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:26,500
Nani Resdi
