{\an8}[Polly] <i>There will be a war in this family
and one of you will die.</i>

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,040
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,080
<i>are your own responsibility.</i>

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,040
[Michael] <i>Since my mother passed away</i>

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,440
<i>Tommy and I haven't even spoken.</i>

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm looking forward to
working with you again, Michael.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,120
<i>That, my friend,
is the finest opium in the world.</i>

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,120
Why would you sell?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,119
[Tommy] The Irish are being difficult.
The Italians are not an option.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,040
-You're going to America?
-To Canada.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,760
To collect payment for the shipment.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,680
[Diana] Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,840
To have each day
what I have only sampled once.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,360
[doctor] <i>Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.</i>

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,520
[Lizzie] <i>She's gone, Tommy. She's gone.</i>

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
A daughter lost, a son found.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,800
This is my son. They call him Duke.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,560
[Holford] It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,480
-How long?
-Perhaps 18 months.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,080
My associates are gonna
take care of Thomas Shelby

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
<i>and you are gonna give us his brother.</i>

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,600
What are Michael's real intentions
towards me, Gina?

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,480
<i>And if you lie, I will know.</i>

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,920
It is my intention to kill Tommy Shelby.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,640
[instrumental music playing]

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,040
[Michael] <i>It was the ambitions
and strategies</i>

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
<i>of one man that caused this.</i>

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,880
<i>I will take revenge on Tommy Shelby.</i>

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,720
You want a drink first or a whore first?

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,480
I want to see my wife first.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,480
After you've fucked your wife,
you're going to kill a man, right?

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
[Lizzie sniffs]

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,600
[sniffs]

34
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,000
The smoke from your daughter's funeral
is still in your clothes...

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
and you slept with someone.

36
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
Not just someone.

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,480
[inhales sharply]

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,040
The enemy.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,280
Every enemy we ever had in one woman.

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,120
There are some things that I do...

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,480
You're not so good
at lying any more, Tommy.

42
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
These days, the truth gets in your eyes.

43
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,560
-I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.
-[scoffs]

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,600
-I need to know where you will go.
-See? You just accept it.

45
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,760
You don't fight it.

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,640
You are cursed, Tommy.

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,200
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
A curse never to be lifted.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,440
I will be away, Lizzie.

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,560
-And while I'm gone, I know a place...
-Always gone. Always away.

[sniffles]

53
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,840
Well, now your rings are gone.
Your rings are away.

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm already packed.

55
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,720
[breath trembles]

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,840
Now leave me to say goodbye to Ruby.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,240
[Tommy] I have to go away
for a bit, Charlie.

58
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Look at me.

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,720
Hey, look at me.

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,440
Mum already told me she's leaving.

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,280
And she told me why.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
Mum, where are you going?

63
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
[Lizzie sighs]

64
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,200
A hotel.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
And then your father will get me a house.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,000
Mum,

67
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,040
I'll come with you.

68
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
I'd rather be with you.

69
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Wherever it is.

70
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,480
You're not my mum,

71
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
but you're more my mum than he's my dad.

72
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
He's never here.

73
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
I'd be on my own here.

74
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,400
[Lizzie] Oh, Charles, love.

75
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,840
I don't think your father
would allow that.

76
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
[horse sighs and stomps]

77
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,800
You can go.

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,320
You can go, son.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,160
I know a good place, Lizzie.
I'll arrange that place.

80
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,920
And, Charlie, you can take him, eh?

81
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,200
They have stables at this new place.

82
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,920
After a while, he'll listen to you.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
He'll forget about Ruby.

84
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,040
That's how horses are.

85
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,920
And you'll be here all alone?

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,080
I'm buying land, Lizzie.
I'm buying up land.

87
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,680
This place I've bought, I was going to
knock down, but you can go there.

88
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Dad...

89
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
Where will you go?

90
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,080
This is the Peaky Blinders' armoury.

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,840
We have a very good relationship
with the BSA factory in Armoury Road.

92
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,920
Two dozen machine guns,
half a dozen submachine guns,

93
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,000
BSA sniper rifles,
three boxes of hand grenades.

94
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,040
For what purpose?

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,760
For eventualities like the one
that is about to occur.

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,960
When men come to us with bad intentions,
family come together.

97
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,000
Tommy says it's time
you joined the family.

98
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,960
But you're not just going to be a soldier.

99
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,720
You're going to be a general... someday.

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,480
So, I need to ask you some questions.

101
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
What have you ever fired?

102
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,280
[Duke] Shotgun.

103
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,840
-[gun clicks]
-Pistol. .22.

104
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,280
What have you ever killed?

105
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
A few rabbits.

106
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,400
Pheasant, partridge, stag.

107
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,360
Arthur tells me,

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,600
when they were taking care
of some business at the betting shop,

109
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,760
you ran away.

110
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,560
It was unfair.

111
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,840
Fairness is not a soldier's concern.

112
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,159
You do what you do.

113
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,840
I already have done.

114
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,920
Fair and square.

115
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,840
I have killed a man.

116
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
Tommy's always right.

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,760
We were outside a hospital in Bridgnorth.
In the Black Country.

118
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,000
My mother was dying.

119
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,280
And the orderly wouldn't give her a bed.

120
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
She was a Gypsy.

121
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
She had no insurance.

122
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,000
She never saw the sunrise.

123
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
Nor did that man who denied her.

124
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,640
Just one more thing
we need to know about you.

125
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,480
Can you keep a secret?

126
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,640
[door slams]

127
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,080
[Arthur] I know, brother.

128
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I know.

129
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I know.

130
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,760
I stole your keys.

131
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,120
Tuberculoma.

132
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
In your brain.

133
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,360
[smacks lips] Yeah. But I still have time
to do what I need to do.

134
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,640
Fuck you, Tommy.

135
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,680
I don't need anyone to know, Arthur.

136
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,040
No, you don't, do ya?

137
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,800
-You don't need anything, do ya?
-No, I don't need anything.

138
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't need anything.

139
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,720
How long have we been dead for, eh?

140
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
You and me. How long?

141
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,880
-At least now I'll have a certificate.
-[scoffs]

142
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,800
Wherever it is, I'll get the drinks in
and I'll wait for you.

143
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,960
-Fuck's sake.
-Yeah.

144
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
All them bullets that missed.

145
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
It's funny, Arthur.

146
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,760
It's funny is what it is.

147
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,680
So don't you fucking weep.

148
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,560
Weep.

149
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
When everyone is taken care of financially
I'll take myself away. On my own.

150
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,600
I don't want anyone... [inhales]

151
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,360
Anyone who may or may not love me...

152
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,360
to have to see me crawl...

153
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
and grow insane and helpless.

154
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
That would be a cruelty to me and to them.

155
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,880
By the time people know the truth,

156
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
I will be gone.

157
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,240
What about Lizzie?

158
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,760
I have some papers I need you to sign
on behalf of the company.

159
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Told Lizzie?

160
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,040
I'm working with the housing minister.

161
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,920
I will be allocating contracts,

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,360
construction contracts,
worth ten million pounds.

163
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,120
You haven't told Lizzie?

164
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,800
Some contracts I'll be allocating are with
companies in which we have an interest...

165
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,520
Fuck you and your contracts!

166
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,480
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue to earn money.

167
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,200
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing it
because it's a good thing.

168
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
-Building houses.
-Oh.

169
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,680
-Yeah, for ordinary working people.
-Yeah. Good for you. Fucking...

170
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,880
[Tommy] In the interests
of a fairer future.

171
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,800
Before that,

172
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,360
I will be going to Canada

173
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,720
to collect payment for the shipment.
Five million pounds!

174
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,440
Five fucking million!

175
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,960
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

176
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
And that will be my legacy.

177
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,160
Instead of me, there will be money.

178
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,280
Because for most of the people
who are close to me, that is what I am!

179
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,480
Fucking money. That is my agency.

180
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,160
Is that all you think you are, eh? Hmm?

181
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
Stand up.

182
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
You heard me.

183
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,600
Stand up. On your feet.

184
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,560
-On your fucking feet.
-Arthur.

185
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,920
On your feet, soldier. On your feet.

186
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Stand the fuck up! Come here! [grunts]

187
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,200
Arthur!

188
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,800
No! Enough!

189
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,920
You hear me? Enough!

190
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,400
Enough!

191
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,560
Now you know.

192
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,240
You tell no one else

193
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,360
until I'm gone.

194
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,680
Until you're gone, yeah.

195
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,160
[Arthur breathing heavily]

196
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,560
When the time comes, I'll call you.

197
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,560
I'll tell you where. It'll be a wagon.

198
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,760
Fuck your wagon!

199
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,280
You light the flame.

200
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,840
You bring Charlie
and Curly and no one else.

201
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,120
Get drunk.

202
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,960
Rake the ashes for silver and gold.

203
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,400
Fuck you!

204
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
And your fucking plans!

205
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,600
That time I did let you fucking win.

206
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,560
[groans]

207
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,440
John.

208
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,120
[glass thuds]

209
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,280
[Arthur] Fuck you, John.

210
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,000
[sobbing] Fucking both of you.

211
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,640
Arthur. Arthur.

212
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:11,760
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

213
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,680
-Let me see your eyes.
-I'm clean, man.

214
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,640
The dragon's fucking gone.

215
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,240
Thanks to you.
Fucking thanks to you. [sobs]

216
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,520
[emotional music playing]

217
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,400
You all right? Come on.

218
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,520
You're fucking...

219
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,680
Hey, I am still fucking here.
Pull yourself together, come on.

220
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
We have work to do.

221
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
Come on!

222
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,560
[indistinct shouting]

223
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,200
[door opens]

224
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,320
[door closes]

225
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,520
[footsteps approaching]

226
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,120
Are you sure you want Billy?
I had to shut up the shop.

227
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,240
[Tommy] Yes. We want Billy.

228
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,120
[Arthur] Sit down, Billy.

229
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,000
Thank you for inviting me, Mr Shelby.

230
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,600
[Arthur] Good to see you again.

231
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,880
[Finn] No.

232
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,920
Mary says not until after six o'clock.

233
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,040
He said to tell his father
he feels okay about it.

234
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,080
[Tommy] Good.

235
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,079
Shut the door, Duke.

236
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Now, we are all gathered, and those...

237
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,400
[in Romani] who know the truth...

238
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,960
will know to be cautious.

239
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,760
[in English] Apologies, Mr Shelby,
I still don't speak the lingo.

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,800
[Tommy] Well, Finn here
never even bothered to learn it.

241
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,680
I heard <i>"tachipen".</i> Truth.

242
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,000
You said something about the truth.

243
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,960
[Tommy] Truth. The truth is

244
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,880
I called men here that I could trust

245
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,840
because I will be going away.

246
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,160
I have to collect payment
for a shipment of goods

247
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,000
which left Liverpool ten days ago.

248
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
[Finn] Payment from who?

249
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,520
[Tommy] South Boston Irish, Finn.

250
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,880
Bootleggers.

251
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,640
Are you going alone?

252
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,680
Johnny Dogs already sailed for Canada.

253
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
Michael will be there.

254
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,440
Michael is family.

255
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
And Michael will be
my guarantee of safety.

256
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,800
While I'm away, I have a job for you all.

257
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,160
I need you to go to Arrow House.

258
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,320
I will be leaving Arrow House for good.
And there are things that need removing.

259
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,840
I need men that I can trust.

260
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
There is cash. There is valuables.

261
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,960
There's information about important people
that has more value than gold.

262
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,280
There are also
bodies buried on the grounds

263
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,520
which need digging up
before the contractors start moving earth.

264
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Isiah, you'll be in charge.

265
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,960
In Arrow House, there is a wine cellar.

266
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,880
In that wine cellar,
there are fine French wines

267
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,880
that are worth more than a man's life.

268
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,240
You're welcome to them, boys.
It'll be like a...

269
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,920
Like a farewell party.

270
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,160
You ready for the party, son?

271
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,320
[in Romani] I know the truth.

272
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
[Finn in English] <i>"Tachipen".</i>

273
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
The fucking truth again.

274
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,440
What truth?

275
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,120
You'll need shovels, you'll need boxes

276
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,080
and you'll take the bones to Mr Patches
to put in the furnace at Greenhams.

277
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,200
Got it?

278
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,000
All right. Any questions?

279
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,440
Yeah. If it's a party, can we bring girls?
[chuckles]

280
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,080
[Tommy] No, Billy.

281
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,720
All the fun will be laid on for you.

282
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,800
So when is the party, Tom?

283
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Mr Shelby.

284
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,200
Party's next Sunday, Billy.

285
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
You mean this Sunday?

286
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,080
Yeah.

287
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,720
[Arthur] While you're digging
fucking holes,

288
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,440
I'll be here
drinking champagne with my wife.

289
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,240
It's our wedding anniversary.

290
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,880
Right.

291
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,080
[Tommy] Oh, and, Finn...

292
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,720
By the way, please explain to, um...

293
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,640
What's her name?

294
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,800
-[Finn] Mary.
-Mary?

295
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,120
-[Finn] Yes.
-Is it Mary?

296
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,680
Please explain to Mary
that you are a Shelby.

297
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,800
It says it here on the back
of your watch. Have a look. Shelby.

298
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,840
Look.

299
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,360
This means you own the watch,
the watch doesn't own you.

300
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,760
The clock strikes six
when you fucking tell it to.

301
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,640
Have a whiskey.

302
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,960
Enjoy the party, boys.

303
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,760
[jazz music playing]

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,840
[Gina sighs]

305
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,800
You want a drink, baby?

306
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,720
No.

307
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,480
-Drinking water like Tommy, huh?
-[sighs]

308
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,280
Until this thing is done,
I need a clear head.

309
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,200
[liquid pours]

310
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,360
[telephone ringing]

311
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,240
Leave it.

312
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Yeah.

313
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,360
Good.

314
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
That's good.

315
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,120
Look, I've got to go.

316
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Good news, Michael.

317
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,280
Listen.

318
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,640
That was our informant in Birmingham.

319
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,880
The Shelby men
will all be together on Sunday.

320
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,960
But Arthur will be
having dinner with his wife

321
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,760
at the bar at The Garrison Tavern.

322
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,400
As I recall, the Shelby table
is right next to the windows, correct?

323
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,360
Every table's a Shelby table.

324
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,400
Yes, but...

325
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,680
Maybe our people could just drive by

326
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,280
and shoot Arthur through the glass
without even getting out of the car.

327
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,800
Michael.

328
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,000
We've talked about this.
There's no other choice.

329
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,640
This business is between me and Tommy.

330
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,560
Yes.

331
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,040
And when you kill Tommy,
Arthur will come after you.

332
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,680
He has to die too.

333
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,960
If Arthur's in a bar, he'll be drunk.

334
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Or worse.

335
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
At least he'll die without pain. [sighs]

336
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,240
[lighter clicking]

337
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,080
Who'll do the killing?

338
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,960
Tommy's working with a faction of the IRA.

339
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,880
Connor has connections.

340
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
They made a deal.

341
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,360
A favour in return for guns.

342
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,200
But, Michael...

343
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,000
whilst the assassin's in the city...

344
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,000
Tommy has a son.

345
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,160
He's a kid.

346
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,800
Kids grow up.

347
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,960
We don't kill women
and we don't kill kids.

348
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,960
The informant also mentioned
a new boy named Duke.

349
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,960
Do you want a fucking bloodbath, Gina?

350
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,640
I know about the new boy.

351
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,360
I've decided that the illegitimate son
is not a threat. My decision.

352
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Only Arthur.

353
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Michael, baby.

354
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,720
Everything's been agreed.

355
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,760
[cigarette fizzles]

356
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,120
Everybody wants the same things.

357
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,960
How many men do you think
they killed with bullets and blades?

358
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
[Michael sighs]

359
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,560
That's how Tommy became king.

360
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,640
And in three days' time,

361
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,880
that's how you will become king.

362
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,200
Deep down, Arthur and Tommy
wanna be dead anyway.

363
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,400
On Sunday, we'll just...

364
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,120
give them what they want.

365
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,640
[tense music playing]

366
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,880
[footsteps approaching]

367
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,800
[door opens]

368
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,760
[door closes]

369
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,520
[Diana] Oswald was called away.

370
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,920
He sent me instead.

371
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,320
Actually, that's not true.

372
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,920
I sent Oswald away and elected myself
to be his representative.

373
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,800
What was it you wanted?

374
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,760
[Tommy] I'm planning on bringing
my housing bill before Parliament.

375
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,160
You'll need to start drawing up a list

376
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,080
of all your land-owning families
with gambling debts, drug addictions,

377
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,240
any other drain on their resources.

378
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,680
I will deliver offers
to buy the surplus land

379
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,640
using treasury bonds.

380
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,360
Thomas, why don't we fuck here.

381
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,120
On these benches.

382
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,520
Right now.

383
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,880
We wouldn't be the first.

384
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,040
I hear your wife left you.

385
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,720
Over the last few months,
I've had some associates of mine

386
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
break into some of your pals' houses.

387
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,240
They stole paperwork.

388
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Letters, bills, bank statements...

389
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,520
Are you not upset?

390
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,080
[clicks tongue]

391
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,360
This is a list

392
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,040
of all land-owning families
facing foreclosure.

393
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,680
[Tommy sighs]

394
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,440
And to answer your question...

395
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,000
No.

396
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,040
No, I am not upset that my wife left me.

397
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,480
And, yeah, if you want to fuck, I'll fuck.

398
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,000
But you'll have to cross the floor
'cause I refuse to fuck on Tory benches.

399
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,400
Mr Shelby.

400
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,640
I was going to have this delivered to you,
but I decided to bring it in person.

401
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,280
It's an invitation
to mine and Diana's wedding.

402
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,520
It's in Berlin.

403
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,200
We're going to get married
in the presence of the Führer himself.

404
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,320
Were you having fun?

405
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,760
Making paper aeroplanes.

406
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,840
I'm afraid... [sighs] I have business.
I will be in Canada.

407
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
Pity.

408
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,360
Oh, and, uh...

409
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,720
the other reason I wanted to...
bring this in person

410
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,480
was to tell you that after our wedding,
you must understand, Mr Shelby,

411
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,520
that if you so much
as look in my wife's direction,

412
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,560
I will have you killed.

413
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,160
Come, Diana.

414
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Just think,

415
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,680
very soon, crumbling old institutions
like this one will be swept away

416
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,840
and become a thing of ancient memory.

417
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Fly safe.

418
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,120
[sighs]

419
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,280
[inaudible conversation]

420
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,160
Be careful with this baby.

421
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,920
You see any potholes,

422
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,040
you drive round them.

423
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,200
[engine starts]

424
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,400
[Frances] Mr Shelby called to say
to expect you.

425
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,440
Yeah, we've come to do a bit of gardening.

426
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,160
We're hearing so many rumours
about what's happening to the house.

427
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,160
Tommy says your second-best quality,
after your baking,

428
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,720
is you don't ask questions.

429
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,680
Get everybody away
from the house until Monday.

430
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,680
Okay. Let's find these bottles of wine
worth more than a man's life.

431
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,800
[glasses clinking]

432
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,920
There's only one guest here.

433
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,320
The rest of the rooms are free
if you want to use them while you wait.

434
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,240
Our friend will be here
by the time it gets dark.

435
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,920
There was a storm last night.

436
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Last of a hurricane.

437
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,120
Boats all came in.

438
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,960
He's not coming by boat,
he's coming by plane.

439
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,160
Then your friend is dead. Wind was like...

440
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,400
[imitates wind howling]

441
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,640
Maybe God's done your job for you, Mickey.

442
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,640
My name is not fucking Mickey,
there is no fucking God

443
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,120
and Tommy will be here.

444
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,760
Another one.

445
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760

-Hey. Hey.
-[Finn coughs and sniffs]

465

What the fuck is this? I thought
it was meant to be a fucking party, lads.

466

It is, now you're here.

467

[hesitates] Where's the fucking booze?

468
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
[Duke] In the kitchen.

469
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,560
All the booze is in the kitchen.

470
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,280
[Billy] All right.

471

[Lazarus] God gives a man wealth,
possessions and honour.

But God steps in and says,
"No! This is grievous, mindless evil!"

In heaven, looking down.

the fucking lights on?

[Isiah] There's no longer any power
in the house of Thomas Shelby.

[Finn] Why not?
What do you mean? What happened?

480
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,600
[Billy] I thought
there would be girls here.

481

[Duke] Who need girls
when you're in a house bound for hell?

We can do whatever we want in this house.

It's got a death sentence.

[scoffs]

490
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,719
I don't want a drink. I want to go
dig up those fucking bodies, yeah?

491
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,600
-Billy?
-Yeah.

492
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,400
Got to wait until
all the bodies are buried

493
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,320
before you start digging them back up.

494
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,320
What the fuck does that mean?

495
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,719
I'm a fucking Shelby.

496
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
So am I.

497
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320

Step back and give me
a bit of light there, boys.

That's at exactly 16:20.

503
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,920
Everyone got that?

504
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
I'll do it.

505
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
This is between me and Tommy.

506
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,360
I'll do it with my own hand.

507
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,360
I'll come with you.

508
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,680
Yeah, don't slam any doors.

It's just a pity you didn't have the guts
to shoot him face-to-face.

513
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,920
My mother was a Gypsy. She saw the future.

514
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,680
She always said it won't be
a bullet that will kill Tommy Shelby.

[Connor] Hey, lads.

[Duke] Take the gun, Finn.

522
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,720
Arthur says if you don't do it

523
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
then you can
walk away from this family for good.

524
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,720
What the fuck do you know about family?

525
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,440
You're not family.

526
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,440
You're the son of a fucking whore.

527
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,360
[Duke] Just take the gun and do it, Finn.

528
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,520
[Billy whimpering] Take the fucking gun.

529
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,680
Now you have the gun, Finn.

530
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,120
<i>You</i> have the gun.

531
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
Use it on these fucks.

[Duke] Charlie Strong told me,

536
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,680
"When you give Finn the gun,

537
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,480
make sure the first
two chambers are empty." [chuckles]

538

[breath trembling]

540

You are no longer a member
of this Shelby family.

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,680
By order of the Peaky fucking Blinders.

542
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,480
[Finn] I will come for you.

543
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
I will fucking come for you!

them, who govern like dogs

547
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,240
Hear this. Then came Jesus forth,
wearing the crown of thorns

548
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,400
and a purple robe, and Pilate said,

"Behold the man. He is the man."

550
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,160
Not the Peaky Blinders.

551
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,160
We see them in their automobiles,
with their whores...

00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,560

Take you out to the street.
I don't wanna spoil my pub.

You'd shoot us like dogs?

No, I don't shoot dogs.

-No.

No one close to you
makes a choice without your opinion, Tom.

659
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,080
Not Arthur, not me, not Ada.

660
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,840
We can't escape you.

661
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,560
Your lethal hand
is always on our shoulders.

662
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,600
Polly was half of me.

663

[door closes]

668
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,880
[Alfie] I smell the smell
of roasting Irishmen.

669
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,920
Oh, yes. Hello.

670
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,200
-[playing piano]
-I also smell the smell of tobacco.

671
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,400
Which is forbidden
in my presence for all except for one,

672
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,360
my new wife, Edna.

673
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,680
The Irish being rendered smoke and fat,

674
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,440
I now own half of Boston.

675
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,440
So, out of respect
for my restored authority,

676
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,640
put the fucking cigarette out now, Tommy.

677
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,680
Hello, Alfie.

678
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,960
I heard it was a good wedding.

679
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,760
Yeah it was, actually. Thank you.

680
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,520
Edna's from a family circus.

681
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,280
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

682
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,360
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants.

683
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,760
Yeah. It was quite a thing.

684
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,720
They had to shut down Camden High Street,

685

and even the gentile,
what normally fucking hate me,

00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,080
they waved with their hankies.

687
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,520
Justice.

688
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,360
And housekeeping.

689
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,480
Long overdue.

690
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,240
Yeah, look at that little cunt ascending,
he is ascending to the heavens.

691
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,680
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

692
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,840
And I can see with this eye.
I'm not blind.

693
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,840
This eye is the eye of a dead man.
Dead men can see through life

694
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,640
like it was a curtain that billows
with the flicker of truth upon it.

695

And I can see with this eye, Tommy,

696
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,040
that your nephew is ascending
and he will be forgiven.

697

Unlike you,

as part of the deal,

I'm not going to die in bed, Alfie.
Who fucking dies in bed?

Good people die in their bed, Tommy.

-Good people, eh?
-Mmm.

And yet here we are, Alfie.

Tommy, if you are about to
express profound emotion,

728
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,040
you might be better served expressing it
to someone who gives a fuck.

729
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,920
Or perhaps to somebody
who is being paid to pretend to have to.

730
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,040
Like a fucking nurse or a priest. Someone.

731
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,840
And, as for death,

732
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,360
speaking as someone
who has been dead for a number of years,

733
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,360
I can only heartily recommend it.

Well, at least I can say that, er,

01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,680
I am one of those rare politicians
who actually makes good on his promises.

744

Country estate,

745
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,040
requisitioned to make way
for houses for working people.

746
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,880
I improved my own home
with good intentions

Now I'm back where we began.

749

With horses and caravans...

01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,960
vagabonds and thieves.

Frances, sit down, please.

752
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,240
I'd like to raise a toast.

753
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,080
A simple toast.

754
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,440
-To family.
-[man] To family.

755

Sometimes,

756
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,120
it is shelter from the storm.

757
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,720
Sometimes, it is the storm itself.

758

Planning on going away for a bit.

759

in this family,

762
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,800
it was you who was
born to be a politician, not me.

763
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,960
Remember that.

764
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,320
And if ever a seat is to become available
in this ugly old city, you should run.

[Tommy] Where's Arthur?

767
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,560
[Linda] He went for a walk down the river.

768
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,040
He said he's not good at farewells,
so he decided to go catch a trout instead.

769
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,200
He told me to tell you that...

"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be."

"Very soon."

How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?
