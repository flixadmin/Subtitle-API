1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,725
- Previously on Gotham...
- On the count of three,

2
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:05,630
instead of telling me who you love,

3
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:07,535
- tell me who to kill.
- Kill Lee.

4
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:10,913
You chose Lee because you love Vale.

5
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:12,915
If a person comes into
contact with my blood,

6
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:14,083
it changes them.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,522
Listen to me! I would never
do anything to hurt you.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,623
Kristen.

9
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:21,824
No!

10
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:23,159
You wanted to save Lee.

11
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:24,894
You knew he would do the opposite.

12
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:27,029
You love Lee, which means we're done.

13
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:29,098
I have found someone. I have no choice

14
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,267
- but to confess my feelings to Ed.
- Da.

15
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,369
Is this about the test they're
running on Alice Tetch's blood?

16
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:35,805
Yes. The rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies...

17
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:38,007
- Violent rage.
- I assume they're, uh,

18
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,075
working on a cure.

19
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:40,643
Yes, but it could take years.

20
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:41,577
Nobody move!

21
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,312
What is going on?

22
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,047
I'm afraid your evening
has been hijacked.

23
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:48,217
Glasses down!

24
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,653
Is that my dear sister I see?

25
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:52,121
She's in you, isn't she?

26
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,990
- Miss Kringle?
- No, my name's Isabella.

27
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:55,558
You remind me of someone
that I used to know.

28
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:56,526
I met someone.

29
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:58,194
I think I'm in love.

30
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,329
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

31
00:01:00,397 --> 00:01:01,531
Welcome back, Detective.

32
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:17,907
GCPD! Hands in the air!

33
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,443
Back away, slowly.

34
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:24,180
This ain't what it looks like.

35
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:26,382
Explain it to me down at the precinct.

36
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,185
For now, you'd be wise
to keep your mouth shu...

37
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:38,260
Listen, uh, can we talk about this?

38
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,564
Be reasonable, man.

39
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,467
Look, I didn't kill anybody, okay?

40
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:47,303
I'm the cleaner, that's it.

41
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:49,338
You're just the cleaner.

42
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,674
Yeah.

43
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,809
You're just the guy
who chops up the bodies

44
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:55,778
and dumps them in a vat of acid.

45
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:57,079
That's it.

46
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:03,252
What are you doing, man?

47
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,555
Just... take me in, okay?

48
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,090
Oh, I'll bet that's what you want.

49
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:10,259
For me to read you your rights,

50
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:11,594
make sure you get a lawyer.

51
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:14,063
Two, three years from now,
I see you on some corner,

52
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:15,598
free as a bird.

53
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,134
Any other night, yeah.

54
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:22,438
It would eat at me,
but, yeah, I'd do it.

55
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:24,440
Not tonight.

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,920
The Toad.

57
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,411
He-he's the one you
want. He gave me the job.

58
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:31,087
See, something's gotten into me.

59
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,315
When I see a scumbag like you,

60
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:35,518
my blood starts boiling in my veins.

61
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:38,587
I just want to punish
you, make you suffer.

62
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,858
Up until now, I've been
able to control it.

63
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:46,262
But it's getting stronger inside of me.

64
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,753
Please.

65
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:49,966
The Toad, I told you.

66
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,601
He's the one.

67
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,102
Just arrest me.

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,337
Arrest me!

69
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:55,571
We're past that.

70
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,006
Please!

71
00:03:57,074 --> 00:04:02,302

72
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,019
Morning.

73
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:06,554
We knew what we were
getting into, right?

74
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,156
When we agreed to let my dad
throw us an engagement party?

75
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,726
Oh, we knew.

76
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,029
I mean, who are these people?

77
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,197
He's very proud of you.

78
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,399
And he wants all of Gotham to know that.

79
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,001
Well, he succeeded, 'cause
he invited most of the city.

80
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:23,671
How are you so okay with this?

81
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,606
Because I agree with him.

82
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:28,008
He should be proud. As am I.

83
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,679
How did I get so lucky?

84
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:40,054
What is it?

85
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:45,659
James Gordon is returning to the GCPD.

86
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:49,514
- When?
- He starts today.

87
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:54,702
Um... how long have you known this?

88
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:55,703
A few days.

89
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,228
I'm sorry, I should
have told you sooner.

90
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,243
It's fine.

91
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,311
Is it?

92
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,480
I don't know, Lee.

93
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,415
We agreed he wouldn't
be part of our lives.

94
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,317
A-And now you're gonna
be working with him?

95
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:11,819
That's a part of our lives.

96
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,220
Do you trust me?

97
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:14,588
Because if you do,

98
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,590
then nothing else matters.

99
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,660
Of course I trust you.

100
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,462
And you're right, you're right,

101
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,431
it's all gonna be okay. It's just...

102
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,966
when I think about what
happened with Tetch,

103
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,369
a-and the things that Gordon said, I...

104
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:29,938
So, don't think about it.

105
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:32,906
I'll try.

106
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:36,377
But if you accidentally shot him...

107
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:37,878
I'd be okay with that, too.

108
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,546
No promises.

109
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:42,613
See you tonight.

110
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,254
Yeah.

111
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,462
Lock this bum up.

112
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:03,937
Hey, hey, hey!

113
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:05,372
There you are.

114
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,975
We got a call. Warehouse
district. You coming?

115
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,710
That's it? No "welcome back"?

116
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,046
Please. If we had a big to-do
every time you came back

117
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:14,281
to the GCPD, we'd never
catch any bad guys.

118
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:15,182
Ándale, partner.

119
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,451
Oh, and, uh,

120
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,353
I believe this...

121
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,788
belongs to you.

122
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:24,591
You coming or what?

123
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,727
Yeah, I'm coming.

124
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:32,833
What must be broken
before it can be used?

125
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,068
Eggs.

126
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,003
Correct! As always.

127
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:42,176
Oh, Edward, you spoil me.

128
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,777
You make it easy.

129
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,648
I'm gonna miss you.

130
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:50,084
I'm only gone two days.

131
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,952
Well, actually, your conference

132
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,722
ends at 1:45 on Monday.

133
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,092
With traffic, that puts
you in at 5:30 into Gotham.

134
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,493
If you leave on time today,

135
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,995
which I'm sure that you will... Mm-hmm.

136
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:03,797
You'll be gone for 44
and one half hours.

137
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,400
Less than two days.

138
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,665
I will hold on to that thought.

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,306
Cream! I forgot your cream.

140
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:13,640
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

141
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:17,673
So what does one do at a
librarian's conference?

142
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,647
It would bore you.

143
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:24,931
Nothing that you would say,
do or think could bore me.

144
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,056
In that case, let me
read you my schedule.

145
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:30,557
Ooh!

146
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,017
Where did those glasses come from?

147
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:40,293
These?

148
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,070
These are my backup pair.
I normally wear contacts.

149
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:44,872
I thought you knew that.

150
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:47,808
Something wrong?

151
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:53,414
Edward, what is it?

152
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:56,049
You look like you've seen a ghost.

153
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:58,085
Excuse me.

154
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,966
It's just a pair of glasses.

155
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:18,272
I remember you loved that style on me.

156
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,778
Oh, dear.

157
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,215
I haven't upset you, have I, Ed?

158
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,118
I would've thought you
would've been used to

159
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,520
seeing people in mirrors.

160
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:35,155
You're just in my head.

161
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,090
Like that makes a difference.

162
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,828
But honestly, besides the fact
that she looks just like me,

163
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,498
you went from someone who files
papers in a police station

164
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,501
to someone who files books in a library.

165
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,036
Not super original.

166
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:50,938
You and Isabella are...

167
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,575
you're somewhat different.

168
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:57,377
Well, I'm dead.

169
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,712
And she's alive.

170
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,482
But how long will that last?

171
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,518
Until you...

172
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,119
I...

173
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,123
I would never hurt Isabella.

174
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:13,835
Bet you would've said
the same thing about me.

175
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,864
Face it, Ed.

176
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,565
You're a killer.

177
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,802
It's only a matter of time before...

178
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,327
Okay, so, a uni I.D.'d the vic.

179
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:37,497
One Paulie Penopolus,
aka Paulie Pennies.

180
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:39,298
Cleanup guy for the Gotham underworld.

181
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,667
Bingo. I'm thinking it was
some kind of business deal.

182
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:43,102
Maybe an unhappy customer.

183
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,804
Perhaps a competitor.

184
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:46,005
Good place to start.

185
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:47,601
Hey, listen, seriously, Jim...

186
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:50,576
I'm glad you're back.

187
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,011
Me too, Harv.

188
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,379
Feels good.

189
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,717
This wasn't just business.

190
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,169
We should call Barnes.

191
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:30,383
You know why I'm here.

192
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:33,786
Oh, yes.

193
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,993
Yes, indeed.

194
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,126
She's in there, isn't she?

195
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:40,808
Inside of you.

196
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,600
Hello, sister dear.

197
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,040
Just tell me.

198
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:58,749
You grew up with your sister.

199
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:01,418
You've seen this virus firsthand.

200
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,554
How do I beat it?

201
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,521
Hmm.

202
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,657
I believe

203
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:09,093
the way this works is...

204
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,390
you give me something,
I give you something.

205
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:13,937
Ticktock.

206
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:16,000
How's about I let you keep your teeth?!

207
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:16,734
Or...

208
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,435
my sister's virus

209
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:19,870
is a beautiful thing.

210
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,740
It makes the darkest
parts of a person sing.

211
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,944
What darkness in you...

212
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:30,647
has Alice brought to life?

213
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:32,316
Tell me that,

214
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,485
and I'll tell you everything I know.

215
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:43,861
Criminals.

216
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,231
The guilty.

217
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,700
My anger at them.

218
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:53,137
Oh, but it's not anger I see.

219
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:57,408
Rage.

220
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,476
Violent, bloody

221
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,712
rage.

222
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,816
All right, Tetch, my turn.

223
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,652
Is there a cure?

224
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,758
Yes.

225
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:17,094
There is a cure.

226
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:18,862
What is it?

227
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:21,732
You give in,

228
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,468
and let my dear sister win!

229
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,370
You think I'm playing?!

230
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:27,671
Have you heard the voices?

231
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,640
What voices?

232
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,676
The virus, even as it grows
stronger, waxes and wanes.

233
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:34,845
You may have the illusion

234
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,914
you're winning.

235
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,916
Then you hear the voices.

236
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:44,088
Those dark voices from deep within you,

237
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:47,558
whispering... whispering...

238
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
and finally,

239
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:53,764
you'll see the world as it really is.

240
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:57,634
Then there will be no
more Captain Barnes,

241
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,736
only Alice.

242
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,407
My dear Alice.

243
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:04,875
You don't know me!

244
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:07,344
You've dirtied your hands, haven't you?

245
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:11,215
And now you're desperately
trying to make it right.

246
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,752
I can make it right.

247
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:31,301
You're back.

248
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,705
I'm back.

249
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,040
I suppose it was only a matter of time.

250
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:40,177
Once a cop, always a cop.

251
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:52,589
For better or worse,
this is where I belong.

252
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,648
- How's Vale?
- Good. I think.

253
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,461
She's out of the hospital, anyway.

254
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,030
- You two are not...?
- No.

255
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,788
I'm not trying to make this awkward.

256
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:07,824
Why would it be? We're both adults.

257
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:09,493
There's no reason we
can't work together.

258
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:11,094
I'm glad you feel that way.

259
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:12,329
Mario agrees?

260
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:15,234
He will. Eventually.

261
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,800
Right.

262
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,869
Our engagement party is tonight.

263
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:21,947
I only bring it up because
a few people here are going.

264
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:24,575
Now it's awkward, isn't it?

265
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:25,943
A little.

266
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,678
You want to know about the two bodies

267
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:29,413
that, uh, were found this morning.

268
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,681
Yes.

269
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,082
I've only done the
preliminary examination,

270
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,586
but the John Doe in the acid,
his face had been removed.

271
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:37,788
Removed? How?

272
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,089
Scalpel? Razor blade?

273
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,058
Whoever did it knew exactly
what they were doing.

274
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,393
I'll have more for you soon.

275
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:44,461
Jim.

276
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:49,066
I think you made the right
decision coming back.

277
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:03,647
I know this doesn't exactly look like

278
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:05,816
"just business," but
right now we're thinking

279
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:07,684
whoever paid Paulie Pennies
to dispose of the body

280
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:09,786
in the bathtub, also
might have killed him

281
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,488
to tie up some loose ends.

282
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,190
Uh-huh.

283
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:17,995
Jim. Good to see you
with a shield again.

284
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:19,062
And a tie.

285
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,397
Captain, good to be back.

286
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:21,999
Bullock was just filling me in.

287
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,927
Hell of one to catch on your first day.

288
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:24,989
Yeah.

289
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,537
That's the preliminary report from Lee.

290
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:30,374
John Doe had his face removed.

291
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:33,844
- Trying to cover up his identity?
- Yeah, maybe.

292
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,545
But the acid would
have done that anyway.

293
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:38,148
I'm running point on this one.

294
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:40,517
- That's cool.
- Honestly, Cap...

295
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,654
Look, I know I've been away...

296
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:44,821
Maybe that's why

297
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,257
you've forgotten how
things go around here.

298
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,393
I give you an order and you follow it.

299
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,795
Which, for the record,
Captain, I totally support.

300
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:54,765
I'm taking point on this,
not giving you the day off.

301
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:57,067
Follow the physical evidence, Bullock.

302
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,769
Report back to me.

303
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,804
Aye, aye.

304
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,706
Jim.

305
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,578
I didn't mean to bite your head off.

306
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:11,948
It's just, sometimes the
ugliness here gets to me.

307
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,016
No need to explain.

308
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,584
Let me know if you need anything.

309
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:17,020
And, uh...

310
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:20,757
don't let the bastards
haze you too hard, rookie.

311
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,759
Yes, sir.

312
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:26,129
Gordon.

313
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:27,764
Here's the one you wanted, Captain.

314
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:30,133
Uh, mid-level felon, goes by "The Toad."

315
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:33,336
Yeah, that's him. Thank you.

316
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,654
Maybe she's right.

317
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:52,923
What if there's something
about Miss Kringle's...

318
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,759
Kristen's... Isabella's face?

319
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,828
What if there's something
about her face that

320
00:16:57,895 --> 00:16:59,663
unlocks this side of me?

321
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:01,765
What if I do hurt her?

322
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:04,735
Oswald.

323
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,637
- Yes?
- You're smiling.

324
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,607
- I was?
- Yes.

325
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:11,908
Oh.

326
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:15,098
Well, I was just thinking...

327
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,282
how darned lucky Isabella is.

328
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,686
You love her, yet to protect her,

329
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,555
you are willing to break up with her.

330
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,157
Beautiful.

331
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,593
Sad, but beautiful.

332
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,308
So you think I should break up with her?

333
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,297
I'm sorry, I thought that's
what we were talking about.

334
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,832
Certainly, I would never pressure...

335
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,801
No, you're right.

336
00:17:41,572 --> 00:17:44,007
If I did hurt her, I would
never forgive myself.

337
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,278
That life would put
her in your path again,

338
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:51,114
only to snatch her from you. Why?

339
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:52,582
I can't do it.

340
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,481
- What?
- I can't break up with her.

341
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,187
But you said yourself...

342
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:59,022
I need you to do it for me.

343
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:01,792
Would you do that?

344
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,728
I would be forever in your debt.

345
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:07,697
Just be gentle.

346
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,702
Of course.

347
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:27,951
I'm looking for a punk who supposedly

348
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,619
frequents this rat hole.

349
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,756
Goes by "The Toad."

350
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,758
Who's askin'?

351
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:43,700
Captain Nathaniel Barnes of the GCPD.

352
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:45,669
How about you and I go
down to the precinct,

353
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:48,572
and you can answer some questions?

354
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:49,773
Blow, pig.

355
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:08,191
I want to know about Paulie Pennies!

356
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:10,293
The body he was getting
rid of last night...

357
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:12,629
Where did it come from?!

358
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,432
Maybe you want me to
open that mouth for you.

359
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:17,200
Okay, stop.

360
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:18,368
I-I hired Paulie.

361
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:19,870
But I'm just a go-between.

362
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:22,505
I'm so sick of hearing that.

363
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:24,841
No one's responsible for anything.

364
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:26,042
Everyone's a middleman.

365
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,911
I want a name!

366
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,580
Symon, okay? Dr. Symon.

367
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:33,116
He's a big-time plastic surgeon.

368
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:36,753
So what, he likes cutting
people's faces off for kicks?

369
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:37,988
- Try again!
- No.

370
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,823
He's got a side business.

371
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:42,292
You get in trouble, you need a new face,

372
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,128
he gives you one.

373
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:46,329
A new face?

374
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:47,797
- Whose?
- I don't know.

375
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:49,766
I just get rid of the
bodies, that's all.

376
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:56,706
You think

377
00:19:56,774 --> 00:19:58,642
you're not guilty,

378
00:19:58,709 --> 00:19:59,809
but you are.

379
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,077
Stop, okay, stop!

380
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:03,046
It's Symon!

381
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:05,749
He's the one you want.

382
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,684
You're a cop.

383
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:14,190
Symon, huh?

384
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,792
Take me to him.

385
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:29,520
Mayor Cobblepot?

386
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:31,923
Hello, Isabella. May I?

387
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,459
Um, of course.

388
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,985
Going somewhere?

389
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:48,220
Just for a couple nights.

390
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:50,954
But I was hoping to talk
to Ed before I left.

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,927
Um, tried calling him. Is he okay?

392
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:57,334
Hmm. Yes.

393
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:58,936
How shall I put this?

394
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:02,839
It's over.

395
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,042
Excuse me?

396
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:06,777
He is not going to see you anymore.

397
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:09,079
Do not try to contact him.

398
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:10,781
That door is closed.

399
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:13,450
Have a nice life.

400
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,991
Oh, my.

401
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,993
It is a shock.

402
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:24,595
But besides your...

403
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:27,702
odd resemblance to his ex...

404
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:30,901
a certain facility with riddles...

405
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,038
compulsion for order...

406
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:37,674
what is it that you two
really have in common?

407
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:40,877
Edward is a person of
exceptional intelligence

408
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:42,346
and imagination.

409
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:45,816
He deserves to be appreciated
by someone on his own level.

410
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:47,484
And you,

411
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:50,654
my dear, are simply not.

412
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,457
Best to end things now.

413
00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:56,026
You're right.

414
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:59,196
I don't deserve him.

415
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:01,632
Glad we agree.

416
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,200
Bye.

417
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:04,758
But I'm not gonna let him go.

418
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:10,123
He loves me. And I love him.

419
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:15,212
Do you know how rare that is, Mr. Mayor?

420
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,354
Of course you do.

421
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:24,590
Because you love him, too.

422
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,327
I can see it.

423
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:31,030
I'm not even jealous.

424
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:33,499
I-I don't think that you understand...

425
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,401
It was my glasses this morning.

426
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,103
They reminded him of Miss Kringle.

427
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,740
He's afraid he's going to
hurt me like he hurt her.

428
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,779
Listen to me, you little idiot,

429
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:49,315
I am telling you one last time,

430
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:53,452
- let... Ed... go.
- No.

431
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,653
I will write to him.

432
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:57,590
I will make him understand
he has nothing to fear.

433
00:22:57,657 --> 00:23:00,026
I'm not gonna let him go.

434
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,597
Very well.

435
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,900
Don't say I didn't warn you.

436
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,718
You better not have been lying to me.

437
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:27,820
I'm not. This is his place.

438
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:30,222
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

439
00:23:31,992 --> 00:23:34,026
I'm trying.

440
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:40,380
I'm about to take the face.

441
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:42,849
Be here in an hour, and
we can do the transplant.

442
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:46,653
You haven't eaten today, have you?

443
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:49,222
Very good.

444
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,224
I have to thank you, my dear,

445
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,593
for taking such care of your skin.

446
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,563
Excellent elasticity.

447
00:23:56,631 --> 00:24:00,066
Now hold still.

448
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:08,074
Who's there?!

449
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,545
Quiet. Or we'll forgo any anesthesia.

450
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:14,447
I said, who's there?

451
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:16,449
GCPD.

452
00:24:16,517 --> 00:24:17,817
You're under arrest.

453
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:18,985
Go for it.

454
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:21,588
Please.

455
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,284
I surrender.

456
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:28,999
Ma'am, you all right?

457
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:44,136
How many?

458
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:45,137
Excuse me?

459
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:46,438
How many have you killed?!

460
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:47,772
How many faces have you taken?

461
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:52,077
I have the right to an attorney.

462
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,845
I wish to invoke

463
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:55,547
that right... now.

464
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:58,984
Guilty.Guilty.

465
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:01,086
Who's there?! Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

466
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:03,522
No one. It's only me.

467
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,924
Guilty. He's guilty! Guilty.

468
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:08,660
- Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
- What is wrong with you?

469
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,595
He's guilty. Guilty.

470
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,034
What are you doing?

471
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:17,569
Arrest me.

472
00:25:17,637 --> 00:25:20,639
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

473
00:25:20,706 --> 00:25:22,908
- I'm not resisting!
- Guilty!

474
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:25,310
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

475
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:27,112
Guilty. He's guilty.

476
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,614
Guilty.

477
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:33,852
The point Dr. Thompkins hopes you pay

478
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,688
particular attention to is
the level of strength required

479
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:41,179
to sever Paulie Pennie"
head from his torso.

480
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,195
And what level would that be, Lucius?

481
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:44,449
Extreme.

482
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:46,345
Extreme strength. Got it.

483
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,100
As for the other victim in the
bathtub, we haven't gotten any hits

484
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:51,703
on his prints, but a puncture
mark in his arm suggests

485
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:54,673
he was drugged prior to
having his face removed.

486
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,008
I'll run toxicology, I'll let
you know what I come up with.

487
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:58,143
Thanks, Lucius.

488
00:25:58,211 --> 00:25:59,411
Yep.

489
00:25:59,478 --> 00:26:01,769
It's good to have you back, Gordon.

490
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:04,683
Lucius, you're in
forensics, not the M.E.

491
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,747
Is there a reason Lee
didn't bring this herself?

492
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:11,122
Dr. Thompkins has
already gone for the day.

493
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,724
Her engagement party.

494
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:15,390
Right.

495
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:17,796
I hear it's gonna be quite the affair.

496
00:26:17,863 --> 00:26:18,997
Beautiful women,

497
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,233
free booze, canapés.

498
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,197
- Harvey, you can go if you want.
- Oh, no.

499
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:25,470
I'd much rather spend time
here with my old partner.

500
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:27,105
Much more fun.

501
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:29,007
Besides,

502
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:30,141
I wasn't invited.

503
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,880
Captain!

504
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:36,749
Bullock, book this
piece of human garbage

505
00:26:36,816 --> 00:26:38,751
for the murder of John Doe.

506
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:40,719
You got it, Captain. Come on.

507
00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:43,689
Plastic surgeon.

508
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:45,424
Face man for the underworld.

509
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:48,293
He had a girl on the table.

510
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:50,329
If I had been there
five minutes later...

511
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:51,430
But you weren't.

512
00:26:51,498 --> 00:26:53,332
You did it, Captain.

513
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,034
Yeah.

514
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:56,335
Today.

515
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:02,041
You know that feeling, Jim,
when you've won the battle

516
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:04,076
but you know you're gonna lose the war?

517
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:08,113
Wars are fought one
battle at a time, sir.

518
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:13,452
You said he killed the John Doe?

519
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,088
- Not Paulie Pennies?
- No.

520
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,890
His killer's still out there.

521
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,592
I'll get him tomorrow.

522
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,834
Promise.

523
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:13,467
My father and I haven't
always seen eye to eye.

524
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:18,903
But I think, Dad, you'll agree that...

525
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:22,685
marrying Lee is the best
decision I've ever made.

526
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:25,088
Without a doubt.

527
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:27,056
And Lee.

528
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,726
You're a doctor, a member of our city's

529
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,028
police department.

530
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:35,665
You're funny, compassionate
and brilliant.

531
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:39,068
Despite insisting all dogs are boys

532
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:42,171
and all cats are girls...

533
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,855
it's hopeless, I've
tried to correct her...

534
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,011
I've loved you since
the moment I saw you.

535
00:28:58,222 --> 00:29:00,390
So wonderful.

536
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:02,325
Lee.

537
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,540
Congrats.

538
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:07,029
You look gorgeous. No surprise.

539
00:29:07,097 --> 00:29:08,631
- Barbara. How did you...
- Get in?

540
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:11,134
As a plus one. With that guy there.

541
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:12,435
Hey.

542
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,603
Or it might have been him.

543
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,638
You need to leave, right now.

544
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:17,173
Can't we bury the hatchet?

545
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:20,543
So I came at you with a knife,
kidnapped you, whatever.

546
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:22,445
I've forgiven you for
beating me unconscious.

547
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:23,746
Water under the bridge.

548
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,281
You just stay right here,
I'm gonna get someone.

549
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,040
I'm leaving.

550
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:29,886
Just wanted to ask.

551
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:32,722
As someone else who was
once with Jim Gordon,

552
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,290
don't you miss it?

553
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:35,591
Miss what?

554
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:37,860
The heat.

555
00:29:37,928 --> 00:29:42,598
Being so close to so
much darkness and light,

556
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,934
to someone always at war with himself.

557
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:47,236
Let me think... Tormented Jim Gordon,

558
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:51,207
or Mario, who I know is a good man,

559
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,342
who'll be a wonderful
father to my children,

560
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,710
and whom I love.

561
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,047
No. I don't miss it.

562
00:29:58,115 --> 00:29:59,248
Wow.

563
00:29:59,316 --> 00:30:01,484
I think you actually believe that.

564
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:03,619
It's kind of sad.

565
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:06,923
Tell my dates I've left, would you?

566
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:10,293
Uh-uh.

567
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,495
Don't let her ruin your night.

568
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,430
Captain. I'm so glad you came.

569
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:16,666
I-I can't stay.

570
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,641
I came to congratulate you.

571
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:20,570
You deserve to be happy.

572
00:30:20,637 --> 00:30:22,071
Thank you.

573
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:24,207
But you have to stay
for at least one drink.

574
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:25,174
If nothing else,

575
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,777
to save me from these people.

576
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:29,445
One drink.

577
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,647
- But no work talk.
- Deal.

578
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,018
So, among the materials
confiscated in Symon's lab,

579
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:39,188
I came across a unique
anesthetic cocktail.

580
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,556
Let me guess.

581
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:43,059
The same cocktail toxicology
found in the John Doe.

582
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,594
Exactly.

583
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:47,912
Hey. I got some bad news.

584
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:50,102
- Symon walked.
- What?

585
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:52,568
The girl he had tied up
refused to press charges.

586
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:53,836
They probably paid her off.

587
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:56,506
And we just got an
order from Judge Bam-Bam

588
00:30:56,573 --> 00:30:59,014
demanding his immediate release.

589
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,927
The Botox son of a
bitch is uber-connected.

590
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:05,336
The toxicology definitely ties
Symon to the John Doe murder.

591
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:08,351
We got to get him back here.

592
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,956
Captain Barnes?

593
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,393
Carmine Falcone.

594
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,195
I don't believe we've met.

595
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:20,663
No.

596
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:23,266
But I was just leaving.

597
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,634
I see.

598
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,802
Is my company so odious?

599
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,404
You belong behind bars.

600
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:30,439
I'm retired.

601
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:34,243
After running Gotham's
underworld for 30 years.

602
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:38,748
This city was built
because of men like me.

603
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,983
People have jobs because of men like me.

604
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,386
That whiskey you're drinking?

605
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:44,887
Paid for through my work.

606
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:47,857
So you did some good. So what?

607
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:49,926
Doesn't mean you're above the law.

608
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,327
Nobody is.

609
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:53,663
You know, whenever I hear a man

610
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,498
possessed of such certainty,

611
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:59,168
I always think he's trying
mostly to convince himself.

612
00:32:01,104 --> 00:32:03,940
I wish you a pleasant evening, Captain.

613
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:24,193
Hey, Captain.

614
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:25,595
Alvarez.

615
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:27,997
Tell Gordon I'm bringing
him the man responsible

616
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:30,466
for Paulie Pennies' murder.

617
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,063
No backup.

618
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:34,032
He's coming in of his own accord.

619
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,500
Sure thing, Captain.

620
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:38,770
But you should know, the
judge released Dr. Symon.

621
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:39,904
Captain?

622
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,375
Guilty.

623
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:45,810
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

624
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:47,545
Guilty. Guilty.

625
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:48,346
Guilty!

626
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:50,882
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

627
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,984
Guilty! Guilty.

628
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:54,719
Guilty.

629
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:06,965
Isabella.

630
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:13,238
Isabella, I got your note.

631
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:18,577
I thought you needed to
leave for your conference.

632
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:20,709
I can be late, Edward.

633
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:28,207
This is more important.

634
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,225
Oswa...

635
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:37,062
Oswald...

636
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,731
the mayor, he informed me
of your position, um...

637
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,969
but believe me, I-I think...
our breaking up is for the best.

638
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:47,272
No, Edward, it's not.

639
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,771
I understand your fear. It
comes from a place of love.

640
00:33:51,978 --> 00:33:54,646
I know you won't hurt me.

641
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,817
You never could.

642
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:00,786
I don't think that you...

643
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:05,457
Oh, my...

644
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:07,226
Kristen.

645
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:10,295
I found old photos in newspapers.

646
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:12,664
You have to... I need to leave now.

647
00:34:12,732 --> 00:34:13,999
No, no, no, no, no.

648
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,801
No, no, no, no. Look at me.

649
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,035
Look at me!

650
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:18,437
You don't know what you're doing.

651
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:21,139
I am forcing you to face your fear.

652
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:23,308
You won't hurt me, even
when I look like this.

653
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:25,210
Edward.

654
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:27,346
Edward.

655
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:40,092
No, no, no, no.

656
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,594
No, no, no, no, no.

657
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:52,642
Edward.

658
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,915
Should I take the glasses off?

659
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:04,650
Keep them on.

660
00:35:13,523 --> 00:35:16,392
Seal off the exits, but do it quietly.

661
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:17,660
Last thing anyone wants

662
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,428
- is a scene.
- Yes, sir.

663
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:20,562
Little late for that.

664
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,698
What are you doing here?

665
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:24,733
I'm sorry, but we have to make an arrest

666
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,802
in the Paulie Pennies
case. We tried to get

667
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,370
the guy at home, but his housekeeper

668
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:29,738
said he was here. Just makes you realize

669
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:31,440
what a small town Gotham is, doesn't it?

670
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:32,875
Couldn't you wait?

671
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,443
If he's here, he's not exactly running.

672
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:36,045
She makes a good point, Jim.

673
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:37,413
You want to take that one?

674
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,747
Good evening, everyone.

675
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:41,917
Jim. What's going on?

676
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:44,653
Apparently, there's a murder
suspect among our guests.

677
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:45,821
Can I ask who?

678
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:47,556
Dr. Maxwell Symon.

679
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,458
- He's a...
- Plastic surgeon.

680
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,126
You arrest him, you're
gonna have to fight off

681
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:52,294
every woman here.

682
00:35:52,362 --> 00:35:53,495
He's a favorite.

683
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:55,798
He's also a murderer.

684
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,434
I'd be curious to know
how your father knows him.

685
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,868
I'm sure that their relationship

686
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:01,870
is completely above board.

687
00:36:01,938 --> 00:36:04,573
While you two hash this out,
I'm gonna go grab Symon.

688
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:06,975
- Harvey.
- What? I can handle

689
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:07,976
a plastic surgeon on my own.

690
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:09,244
And don't worry,

691
00:36:09,312 --> 00:36:11,347
discretion is my middle name.

692
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:16,418
Lee, I'd like a word with Jim.

693
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:18,420
- Mario...
- It'll be fine.

694
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:20,589
Okay.

695
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:36,572
Look, Mario, I have a job to do,

696
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,340
so whatever this is...

697
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:40,275
When you told Tetch to kill Lee,

698
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:41,877
you knew he would do the opposite.

699
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:45,481
You sacrificed your
girlfriend for my fiancée.

700
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:46,382
That's insane.

701
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,550
Can we just admit you still love her?

702
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,220
- I don't have time for this.
- Hey.

703
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:54,957
You once told me that
if I ever hurt Lee,

704
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:55,924
you'd kill me.

705
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:57,326
Well, now it's my turn.

706
00:36:57,971 --> 00:36:59,962
I love Lee and I'll do

707
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:02,131
whatever I have to to keep her.

708
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,565
Then word of advice...

709
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:06,969
lose the jealousy.

710
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:08,370
It's weak.

711
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,686
Gordon.

712
00:37:20,784 --> 00:37:23,519
For Lee, I'll give you that one.

713
00:37:40,703 --> 00:37:43,839
Oh, Captain... if you
keep frowning like that,

714
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:46,341
you'll never get those
wrinkles out around your mouth.

715
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:49,745
Come down to my office tomorrow.

716
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,881
I'll give you a free evaluation.

717
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:01,557
I'm surprised you can feel that

718
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,258
through that thing you call a face.

719
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:04,726
What are you doing?!

720
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:07,229
What I should have done all along.

721
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,802
You're insane.

722
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,471
Oh, no, Doc.

723
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:17,973
I'm saner than I've ever been.

724
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:21,076
I'm seeing things clearly...

725
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:23,979
for the very first time.

726
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:26,448
All these years, I've put
my trust in the system,

727
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:29,551
my trust in the law, held myself back

728
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:32,267
from doing what I really wanted to do.

729
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,291
And then I saw the truth.

730
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,694
It's not just you that's guilty.

731
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,931
This whole city is guilty.

732
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:43,932
Stop.

733
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:48,725
You're a police officer, for God's sake!

734
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:50,939
You have to follow the law.

735
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,908
I don't have to do anything.

736
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:54,243
I am the law.

737
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,845
I am judge...

738
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:58,981
jury...

739
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:02,718
and executioner!

740
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,616
Ed.

741
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,889
- How'd she take it?
- What?

742
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,225
Oh. Uh, um... everything is...

743
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:40,627
wonderful.

744
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:43,096
Isabella showed me that, uh...

745
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:45,532
I was worried over nothing.

746
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:54,942
I'm so happy for you.

747
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:57,135
But... why are you back?

748
00:39:57,203 --> 00:39:58,812
Well, she had to go to her conference.

749
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,147
I insisted.

750
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:02,082
You're a good man.

751
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,817
But you look done in.

752
00:40:03,885 --> 00:40:05,953
I will hear all about it tomorrow.

753
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,955
Get some sleep.

754
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:23,003
Got to give her credit.

755
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:25,372
She fought for him.

756
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,841
Too bad she underestimated her opponent.

757
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:31,145
I'm assuming it's done.

758
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:32,646
Yup.

759
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:34,448
Feel kind of bad, though, boss.

760
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:37,151
I always liked librarians.

761
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:38,952
You?

762
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,598
What about poor Ed?

763
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:44,391
He will be heartbroken.

764
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:49,696
Luckily, he has a shoulder to cry on.

765
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,547
Uh-oh. Come on. No, no.

766
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:11,118
Oh, come on. Uh-oh.

767
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,922
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

768
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:16,323
Help me, help me! Somebody, help!

769
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,559
Oh, dear.

770
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,734
Jim, you and Mario
have a heart-to-heart?

771
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:30,103
- Yeah. Where's Symon?
- No luck.

772
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:31,713
He must have skedaddled.

773
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:34,508
I thought he might be at the bar.

774
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,609
Uh-huh. Okay.

775
00:41:35,677 --> 00:41:37,511
Keep a perimeter in
case he shows back up.

776
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,313
I'm gonna head to his house.

777
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,360
And, Harvey, uh... take it easy, huh?

778
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:44,484
It's good to have you back again, Jim.

779
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:46,157
- Uh-huh.
- I'm real glad.

780
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:49,623
Captain.

781
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:51,767
- Did you hear?
- Everything.

782
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:53,493
I saw Symon here earlier.

783
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,795
You manage to pick him up?

784
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:57,329
Not yet. He must've skipped
out when we showed up.

785
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:58,435
We'll get him.

786
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,458
Alvarez said you were bringing in
the guy who did Paulie Pennies.

787
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:03,670
Turned out to be a dead end.

788
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:06,640
I'll let you know when I find Symon.

789
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,275
Jim.

790
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:11,330
Things are gonna change around here.

791
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:14,169
You and I are gonna make
a difference in this city.

792
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:17,050
We're gonna clean it up.

793
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:19,637
Yes, sir.

794
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:37,404
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

795
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,972
Guilty. Guilty.

796
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,108
Guilty!

797
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:43,677
Guilty! Guilty!

798
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:45,379
Guilty.

799
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:46,546
Guilty.

800
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:49,316
Guilty.Guilty.

801
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,249
GCPD. Sir?

802
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,607
Dr. Symon.

803
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:10,332
Who did this?

804
00:43:15,214 --> 00:43:16,737
Barnes.
