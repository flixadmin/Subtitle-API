1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,210
This city still needs saving.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,886
- But not by the Hood.
- It needs a hero.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,846
If you survive a crucible, you grow
stronger. This is to remind you of that.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,121
Welcome aboard.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,561
Sara swore allegiance
to the League of Assassins.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,721
You agreed to go back.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,962
- She'll be okay.
- Yeah, I know she'll be okay.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,162
But okay at what, is what bothers me.
Uhn.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,850
Dad? Dad!

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,450
Slade's whole plan was
to take everything from me. He did.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,847
Slade took Laurel, to
kill the woman I love.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,684
- So...
- So he took the wrong woman.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,651
I love you. Do you understand?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,844
The five years that I was gone,
I wasn't always on the island.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,090
My name is Amanda Waller, Mr. Queen.
Welcome to Hong Kong.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,091
Got him.
Coming up 52nd Street, heading east.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,648
Copy that. Or is it Roger?
I never know the difference.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,565
John, there's an illegal shipment of RPG's
headed your way.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,610
- Roger. I'm on it.
- Oh, so it is Roger.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,087
RPG's are secure. I've got eyes on them.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,602
Roy, we're coming to you.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,650
Vincent Steelgrave, you
have failed this city.

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,888
The Arrow just took down
another one of this city's Most Wanted.

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,971
There's no denying that the city's crime
rate has plummeted in the past five months.

25
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,162
- You're welcome.
- So has its employment rate...

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,481
...and its population.

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,291
We have experienced two terrorist attacks
in as many years.

28
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,000
Starling City is dying.
A prison full of criminals...

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,486
Take another off the board.

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,480
We keep this up, there will only be two
types of criminals left in Starling City:

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,962
The ones we put away
and the ones that are running scared.

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,411
What's that?

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,042
A fern. It thrives on low light.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,369
Since you're living here,
the place could do with a little sprucing.

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,042
- You should buy me a bed.
- You're sleeping on the floor.

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,681
Another text from Thea.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,411
Where is she now?

38
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,007
Amalfi Coast.
I keep telling her to send photos.

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,369
- I'm gonna go do a patrol. Clear my head.
- Hey.

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,724
You did really good tonight.

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,929
I think I'm gonna head out too.

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,003
I have to pull an early
shift at work today.

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,766
Which may be
the most depressing thing I've ever said.

44
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,810
- But we're still on for tomorrow night?
- Absolutely.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,243
I am going to turn you into
corporate master of the universe.

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,442
Those board members
are gonna be begging...

47
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,405
...to sell Queen Consolidated back to you
and your backers.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,730
I'm gonna roll out too.

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,204
Lyla has me trying to
build the bassinet from hell.

50
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,409
That reminds me.

51
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,085
I figured since you and Lyla
are having a girl...

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,083
- Man, you cannot afford this.
- I can't afford anything.

53
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,567
Which is why I made it.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,604
Arrowheads. One of the few things
that I can make.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,803
Well, it's beautiful. Thank you.

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,847
Congratulations, John.

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,646
And not just on the baby.

58
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,611
You and Lyla are happy.

59
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200
You should try it sometime.

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,085
My last girlfriend,
she's in the League of Assassins.

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,171
My girlfriend before that, she shot
my girlfriend before that. I'm not...

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,285
- I'm not exactly a catch at the moment.
- Maybe Felicity will change all that.

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,406
It's...

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,246
It's not the right time.

65
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,171
Things are as good now
as ever will be, Oliver.

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,284
And you love her. You even told her so.

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,603
- I was trying to fool Slade.
- Yes.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,367
Now the only person you're fooling
is yourself.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,925
Thanks again.

70
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,729
I told you, I don't speak Chinese.

71
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,363
And I told you, if you tried to
escape again, I'd beat you senseless.

72
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,969
Steelgrave took a plea for 15 to 20.

73
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,085
His lawyer folded after I hit him
with the evidence that the Arrow gathered.

74
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,526
Good work.

75
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,246
You catch them, I cook them.

76
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,685
- Did I say that too loud?
- No, you're fine.

77
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,928
Did you ever think we'd end up as partners?

78
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,808
Is that why you invited me down here, Laurel? To
see Mr. Steelgrave sent off into his new life?

79
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,246
No.

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,046
I have a surprise for you.

81
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,804
- What's your dad doing here?
- You'll see.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,729
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hm.

83
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,201
- Dad. Hi. How are you?
- Hey.

84
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,091
If they'd told me press conferences
came with the promotion...

85
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,527
...I would've told them
I prefer getting shot at.

86
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,961
Good thing
your doctor isn't giving you a choice.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,091
You could try to hide the fact that you're
glad I can't get out in the field anymore.

88
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,971
I can't hide that I'm
glad that you're safe.

89
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,847
- What's all this?
- Your surprise.

90
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,166
Thank you all... Excuse me.
Thank you for coming.

91
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,731
Five months ago...

92
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,930
...this city was under siege.

93
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,602
And the S.C.P.D.
rallied behind a man in a hood.

94
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,567
Well, I ended up with a captain's rank...

95
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,802
...and he didn't even get a thank you.

96
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,685
But today...

97
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,366
...he does.

98
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,448
Today the Starling City Police Department
is formerly recognizing the individual...

99
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,246
...known as the Arrow.

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,888
And I'm using my new position...

101
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,290
...to disband the anti-vigilante task force
charged with capturing him.

102
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,771
Thank you.

103
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,531
Make no mistake,
vigilantism will never be tolerated.

104
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,647
But I refuse to hunt, in the name of
this city, the hero who saved it.

105
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,126
Shut that crap off.

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,641
Less heat on the Arrow
means more heat on us.

107
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,486
And the ATF now has our shipment
of grenade launchers.

108
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,729
They got our shipment?
What are we paying bribes to the cops for?

109
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,322
We have a more pressing concern.

110
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,491
Lack of leadership.

111
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,449
I nominate myself.

112
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,091
Any objections?

113
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,691
Yeah, a few.

114
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,564
Oh, illuminate me.

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,041
Where do I start? You talk funny.

116
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,086
You don't know the first thing about
business. You're just a pill pusher.

117
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,800
Oh, those pills I push...

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,411
...are known as Vertigo.

119
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,524
In the wake of the Count...

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,690
...I tinkered some with his formula.

121
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,169
Introduced an additive...

122
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,966
...produced by certain mushrooms.

123
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,768
My Vertigo reveals the face
of your greatest fear.

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,330
As I was saying...

125
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,329
...lack of leadership.

126
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,127
I nominate myself. Any objections?

127
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,131
Our course of action is
straight as an arrow.

128
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,490
Gentlemen...

129
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,205
...we're gonna kill him.

130
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,966
Hey, how was work?

131
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,364
It is not work. It is a soul-crushing
exercise in misery with health and dental.

132
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,562
Suffice it to say, I am highly motivated...

133
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,286
...to convince the board
to sell you back the company.

134
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,201
Unfortunately, you don't have the
qualifications to run Queen Consolidated...

135
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,129
...but what you do have is passion.

136
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,806
You care about the company
and the people there.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,083
That's what you have to get across to them.
Speak from the heart.

138
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,125
Felicity.

139
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,406
Would you like to go out to dinner with me?

140
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,927
- I'm being serious, here, Oliver.
- So am I.

141
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,887
I don't wanna read too much into this...

142
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,003
...but are you asking me out on a date?

143
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,244
Like an actual date? Like a date, date?

144
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,886
Sure... I mean,
the implication being with dinner...

145
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,050
Usually I'm the one
talking in sentence fragments.

146
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,722
Would you like to go to dinner with me?

147
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,486
Yes.

148
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,409
- Go.
- Calvin Nico just knocked over a liquor store.

149
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,364
Nico's in Steelgrave's crew.

150
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,524
Send his photo to Roy. Get me Felicity.

151
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,603
You got it.
[can't talk right now.

152
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,810
I'm at work.

153
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,966
Could I ask you guys
just to wait one moment?

154
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,323
Someone is calling for tech support.

155
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,767
You are gonna get me so incredibly fired.

156
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,201
Okay, I'm hacked into the city's database.
I'm running facial recognition now.

157
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,447
You like Italian?

158
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,443
- What?
- For tonight. You like Italian?

159
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,806
Everyone likes Italian.

160
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,401
Oliver, you're in the middle
of a high-speed chase.

161
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm multi-tasking.

162
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,968
I got him. He's in the sewer.

163
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,442
I'm picking up his cell phone.
He's at the corner of Grand and Ames.

164
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,967
And, yes, I love Italian.

165
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,208
Captain Lance is also in pursuit.
You are welcome. I have to go.

166
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,486
Detective, thank you.

167
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,326
- You had it handled.
- For what you said today.

168
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,643
- I wish I could do more.
- You've already done more than enough.

169
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,371
I've gotta go. Some place I have to be.

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,967
You got a hot date or something?

171
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,762
So this morning makes how many
escape attempts in the last five months?

172
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,450
- Nine.
- What we have here...

173
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,526
...is a failure to reach an understanding.
Oh... Go to hell.

174
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,891
So this is my reward for saving you
from drowning off the coast of Lian Yu?

175
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,646
Yeah. Why'd you do that?

176
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,842
That's need to know.

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,005
Suffice it to say, I have need of a man
of your capacity.

178
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,328
- I don't care.
- Mm.

179
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,482
I don't care about anything
except going home.

180
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,886
You should know that.

181
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,364
You should know
that I will never stop trying to escape.

182
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,047
You should know it's easy to kill someone
the world already thinks is dead.

183
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,725
Kill me, then.

184
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,722
I don't care.

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,287
We're gonna have to try this
another way, then.

186
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,404
- Hi. Thank you for waiting.
- No problem. I just wanna buy this.

187
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,886
This is a satellite frequency
communicator TX-40.

188
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,526
Yeah, I'm trying to breach
a Tor-secured firewall...

189
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,247
...and I need something to help me
piggyback off a Keyhole Hexagon satellite.

190
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,523
I did that once.
Hacked a public Wi-Fi signal...

191
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,041
...piggybacked using
crowdsourced stealth processing.

192
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,440
Huh.

193
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,762
You're Felicity Smoak.
Formerly of Queen Consolidated.

194
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,440
Mind if I ask you something?
Why are you here?

195
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,881
How do you know who I am?

196
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,882
I know a guy who might be interested
in hiring someone with your expertise.

197
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,766
I'm not actually looking
for a new job right now, God help me.

198
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,242
But I can help you buy this, unless
I can't. I mean, I shouldn't.

199
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,401
- You shouldn't buy this.
- Clearly you don't understand this sales thing.

200
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,446
The next gen model, TX-50, comes out in a
few months. I got to touch one last year.

201
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,444
Pure bliss. And if you wanna
breach Tor-level security...

202
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,120
...you should deploy
a remote administration tool.

203
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,441
I have a good one.

204
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,443
- Here's the URL.
- Thanks.

205
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,444
- Happy hacking.
- Certainly hope so.

206
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,129
- False alarm.
- Are you sure? These contractions...

207
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,363
Just Braxton Hicks.
You're not even four centimeters dilated.

208
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,648
I feel like an M1A1.

209
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,087
It's a tank. Think a big, big tank.

210
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,806
You did the right thing.
You don't want your husband...

211
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,121
- Boyfriend.
- Ex-husband.

212
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,767
To be delivering the baby on the freeway.

213
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,121
You can get dressed now.

214
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,801
All right.

215
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,282
- You okay?
- I'm not the one that's nine months pregnant.

216
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,925
You look a little scared.

217
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,289
Honey, please, I've thrown down
with the Taliban, Malcolm Merlyn...

218
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,131
...and a host of Mirakuru-powered
human weapons.

219
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,765
I'm terrified.

220
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,001
Set it up for six at the end.

221
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,489
- Queen. Party of two.
- Yes. Right this way.

222
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,047
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

223
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,888
- Heh.
- What?

224
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,805
- Nothing. I'm just...
- Nervous?

225
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,201
- Yeah.
- Line forms behind me.

226
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,001
- Scotch, neat.
- Just a water for me, thanks.

227
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,522
Hey, are you sure? The booze might
sort of help with the whole...

228
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,769
The alcohol is not going to mix well
with the three benzos I took.

229
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,409
Am I being crazy? I mean, what
do we have to be nervous about?

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,286
Well, we've already exhausted every topic
that one would normally talk about...

231
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,490
...on a first date, second date,
third date, and every date.

232
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,728
And I've already seen you shirtless.

233
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,527
Multiple times. Shirtless. All the time.

234
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,728
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

235
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,762
There are still a few things
that you don't know about me.

236
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,410
Please name one.

237
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,361
The five years that I was away...

238
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,521
...I wasn't always on Lian Yu.

239
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,604
I thought so.

240
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,410
- Where were you?
- Hong Kong.

241
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,530
For one.

242
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,326
And I have been thinking a lot
recently about...

243
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,289
...my time there.

244
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,286
The choices that I had to make.

245
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,447
Those years sound like
they're filled with a whole lot of suck.

246
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,969
I'm sorry. I'm just a
little out of my element.

247
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,809
The entire time that I was gone,
I could never...

248
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,801
...completely trust someone.

249
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,769
And when that goes on for so long,
you stop...

250
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,291
...seeing people for people. You see...

251
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,009
...threats.

252
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,768
Or targets.

253
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,887
And when I decided to come home, l...

254
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,162
I just didn't know
how to turn that part of me off.

255
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,808
But then I walked into your office.

256
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,011
You were the first person
that I could see as a...

257
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,522
A person.

258
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,607
There was just something about you.

259
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,963
- Yeah, I was chewing on a pen.
- It was red.

260
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,484
GPS shows him in the restaurant.

261
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,480
The Arrow's definitely in there. If we're
gonna find him, we gotta get in closer.

262
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,045
We're close enough.

263
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,167
Do you remember when I told you that because
of what we do, I didn't think that...

264
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,330
...I could be with someone that l...

265
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,568
- That I could really care about?
- Yeah, I remember.

266
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,166
So maybe I was wrong.

267
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,246
Oliver, are you...?

268
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,680
Oliver?

269
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,604
Is she okay?

270
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,444
She's knocked out.

271
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,562
It's on the news. Police
and fire on the scene.

272
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,041
Yeah, I didn't think it
was best to stick around.

273
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,767
I don't think you and an explosion
at the same place is a coincidence.

274
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,125
Hey, check this out.

275
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,805
It's a GPS tag. I found it on yourjacket.
It's wasted now.

276
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,283
- You took out one of Steelgrave's crew earlier.
- It was a set-up.

277
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,647
So they could plant that thing on me.

278
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,808
- Oliver, I know what you're thinking.
- No.

279
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,123
I know exactly what's going on
in your head, and you are wrong.

280
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,561
Someone planted a tracer
and I don't notice?

281
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,603
The only explanation...

282
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,051
I lost my focus.

283
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,122
The person we took down earlier...

284
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,641
...is working with whoever's responsible
for the explosion.

285
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,802
Another one of Steelgrave's crew,
I'm guessing.

286
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,442
I need to know who's at the top
of that organization now...

287
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,926
...and where I can find him.

288
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,811
I'm on it.

289
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,849
- Oliver!
- Hey, hey, hey.

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,163
You're safe. You're safe. I'm here.

291
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,245
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm on your side.
- Got this handled, detective.

292
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,250
These guys blew up a building.
You think I'm sitting this out?

293
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,364
Suspect's name is Werner Zytle.
He's a real nutbar.

294
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,131
Keep your head on a swivel, then.

295
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,124
I'm Werner Zytle.

296
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,164
But you can call me Vertigo.

297
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,125
The Count's dead.

298
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,008
Some things never die.
You, for example. It's frustrating.

299
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,680
It just means I have to
try a little bit harder.

300
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,362
The Count might be dead, true...

301
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,888
...but his glorious narcotic lives on...

302
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,526
With a few enhancements that will
reveal to you your greatest fear...

303
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,361
...by gazing upon truth itself.

304
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,003
Get away from him or get put down!

305
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,922
Felicity, call an ambulance.

306
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,086
Are you okay? That was a pretty strong
psychotropic Werner hit you with.

307
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,322
Ahem. How's Detective Lance's condition?

308
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,928
- Stable. He's at Starling General.
- I hacked the paramedic radio.

309
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,845
He had a coronary artery spasm
treatable with medication.

310
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,201
He'll be fine.

311
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,161
How are you?

312
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,726
Believe it or not,
I have had worse first dates.

313
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,931
Hit the streets. Werner's agenda
can't stop with me.

314
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,686
- I need to know what he has planned.
- On it.

315
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,084
- I'll back him up.
- Roy's got it. Go home to Lyla.

316
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,930
Oliver.

317
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,050
If this is about what happened, man,
risk is part of the job.

318
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,244
Diggle, it's just intel gathering.
Roy can handle it.

319
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,885
I know we need to talk.

320
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,606
About our dinner,
or our dinner getting blown up?

321
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,290
- Both.
- It's okay.

322
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,927
We'll talk about it
after we catch this guy.

323
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,162
Maybe we should
reschedule the board meeting.

324
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,971
It's in less than an hour.

325
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,924
I've got this.

326
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,965
When are people gonna realize
that I don't speak Chinese?

327
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,850
Japanese.

328
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,202
- You speak English?
- Better than you speak Chinese.

329
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,963
- Where am I?
- Our home. Mine and my husband's.

330
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,245
Your husband?

331
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,963
Welcome to my home.

332
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,720
Dinner?

333
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,726
Gotta warn you,
the doctors told me not to get yelled at.

334
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,329
It's a good thing you don't care, then,
since you're still going out in the field.

335
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,646
Do you know what
an advanced health care directive is?

336
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,321
It's what they ask for
when you're gonna die, Dad.

337
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,006
The night Sara left,
the night you collapsed...

338
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,687
...the E.R. doctor asked me if you had one.

339
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,126
I'm sorry, Laurel, I really am.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

340
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,847
Then why do you keep
pushing yourself like this?

341
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,530
I don't know how.

342
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,851
Been a cop since before you and your sister
were born, it's all I know.

343
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,690
If I'm not a cop...

344
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,882
...what am I?

345
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,209
You're my father...

346
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,406
...and I need you.

347
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,844
And I just spoke to Ned Foster,
he said the board is primed.

348
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,045
You just have to go in there and wow them,
which I am pretty sure is a business term.

349
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,930
I'm afraid we have a situation.

350
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,049
There's another bidder for the company.

351
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,043
Really? Who?

352
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,049
Ray Palmer.

353
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,850
Nice to meet you. Love your company.

354
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,408
- Nice to see you again, Ms. Smoak.
- You two know each other?

355
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,811
So sorry I am late. Traffic was terrible,
which is why I took my helicopter.

356
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,328
I parked on your roof, I hope that's okay.
You guys validate, right?

357
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,043
Oh, frack.

358
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,167
Two years ago, the people of Starling City
thought I was dead.

359
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,484
I came back.

360
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
And so can Queen Consolidated.

361
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,444
With Starling National Bank's new investment,
we can take QC out of receivership...

362
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,727
...and into the future.

363
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,809
I mean, this company is my family.

364
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,927
And as my mother always said:

365
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,202
"There is nothing more important to me
than family."

366
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,810
Thank you.

367
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,883
That was a good speech.

368
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,730
Hard to top.

369
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,848
Thank you all for coming out today.

370
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,442
I promise to be brief,
if not a little entertaining.

371
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,208
Oh, that's one of my new smart watches.

372
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,085
I'm very proud of those.

373
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,731
You like it? It works for you? Yeah, good.

374
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,924
Anyway, science. Numbers.

375
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,365
I like numbers.

376
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,926
These numbers show QC's performance
under Mr. Queen's management.

377
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,288
I'm using that term
extremely loosely, BTW...

378
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,364
...also BTW, these numbers aren't
sanitized for Wall Street.

379
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,961
This is raw information
from your company's servers.

380
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,884
How'd he get into our computers?

381
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,890
Something tells me he deployed
a remote administration tool.

382
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,166
But the truth is, this company's woes
are a symptom of a much larger problem.

383
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,290
And that problem is Starling City.

384
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,811
Queen Consolidated can't hope to survive
if the city it's located in is dying.

385
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,681
And guess what? It is.

386
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,491
Nobody wants to live here anymore.

387
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,803
And after two terrorist attacks,
who can blame them?

388
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,407
This city still needs saving.

389
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,490
And that is my vision for this company.

390
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,682
To not only see it rise from the ashes...

391
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,442
...but to take this city with it
to that new horizon.

392
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,042
And that new day has a name.

393
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,685
Oliver.

394
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,689
I'm sorry.
I really thought it was gonna go our way.

395
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,844
So did I, but maybe the company's
better off with Dr. Palmer.

396
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,800
I couldn't make time for QC last year, trying
to get the company back now is selfish.

397
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,008
It's something that
the old me would have done.

398
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,567
If the past 12 hours
have reminded me of anything...

399
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,327
...it's that I made the decision
to put Oliver Queen aside and be the Arrow.

400
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,891
It's not a choice I can unmake.

401
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,731
- Last night you didn't feel that way.
- Look what happened.

402
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,241
Oliver. The explosion wasn't your fault.

403
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,042
When Werner hit me with the Vertigo dart...

404
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,250
...he told me that his formula,
it shows us our worst fear.

405
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,729
I saw myself.

406
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,606
You don't really think
you're afraid of yourself, do you?

407
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,322
I think I'm scared of what would happen
if I let myself be Oliver Queen.

408
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,161
What did we find out?

409
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,449
You know how we got the number
of crime bosses down to three?

410
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,682
This new guy Werner wants to make it zero.

411
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,405
Take out the competition.

412
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,604
Mikhail Petruv, Luciano Costa,
Shintaro Shimosawa.

413
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,762
What are their locations?

414
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,287
I'm not getting anything
off their last addresses.

415
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,363
Werner could be moving these guys
right now.

416
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,281
It's not like these guys walk around
with little GPS's attached to them.

417
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,090
Unless they do. Petruv, Costa, Shimosawa,
they're all on parole or out on bail.

418
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,644
- Ankle monitors.
- Can't be right.

419
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,802
They're all in the same location.

420
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,408
Rockets Arena.

421
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,565
The heavyweight title fight's tonight.
There'll be, like, 20,000 people there.

422
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,331
He's willing to blow up a restaurant
to take down one man.

423
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,484
- He'll blow up a stadium to take down three.
- But an RPG won't do it.

424
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,803
I need you looking for a large
explosive device. Roy, suit up.

425
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,645
- Where do you want me?
- Here.

426
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,805
- I can't have you in the field anymore.
- Really? What changed?

427
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,320
You're gonna be a father.

428
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,609
Oliver, you've known for the past five months I
was gonna be a father, so I ask you again...

429
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,969
...what changed?
lhave.

430
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,324
My risks can't be your risks. That...

431
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,081
Diggle, you have a life.
You have a new life. it's...

432
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,845
- it's a life I can't have.
- I get it.

433
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,163
You and Felicity were in an explosion.

434
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,807
People died. Either one of you could have.
But you didn't.

435
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,684
You can't let that shake you, man.

436
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,208
Detective Lance is in a hospital bed
because I let him come with me.

437
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,807
Wait, Lance is his own man
who makes his own decisions. And so am I.

438
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,567
Not this one.

439
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,003
Oliver, I've given the past two years
of my life to your crusade.

440
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,850
I don't know what that's earned me...

441
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,321
...but at least the right
to make my own choices.

442
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,882
- No, it doesn't.
- You would be dead if it wasn't for me!

443
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,810
You're right.

444
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,727
But this is my crusade...

445
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,088
...which makes this my decision.

446
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,884
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

447
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,401
- Come on!
- Yeah!

448
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,251
Come on, baby, let's go!

449
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,490
Come on, let's go,
finish him now.

450
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,929
It's a five-minute timer.

451
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,922
Come on. What are you waiting for?

452
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,771
My partner. Go.

453
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,288
I've isolated a frequency spike
consistent with an incendiary device.

454
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,411
It's in the maintenance tunnel
underneath the stands.

455
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,285
I'll get the bomb. Get the son of a bitch.

456
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,364
Back for more?

457
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,451
It's as if you've developed an addiction...

458
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,563
...to Vertigo.

459
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,126
I've made my choice.

460
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,641
- Felicity, we're running out of time here.
- Okay.

461
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,969
From your description, it sounds like
a collapsible circuit design.

462
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,003
- Felicity?
- Cut the yellow wire.

463
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,771
There is no yellow wire.

464
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,845
Okay, new plan.

465
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,763
Above you there should be
insulated piping pumping the arena's a.c.

466
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,206
They're pumping Freon.

467
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,681
You wanna break one off,
aim it at the bomb.

468
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,683
You're gonna freeze the thing.

469
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,725
It's not working.

470
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,690
Don't look so surprised.

471
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,848
I haven't been gone that long.

472
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,603
Tie me up and lock me down,
it doesn't matter.

473
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,006
There will always be a Vertigo,
always someone to pick up the mantle.

474
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,323
You have given it the power.

475
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,602
Don't you see?

476
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,962
Don't you see?

477
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,006
- You look well. How's Nanda Parbat?
- Hot.

478
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,243
It's good to see you.

479
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,090
You've been missed.

480
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,124
I was on my way to see Laurel,
picked up on your radio chatter.

481
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,761
Tell Felicity to mix up
her frequencies a bit.

482
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,521
That's a good tip,
and is this permanent, you being back?

483
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,091
I hope so.

484
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,805
We'll see.

485
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,890
- How are you doing?
- I'm...

486
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,128
I'm working through a few things.

487
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,884
Word of advice...

488
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,010
...we're not our masks.

489
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,760
And we need people in our lives
who don't wear one.

490
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,321
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

491
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,602
And the answer better not be stalking me.

492
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,923
Depends on whether you consider
pinging your phone's GPS stalking.

493
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,441
Okay, guilty.
But you know how I know a guy...

494
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,002
...who would be interested in
hiring someone with your expertise?

495
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,045
Turns out I could really use it.

496
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,170
Seems somebody hacked my cell phone,
my laptop, and my desktop.

497
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,560
Gee, that's too bad.

498
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,681
All my data's been replaced
by audio files of porcupine flatulence.

499
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,448
And so I was hoping that whoever did it
might be willing to undo it...

500
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,847
...if I apologize for misleading them
in any way.

501
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,682
That would probably work. Oh. Unless you did
that to steal that person's friend's company...

502
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,891
...in which case, I would suggest getting
used to the sound of spiky rodents farting.

503
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,168
I didn't steal anything.

504
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,840
Maybe a little.
But I didn't even need the data.

505
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,249
- I mean, you saw the speech. It was good.
- My friends just had a baby.

506
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,371
So if you don't mind, there's another
slimy little human that needs my attention.

507
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,525
Oh, and BTW, you might wanna
check your tablet while you're at it.

508
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,648
- Hey.
- Hi.

509
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,929
Oh. She is scrumptious.

510
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,562
- Mazel tov, guys, seriously.
- Thank you.

511
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,051
- I could come back.
- No, Oliver, come in.

512
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,600
Oh, she's perfect.

513
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,084
Congratulations.

514
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,249
Thank you, Oliver.

515
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,291
- For what?
- For being right.

516
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,122
The second I looked at her...

517
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,886
...everything changed.

518
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,204
My whole universe...

519
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,211
...it changed.

520
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,086
You were right.

521
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,969
- How do I get out of here?
- You can't leave.

522
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,606
Well, why don't you try to stop me?

523
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,167
You've already learned I can.

524
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,811
Repeatedly.

525
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,283
Amanda Waller wants you working for her.
And she will have her way.

526
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,285
Too bad for her, I'd rather die.

527
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,767
Which is why
it's not your life she's threatening.

528
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,127
I'm to be responsible for you.

529
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,971
And she's found the proper way
to motivate me.

530
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,449
Akio.

531
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,804
She's threatened my family.

532
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,003
She'll kill them if I let you go.

533
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,206
My father had a proverb
he was once fond of.

534
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,331
- "A man cannot live by two names."
- What does that mean?

535
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,005
In your case...

536
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,282
...I believe it means
not having any choice.

537
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,011
They look really happy.

538
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,811
- She's beautiful.
- She is.

539
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,970
We need to talk.

540
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,209
I don't want to talk.

541
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,131
Which, for me,
I know is a little unprecedented.

542
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,966
But...

543
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,526
...as soon as we talk, it's over.

544
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,366
I'm so sorry.

545
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,921
I thought that I could be me...

546
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,244
...and the Arrow.

547
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,044
But I can't.

548
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,170
Not now.

549
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,844
- Maybe not ever.
- Then say never.

550
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,925
Stop dangling maybe's.

551
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,125
Say it's never going to work out between
us. Say you never loved me. Say...

552
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,646
Felicity.

553
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,446
Don't ask me to say that I don't love you.

554
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,166
I told you as soon as we talked...

555
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,602
...it would be over.

556
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,722
- Hello?
- It's Barry.

557
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,441
Barry Allen.

558
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,765
I woke up.

559
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,563
I could use some advice.

560
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,285
I'll be right there.

561
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,763
And here I thought that you used up
all your League of Assassin vacation days.

562
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,283
You look great. How's Dad doing?

563
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,761
The same. Seeing you will help.

564
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,962
I don't want him to know I'm in town.
Not just yet.

565
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,125
You don't want him to know you're in town,
or you don't want him to know why?

566
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,121
Both.

567
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,844
This life, it...

568
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,330
It's complicated.

569
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,926
We didn't want you to choose it.

570
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,003
- Not for us.
- I know.

571
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,770
I chose it for me.

572
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,005
The Arrow.

573
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,168
Oliver. "Busted someone
who tried to blow up Rockets Arena."

574
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,960
My boss wants me to head to the station
to backstop the interrogation.

575
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,330
Laurel Lance.
Always trying to save the world.

576
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,965
Runs in the family.

577
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,326
Love you.

578
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,049
Hello, Sara.

579
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,049
What are you doing here?

580
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,721
Oh! No! No! Sara!

581
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,365
Sara!

582
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,046
No! No!

583
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,850
No!
