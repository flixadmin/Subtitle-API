1
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,661
-You're wearing a black cloak again.
-I've been sent to negotiate with you.

2
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,818
It appears my trusting nature
got the better of me.

3
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,695
It's happened before.

4
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,866
I was hoping your loyalty was real
when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

5
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,992
Truly, I was.

6
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,536
The Halfhand ordered me to join your army

7
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,289
and bring back whatever information
I could to Castle Black.

8
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,291
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

9
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,004
I was loyal to him
and to my Night's Watch vows.

10
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,756
All your vows?

11
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,260
She wasn't enough to turn you?

12
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,514
Were you enough to turn her?

13
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,643
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

14
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,649
-Did you see her again at Castle Black?
-Yes.

15
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,526
And?

16
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,861
She's dead.

17
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,365
-Your doing?
-No.

18
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,619
We'll drink to her.

19
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,230
Of all the ways I'd kill you,
poison would be the last.

20
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,777
-Ygritte.
-Ygritte.

21
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,957
-That's not wine.
-No, it's a proper northern drink,

22
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:39,172
Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard.
Killed some of our strongest men.

23
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:45,887
One of our giants went into your tunnel
and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.

24
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,930
He's dead.

25
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,851
-He killed my friend, Grenn.
-He was their king.

26
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,855
The last of a bloodline that stretches
back before the First Men.

27
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,982
Grenn came from a farm.

28
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,490
-Mag and Grenn.
-Grenn and Mag.

29
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,828
Kullback, could I trouble you
for something to eat?

30
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,040
I don't imagine
our guest has eaten anything

31
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,458
for quite some time.

32
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,089
So, you're here to strike a bargain?

33
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,675
Turn your army around and go home.

34
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,013
You know I know you're low on arrows,
you're low on oil, you're low on men.

35
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,975
-How many are left, 50?
-I told Tormund and Orell.

36
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,604
-We have more than 1,000 men.
-I showed you everything I had.

37
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,606
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

38
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,110
And what did you do?
You fired on us with everything you had.

39
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:47,990
It wasn't much. As soon as I saw that,
I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,

40
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,326
an unmanned stretch,
five miles west of here.

41
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,245
A lot of them will die climbing,

42
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,539
but most of them will be over
by the end of the day.

43
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,667
It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow,

44
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,585
which is more
than you've ever done for me.

45
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,048
My people have bled enough.
We're not here to conquer.

46
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,802
We're here to hide behind your Wall.
Just like you.

47
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,680
We need your tunnel.

48
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,600
Now, we both know that winter is coming.

49
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,062
And if my people aren't south of the Wall
when it comes in earnest,

50
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,730
we'll all end up worse than dead.

51
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,775
You want to strike a bargain with me?

52
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,779
Here's the bargain.
You go back, you open the gates to us,

53
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,532
and I swear to you
that no one else will die.

54
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,450
Refuse...

55
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,121
and we'll kill
every last man at Castle Black.

56
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,673
That's why you're here.

57
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,468
I reckon you could do it
before any of them could stop you.

58
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,763
They'd kill you, of course.
They'd kill you slow.

59
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,725
But you knew that when you came in here.

60
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,313
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?

61
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,691
Killing a man in his own tent
when he's just offered you peace?

62
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,068
Is that what the Night's Watch is?

63
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,196
Is that what you are?

64
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,117
Riders coming!

65
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,495
-Are you attacking us?
-No.

66
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,955
It's like you said, we don't have the men.

67
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,611
Hold! To me! To me!

68
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,892
Stand down!

69
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,274
I said my people have bled enough
and I meant it.

70
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,354
-Round them up.
-Stay with the horses.

71
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,366
You're the King beyond the Wall?

72
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,954
-Do you know who I am?
-Never had the pleasure.

73
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,124
This is Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

74
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,169
We're not in the Seven Kingdoms
and you're not dressed for this weather.

75
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,590
It is customary to kneel
when surrendering to a king.

76
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,723
We do not kneel.

77
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,434
I'll have thousands of your men
in chains by nightfall,

78
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,353
have nowhere to put them,
have nothing to feed them.

79
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,983
I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.
Their fate depends on their king.

80
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,697
All the same, we do not kneel.

81
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,034
Take these men away.

82
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,122
What's a man of the Night's Watch
doing in a wildling camp?

83
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,751
I was sent to discuss terms
with the King beyond the Wall.

84
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:55,005
You're speaking to the one true king, boy.
You will address him as "Your Grace."

85
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,259
I know he's the king.
My father died for him.

86
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,304
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.

87
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,266
I'm Ned Stark's son.

88
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,605
-Your father was an honorable man.
-He was, Your Grace.

89
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,316
What do you think
he'd have done with him?

90
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,283
I was this man's prisoner once.

91
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,578
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.

92
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,789
But he spared my life.

93
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,584
I think my father
would have taken him prisoner,

94
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,085
listened to what he had to say.

95
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,841
Very well, then. Take him.

96
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,016
Your Grace.

97
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,728
If my father had seen
the things that I've seen,

98
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,647
he'd also tell you
to burn the dead before nightfall.

99
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,859
All of them.

100
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,412
I would suggest milk of the poppy

101
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,248
to ease his pain,
but he is completely insensate.

102
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,416
Bloody Martells.

103
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,213
-The cause appears to be manticore venom.
-It is. The Death's Head manticore.

104
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,176
Yes, I've read a great deal about it.
It's a horrible poison.

105
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,970
Usually Mantari in origin.

106
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,808
-Oh, yes, yes. There's nothing to be done.
-Yes, there is.

107
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,272
-May I ask what you think you're doing?
-Saving him.

108
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:40,986
Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise,
but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

109
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,613
Well, well beyond.

110
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:47,576
This man is not even a maester,
let alone Grand Maester.

111
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,038
That's for the best.
No maester knows how to save him.

112
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,040
That is exactly the sort of arrogance

113
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,626
that had him expelled from the Citadel,
Your Grace.

114
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,797
His curiosity was deemed
dangerous and unnatural.

115
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
Rightly so, in my opinion.

116
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,051
You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

117
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,182
But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.

118
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,434
-Not anymore.
-But I...

119
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,570
-You can save him?
-Difficult to say, Your Grace.

120
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,030
But if my past work is any guide...

121
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,909
we stand a chance.

122
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,080
Do everything you can.
Come to me for anything you need.

123
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,206
Thank you, Your Grace.

124
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,211
You should know,
the process may change him...

125
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:41,922
somewhat.

126
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,468
Will it weaken him?

127
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,806
-Oh, no.
-Very well, then.

128
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,579
Not another word. We've been over this.

129
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,165
-The matter's closed.
-I'm opening it again.

130
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,628
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

131
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,382
You're still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
And you will marry Loras Tyrell

132
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,802
-as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
-I will not.

133
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,181
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

134
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,225
Tyrion's sentence
will be carried out tomorrow.

135
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,981
You have, on several occasions,
made great claims

136
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,442
about your commitment
to this family's future.

137
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:47,446
Your role in that future
is more vital now than it ever was.

138
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,447
I don't care.

139
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,409
I will stay in King's Landing
where I belong, with my son, the king.

140
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,704
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

141
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,957
I decided to take your brother with me
and not you.

142
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,419
You insisted that you would not be left
at Casterly Rock

143
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,922
under any circumstances.
And if you recall--

144
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,424
I'm not interested in hearing
another one of your smug stories

145
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,136
about the time you won.
This isn't going to be one of those times.

146
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,597
Do you think you'll be the first person

147
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,392
dragged into a sept
to be married against her will?

148
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,644
When you marched
into the throne room to tell me

149
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,105
we'd won the Battle of Blackwater--
Do you remember?

150
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,526
I was sitting
on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

151
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,070
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

152
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,030
That's how far
I was willing to go when I thought

153
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,574
someone awful
had come to take my son away.

154
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,329
Someone awful is coming
to take him away.

155
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,581
-No.
-Joffrey is dead.

156
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,750
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

157
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,837
And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.

158
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,004
My last boy.

159
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,425
Margaery will dig her claws in,

160
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,719
you will dig your claws in
and you'll fight over him

161
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,887
like beasts, until you rip him apart.

162
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,599
I will burn our house to the ground
before I let that happen.

163
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,435
And how will you do that?

164
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,524
-I'll tell everyone the truth.
-What truth would that be?

165
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,114
You don't know, do you?

166
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,743
You never believed it.

167
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,079
How is that possible?

168
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,625
What am I saying?
Of course it's possible.

169
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,880
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

170
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,466
have any conception
what his actual family was doing?

171
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,386
We were right there in front of you
and you didn't see us.

172
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,097
One look in the past 20 years,

173
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,225
one real look at your own children
and you would have known.

174
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,394
Known what?

175
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,314
Everything they say is true.

176
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,940
-About Jaime and me.
-No.

177
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,109
-Your legacy is a lie.
-No, no, no, no.

178
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,111
I don't believe you.

179
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,242
Yes, you do.

180
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,345
Jaime.

181
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,016
-You won.
-One fewer brother.

182
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,643
Must be proud of yourself.

183
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,895
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

184
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,772
For my family, no, nothing.

185
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,149
I would do things for my family
you couldn't imagine.

186
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,902
-Tyrion is your family.
-He's not.

187
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,571
-You don't get to choose.
-I do. So do you.

188
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,242
You can choose the creature that killed
our mother to come into this world.

189
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,327
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

190
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,121
He didn't decide to kill her.
He was an infant.

191
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,082
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

192
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,084
All the same,
you cut it out before it does.

193
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,088
What do you decide? What do you choose?

194
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:55,300
The things I did to get back to you,
to endure all that, only to find you--

195
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,638
I choose you.

196
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,932
-Those are words.
-Yes.

197
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,059
Like the ones I just said to Father.

198
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,979
I told him.

199
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,065
-Told him what?
-I told him about us.

200
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,737
-You told him?
-I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

201
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,616
I told him I'm staying right here
with Tommen, with you.

202
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,785
-You think he'll just accept that?
-Go and ask him.

203
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,916
-What did you say?
-I don't want to talk

204
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,837
about Tywin Lannister.
I don't choose Tywin Lannister.

205
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,382
I don't love Tywin Lannister.
I love my brother.

206
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,593
I love my lover.

207
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,763
People will whisper,
they'll make their jokes. Let them.

208
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,808
They're all so small,
I can't even see them.

209
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,227
I only see what matters.

210
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,906
-Someone will walk in.
-I don't care.

211
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,279
I can speak the common tongue
if you wish.

212
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,656
You speak it very well.

213
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,576
Before you freed me,
I belonged to Master Mighdal.

214
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,081
I was tutor to his children.
I taught them languages and history.

215
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,043
They know a great deal
about your family because of me.

216
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:58,548
Little Calla is only seven,
but she admires you very much.

217
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,343
I hope I can prove worthy
of her admiration.

218
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,220
What can I do for you?

219
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,808
When you took the city,
the children begged me

220
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,434
not to leave the house.

221
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,855
But Master Mighdal
and I agreed that I must.

222
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,149
So I lost my home.

223
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:22,489
-Now I live on the streets.
-I have outfitted mess halls

224
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,908
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

225
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,869
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

226
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:32,916
I went to one of these places.
The young prey on the old.

227
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,919
Take what they want
and beat us if we resist.

228
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,839
My Unsullied will make them safe again
in short order,

229
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,549
my friend, this I promise you.

230
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,219
Even if they are safe,
who would I be there?

231
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,180
What purpose would I serve?

232
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,475
With my master, I was a teacher.

233
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,854
I had the respect
and love of his children.

234
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,440
What is it that you want from me?

235
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,317
Your Grace, I ask you

236
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,612
to let me sell myself back
to Master Mighdal.

237
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,407
You want to return
to a man who owned you

238
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,618
-like a goat or a chair?
-Please, Your Grace.

239
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,706
The young may rejoice
in the new world you have built for them,

240
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,584
but for those of us too old to change,

241
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,296
there is only fear and squalor.

242
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,715
I am not alone.

243
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,927
There are many outside
waiting to beg the same of you.

244
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:30,849
I did not take this city to preside
over the injustice I fought to destroy.

245
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,893
I took it to bring people freedom.

246
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,731
But freedom means
making your own choices.

247
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,902
I will allow you to sign a contract
with your former master.

248
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,197
It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.

249
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,782
Thank you, Your Grace.

250
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,327
Thank you.

251
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,335
The masters will take advantage
of this situation.

252
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,424
The men serving them
will be slaves in all but name.

253
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,350
Approach, my friend.

254
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,668
"I have brought you..."

255
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,174
"He came from the sky."

256
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,469
"The black one."

257
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,684
"The winged shadow."

258
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,479
"He came from the sky and..."

259
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,278
"My girl."

260
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,364
"My little girl."

261
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,205
-What was her name?
-Zala, Your Grace.

262
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,000
-How old was she?
-Three.

263
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,627
Three.

264
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,133
They came to us
from White Harbor and Barrowton,

265
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,636
from Fairmarket and King's Landing,

266
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,266
from north and south, from east and west.

267
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:29,189
They died protecting
men, women, and children

268
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:34,069
who will never know their names.
It is for us to remember them.

269
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:39,366
Our brothers,
we shall never see their like again.

270
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,409
And now their watch is ended.

271
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,664
And now their watch is ended.

272
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:02,490
Your old, blind man patched me up. Why?

273
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,910
He's sworn to treat all wounded men,
friend or foe.

274
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,496
You want me alive so you can torture me?

275
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,168
-No one's going to torture you.
-So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?

276
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,670
Drop us from the top of the Wall?

277
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,547
I don't know what happens
to the prisoners.

278
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,676
-Who decides?
-I suppose Stannis does.

279
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,264
-He your king now?
-I don't have a king.

280
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,019
You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.

281
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,981
You can never be a kneeler again.

282
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,400
We're going to burn
the bodies of your dead.

283
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,656
-Do you want to say any words over them?
-Words? What kind of words?

284
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,076
Funeral words.
I don't know how the free folk do it.

285
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,077
Do what?

286
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,246
Say farewell.

287
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,583
The dead can't hear us, boy.

288
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,049
Snow.

289
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,471
Did you love her?

290
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,100
She loved you.

291
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,938
-She told you?
-No.

292
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,690
All she ever talked about was killing you.

293
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,068
That's how I know.

294
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,198
She belongs in the North.

295
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,909
The real North.

296
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,454
You understand me?

297
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,022
-We can stop. We can rest.
-We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.

298
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,576
We're not going to make it.

299
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,875
-We're already here.
-Jojen.

300
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,545
Jojen.

301
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,464
Look, Jojen. Look.

302
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:13,593
-Jojen! Come on!
-Help them! Now!

303
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,261
Hold on to me!

304
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,142
Hang on!

305
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,312
-Hodor.
-Help them!

306
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,981
Hodor. Hodor.

307
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,878
Hodor!

308
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,274
Hodor.

309
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,320
Hodor!

310
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,436
Bran!

311
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,276
Save yourself, now!

312
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,886
Come with me, Brandon Stark.

313
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,103
He is lost.

314
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,814
Come with me or die with him.

315
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,025
Go with them.

316
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,048
They cannot follow us.

317
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,717
The power that moves them
is powerless here.

318
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,430
-Who are you?
-The First Men called us the children,

319
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,808
but we were born long before them.

320
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,894
Come, he waits for you.

321
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,481
You're the three-eyed raven?

322
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,862
I've been many things.

323
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,991
Now, I am what you see.

324
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,330
My brother, he led us to you
and now he--

325
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,664
He knew what would happen.

326
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:42,338
From the moment he left,
he knew and he went anyway.

327
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,216
-How do you know?
-I've been watching you.

328
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,887
All of you. All of your lives.

329
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,140
With a thousand eyes and one.

330
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,313
Now, you've come to me at last,
Brandon Stark.

331
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,566
Though the hour is late.

332
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,736
I didn't want anyone to die for me.

333
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,240
He died so you could find
what you have lost.

334
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,701
You're going to help me walk again?

335
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,955
You will never walk again.

336
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,751
But you will fly.

337
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,394
Podrick.

338
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,896
Podrick.

339
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,149
Where are the horses?

340
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,903
-I hobbled them last night.
-What sort of hobble?

341
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,780
A figure eight like you taught me.

342
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,701
If you did it like I taught you,
then the horses would be here.

343
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,161
Thieves, maybe?

344
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,538
It's at least 30 miles
to the Eyrie from here.

345
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,040
You're carrying the saddlebags.

346
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,528
People coming.

347
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,908
You can shit later.
There's people coming.

348
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:37,995
Morning.

349
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,582
Morning.

350
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,210
I like your sword.

351
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,880
Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?

352
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,884
-About ten more miles.
-Do you hear that, Podrick?

353
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,553
Only ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.

354
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,433
-Are you a knight?
-No.

355
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:01,936
But you know how to use that sword?

356
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,188
I do.

357
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,859
-Does it have a name?
-Oathkeeper.

358
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,569
Mine's Needle.

359
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,030
Good name.

360
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,867
Who taught you how to fight?

361
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:19,828
My father.

362
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,290
Mine never wanted to.

363
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,877
Said fighting was for boys.

364
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,629
Mine said the same.

365
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,342
But I kept fighting the boys anyway.
Kept losing.

366
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,010
Finally my father said,

367
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,763
"If you're going to do it,
you might as well do it right."

368
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,602
Seven blessings.

369
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,063
I'm Brienne of Tarth.
This is Podrick Payne.

370
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,401
You want something?

371
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,445
That's Sandor Clegane. The Hound.

372
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,667
You're Arya Stark.

373
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,378
I asked if you wanted something.

374
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,589
I swore to your mother
I would bring you home to her.

375
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,968
-My mother's dead.
-I know.

376
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,722
I wish I could have been there
to protect her.

377
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,766
You're not a northerner.

378
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,602
No, but I swore
a sacred vow to protect her.

379
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,480
Why didn't you?

380
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,571
She commanded me to bring
Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.

381
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,114
You're paid by the Lannisters.

382
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,825
You're here for the bounty on me.

383
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,412
-I'm not paid by the Lannisters.
-No?

384
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,666
Fancy sword you've got there.

385
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,960
Where'd you get it?

386
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,757
I've been looking
at Lannister gold all my life.

387
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:01,430
Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.
Tell me that's not Lannister gold.

388
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,975
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

389
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,355
-The Bloody Gate is ten miles.
-I swore to your mother by the old gods--

390
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,023
-I don't care what you swore.
-Arya!

391
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,399
You heard the girl.

392
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,235
-She's not coming with you.
-She is.

393
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,906
You're not a good listener.

394
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,869
Valyrian steel?
I always wanted some Valyrian steel.

395
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,705
Come with me, Arya.
I'll take you to safety.

396
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,916
Safety? Where the fuck's that?

397
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,668
Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.
Her mother's dead.

398
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,754
Her father's dead. Her brother's dead.

399
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,589
Winterfell is a pile of rubble.

400
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,883
There is no safety, you dumb bitch.

401
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,430
You don't know that by now,
you're the wrong one to watch over her.

402
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,434
And that's what you're doing?
Watching over her?

403
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,354
Aye, that's what I'm doing.

404
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,883
I have no wish to kill you, Ser.

405
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,064
I'm not a knight.

406
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,812
Arya! Arya!

407
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,190
Arya!

408
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,194
-Where is she?
-She was just here.

409
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,405
-Why weren't you watching her?
-I was watching you.

410
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,658
-I thought you might need some help.
-Which way, Pod? Which way did she go?

411
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,784
I think that way.

412
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,869
Arya!

413
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,038
Arya!

414
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:25,944
You're still here?

415
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,206
Big bitch saved you.

416
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,253
-I don't need saving.
-No, not you. You're a real killer.

417
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,088
With your water dancing

418
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,132
and your Needle.

419
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,260
You going to die?

420
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,513
Unless there's a maester
hiding behind that rock.

421
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,766
Arya...

422
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,018
I'm done.

423
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,399
I'd skin you alive for wine.

424
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,194
Fuck water.

425
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,822
Killed by a woman.

426
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,077
I bet you like that.

427
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,622
Go on.

428
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,957
Go after her.

429
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,460
She'll help you.

430
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,757
Going at it alone...

431
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,593
you won't last a day out there.

432
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,346
I'll last longer than you.

433
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,730
You remember where the heart is?

434
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,782
Fuck it. I'm ready.

435
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,578
Go on, girl.

436
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,373
Another name off your list.

437
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,167
You kept promising me.

438
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,635
I cut down your butcher's boy.

439
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,429
The ginger.

440
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,015
He was begging for mercy.

441
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,060
"Please, Ser. Please don't kill me.

442
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,354
Please, please."

443
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,191
Bled all over my horse.

444
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,695
Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks.

445
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,158
And your sister.

446
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,119
Your pretty sister.

447
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,664
I should have taken her.

448
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,126
That night the Blackwater burned.

449
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,046
I should have fucked her bloody.

450
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,717
At least I'd have one happy memory.

451
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,062
Do I have to beg you?

452
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,569
Do it.

453
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,201
Do it.

454
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,247
Do it.

455
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:55,779
Kill me.

456
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,368
Kill me!

457
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,372
Kill me!

458
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,376
Kill me!

459
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,346
Get on with it, you son of a whore.

460
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,099
Is that any way to speak about our mother?

461
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,143
-What are you doing?
-What do you think I'm doing?

462
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,646
A galley's waiting
in the bay bound for the Free Cities.

463
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,189
-Who's helping you?
-Varys.

464
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,941
-Varys?
-You have more friends than you thought.

465
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,580
There's a locked door
at the top of the stairs.

466
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,249
Knock on it twice, then twice again.

467
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,334
Varys will open.

468
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,129
I suppose this is goodbye, then.

469
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:11,813
Farewell, little brother.

470
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,191
Jaime.

471
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,905
Thank you for my life.

472
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,367
Quickly now.

473
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,365
Tywin?

474
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,203
My lion.

475
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:10,909
I'm sorry.

476
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,632
I'm sorry.

477
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,556
Tyrion.

478
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,892
Put down the crossbow.

479
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,106
Who released you?

480
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,403
Your brother, I expect.
He always had a soft spot for you.

481
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,073
Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers.

482
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,580
This is how you want to speak to me?

483
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,333
Shaming your father
has always given you pleasure.

484
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,334
All my life...

485
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,045
you've wanted me dead.

486
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,508
Yes.

487
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,053
But you refused to die. I respect that.

488
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,349
Even admire it.
You fight for what's yours.

489
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,520
I'd never let them execute you.
Is that what you fear?

490
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,440
I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.

491
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,066
You're a Lannister.

492
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,529
You're my son.

493
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,658
I loved her.

494
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,702
Who?

495
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:19,871
Shae.

496
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:21,789
Oh, Tyrion.

497
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,793
-Put down that crossbow.
-I murdered her.

498
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,714
With my own hands.

499
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,929
-It doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter?

500
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,306
She was a whore.

501
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,602
-Say that word again.
-And what?

502
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,771
You'll kill your own father in the privy?

503
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,857
No.

504
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,320
You're my son.
Now, enough of this nonsense.

505
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:59,035
I am your son and you sentenced me to die.
You knew I didn't poison Joffrey,

506
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,455
but you sentenced me all the same.

507
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,582
-Why?
-Enough.

508
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,253
We'll go back to my chambers
and speak with some dignity.

509
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,713
I can't go back there. She's in there.

510
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,215
What, you're afraid of a dead whore?

511
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,021
You shot me.

512
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,492
-You're no son of mine.
-I am your son.

513
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,413
I have always been your son.

514
00:59:58,636 --> 00:59:59,595
What have you done?

515
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,890
Quickly.

516
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,272
Trust me, my friend.
I've brought you this far.

517
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,515
-I want to see the captain.
-You're seeing him.

518
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:10,518
I want to go north, to the Wall.

519
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:12,645
No, you don't.

520
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,149
-I can pay.
-There is nothing in the North

521
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:21,112
-but ice and war and pirates.
-I wouldn't need a cabin. Please.

522
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,406
I could work, scrubbing the floors.

523
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,783
I'm not going north, child.
I'm going home.

524
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,245
-Where's home?
-The Free City of Braavos.

525
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,958
-Wait. I have something else.
-More silver won't make a difference.

526
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,794
It's not silver. It's iron.

527
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,215
This...

528
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:47,513
-How did you--
-Valar morghulis.

529
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,226
Valar dohaeris.

530
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,021
Of course, you shall have a cabin.
