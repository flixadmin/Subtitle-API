1
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,311
Listen.

2
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,147
OK, you win.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,150
But can you turn off that music?

4
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,985
You know I hate that song.

5
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,115
Why won't you say anything?

6
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,912
Say something, damn it!

7
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,992
You're there.

8
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,286
And you're watching me.

9
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,163
What do you think?

10
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,082
You think you can fool me? No.

11
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,293
No. You can't fool me!

12
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,253
I can feel your presence...

13
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,548
and your movements.

14
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,092
I can even smell you.

15
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,764
And if you think, you son of a bitch...

16
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,601
that I'm going to hang myself
while you're there...

17
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,578
We should ask for more time
with the Hubble telescope to study.

18
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,375
- What's up?
- She fainted.

19
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,002
- What happened to her?
- Julia? What is it?

20
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,381
- Julia, are you OK?
- Bring some water.

21
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,007
It's OK, Julia.

22
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,220
- Let her breathe.
- Julia, what happened?

23
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,846
- She fell down.
- Call a doctor.

24
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,848
- No. I'm OK.
- You sure?

25
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,017
It's my sister.

26
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,693
<i>This is Sara. I can't take your call...</i>

27
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,574
Is it wise to turn up like this
after six months?

28
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,285
I just need to know she's OK.

29
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,038
Sara!

30
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,334
Sara!

31
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,463
Maybe she's gone out.

32
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,342
No. Something's happened to her.

33
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,731
The power is out.

34
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,985
The fuses seem OK.

35
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,486
I'm going to look upstairs.

36
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,118
Sara?

37
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,961
Sara?

38
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,489
Isaac, she's not here.
Let's ask the neighbors.

39
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,783
- Don't come down.
- Why not?

40
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,953
What is it?

41
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,750
Isaac, what is it?

42
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,296
- What is it?
- Julia.

43
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,715
- What is it, Isaac?
- Come with me.

44
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,145
Inspector.

45
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,439
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,317
No, thanks.

47
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,947
The forensics team say Sara took her
own life last night during the power cut

48
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,366
but we need to find out why.

49
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,786
I hear she had a degenerative disease.

50
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,914
Yes, a progressive loss of her sight.

51
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,457
Like my wife.

52
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,336
But Sara went blind a year ago.

53
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,630
How was she coping with that?

54
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,050
She wasn't depressed,
if that's what you mean.

55
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,344
In fact...

56
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,597
she was going to have an operation.

57
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,225
She was waiting for a donor, but...

58
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,227
she hoped to regain her sight.

59
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,236
Perhaps she got tired of waiting.

60
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,353
All right.

61
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,107
Yes, thank you.

62
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,866
Dr. Román can't come to the funeral.
He sends his condolences.

63
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,745
He also said he'll check your eyes
before we go.

64
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,122
Isaac, the power is back on.

65
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,376
Darling, are you listening?

66
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,339
The CD player. Did you hear it?

67
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,592
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's weird?

68
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,221
That Sara was listening to music
before she...

69
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,515
And she hated that song.

70
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,392
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?

71
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,146
- What if she was with someone?
- Julia, please.

72
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,484
We'll never know why your sister did this.
We hadn't heard from her in months.

73
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,945
But it's strange,
I need to know what happened.

74
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,655
Don't work yourself up.

75
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,865
I'm not thinking about myself now.

76
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,118
Somebody has to.
Stress could cause an attack of blindness.

77
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,331
Isaac, I've had two attacks in five years!

78
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,542
And you've lost 20 percent of your vision.

79
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,595
Oh, not again!

80
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,155
Any luck?

81
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,158
Nothing. Not even a candle.

82
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,745
It's time to meet the neighbors.

83
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,830
OK, hurry.

84
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,896
Isaac?

85
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,212
Julia.

86
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,872
Excuse me.

87
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,501
Sorry.

88
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,298
I'm sorry for your loss.

89
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,884
My name's Blasco. I live next door.

90
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,179
I didn't really know
your sister very well, but...

91
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,848
Lía really liked her

92
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,267
and she asked me to give you these.

93
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,270
- Lía?
- My daughter.

94
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,107
Sara used to lend her books.

95
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,818
The poor girl is really upset...

96
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,654
and she didn't even want
to get out of the car.

97
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,824
Right, OK.

98
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,617
Excuse me.

99
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,912
Lía would like to know
if Sara left a note.

100
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,290
We don't know anything.

101
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,835
I understand, I understand.

102
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,671
Well, I won't disturb you any longer.

103
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,720
Shall we continue?

104
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,014
A neighbor and his daughter?

105
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,727
I didn't know she was so alone.

106
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,241
But I forgave her...

107
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,580
and I also forgive you.

108
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,839
Now I have to forgive myself
for not being there.

109
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,976
Although I did all I could, didn't I?

110
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,871
The autopsy shows nothing unusual.

111
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,248
You checked every fingerprint
in the house?

112
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,959
And we only found ours and hers.

113
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,296
Yes, but...That song...

114
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,965
And what about at the cemetery?

115
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,803
Julia, there's nothing to suggest
anybody was with your sister.

116
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,390
And nobody saw or heard
anything suspicious.

117
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,437
If you like, you can ask Soledad.

118
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,566
- Who?
- An old lady who lives opposite.

119
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,861
She helped your sister a lot
when she went blind.

120
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,198
Don't be long.

121
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,330
Where did you say she lives?

122
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,542
Follow the rope in the yard.

123
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,794
What rope?

124
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,058
The old lady doesn't know anything.

125
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,978
Apart from you, nobody else knew.

126
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,772
But you must talk to your wife.

127
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,066
She'll find out sooner or later.

128
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,444
I'm waiting for the right time.

129
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,018
Mrs. Soledad?

130
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,610
Hello?

131
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,615
Who is it?

132
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,034
I'm Julia, Sara's sister.

133
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,660
I'll be right out.

134
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,207
Excuse the mess.

135
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,920
I'm sure the house is quite disgusting.

136
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,549
Hello.

137
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,802
- Are you there?
- Yes.

138
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,721
Sorry. I didn't know you were...

139
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,932
No, I'm sorry.

140
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,976
I wanted to go
to your sister's funeral, but...

141
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,688
it took me an hour
to find a matching pair of shoes.

142
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,773
That's all right.

143
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,400
You were Sara's friend, weren't you?

144
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,321
When she started losing her sight...

145
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,701
a year ago, we had some long chats.

146
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,790
But lately, she hardly spoke to me.

147
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,543
She'd made new friends.

148
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,337
What new friends?

149
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,339
Younger people, you know...

150
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,758
From the Baumann Center.

151
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,052
The Baumann Center? What's that?

152
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,430
A center for the blind, not far from here.

153
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,849
One of those places where they tell you

154
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,603
you can still do anything you like
despite being blind.

155
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,606
If you can't hear, you're deaf.

156
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,775
If you lose an arm, you're a cripple.

157
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,694
If you can't see, you're blind.

158
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,072
And nothing is like it was before.

159
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,368
Mrs. Soledad, can you tell me
where to get a taxi?

160
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,412
Thanks.

161
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,164
BAUMANN CENTER

162
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,712
- Yes, go down the stairs.
- Thanks.

163
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,519
<i>I'm going to miss her.</i>

164
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,604
<i>You didn't even like her.</i>

165
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,314
<i>No, that's not true.</i>

166
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,067
<i>I don't understand why she did it.</i>

167
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:11,363
Poor Sara. But to hang yourself
in the basement?

168
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,282
How about a minute of silence?

169
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,618
- Don't be cruel, Nora.
- Cruel? None of us could stand her.

170
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,413
But don't you think it's strange?

171
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,623
No.

172
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,293
We've all thought about doing it.

173
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,461
Dela!

174
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,591
Nora is right.
I once considered slitting my wrists...

175
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,968
with candles and opera playing!

176
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,805
Me too. Throwing myself out the window.

177
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,184
OK, we've thought about it
but we haven't done it.

178
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,520
Because there's always a reason
to keep living, right?

179
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,106
Sara obviously didn't find one.

180
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,943
And isn't a boyfriend a good reason?

181
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,030
Sara had a boyfriend?

182
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,574
She told me she'd met a guy.

183
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,785
- Who?
- No idea.

184
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,121
They'd been going out
for a couple of months.

185
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,249
They even spent a week in Bellavista.

186
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,670
What's in Bellavista?

187
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,130
Hotel rooms!

188
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,425
Quiet, you lot!

189
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,353
That's strange. Shit!

190
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,480
What?

191
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,734
There's someone in here.
I think it's Sara.

192
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
Shut up, Nora! That's not funny!

193
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,364
I can smell her too!

194
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,615
Something moved!

195
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,160
I've got her! Call security!

196
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,329
I'm Sara's sister! I'm Sara's sister.

197
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,456
Julia?

198
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,500
Yes.

199
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,335
Why were you spying on us?

200
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,671
No. I just didn't know how to interrupt.

201
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,549
- And who's he?
- Who?

202
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,093
- The man with you.
- I came alone.

203
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,430
There's someone else here. A man.

204
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,391
And he's behind you.

205
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,829
Wait!

206
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,442
Shit!

207
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,044
Who's there?

208
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,297
Turn around.

209
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,549
Turn around.

210
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,843
I said turn around!

211
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,840
No. No!

212
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,821
Isaac?

213
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,454
Isaac?

214
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,556
"Hotel Romeo, Bellavista."

215
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,769
What happened to you?

216
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,854
You're soaking.

217
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,900
I got caught in the rain
when I left Soledad's house.

218
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,486
You were with her all this time?

219
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,990
She offered me tea. I couldn't say no.

220
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,993
Julia. I went to find you.

221
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,579
I know you left there an hour ago.

222
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,956
Where have you been?

223
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,834
Now you're controlling me?

224
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,378
I could also ask what you're looking for.

225
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,342
OK, fine.

226
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,803
Fine.

227
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,807
I'm sure there's something
strange about Sara's suicide.

228
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,768
Someone is watching our every move.

229
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,063
Julia, for god's sake. Who?

230
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,567
Her boyfriend.

231
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,445
Sara had a boyfriend?

232
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,405
- Yes.
- How do you know?

233
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,243
I went to the Baumann Center,
and someone was spying on us.

234
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,912
- How do you know?
- I chased him.

235
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,915
- You chased him?
- Yes, I chased him.

236
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,084
Isaac!

237
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,796
- Isaac, what are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.

238
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,592
If I have to play
the controlling husband, I will.

239
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,886
And I'll drag you out of here
if I have to,

240
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,055
but I won't let you have another attack.

241
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,808
I could never forgive myself.

242
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,728
What happened with your sister
was bad enough.

243
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,988
You're right.

244
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,242
But I really don't want to go home.

245
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:16,163
Why don't we go somewhere nearby,
just me and you? Alone.

246
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,300
Where would you like to go?

247
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,562
WELCOME TO BELLAVISTA

248
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,619
Sure you want to stay here?

249
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,621
The guidebook says it's cozy.

250
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,590
Nice view, isn't it?

251
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,637
- Julia?
- Yes, yes. Delightful.

252
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,472
Thank you.

253
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,392
Julia, I'm going to park the car.

254
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,769
Yeah, OK.

255
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,776
Are you sure you don't remember?
A blind woman?

256
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,612
Ah, yes. A colleague told me about her.

257
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,281
I know this might seem odd, but...

258
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,909
could you check the name
of the man she was with?

259
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,203
It's not on the bill.

260
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,330
Sorry, I don't remember a man with her.

261
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:45,001
My sister is dead,
and so I need to find him.

262
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,504
Let's see, I don't understand.

263
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,757
There's no record of her reservation.

264
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,719
It's as if the details have been deleted.

265
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,638
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

266
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,515
It must be a computer problem.

267
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,518
Try at the Harlequin.

268
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,396
It's a restaurant
we recommend to our guests.

269
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,315
Thank you. Thank you.

270
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,615
Thank you.

271
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,327
God knows why
they recommended this restaurant.

272
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,079
I like it.

273
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,667
It's not really your style.

274
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,426
And that waiter
can't take his eyes off you.

275
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,510
Yeah, right!

276
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,268
It's your imagination.

277
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,811
Maybe.

278
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,525
My reading glasses...

279
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,153
In your coat? How strange!

280
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,573
I'll go and get them
and go to the bathroom.

281
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,866
OK.

282
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,745
If he tries anything, scream.

283
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,841
That's quite a change.

284
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,802
I like it. It brings out your eyes.

285
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,096
By the way, I knew they were green.

286
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,350
You're confusing me with my twin sister.

287
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,227
She was here last week,
with her boyfriend.

288
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,813
Her boyfriend?

289
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,607
She was with a man, right?

290
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,361
Yes, I think she was, yes.

291
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,863
Do you remember his name?

292
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:41,659
No, no idea.
He was very reserved, very plain.

293
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,205
- Could you describe him?
- Yes, he was...

294
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,460
I don't know, he was just normal.

295
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,712
But was he tall, short, fair, dark?

296
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,426
It's funny, I couldn't tell you.

297
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,055
How come you remember my sister
but not him?

298
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,308
It was hard not to notice her,
because of the bandages.

299
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
Bandages?

300
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,314
From the operation.

301
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,197
- My sister had had an operation?
- Yes.

302
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,199
I guessed the color of her eyes.

303
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,701
She said when she'd recovered
she'd come back,

304
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,121
and if I got the color right,
then maybe...

305
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,873
- Pablo, will you come here a moment?
- Of course.

306
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,583
Excuse me. Give her my regards.

307
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,884
I couldn't find them.

308
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,264
We'll have to manage.

309
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,813
Is something wrong?

310
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,946
Sara was here last week.

311
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,787
Julia, what are we doing here?

312
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:12,459
Isaac, the waiter says
she had a bandage over her eyes.

313
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,668
Don't you see?

314
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,046
If she'd had the operation

315
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,340
and was hoping to get her sight back,

316
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,634
why would she kill herself?

317
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,304
Tell me, why?

318
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,398
Because the operation didn't work.

319
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,651
What?

320
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,154
It didn't work.

321
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,575
Dr. Román told me yesterday.

322
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,126
I was waiting for the moment to tell you.

323
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,066
That man exists.

324
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,527
- He exists.
- Julia! Julia!

325
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,614
- What else haven't you told me?
- I wanted to protect you.

326
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,741
- From what?
- From the truth, Julia.

327
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,160
And what is the truth?

328
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,415
Sara killed herself because
she couldn't bear being blind.

329
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,133
Julia.

330
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,220
Julia.

331
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,600
You know she came here with her boyfriend?

332
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,061
That doesn't prove anything.

333
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,063
Then why is he hiding?

334
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,941
Why didn't he come to the funeral? Why?

335
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,986
He probably left her.

336
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,408
He probably left her when
he found out she wouldn't see again.

337
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,246
Just like that?

338
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,875
- Just like that, huh?
- Well...

339
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,502
- And you're a psychologist.
- Julia!

340
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
God!

341
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,138
What are you doing?

342
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,100
Julia! Julia! Didn't you see it?

343
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,901
You didn't see it, did you?

344
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,617
How many attacks have you had?

345
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,369
- Two.
- Shit!

346
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,081
Shit.

347
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,542
Shit.

348
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,716
If...

349
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,469
If I go blind...When I go blind...

350
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,721
No! That's not going to happen.

351
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,060
Not wanting it to happen
doesn't mean it won't.

352
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,652
Isaac...

353
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,991
You once told me that...

354
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,121
you could see the universe in my eyes.

355
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,751
And I still can.

356
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,670
What if that universe goes dark?

357
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,510
Close your eyes.

358
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,721
What?

359
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,265
Close your eyes.

360
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,858
Can you see me?

361
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,861
Of course I can't.

362
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,241
How do you know I'm still here?

363
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,994
Because I can hear you.

364
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,248
And if I'm silent?

365
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,459
How do you know I'm still here?

366
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,768
I can touch you.

367
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,773
And you can smell me.

368
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,029
And kiss you.

369
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,764
Promise me that if the day comes,
we'll return to the desert.

370
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,266
Yes.

371
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,685
You know why?

372
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,565
The last thing I want to see
is that sky...with you.

373
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,943
- Julia.
- Promise me.

374
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,113
Promise me.

375
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,116
I promise.

376
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,873
But you have to promise me...

377
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,544
that you'll stop chasing ghosts...

378
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,798
and that you'll see Dr. Román.

379
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,259
Tomorrow.

380
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,971
OK.

381
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,199
I'll put the cases in the car.

382
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,120
I'll meet you at the entrance
in 15 minutes.

383
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,130
Miss Levin.

384
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,634
Miss Levin.

385
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,263
I'm very sorry for your loss.

386
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,350
My name is Créspulo.

387
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,437
I read about your sister
in the obituaries section.

388
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,231
Thank you.

389
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,650
I have something of hers.

390
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,905
A few hours after your sister left...

391
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:03,077
I found a key under the bed in her room.

392
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,914
I think I put it down here.

393
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,050
Thank you.

394
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,317
Mr. Créspulo? Oh, sorry, sorry.

395
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,237
Mr. Créspulo...

396
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,240
My sister was here with a man, right?

397
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,367
The invisible man.

398
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,289
Pardon?

399
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,587
The man who came with your sister,
nobody remembers him, right?

400
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,675
Well...

401
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,762
That doesn't mean he was invisible.

402
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,680
Some people have no light.

403
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,143
Do you know what it is to enter a room
and have nobody look at you?

404
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:15,149
Or to walk along the street
and have people stumble into you?

405
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,615
Or to ask something three times
and nobody answers?

406
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,451
That's the man you're looking for.

407
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,871
A silence. A void.

408
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,583
An absence.

409
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,670
That's why nobody remembers him.

410
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,464
Nobody except you.

411
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,887
In a way, I'm kind of invisible too.

412
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,976
It's been years
since anybody remembered me.

413
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,063
That man...

414
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,774
Do you know where I can find him?

415
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,488
What are you afraid of?

416
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:08,327
He had his van parked up
in a garage two streets down.

417
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,375
There's a security camera on it
24 hours a day.

418
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,587
Thank you.

419
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,006
Wait!

420
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,258
Be careful.

421
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,260
The man who was with your sister

422
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,179
had a lot of rage in his eyes.

423
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,599
He knows how to be a shadow.

424
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:34,937
And if somebody feels invisible
and is angry at the world...

425
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,814
they're dangerous.

426
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,151
He has no light. Nobody looks at him.

427
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,529
He could get close
without you realizing and...

428
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,349
- Where were you?
- Did anyone come out?

429
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,101
- I've been waiting for ten minutes.
- Wait.

430
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,022
He's here. And I know how to find him.

431
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,113
No! I'll go and ask the security guard.

432
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,742
- OK. Calm down.
- No. You wait here, OK?

433
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,119
Shit, no need to be like that.

434
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,581
Let me remind you that you made a promise.

435
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,042
- OK, OK.
- I can't take this, Julia!

436
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,752
- Stop shouting.
- I've had enough!

437
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,004
- Listen...
- There's no mystery!

438
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,591
- I want to know who she was with.
- You want this video? I'll get it!

439
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,761
But this bullshit ends here,
you understand?

440
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,805
Jesus Christ!

441
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,412
<i>You've reached the voicemail...</i>

442
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:44,150
Excuse me? Did a man come in here
asking for a security video?

443
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,903
Look, I don't want any trouble.

444
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,072
The guy came, gave me money

445
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,825
- ...and promised he wouldn't tell.
- He's my husband.

446
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,827
I've been waiting for him.

447
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,829
Do you know where he went?

448
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,709
He left as soon as this bad boy
made the copies he wanted.

449
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,046
And...was there anyone else here?

450
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,716
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.

451
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,844
If you want, we can check the monitors.

452
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,722
What the hell?

453
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,481
I'll be right back.

454
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,987
Fucking hell!

455
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,698
What is it?

456
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,373
It's OK, it's me.

457
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,959
Somebody shut off the power.

458
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,756
This can't be happening.

459
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,717
This can't be happening.

460
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,260
No.

461
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,037
My husband has been abducted
and he's in danger.

462
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:24,166
At the moment, all we know is
that someone took the security video.

463
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,709
No! I'm telling you.

464
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,879
The man who was with my sister
is behind all this.

465
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,840
You have to find him before it's too late.

466
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:36,011
How can we find a man
who nobody seems to have ever seen?

467
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,263
Not even you.

468
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,937
Créspulo.

469
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,944
He was the only one who knew.

470
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,989
There's no sign of violence,
it looks like an accident.

471
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,616
It's the invisible man.

472
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,701
- He's covering his tracks.
- What?

473
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,287
You've got to find him!
My husband is in danger!

474
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,831
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Isaac!

475
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,376
- Call a doctor!
- My husband...

476
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,003
We need a doctor here, now!

477
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,885
Isaac!

478
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,653
The process is irreversible.

479
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,488
How long do I have?

480
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,990
I don't know.

481
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,577
It could be hours, days, maybe weeks.

482
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,371
But less than a month.

483
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,666
We have to find a donor
and operate as soon as possible.

484
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,334
Did you meet Sara's boyfriend?

485
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,713
No, I never met him.

486
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,593
Julia, I know you've had a rough time...

487
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,221
but you have to think of yourself.

488
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,809
Please try to avoid
any more emotional strain.

489
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,354
And don't force your sight, OK?

490
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,452
Iván! Iván!

491
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,287
Iván!

492
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,343
A boyfriend?

493
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,179
Sara never mentioned a boyfriend.

494
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,683
She didn't trust men.

495
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,311
Not like me. Or you.

496
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,439
I'm sure Isaac hasn't left me.

497
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,108
That's what we all say.

498
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,612
I invented a story too
when my husband left me.

499
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,408
My husband couldn't stand my son Ángel.

500
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,745
But my son was more important to me
than anything.

501
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,915
Then my eyesight degenerated and...

502
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,750
I went blind.

503
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,005
Fortunately, Ángel looked after me
for 10 years.

504
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,299
Then, one morning, I woke up and...

505
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,719
he'd gone too.

506
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,013
My Ángel had gone.

507
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,226
What kind of son
abandons his blind mother?

508
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,979
I had to invent another story.

509
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,815
And I still stick to it.

510
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,612
How humiliating. I'm sorry.

511
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,197
Don't worry.

512
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,831
Hello?

513
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,167
<i>The hotel is automated.</i>

514
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,712
<i>There are no staff,</i>
<i>guests check in using an ATM.</i>

515
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,089
The bank called me this morning.

516
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,883
A transaction was carried out

517
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,177
with your husband's credit card.

518
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,512
I searched the room

519
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,223
and I found this on the bedside table.

520
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,936
Julia, there are things
you don't know about your husband.

521
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,481
He hid Sara's operation from you.

522
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,108
He did it to protect me.
Dr. Román told him.

523
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,070
Román says he didn't
tell anyone about the operation.

524
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,032
So how did your husband know?

525
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,578
Inspector, a patrol car
just drove by Sara's house.

526
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,747
They saw lights on inside.

527
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,004
Isaac?

528
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,092
Wait here, Julia. Don't move.

529
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,334
Isaac?

530
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,231
Hello?

531
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,235
Isaac?

532
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,909
Isaac?

533
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,131
Julia!

534
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,177
Shit! I have to get out of here!

535
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,887
Where is it?

536
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,430
Relax.

537
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,600
Where is the exit? Calm down.

538
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,063
Julia? Julia?

539
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,820
Inspector! There's somebody down here.
Inspector!

540
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,238
Inspector!

541
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,534
Julia, calm down, it's me.

542
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,623
Somebody is here!

543
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,126
Somebody is here!

544
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,888
What is it?

545
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,265
What is it?

546
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,645
Turn on the torch, I can't stand the dark.

547
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,190
Please, say something.

548
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,234
Why won't you say something?

549
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,334
Thank you.

550
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,381
Hello.

551
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,012
There's something you need to know, Julia.

552
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,099
Your husband left a note.

553
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,271
We checked the handwriting,
it was definitely written by him.

554
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,190
Listen...

555
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,903
Sara and Isaac
had been lovers for six months.

556
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,073
He asks you to forgive him.

557
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,078
This explains the calls
to your sister's number

558
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,289
that we found on your husband's mobile.

559
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,210
Did you know that
they had been in contact?

560
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,389
Think, Julia.

561
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,310
It was Isaac who insisted
on getting the security video.

562
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,106
Probably because he was on it
and he didn't want you to find out.

563
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,110
Then when he went to the motel,

564
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,946
he decided he couldn't live without Sara.

565
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,495
I'm sorry, Julia,
but everything make sense.

566
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,346
We've found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.

567
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,931
You just have to sign here.

568
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,815
Thank you.

569
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,504
Calm down, Julia.

570
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,883
Calm down. Sleep a bit more.

571
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:21,972
Listen, Julia.

572
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,932
Everything went well.

573
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,018
But we have to be very careful.

574
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,398
Your eyes must be protected
from all light for two weeks.

575
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,110
And you mustn't ever remove the bandages.

576
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,820
If you take them off too soon...

577
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,030
there'll be no cure.

578
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,117
But don't worry,
they'll look after you here.

579
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,494
No.

580
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,123
I'd prefer to go home, please.
I hate hospitals.

581
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,709
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible.

582
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,794
You need to be under supervision.

583
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,256
OK...I can go to my sister's house,

584
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,425
where I know my way around.

585
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,763
Julia, I don't think it's a good idea.

586
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,725
Right. If I can't see, I can't feel.

587
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,230
Look, I tell you what.

588
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,357
You can go to your sister's house...

589
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,570
but a caregiver
will visit you every day, OK?

590
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,495
Julia, there's something else.

591
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,208
Your husband's body
is still in the hospital.

592
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,252
- You want me to deal with it?
- No.

593
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,674
No, I'd prefer to do it myself.

594
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,386
Can we keep the body
until I can see again?

595
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,431
I need to say goodbye to him.

596
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:01,696
Let's go to the sofa.
Keep going, a bit more.

597
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,408
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.

598
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,162
- Careful, don't worry.
- It's OK.

599
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,455
It's all there.

600
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,836
Shall we wait until the caregiver arrives?

601
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,715
- Can you do me a favor?
- Sure. What is it?

602
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,717
I'd like to know what this key is for.

603
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,190
Whatever this key opens,
it's not in this house.

604
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,985
- Are you sure you tried all the locks?
- Yes.

605
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,362
Do you need anything else?

606
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,199
No, thank you. You can go now.

607
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,409
- It's OK.
- OK.

608
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,357
- Hello?
- Hello. You must be Julia, right?

609
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,859
I'm Iván, your caregiver.

610
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,445
Sorry I'm late, the traffic was terrible.

611
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,030
I called but I got cut off.

612
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,202
I would have preferred a woman.

613
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,041
Well, you can call Dr. Román...
What happened to your hand?

614
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,546
It's only a superficial cut.

615
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,216
By tomorrow morning,
you won't even feel it.

616
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,304
Now I'll make dinner and tidy up.
You stay there.

617
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,307
By the way...

618
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,561
what should I do with the glasses?

619
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,605
Throw them away.

620
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,862
While you were eating,
I had a look around the house.

621
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,782
Julia...

622
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,745
- Julia. Sorry.
- What are you doing?

623
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,413
It's time for me to go now.

624
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,498
What time is it?

625
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,500
Nine o'clock, Julia.

626
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,003
The first few days,
you lose track of time.

627
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,882
I'll leave you some sleeping pills,
just in case.

628
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,427
And I'll leave you a pager.

629
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,223
If you need to contact me,
press the button. Give me your hand.

630
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,435
Here, this is the button. OK?

631
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,737
- Come on.
- What?

632
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,072
I have to put you to bed.

633
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,825
No, I can do that myself.

634
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,660
Are you sure?

635
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,337
Are you all right?

636
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,799
All right, all right. You win.

637
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,302
Put me to bed, then you can go.

638
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,079
Who's there?

639
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,127
It's OK.

640
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,129
It's OK, darling.

641
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,381
It's me.

642
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,217
Isaac?

643
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,887
Isaac.

644
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,264
How can this be?

645
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,315
Don't say anything.

646
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,817
What are you doing here?

647
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,863
- What are you doing?
- Take it off.

648
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,824
Take off this dirty bandage...

649
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,661
so you can see me better.

650
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,745
No!

651
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,209
Get off me!

652
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,462
Let me go! Get off! No!

653
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,214
Don't resist, little sister.

654
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,384
It's two against one.

655
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,681
No! No!

656
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,642
- Stay still!
- No! Stop it!

657
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,853
No!

658
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,105
Let me go!

659
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,829
Oh, god.

660
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,893
Iván, Iván.

661
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,395
<i>Julia, is everything OK?</i>

662
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,648
I think there's somebody in the house.

663
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,733
<i>What?</i>

664
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,776
In the room next door.

665
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,697
- <i>Don't move, I'll call the police.</i>
- No, Iván. Iván!

666
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,714
<i>OK. Are you still there?</i>

667
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,177
Yes. Get me out of here.

668
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,680
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- In the guest bedroom.

669
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,517
<i>OK, find the door</i>
<i>and walk out of the room.</i>

670
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,104
<i>Find the wall, to your right.</i>

671
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,692
- He's there.
- <i>Calm down.</i>

672
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,612
<i>OK. Two paces in front of you,</i>
<i>there's the banister.</i>

673
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,865
- OK, yes.
- <i>Hold on to the banister.</i>

674
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,077
<i>There are six steps to the first landing.</i>

675
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,042
<i>Now, there are nine more.</i>

676
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,545
<i>Julia?</i>

677
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,216
I'm down, what do I do now?

678
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,010
<i>Find the wall, then follow it to the door.</i>

679
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,771
- Who are you? Who are you?
- <i>What's going on?</i>

680
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,982
- I don't know!
- <i>Get out of the house. Get outside!</i>

681
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,253
There's no sign
that anyone entered the house.

682
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,046
Someone was inside.

683
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,215
They were looking for something.

684
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:02,468
I'm sorry, but that's all I can do.

685
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,058
- Shall I call the hospital?
- What for?

686
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,396
Perhaps you shouldn't stay here,
after what's happened.

687
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,314
You don't believe me either?

688
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,191
No. But in your condition...

689
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,069
it's normal for your senses
to confuse you.

690
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,406
Don't open your eyes
under any circumstances.

691
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,285
You can let go now.

692
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,747
What is it?

693
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,042
My eyes could get damaged.

694
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,963
No, I just want to change the bandage.
I'm being careful.

695
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,967
I've done this hundreds of times.
Don't worry.

696
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:50,933
You know, when I was 20,

697
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,770
I had a car accident
which left me blind for two months.

698
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,775
And like you, I imagined things...

699
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,652
and I had nightmares.

700
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,071
And I refused help.

701
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,535
I couldn't bear the idea of going blind.

702
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,377
In the end, I got my sight back...

703
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,424
but during those two months...

704
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,929
I understood what it meant
to live in the dark.

705
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,227
That's why I became a nurse.

706
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,856
You invented that to make me feel better.

707
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,692
No. Call the hospital
if you don't believe me.

708
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,154
Julia, I know you're frightened,

709
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,281
but the only way to lose your fear...

710
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:49,909
is to fight it.

711
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,793
What do you say?

712
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,256
Will you let me help you?

713
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:12,515
- Julia. Hold it over...
- Let me do it. Let me.

714
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,976
- What happened?
- You spilled a bit.

715
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:18,312
Try and get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...

716
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,149
Exactly, from the wooden chest
to the glass cabinet.

717
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,402
And then, from the glass cabinet...

718
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,655
- It's really difficult.
- What can you feel?

719
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,240
My eyes, my nose...

720
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:32,285
My nose is easy,
it's the biggest part of my body.

721
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,712
I've got it. You're going to love this.

722
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,756
You'll love this,
it's Beethoven's summer hits.

723
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,887
Yes, I've had my low points.

724
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:54,390
But I've managed to sleep
through the night.

725
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,393
Iván has been very patient
with me all week.

726
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:01,272
Yes, he looks after me well. I will.

727
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,067
I will, yes. Thanks for calling. Bye.

728
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,323
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, it's getting late.

729
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,700
Why not stay a bit longer?

730
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,037
Just a while.

731
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,080
- Are you still afraid?
- No.

732
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,082
No, it's not that.

733
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,460
It doesn't matter.

734
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,924
OK. A special dinner for two?

735
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,553
- Watch TV, I'll do everything.
- That could be difficult.

736
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,973
- Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
- I'll help you.

737
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,244
You've drunk a lot.

738
01:05:58,579 --> 01:05:59,914
I'm celebrating something.

739
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:01,916
What?

740
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,628
That in four days' time...

741
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,923
they take my bandages off
and I'll be able to see.

742
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,468
It will be all right, Julia.

743
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,680
You know what?

744
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,934
If the operation doesn't work,
I couldn't complain.

745
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,813
I've already seen all I wanted to see.

746
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,651
What is the most beautiful thing
you've seen?

747
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,699
That's funny.
It's ironic you should ask me that.

748
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,575
Why?

749
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,663
Because I've spent my life...

750
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,874
looking for invisible planets.

751
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,168
My eyes have seen amazing things...

752
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,171
but nothing...

753
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,758
compares to the night sky over the Sahara.

754
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,139
That was where I met Isaac.

755
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:03,185
We were on the same excursion
and we spent a whole night...

756
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,690
contemplating the stars.

757
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:12,737
I asked him if it was
the prettiest thing he'd ever seen.

758
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:15,906
And he said yes.

759
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,040
When I turned around...

760
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,669
I realized he'd been watching me,
and I got really nervous.

761
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,131
And so I asked him...

762
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,553
why he wasn't contemplating the universe.

763
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,681
And he said...

764
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,642
"I don't need to look up to do that...

765
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,813
I can see the universe in your eyes."

766
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,276
And what happened?

767
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:56,989
I came closer.

768
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,284
I touched him.

769
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,121
And I noticed that he was nervous too.

770
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:08,209
At that moment,
it was as if we became one.

771
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,004
I wanted to know if he felt the same.

772
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,423
What did he say?

773
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,384
Nothing.

774
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,180
He answered me with a look.

775
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,557
Why?

776
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:27,019
Why did he have to look at me like that?
Why?

777
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,066
- Would you have preferred he hadn't?
- I don't know.

778
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:38,030
When he had the affair with Sara,
I thought it was just a mistake, but...

779
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,784
I swear I don't know anymore.

780
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,329
I don't know what to think.

781
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,001
Everything will be OK, Julia.

782
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:55,464
Do you promise?

783
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,009
I promise.

784
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,656
No, no, I can't.

785
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,617
I can't do this. It's not right.

786
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,793
- Iván! Iván...
- No, don't say anything.

787
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:36,088
- I'm sorry, very sorry.
- You don't have to say anything.

788
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,883
I'll ask the hospital to replace me.

789
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,092
Is that what you want?

790
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:43,596
And you?

791
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,565
If you don't say anything,
I'll come back tomorrow.

792
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,152
If not, you can tell me with the pager.

793
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,912
Help! Help!

794
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,332
Help!

795
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,337
It's OK! It's Blasco, your neighbor.

796
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:41,880
Lía's father.

797
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,258
Call the police! Please!

798
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,220
It's OK, you could use a drink.

799
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,015
No, call the police first, please.

800
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,184
Why do you want to call the police?

801
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,228
To explain another nightmare?

802
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,439
- They didn't believe you last time.
- No!

803
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,524
There was somebody next to my bed.

804
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:02,484
I swear this time it's true.

805
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,862
And what did he want? To rape you?

806
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,782
It's my daughter. She can't sleep.

807
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,452
What did I tell you about spying?

808
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,078
Get back to bed right now!

809
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,289
And shut the door!

810
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:17,875
Mr. Blasco.

811
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,170
Can you call now, please?

812
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:28,218
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

813
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,515
That's strange. The line is dead.

814
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,980
It's OK. I'll get the mobile.

815
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,103
The mobile battery is flat.

816
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,772
It will take a few minutes to charge up.

817
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,693
You sit down here. Sit down.

818
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:30,489
Sit down. Sit down.

819
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,283
What do you say?

820
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:36,120
Shall we have that drink

821
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,372
while we wait for it to charge up?

822
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:40,999
What do you say?

823
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,544
Could you bring me some water, please?

824
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:44,920
Water?

825
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:47,840
Yes. I've got a dry mouth.

826
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,008
Yes, OK.

827
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,110
Julia, where are you going?

828
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,279
Hey, hold on!

829
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,073
Hey!

830
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,702
Miss, where are you going?

831
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,662
Miss.

832
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,541
Iván, please answer.

833
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,127
Iván!

834
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:29,006
- Answer, please, Iván...
- <i>Julia, what is it?</i>

835
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,313
- My god, Julia!
- Iván!

836
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,148
Come on, let's get you home.

837
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,025
No! Not my house! Your house!

838
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:50,527
- Calm down!
- My house isn't safe!

839
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,446
Please, take me to your house!

840
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:56,241
OK.

841
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,578
OK, thanks. Bye.

842
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,707
What did they say?

843
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,711
Inspector Dimas isn't on duty till 7:00.

844
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,509
You should try to sleep a bit
and I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

845
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,721
Julia, I won't let anybody hurt you.
Calm down.

846
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,559
- You can sleep in my bed.
- And you?

847
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,228
I'll get the fold-out bed.

848
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,897
- No!
- I'll only be two minutes.

849
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,440
- I'll come.
- You're safe.

850
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,067
- OK.
- I'll be right back.

851
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,028
OK.

852
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,876
Iván?

853
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,918
- Don't scream.
- Who is it?

854
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,503
- It's Lía.
- Who is it?

855
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,796
Lía Blasco.

856
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:36,592
- Get away! How did you find me?
- I followed you. I was Sara's friend.

857
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,135
I don't care! Get away.

858
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:41,430
My father has nothing to do with all this.

859
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:45,726
- No? Your father lied to me.
- He's lonely and you're attractive.

860
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:47,603
Why should I believe you?

861
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,772
Because it was me who took the key
and was spying on you.

862
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,942
- Do you have nightmares?
- What?

863
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,986
Sara had them too.

864
01:16:56,486 --> 01:17:00,574
She dreamt someone stabbed her
in the eyes with needles.

865
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:02,784
There's a monster out there.

866
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,495
Nobody can see him
because he hides in the dark.

867
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,956
He made her blind
and he'll do the same to you!

868
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,627
- That's enough, Lía!
- It's him, Julia. I followed him.

869
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,545
And today I saw the needles again.

870
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,298
- It's your nurse, Julia.
- No!

871
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,177
Listen to me!

872
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:24,848
Do you think Isaac committed suicide?
He loved you.

873
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:29,102
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want you to worry.

874
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,813
- No!
- That's why they didn't tell you.

875
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:35,025
- Sara told me.
- Isaac left a note, leave me alone.

876
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,820
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters aren't real, Lía!

877
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:40,405
This one is.

878
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,326
He collects images.

879
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,914
He has a wall full of photos,
of you and Sara.

880
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,251
- He took your eyes.
- Enough, Lía, enough!

881
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:55,462
Get off me!

882
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:59,091
What are you doing?

883
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,054
If you don't believe me, use the key.

884
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,601
- The key! Where is it?
- It was him.

885
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,187
- No, you took the key.
- Me? Why?

886
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,564
I don't know! To protect your father.

887
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,485
- It's him. Don't tell him I'm here.
- Lía! Lía!

888
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,742
- Iván?
- Julia, what are you doing?

889
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,537
I'm really scared.

890
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,832
I'll make you a herbal tea.

891
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,292
It will help you relax.

892
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,629
- Iván?
- Yes?

893
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,465
I can't find the key.

894
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:43,218
It's the only proof I have against Blasco.

895
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:45,721
Did you take it?

896
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:01,403
It was on the floor.

897
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,531
- Yes. Give it to me.
- I'll keep it, you're too nervous.

898
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:07,617
I'll make you that tea.
You sit down and relax.

899
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,796
He's lying to you. He had the key.

900
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,883
- We have to get out of here.
- No, I don't want to.

901
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,342
Don't you believe me?

902
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,428
It's impossible, he's a good nurse.

903
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,015
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

904
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,141
It's locked.

905
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,061
- Julia?
- Yes?

906
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:38,857
- Sugar?
- Two, please.

907
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,281
- He wants to drug you and blind you.
- What?

908
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,825
- Can you take off the bandage?
- No! Why?

909
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,161
Then we can't go out the window.

910
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,538
I have to get the key.

911
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:56,750
Get away from him somehow
and meet me in the bathroom.

912
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,251
Lía.

913
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:00,629
Here you go.

914
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,008
Come on, I'll show you to bed
and sit with you.

915
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,183
I'd like to go to the bathroom.

916
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,436
OK.

917
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,025
Thanks.

918
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:00,897
Julia, is everything OK?

919
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,233
Yes, what was that noise?

920
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,151
I don't know, I heard it too.

921
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:07,279
I thought it was you.

922
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,240
Your tea is getting cold.

923
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:11,908
Yes, OK. I'll be right out.

924
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,374
Lía, please, Lía, Lía.

925
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:25,213
Four days, only four more days.

926
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:28,925
Only four more days.

927
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:30,886
No.

928
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:47,068
Julia, I'm going back to the basement.
Are you OK?

929
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,070
Yes, I'll be right out.

930
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,236
Lía.

931
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:14,698
Lía.

932
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:48,440
What are you doing here?

933
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,528
Why are you crying?

934
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,658
Answer me, Julia, please.

935
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:03,496
A girl...There was a girl here.

936
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,042
Lía, Blasco's daughter.

937
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,085
And I got scared.

938
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:11,755
Why did you take your bandage off?

939
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:13,131
I couldn't see.

940
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,217
She said horrible things about you.

941
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:18,344
And I was scared.

942
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,013
Of me?

943
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,475
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

944
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:26,686
No.

945
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:31,983
I needed to see your face to be sure.

946
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:35,862
And what did you see?

947
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,746
Nothing...I can't see anything.

948
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,023
Are you sure you can't see?

949
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:23,952
Sometimes the eyes take time to readapt.

950
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,634
The operation didn't work, Iván.

951
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,102
I'm very sorry, Julia.

952
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,776
That girl was probably lying
to protect her father.

953
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:03,908
Tomorrow, we'll talk to the inspector
and it'll all be over.

954
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,369
No! No.

955
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,914
No, please, let's go to the hospital now.

956
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:11,916
- We'll call Dr. Román first.
- Please!

957
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,501
We'll call Dr. Román, Julia!

958
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:17,422
- Now.
- Julia, trust me.

959
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:23,386
Dr. Román? It's Iván.

960
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:25,930
I'm sorry to wake you at this hour.

961
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:28,892
We've got a problem with Julia Levin.

962
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,396
She accidentally took off her bandage.

963
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:45,200
Understood, yes, I'll tell her.

964
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,118
Thank you, and sorry to bother you.

965
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,414
- Well?
- He's at a conference in Geneva.

966
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:53,249
We can't do anything now.

967
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:56,961
- Then take me to the hospital.
- No, Dr. Román said you have to rest.

968
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:59,547
I need a second opinion.

969
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,883
Julia, the damage is done.

970
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:05,720
If you don't do as I say,
it'll be irreversible.

971
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:15,313
OK. OK.

972
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:49,889
Why did you get up?

973
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:52,016
The kettle was whistling.

974
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,186
No, no. I'll do it. You sit down.

975
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,480
Careful.

976
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:01,317
That's it.

977
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:14,622
This is almost ready.

978
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:32,640
Here you are.

979
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:34,892
Thank you.

980
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:53,578
What is it?

981
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,793
Why are you doing all this, Iván?

982
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:08,885
What do you mean?

983
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,429
Why all this attention?

984
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:16,893
What do you want from me?

985
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,897
Look, Julia, I...

986
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:26,527
When...

987
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:29,489
When you kissed me...

988
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:34,243
I wasn't expecting it. No.

989
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:38,373
I wasn't expecting it.
It's not that I don't like you.

990
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:41,626
Because...that's not true.

991
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:46,798
I just wanted to give you time.

992
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,425
You've suffered a lot, and...

993
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,095
you need to heal your wounds.

994
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,265
What I'm trying to say is...

995
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:00,061
that I want to be with you.

996
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,401
Drink your tea.

997
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:26,629
Did you put sugar in it?

998
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:32,885
I'll get it for you.

999
01:31:01,455 --> 01:31:02,915
Two, right?

1000
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:05,334
As always.

1001
01:31:13,467 --> 01:31:14,635
OK?

1002
01:31:29,108 --> 01:31:30,943
Can you come with me for a moment?

1003
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:35,156
What for?

1004
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:38,159
I have to get something from the freezer,
I need your help.

1005
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,662
Come on. Leave that here.

1006
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:09,565
Open the freezer.

1007
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:11,442
Why?

1008
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,152
Do as I say.

1009
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:18,449
Open the freezer!

1010
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,690
Liar.

1011
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:14,630
Are you afraid?

1012
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,640
No, no, no!

1013
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:29,645
You don't know what fear is!

1014
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:35,776
You've got no idea what fear is!

1015
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:38,988
Real fear of being ignored or rejected,

1016
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,364
fear of indifference.

1017
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,034
Julia, look at me! Look at me!

1018
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:46,912
You don't know what it is to live
in darkness, and hide in another world,

1019
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:49,248
a silent world without looks,

1020
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:52,376
getting used to a life
counting your steps.

1021
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,172
Always wearing the same clothes...

1022
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:59,800
using your voice, one voice and no voice,

1023
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:04,221
and your eyes, two eyes and no eyes.

1024
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:08,267
It's been so long, Julia,
that in the end you become a shadow,

1025
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,561
until one day you discover
that blind people

1026
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,147
know you're there,

1027
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:14,565
that you breathe,

1028
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,984
that you're still alive.

1029
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,362
You can offer them your eyes for theirs,

1030
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:22,573
your hands for theirs.

1031
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:25,659
That's why we're so perfect together.

1032
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:30,623
That's why we have to stay this way.

1033
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,756
If you're not Iván, who are you?

1034
01:34:40,424 --> 01:34:41,675
Where are you taking me?

1035
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:45,471
My eyes hurt, something is wrong.

1036
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,974
Take the bandage off, please.

1037
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,268
Please!

1038
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,271
Please, take it off.

1039
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,483
Please. It really hurts.

1040
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,485
- Take it off.
- Shut up!

1041
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:03,864
I beg you.

1042
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,673
Let me see.

1043
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,509
Let me see.

1044
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:29,807
Ah, it's started again, hasn't it?

1045
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,023
This time...

1046
01:35:39,775 --> 01:35:41,068
it'll be more intense.

1047
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,628
Get out of the car, Julia.
We have to pack your bags.

1048
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:03,382
Open the door.

1049
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:09,972
Open the fucking car!

1050
01:36:10,055 --> 01:36:12,183
Open the door, Julia!

1051
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:15,102
Julia, open the fucking car!

1052
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:16,854
Julia!

1053
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,355
Julia!

1054
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:20,483
Julia!

1055
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:26,447
Julia!

1056
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:45,859
Who's there?

1057
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,071
Is the front door locked?

1058
01:37:49,863 --> 01:37:51,907
It's you, Julia, you scared me.

1059
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:55,661
- Is it locked?
- Yes, of course. What is it?

1060
01:37:55,744 --> 01:37:58,080
- There's a killer out there.
- A killer?

1061
01:37:58,163 --> 01:38:01,125
Yes, we have to call the police.
Where's the phone?

1062
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:05,004
Over there in the corner.
Under the picture.

1063
01:38:05,504 --> 01:38:06,505
Quiet!

1064
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:08,799
Silence.

1065
01:38:10,175 --> 01:38:11,802
- What is it?
- Don't move.

1066
01:38:18,767 --> 01:38:20,728
- It's him.
- Who?

1067
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:24,940
Don't come any closer, you son of a bitch!

1068
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:26,609
Who are you talking to?

1069
01:38:26,942 --> 01:38:28,861
With a man who thinks he's invisible.

1070
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:31,405
He blinded Sara
and now he wants to blind me.

1071
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,074
You're scaring me.

1072
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:37,411
Don't come any closer!
Call the police, Soledad.

1073
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:41,040
- Quickly! Call them.
- Don't do it, Mom.

1074
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,082
Don't...

1075
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:43,792
Ángel?

1076
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:46,462
Is that you, Son?

1077
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:52,843
Yes, I've come home.

1078
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,722
This woman says you're following her.

1079
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:58,474
This woman is crazy.

1080
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:03,187
- Your son is a killer.
- Shut up.

1081
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,521
Don't listen to her, Mom.

1082
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,357
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.

1083
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,984
- He killed my husband and Sara.
- Shut up.

1084
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,320
He lead a blind woman to a noose.

1085
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:13,197
I loved Sara.

1086
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:17,117
She killed herself because
she wasn't able to live in darkness.

1087
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:20,871
"Able to"?
Nobody is able to get used to that!

1088
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:23,165
You bastard! You made her blind!

1089
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:25,918
- You killed her!
- Is that true, Son?

1090
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:29,046
Mom, Mom, you know me...

1091
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:31,632
Don't move, I said. Don't move.

1092
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:35,427
Call the police, Soledad. Call them!

1093
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:03,956
I knew you'd come back...

1094
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,253
and you'd realize that
you could only be happy here.

1095
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:13,090
I told you you'd be nothing without me.

1096
01:40:14,174 --> 01:40:15,592
Less than nothing.

1097
01:40:16,635 --> 01:40:17,803
Invisible!

1098
01:40:26,228 --> 01:40:28,147
How long have you been able to see?

1099
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:29,857
But you're still my son.

1100
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:33,110
And I won't let anything
or anyone take you away.

1101
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:35,487
Mom, I asked you a question.

1102
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,075
How long have you been able to see?

1103
01:40:41,535 --> 01:40:43,871
Ángel, what are you doing, Son?

1104
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:46,331
What are you doing, Ángel?

1105
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:48,667
Son, no, no.

1106
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:51,295
No, no!

1107
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,506
It's OK, Mom.

1108
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:56,425
No, no!

1109
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,555
- Mom, it's OK.
- No, no!

1110
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:06,602
Look, Mom. This liquid attacks
the optic nerve without causing any pain.

1111
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:09,271
Mom, don't worry.

1112
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:13,025
And these needles are also useful.

1113
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:14,860
- It won't hurt.
- Don't, please!

1114
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:17,237
I have to do it. I have to.

1115
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:18,906
My boy.

1116
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:22,493
No, no, no!

1117
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:53,440
What are we doing here?

1118
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:57,945
I won't use it on you.

1119
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:06,787
Your optic nerve must be very damaged.

1120
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:08,622
It won't take long.

1121
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:12,084
It can't end like this. It can't.

1122
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:14,503
Don't worry, don't worry.

1123
01:42:15,128 --> 01:42:16,088
Don't worry.

1124
01:42:16,588 --> 01:42:18,257
When the darkness comes...

1125
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:20,884
I'll be by your side.

1126
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,554
I've packed your bags.

1127
01:42:24,721 --> 01:42:28,392
We'll go far away, we'll disappear
and nobody will ever find us.

1128
01:42:29,726 --> 01:42:30,978
We'll start again.

1129
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,646
Don't touch me!

1130
01:42:34,064 --> 01:42:35,774
No, you son of a bitch!

1131
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:41,446
I'll never ever love you,
I'd rather be dead!

1132
01:42:42,614 --> 01:42:44,408
- Don't touch me!
- You want this?

1133
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:47,119
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

1134
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:49,663
Let me go!

1135
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:51,874
Let me go! Get off!

1136
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:54,626
Do it, do it. Do it.

1137
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,505
Stay with me.

1138
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,330
Do it.

1139
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:32,998
Do it.

1140
01:43:34,082 --> 01:43:36,627
Do it! Fucking do it!

1141
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,755
- Do it!
- I can't! I can't!

1142
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,428
Of course you can't.

1143
01:43:46,511 --> 01:43:48,430
Because, although you don't know it...

1144
01:43:49,014 --> 01:43:50,223
you love me.

1145
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:55,187
Because you know, Julia,
that without me you're nobody.

1146
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,147
And without you, I'm only a shadow.

1147
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:15,100
Julia, why did you lock the door?

1148
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:21,481
- <i>Yes? Hello?</i>
- Inspector! It's Julia.

1149
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:23,567
- <i>Julia, is that you?</i>
- Shut up!

1150
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:26,361
This will be the last time I call you.

1151
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:28,155
<i>Calm down. What's the problem?</i>

1152
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:31,074
- He's locked me in my house.
- <i>Calm down, Julia.</i>

1153
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:34,453
He'll kill me.
If you don't come now, it'll be too late.

1154
01:45:34,536 --> 01:45:37,247
You have to believe me, please.

1155
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:39,624
- <i>Julia, calm down...</i>
- Are you listening to me?

1156
01:45:41,793 --> 01:45:42,919
Inspector?

1157
01:45:50,343 --> 01:45:51,553
Julia!

1158
01:47:56,845 --> 01:47:59,890
Julia, it's the police!
Cover the stairs and that corridor!

1159
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,224
Julia, are you there?

1160
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:04,269
It's Dimas! Julia, can you hear me?

1161
01:48:05,478 --> 01:48:07,606
- What the hell! Julia!
- Shut up!

1162
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:09,691
- What's going on?
- Shut up, I said!

1163
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,289
You see him? You see him, Inspector?

1164
01:48:24,372 --> 01:48:26,416
- Police! Drop the knife!
- There he is!

1165
01:48:26,499 --> 01:48:27,876
Hands on your head!

1166
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,974
Don't look at me.

1167
01:48:46,645 --> 01:48:48,647
Don't look at me, please.

1168
01:48:51,566 --> 01:48:52,817
Don't look at me!

1169
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:54,611
Throw the knife down!

1170
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,366
Throw the knife down!

1171
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:03,286
What are you doing?
No! Throw down the knife!

1172
01:49:45,578 --> 01:49:47,205
I'm going to go blind, aren't I?

1173
01:49:53,044 --> 01:49:54,254
How long have I got?

1174
01:49:57,007 --> 01:49:58,383
You won't see the dawn.

1175
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:09,394
I need you to do me a favor.

1176
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,512
Can you leave us alone, please?

1177
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:55,857
What happened to his eyes?

1178
01:50:58,568 --> 01:50:59,819
He donated them.

1179
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:08,536
And where are they?

1180
01:51:09,412 --> 01:51:11,081
Where he would have wanted them.

1181
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:21,925
Isaac, why?

1182
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,389
I miss you so, so much.

1183
01:51:32,727 --> 01:51:34,187
You promised.

1184
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:38,066
You promised me.

1185
01:52:21,943 --> 01:52:25,405
<i>You said that</i>
<i>when you looked into my eyes...</i>

1186
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:28,324
<i>you could see the universe.</i>

1187
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:30,869
<i>And I still can.</i>
