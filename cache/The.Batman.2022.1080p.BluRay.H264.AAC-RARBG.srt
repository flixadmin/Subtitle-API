01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,869
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

893
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:46,579
I want to continue this.

894
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,791
Excuse me.

895
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,588
I'm so sorry for your loss.

896
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:58,716
Thank you.

897
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,559
[Gordon] Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

898
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:03,762
Gil Colson is missing.

899
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:05,139
[MacKenzie] What?

900
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,516
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

901
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,642
Christ, not again.

902
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:10,811
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

903
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,149
You got people looking for him, Jim?

904
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:18,110
[Gordon] Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

905
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,111
[MacKenzie] What'd his wife say?

906
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:20,594
[Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.

907
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,782

918
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,046
Get out of the car and show your hands!

919
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:21,674
Get out!

[Man in car grunting]

921
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:33,477
Get 'em up!

Get out! Show 'em!

923

[Panting]

924
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,360
Christ, it's Colson.

[Sirens wailing]

938
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:43,062
[Officer]
We don't know if he's in on it.

939
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,342
What's he looking at?

940
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,553

Holy shit.

945
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:10,157
[MacKenzie] Are you kidding me?

946
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,993
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

947
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,288
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

948
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:19,208
[Cell phone continues ringing]

949
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,263
Please.

950
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,183
He made me do it.
[Tearfully] I'm so sorry.

951
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,870
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

952
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:39,895
I'm so sorry.

953

Looks like a combination lock.

954
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,607
Can't we just cut it off?

955
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,026
Not if you want to keep your head.

956
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:51,240

Who are you?

960
01:06:30,863 --> 01:06:32,447
I'm nobody.

961
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,326
I'm just an instrument,

962
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:40,706
here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.

963
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:42,332
"Unmask"?

964
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:43,584
Yes.

965
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:47,254
Let's do it together, okay?

966
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,756
I've been trying to reach you.

967
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:52,759
You're part of this too.

968
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,636
How am I a part of this?

969
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,638
You'll see.

970
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:58,533
[Officer] Hey, chief.
You better take a look at this.

971
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,642
[Riddler on stream]
Say hello to my followers.

972
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:01,977
We 're live.

973
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,063
They're here to watch our little trial.

974
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:07,441
At the moment,

975
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:10,903
the man across from you, Mr. Colson,

976
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:12,029
is dead.

977
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:14,174
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

978
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:15,198
But wait a minute...

979
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,368
[Shouting] Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!

980
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:21,455
You hear me?

981
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,539
[Softly] Okay.

982
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,708
[Riddler groaning comically]

[Riddler laughing]

984
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:33,383
[Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.

985
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,304
No one ever gave me a chance.

986
01:07:39,348 --> 01:07:40,390
Now,

987
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,186
ever since I was a child,

988
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:47,856
I've always loved little puzzles.

989
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,859
For me, they are a retreat

990
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:54,279
from the horrors of our world.

991
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:59,576
Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.

992
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,912
- You want me to do puzzles?
- [Chuckles excitedly]

993
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,748
Three riddles in two minutes.

994
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,919
You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.

995
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,338
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

996
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,590
Okay, okay. So I just...

997
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:14,859
- You want me to...
- [Device beeps]

998
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:17,219
- [Whimpers]
- Riddle number one...

999
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,931
- [Timer beeping]
- ."It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,

1000
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:25,686
but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

1001
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,188
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

1002
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:29,356
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

1003
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,857
- "Justice."
- huh?

1004
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:31,984
The answer's "justice."

1005
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:33,277
- Justice?
- Yes!

1006
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,945
- Oh, god.
- Justice!

1007
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:39,366
[Dramatically] And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,

1008
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,827
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

1009
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,288
were you not, Mr. Colson?

1010
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:45,640
Of course, of course. Of course.

1011
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:48,041
Riddle number two.

1012
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:52,254
"If you are justice, please do not lie.

1013
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:56,508
What is the price for your blind eye?”

1014
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,385
- "The price"?
- [Batman] "Bribes."

1015
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,720
Oh, god. "Bribes"?

1016
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:02,031
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

1017
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,307
[Hesitating]

1018
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:04,575
[Shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!

1019
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:05,851
- How much?
- Nothing!

1020
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:08,145
- [Raises voice] How much?
- Ten grand. Ten gs a month.

1021
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,581
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

1022
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:11,440
What cases?

1023
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:12,649
He didn't ask me that!

1024
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:14,168
- Come on! Ten grand.
- [Riddler laughing]

1025
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,154
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1026
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,865
Don'tlose your head, Mr. Colson.

1027
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:23,785
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

1028
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:26,288
[Singsongy] Last riddle.

1029
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:30,709
[Dramatically]
"Since your justice is so select,

1030
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:35,088
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

1031
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,257
- "Which vermin"?
- [Batman] The rat.

1032
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,885
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore maroni case.

1033
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,821
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

1034
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,055
Twenty seconds.

1035
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:44,806
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

1036
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,909
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

1037
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,477
If I go out this way, it's just me.

1038
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,688
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

1039
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:53,231
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

1040
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:54,709
- People are watching.
- What people?

1041
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:56,860
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

1042
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,112
- It's the whole system!
- Five!

1043
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:00,072
- Four!
- [Beeping rapidly]

1044

- Goodbye!

[Gordon] Take it easy.

1054
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,067
[Martinez] I want to see.

1055
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:39,842
[Medic] What is that thing? Leather?

1056
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:44,825
[Medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?

1057
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,427
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1058
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,720
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

1059

- [Gordon] Hey!
- [Officers clamoring]

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Relax, god damn it!

1062
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,961
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

1063
01:10:57,379 --> 01:10:59,923
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

1064
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,426
Colson's blood is on his hands.

1065

This is what you wanted, huh?

1588
01:46:15,078 --> 01:46:17,497
This little conversation here?

01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:22,085
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1591
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:26,839
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1597
01:47:36,242 --> 01:47:37,535
You lied to me...

1598
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:41,998
My whole life.

1599
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:49,213
I spoke to carmine Falcone.

1600
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:55,595
He told me what he did for my father.

1601
01:47:59,599 --> 01:48:01,100
About Salvatore maroni.

1602
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:05,813
He told you Salvatore maroni...

1603
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:07,649
Had my father killed.

1604
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:12,320
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1605
01:48:15,073 --> 01:48:19,619
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1606
01:48:19,702 --> 01:48:22,038
believing that he was a good man.

1607
01:48:22,121 --> 01:48:23,706
He was a good man.

1608
01:48:24,874 --> 01:48:26,584
You listen to me.

1609
01:48:26,668 --> 01:48:30,088
Your father was a good man.

1610
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:35,635
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1611
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:37,637
He had a man killed.

1612
01:48:39,972 --> 01:48:43,226
[Sighing] To protect his family image?

1613
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,561
His political aspirations?

1614
01:48:45,645 --> 01:48:49,190
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1615
01:48:51,776 --> 01:48:53,319
He was protecting your mother.

1616
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:57,824
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1617
01:48:57,907 --> 01:49:00,034
He cared about her,

1618
01:49:00,118 --> 01:49:01,411
and you,

1619
01:49:01,494 --> 01:49:04,414
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1620
01:49:04,497 --> 01:49:07,959
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1621
01:49:08,835 --> 01:49:12,171
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1622
01:49:12,255 --> 01:49:15,383
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1623
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:17,301
That's who Falcone is.

1624
01:49:19,554 --> 01:49:21,764
And that was your father's mistake.

1625
01:49:21,848 --> 01:49:23,891
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1626
01:49:23,975 --> 01:49:26,728
your father was distraught.

1627
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:30,815
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1628
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:33,067
that he would confess everything.

1629
01:49:34,569 --> 01:49:36,571
And that night,

1630
01:49:36,654 --> 01:49:40,575
your father and your mother were killed.

Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1635
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:04,265
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1636
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:07,101
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1637
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:12,398
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1638
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:18,029
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1639
01:50:18,696 --> 01:50:20,490
I know you always blamed yourself.

1640
01:50:20,573 --> 01:50:23,117
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1641
01:50:25,286 --> 01:50:27,580
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1642
01:50:28,998 --> 01:50:31,375
but I didn't know how to help.

1643
01:50:31,459 --> 01:50:33,961
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1644
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:38,007
But I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1645
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,926
You needed a father.

1646
01:50:41,886 --> 01:50:44,305
And all you had was me.

I'd feel fear like that again.

2132
02:24:30,371 --> 02:24:32,456
You've seen Gotham's true face now.

2133
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:34,416
Together, we've unmasked it.

2134
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:37,461
Its corruption, its perversion

2135
02:24:37,545 --> 02:24:41,382

2136
02:24:41,465 --> 02:24:45,302
But unmasking is not enough.

2137

the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.

2150
02:25:41,567 --> 02:25:44,528
Those who are not washed away

2151
02:25:44,612 --> 02:25:47,615

Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

2161
02:26:19,396 --> 02:26:21,565
The pigs will have me in their custody,

2162
02:26:21,649 --> 02:26:23,692
but that's okay.

2163
02:26:23,776 --> 02:26:28,280

[Car creaking]

2289
02:36:40,267 --> 02:36:41,476
[People whimpering]

2293
02:38:37,967 --> 02:38:40,261
[Bruce] Wednesday, November 6th.

2294
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:42,097
[Siren wailing in distance]

2295
02:38:43,473 --> 02:38:45,350
The city is unden/vater.

2296
02:38:47,686 --> 02:38:49,437
The national guard is coming.

2297
02:38:51,731 --> 02:38:53,733
Martial law is in effect...

2298
02:38:54,651 --> 02:38:56,277
But the criminal element never sleeps.

2299
02:38:59,489 --> 02:39:03,201
Looting and lawlessness will be rampant

2300
02:39:03,284 --> 02:39:05,829
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

2301
02:39:06,996 --> 02:39:10,709
I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.

2302
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:16,798
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

2303
02:39:18,174 --> 02:39:19,551
[Bella] We will rebuild.

2304
02:39:20,176 --> 02:39:21,636
But not just our city.

2305
02:39:22,345 --> 02:39:26,558
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

2306
02:39:26,641 --> 02:39:28,727
in our elected officials,

2307
02:39:28,810 --> 02:39:30,103
in each other.

2308
02:39:30,895 --> 02:39:34,232
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

2309
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:35,479
[Woman speaks indistinctly]

2310
02:39:35,608 --> 02:39:36,901
[Helicopter blades whirring]

2311
02:39:38,570 --> 02:39:40,238
[Bruce] I'm starting to see now.

2312
02:39:41,698 --> 02:39:43,867
I have had an effect here...

2313
02:39:45,952 --> 02:39:47,871
But not the one I intended.

2314
02:39:50,248 --> 02:39:53,293
Vengeance won't change the past,

2315
02:39:54,627 --> 02:39:57,005
mine or anyone else's.

2316
02:39:59,424 --> 02:40:01,468
I have to become more.

2317
02:40:04,554 --> 02:40:06,181
People need hope.

2318
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:09,601
To know someone's out there for them.

2319
02:40:13,396 --> 02:40:15,064
The city's angry,

2320
02:40:15,982 --> 02:40:17,358
scarred,

2321
02:40:18,276 --> 02:40:19,527
like me.

2322
02:40:21,654 --> 02:40:23,740
Our scars can destroy us.

2323
02:40:25,116 --> 02:40:27,827
Even after
the physical wounds have healed.

2324
02:40:29,454 --> 02:40:31,206
But if we survive them,

2325
02:40:32,707 --> 02:40:34,584
they can transform us.

2326
02:40:36,461 --> 02:40:38,379
They can give us the power

2327
02:40:39,339 --> 02:40:40,840
to endure...

2328
02:40:42,217 --> 02:40:44,344
And the strength to fight.

2329
02:40:47,263 --> 02:40:49,432
[Reporter]
We are live. As you can see,

2330
02:40:49,516 --> 02:40:52,310
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham square garden

helping to save the lives

2332
02:40:54,062 --> 02:40:55,748
- of hundreds of victims.
- [Riddler moaning]

2333
02:40:55,772 --> 02:40:58,775
And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,

2334
02:40:58,858 --> 02:41:01,402
a mysterious masked man emerges,

2335
02:41:01,486 --> 02:41:03,881
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

2336
02:41:03,905 --> 02:41:06,366
[Man] Isn't that just terrible?

2337
02:41:07,742 --> 02:41:09,661
Him...

2338
02:41:09,744 --> 02:41:12,622
Raining on your parade like that?

[Tutting]

2340
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:20,338
What is it they say?

2341
02:41:21,506 --> 02:41:23,675
"One day you're on top,

2342
02:41:25,218 --> 02:41:26,886
the next...

2343
02:41:28,263 --> 02:41:30,181
You're a clown."

[Exhales ruefully]

2345
02:41:32,559 --> 02:41:33,726
Well,

2346
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:38,356

there are worse things to be.

[Riddler weeping]

2348
02:41:40,650 --> 02:41:43,319
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

And you know,

2351
02:41:53,621 --> 02:41:56,833

02:42:08,803 --> 02:42:11,222

Riddle me this...

2356
02:42:21,399 --> 02:42:23,526
"The less of them you have,

2357
02:42:24,277 --> 02:42:28,114
the more one is worth."

2358

[Cat meows]

2365
02:43:12,951 --> 02:43:14,369
Where will you go?

2366
02:43:15,870 --> 02:43:18,289
I don't know. Upstate.

You know this place
is never gonna change.

2370

With carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

2371
02:43:36,724 --> 02:43:38,643
There's gonna be a power grab.

2372
02:43:40,269 --> 02:43:41,396
It'll be bloody.

2373
02:43:42,021 --> 02:43:43,231
I know.

2374
02:43:44,774 --> 02:43:45,858

I have to try.
