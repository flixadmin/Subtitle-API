No, I'm not entirely sure.

I hope all his other negative memories
were gone as well.

If there is, why won't you tell us
where it is then?

how will you take responsibility
for yours, Sergeant?

372
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,259
[researcher 2] So you're telling me that
MH-6 here was the special infectee

373
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,177
-who captured MH-5?
-[researcher 3] Yes, sir.

374
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,929
But he died of gunshot wounds?

375
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,640
[researcher 2] Are you sure he's dead?

376
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,393
[researcher 3] He doesn't have any
vital signs and I've double-checked.

377
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,439
I mean, it's definitely a monster,
so how is it dead?

378
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,366
[researcher 3] Could it be something
similar to what we have with MH-1?

379
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,826
[researcher 2] MH-1 didn't die,

380
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,454
but it also had no vital signs
as a monster.

383
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,545
We'll have to do some tests
to compare with the samples from MH-1.

384
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,881
In any case, MH-5 should be arriving soon.

385
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,674
Make sure that we're prepared.

386
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,760
This could be our last chance
to solve this.

387
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,221
We need to aggregate all the data,
experience, and test findings

You didn't have to execute him.

I simply disposed of a test subject

he abruptly seized attacking.

Until today, no monster
had ever self-regulated its behavior

that you were brought here

Answer me first and I will.

develop a vaccine or a cure?

Then why don't you

475
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,869
use me to make it again, Doctor?

476
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,247
You might end up dead, though.

477
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,624
Are you okay with that?

478
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,585
I wouldn't have stepped foot in here
if I wasn't.

479
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,421
What I meant is, you'll probably
end up begging us to kill you.

480
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,590
You should know better than anyone

481
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,050
the regenerative abilities of the MHs…

482
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,221
which I see is a blessing, are nothing
more than a curse to you people.

483
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,558
Monster humans are creatures
who have been denied

484
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,018
the beautiful relief of death.

485
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,395

I'm sure you'll do well unlike the others.

491

I get the feeling we're about to witness
the birth of a very special MH, you see.
