1
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:03,651
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,307
I demand that you arrest

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:10,001
Detective Gordon for
the murder of my husband.

4
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,024
You talk of hate and revenge,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,860
but you still love James Gordon.

6
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,863
I hope she knows what a
lying cheat you are, Maria.

7
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:18,698
I had to leave, or they
were gonna take me to prison.

8
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:20,533
You can't run fast
with a five-year-old.

9
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:21,401
I'm your daughter.

10
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:22,502
First, we take away his mind.

11
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,438
And then when this bird is broken...

12
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:27,073
Who are you in on this with?!

13
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:29,909
you can put him out of his misery.

14
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:32,011
Guess where Dwight Pollard
worked before the morgue.

15
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:32,779
Indian Hill.

16
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:35,214
It's time to get him.

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,083
What you call sanity,

18
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:39,752
it's just a prison in your minds.

19
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:42,088
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!

20
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,096
Three nines, and joker's wild.

21
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,597
Four of a kind.

22
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,201
Must be my lucky night.

23
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:10,249
Stop or I will fire!

24
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:13,152
I said stop or I will fire!

25
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,058
Call for backup.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,634
Call for backup?

27
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,636
It's you.

28
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:08,941
It's really you.

29
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,893
- So...
- So?

30
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:46,261
It seems after shutting down
Indian Hill, the government

31
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:48,680
just packed everything
up and shipped it here.

32
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:51,316
To a Wayne Enterprises facility.

33
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,519
They sent it back to the
same people who were running

34
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:55,587
Indian Hill and funding
Strange to begin with?

35
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:56,989
Yep.

36
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:59,224
Do we know how Jerome
ended up at Indian Hill?

37
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,893
No, but it makes sense.

38
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:02,528
Strange was collecting
psychopaths, right?

39
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:05,164
Fish, Galavan. Jerome fit the bill.

40
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,934
The woman that walked out of the
morgue, that was Dwight's trial run.

41
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:12,471
- He's gonna bring back Jerome.
- Oh, that's great.

42
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:15,441
That's all this city needs...
Jerome Valeska sucking air with

43
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:17,510
- 50 fanatics at his back.
- Lucius.

44
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,914
If you wanted to bring back
someone from one of these,

45
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:23,516
what would be your next step?

46
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:26,585
Thawing 'em out. These
pods run at 237 degrees

47
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:29,455
below zero. You'd have to get
the body to core temperature

48
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,457
before even attempting reanimation.

49
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:33,793
I worked on the design of
these when I was at Wayne.

50
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,828
Oh, good job. Thanks
for helping the bad guys.

51
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,263
How long?

52
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:38,831
If we're lucky, three hours.

53
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:53,946
GCPD. You're under arrest.

54
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,351
He needs a hospital.

55
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:04,123
No.

56
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:13,265
Appreciate you boys seeing me so late.

57
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,101
Doesn't seem like we had much of
a choice, Mr. Clemens, does it?

58
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,270
Please, call me Cole.

59
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:20,506
You want money.

60
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,709
That bitch, Maria Kyle,

61
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,822
she owes me 200 grand.

62
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:27,985
I heard 100.

63
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,317
Well, you got to figure
gas money coming out here

64
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:32,785
and, uh...

65
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,320
Well...

66
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:35,988
think you can afford it?

67
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:38,827
And what exactly is
the nature of this debt?

68
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,394
Call it lost income due
to a broken contract.

69
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,496
She said she'd do something.

70
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:46,232
She didn't.

71
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,801
Ergo, she owes me the
money I would've made,

72
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:50,836
- plus interest.
- Or what?

73
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:52,638
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

74
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:54,840
I would never hurt a woman.

75
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,709
However,

76
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:00,212
I would feel justified in
giving the police enough evidence

77
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:04,149
so that your little girlfriend

78
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:06,919
could only talk to her mama

79
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:11,423
every other Thursday through
a screen for the next 40 years.

80
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,927
So, you give Maria
the money, she gives it

81
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:16,428
to me...

82
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:18,597
I'm out of your lives.

83
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,599
Cash, obviously.

84
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:37,716
He should have been taken to a hospital.

85
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:38,918
He will be.

86
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:40,219
I needed to talk to him.

87
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,587
I can do that better here than there.

88
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:42,588
Bending the rules,

89
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:43,589
what a surprise.

90
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:44,957
It's Jerome Valeska we're talking about.

91
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,225
You remember what he's done.

92
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,393
There's always a reason.

93
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:49,628
He needs to go to a hospital.

94
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:51,630
Lee...

95
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,300
I know you had Falcone call off Zsasz.

96
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,401
Thank you.

97
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:56,402
You want to thank me?

98
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:57,937
When you find Dwight,

99
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,766
you have him bring back Mario
from the dead, how 'bout that?

100
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,915
James Gordon.

101
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:13,052
The James Gordon. Wow.

102
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,921
It's actually you.

103
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:17,756
So cool I'm meeting you.

104
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,224
You should thank your friends.

105
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,094
They're the ones who left you behind.

106
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,595
Eh, I'd have done the same.

107
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,764
Tell me where he took Jerome.

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,233
Why? You can't stop it.

109
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:29,368
Stop what?

110
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:30,769
Um...

111
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,338
the night of the awakening.

112
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,157
You mean waking up Jerome?

113
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:37,309
Jerome is just the first step.

114
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:40,112
You think we're a small band.

115
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:42,581
But we are everywhere.

116
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:52,791
Put out a citywide call,

117
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:54,793
I want every unit looking
for this symbol. Go, now.

118
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,847
We're almost done loading the vans.

119
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:15,981
How are you doing?

120
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:18,517
Ding...

121
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:19,585
dong...

122
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,221
And we are...

123
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:24,757
there.

124
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:34,400
I hope you had a nice sleep.

125
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:38,237
'Cause we got a busy,
busy day ahead. Hmm?

126
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,843
Well, hang on to your hats, folks!

127
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,980
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet.

128
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:08,530
"Unsurprisingly, there
have already been calls

129
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,945
"for the mayor's resignation.

130
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:14,489
"The clearly disturbed Mayor Cobblepot
capped the interview by announcing,

131
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:16,495
'To hell with the people of Gotham.'"

132
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,830
What are you doing?

133
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,298
I'm reading.

134
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,568
"Mayor Crumblepot." Clever, huh?

135
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,726
- "Neither the man, his chief of staff...
- Is Ed here?

136
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,105
- "Edward Nygma, nor his...

137
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,407
- "Deputy chief of staff...
- Did he call?

138
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,575
Tarquin..." somebody,

139
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,276
"were available for comment,

140
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,311
"begging the question,

141
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,746
who is running Gotham?"

142
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,381
I need to find Ed.

143
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,917
You need to fix this situation.

144
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,118
Who cares what people
think of the mayor?

145
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,219
The city runs itself.

146
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,788
I'm talking about your other job.

147
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,989
The real one.

148
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,824
You melt down in public, hide out here,

149
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,826
people start to smell
blood in the water.

150
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,061
Who?

151
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,562
Tommy Bones.

152
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:51,630
The Duke.

153
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,332
The East Side gangs are holding,

154
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,600
but south of the Narrows,

155
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,801
the docks, there's chatter.

156
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,803
The king is dead.

157
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,606
Or soon will be. That kind of chatter.

158
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,941
I need Ed, he's the only one...

159
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:03,842
Listen to me!

160
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,110
Ed's not here.

161
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,278
I am.

162
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,579
So get up, take a shower,

163
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,781
do that disco vampire
thing with your hair.

164
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:13,018
I will call a meeting of the
heads of the family, you will come,

165
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,121
you will be your old self
and the rumors will stop.

166
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,523
Why are you helping me?

167
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,460
Because people think you like me, Ozzie.

168
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,195
And as long as they're scared of you,

169
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,163
I get to keep breathing.

170
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,834
1:00, my place.

171
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,147
Are you sure about this?

172
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,582
Of course.

173
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,718
You saved our lives.

174
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,054
And other reasons.

175
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,288
This is so stupid.

176
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,790
Cole is a weasel.

177
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,158
Just call the cops

178
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,726
and get his ass arrested.

179
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,161
And what about your mom?

180
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,996
I mean, a weasel he most definitely is,

181
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,465
but if what he says is
true, she could go to jail.

182
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:02,334
And isn't that why you have lawyers?

183
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,835
You pay a guy like Cole,

184
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,838
all that happens is he comes back again.

185
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,173
And again.

186
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,808
Look, worst case scenario,

187
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,843
this buys us time to get
your mom's record cleared

188
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,378
so he doesn't have a hold over her.

189
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:14,913
Right, 'cause it's just money.

190
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,015
Or another choice is I could leave.

191
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,987
I don't want to, but...

192
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,989
it is an option.

193
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,490
You know what?

194
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:26,692
Fine.

195
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,226
Fine.

196
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:31,930
If he doesn't mind
paying, why not, right?

197
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,933
But I'd start keeping
a lot of cash around.

198
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,877
They're all over the city.

199
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,112
Maybe they were here the whole time

200
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,513
and we just didn't notice.

201
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:50,082
Seems most are concentrated

202
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,883
in the Narrows, rougher parts of town.

203
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,618
Abandoned buildings, warehouses.

204
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,054
You're thinking this
is how they communicate?

205
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,356
Announce the next meeting
as the group moves around?

206
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,625
Could be more than one group,
could be multiple chapters.

207
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,062
Like the Elks, and Dwight's
the Grand Poobah or something.

208
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,732
I'm thinking that son of a
bitch we found at the break-in

209
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,967
could have been telling the truth.

210
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,869
What, that they're everywhere?

211
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,370
Huh? That Jerome's got thousands

212
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,740
of disciples waiting for
him to wake up? Come on.

213
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,109
- This is 50 wackadoos, tops.
- Maybe.

214
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,243
Maybe not.

215
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,011
I think I got something.

216
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,283
You asked what Dwight
would need to revive Jerome.

217
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,119
That girl, Melanie
Blake, his test subject...

218
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,820
She received thousands
of volts of electricity.

219
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,489
- That amount...
- Would cause

220
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,125
- a power surge in the electric grid.
- I was about to say

221
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,060
that would cause a power
surge in the electric grid.

222
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,928
Here. Ninth and Henry.

223
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,630
The power company
recorded several surges

224
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,332
around the time Melanie Blake
would have been brought back,

225
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,967
and multiple surges as recent

226
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,835
as 15 minutes ago, same location.

227
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,137
I'll get the Strike Force.

228
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,238
I'll get the car.

229
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,573
I'll just...

230
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:51,343
stay here, if that's okay.

231
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,345
Yeah. That's okay.

232
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,513
Yo, Alvarez!

233
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,549
We got a location on Dwight. Let's go.

234
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,489
It's me.

235
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,559
No.

236
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,296
It goes here.

237
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,898
This goes here.

238
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,336
Wake up.

239
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:21,206
Come on. Wake up.

240
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,608
I just heard from our guy in the
GCPD. They've got our location.

241
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:27,112
The others are gonna wait
for us at the rendezvous.

242
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,613
He's still dead.

243
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,183
I know he's still dead.

244
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,785
I ran into some technical difficulties.

245
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,053
Nothing that I can't fix.

246
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,388
Is everything plugged in?

247
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,190
Yes.

248
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,457
Try turning it on and off.

249
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,692
I did! Three times.

250
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,294
Look, you have spent the last year

251
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,296
telling everyone that
the Prophet would return.

252
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,065
People have made
sacrifices for you, Dwight.

253
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,334
I left a really good
job at the post office.

254
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,203
The police are coming,

255
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,838
and you promised them Jerome.

256
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,739
The others expect to hear him speak.

257
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,508
They want to see his face

258
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:57,943
and if you can't do that...

259
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,157
You know, you make an interesting point.

260
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,768
They want to see your face.

261
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,189
No awakening for this guy.

262
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,691
Looks like Dwight took off pretty quick.

263
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,061
Yeah. Like he knew we were coming.

264
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,468
Harvey.

265
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,838
Holy smacks. Is that Jerome?

266
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,412
Why'd he take his face?

267
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,123
Brothers and sisters,

268
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:23,762
I promised you Jerome
would return and today

269
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,232
your faith is rewarded.

270
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:31,403
Jerome is here.

271
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,711
Behold the Prophet.

272
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:52,457
The Prophet is here.

273
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,326
Where's Jerome?

274
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,794
Where's the hell's Jerome?

275
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,629
The Prophet is here.

276
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,930
Where's Jerome?

277
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,366
The Prophet is here!

278
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,804
Listen to me!

279
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,507
Jerome is here.

280
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:10,942
He never left us.

281
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:13,945
Each of you kept him alive.

282
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,715
Each of you is Jerome.

283
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,617
I am Jerome.

284
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:22,287
We are all...

285
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,690
Jerome.

286
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,459
I'm Jerome.

287
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,327
I'm Jerome.

288
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:30,562
- I'm Jerome.
- I'm Jerome.

289
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,697
You are Jerome.

290
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,366
You are Jerome. You are Jerome.

291
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,900
And you, and you...

292
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,504
We are Jerome.

293
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,540
We are Jerome!

294
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,242
We are Jerome!

295
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,744
We are Jerome!

296
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,346
We are Jerome! We are Jerome!

297
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,548
We are Jerome!

298
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,419
Great. Thank you.

299
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,381
I was going through the evidence
you recovered from the scene.

300
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:20,572
That phone was on the
corpse next to Jerome.

301
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,434
The last number came from the precinct.

302
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:26,144
Wait. You're saying someone
in this house tipped them off?

303
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,281
It would make sense. They cleared
out moments before we got there.

304
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,049
So we got a freaking mole?

305
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,586
I was gonna replace that lamp.

306
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:36,788
Is there any way to know who called?

307
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:38,457
The number came up as the main.

308
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,092
So you can't make some kind of gadget

309
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,326
to figure it out?

310
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:43,295
Sure. I'll get on that.

311
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,363
Let me see it.

312
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,468
Everybody listen up!

313
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,837
Everyone stop what you're doing.

314
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:57,142
We have a mole.

315
00:16:57,177 --> 00:17:00,278
The cult we've been tracking
was tipped off to our raid,

316
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:02,714
and the call came from in here.

317
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,817
It was sent to this phone.

318
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:09,654
So...

319
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,656
let's find out who the traitor is,

320
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:14,493
shall we?

321
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:20,699
Grab him!

322
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:22,300
- Get him!
- Stop!

323
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:24,603
No, no, don't.

324
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:27,139
Get him in the room.

325
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:28,607
Get him in the interrogation room.

326
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:30,709
Good bluff.

327
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:33,011
Thank you, sir.

328
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:34,613
Everybody get back to work.

329
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,585
My, my.

330
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,854
You scrub up nice.

331
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,389
Am I early?

332
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:45,924
About that...

333
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,392
I sent out the word.

334
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,594
Said you wanted to see
everyone, express summons,

335
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,829
et cetera, et cetera.

336
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:52,597
And...

337
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,566
See for yourself.

338
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,168
This is a rebellion.

339
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:57,769
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

340
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:00,172
But... I did warn ya.

341
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,542
You have been such a friend, Barbara.

342
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:05,010
Tell me.

343
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:07,345
What should I do now?

344
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:11,950
Well. If it were me, I
would pick one of them,

345
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:14,219
the Duke, maybe, or Tommy Bones,

346
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,620
and teach them a lesson.

347
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:18,056
They don't respect you, Oswald.

348
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:21,126
In fact, you probably want to
kill Tommy Bones and the Duke.

349
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,794
Just clean house.

350
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:27,699
I'm sorry. Just...

351
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:32,571
Well. I'm glad you can
find the humor in it.

352
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:34,573
Did you really think

353
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:37,442
I would be so easy to manipulate?

354
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,281
What was your plan?

355
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:44,549
Take advantage of me

356
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,551
while I was in a weakened state?

357
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:48,787
Trick me into attacking my subordinates

358
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,489
so they truly did rebel?

359
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:52,324
Inciting war,

360
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,593
so that you could pick up the pieces?

361
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,165
My dear, you are tragically

362
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,167
out of your depth.

363
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:04,769
Oswald. I am your friend.

364
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:06,972
Perhaps I should call
Tommy Bones. Or the Duke.

365
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:09,241
Or any of the families,
and ask them if you

366
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,076
really invited them to this meeting.

367
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,078
What would they say?

368
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:20,485
Yes?

369
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:22,187
He's right here.

370
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:25,223
Tommy Bones.

371
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:29,427
Yes?

372
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:31,997
You get the message?

373
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:34,132
We don't work for you no more.

374
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,635
Your day is done, freak.

375
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,271
How dare you?

376
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:41,006
I will gut you!

377
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,475
I will hang your entrails

378
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,810
from every lamppost in Gotham!

379
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:47,445
Then Nygma dies.

380
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,281
What?

381
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:52,951
Walk away quiet. Maybe we'll
send him back in one piece.

382
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:54,986
We'll even let you keep being mayor.

383
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,624
They have Ed.

384
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,727
They're holding him hostage.

385
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:05,330
I will kill them.

386
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:06,565
Every one of them!

387
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:09,801
I have to go.

388
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:11,236
I have to gather my men.

389
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:22,881
Put her on.

390
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,921
- Hey.
- He bought it.

391
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:34,593
Well done.

392
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:35,694
So we're good, now?

393
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:38,263
I said all you told me.

394
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,398
Yeah. We're good.

395
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:48,106
Officer Andrew Dove,
six years with the GCPD,

396
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:51,109
twice decorated.

397
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,945
Up for promotion in six months.

398
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,747
Well, congrats, pal,

399
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:59,517
'cause you're going to Blackgate,
and they love cops there.

400
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:01,786
I stopped being a cop a long time ago.

401
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,855
The hell you did.

402
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,890
No one ever stops being a cop.

403
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:07,459
You were here

404
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,361
when Jerome and the Maniax attacked.

405
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,896
You defended this house against him.

406
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:14,599
And that's the night I changed.

407
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:16,868
Don't waste your breath, Jim.

408
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:18,436
Let's put him on a bus to Blackgate,

409
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:19,771
stick a target on his back

410
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:21,272
and forget about him!

411
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:22,907
Good cop, bad cop

412
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,576
doesn't work on cops.

413
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,812
At the very least, you two
should have switched roles.

414
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:30,949
You know what?

415
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,419
You're right.

416
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,390
You're gonna tell me
what Dwight's planning

417
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:39,724
right now!

418
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:44,796
You think this is funny, don't you?

419
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,464
How about this?!

420
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:50,635
Hilarious.

421
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:51,836
Again!

422
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:53,972
If you insist!

423
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:00,945
Harvey. Harvey, no! No.

424
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:07,285
25 milligrams of sodium pentothal.

425
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,455
Give him a few minutes, he'll
tell you what you need to know.

426
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,290
Damn.

427
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:15,627
Lee...

428
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:19,397
- Lee, stop.
- Don't touch me.

429
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:21,800
What the hell was that?

430
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:23,435
You wanted Dove to
talk, so now he'll talk.

431
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,836
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Really?

432
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:27,105
Did I not just see Harvey
punch him in the face?

433
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,473
What about you? You
brought a wounded suspect

434
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:29,674
into the precinct

435
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,076
instead of taking him to the hospital,

436
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:32,577
because you wanted to interrogate him.

437
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:34,246
You guys can bend the
rules, but I can't.

438
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:37,415
None of us should... Me, Harvey, you.

439
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,618
But especially not you.
You're better than that.

440
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:40,619
Oh, that's so sweet.

441
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:41,987
Would you stop it?

442
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:44,189
Look, you want to blame me

443
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,757
for Mario's death, that's fine.

444
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:48,994
I can live with that,
knowing you're okay.

445
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,529
But don't let your hatred of me

446
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:52,531
turn you into something you're not.

447
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,266
Or what, Jim?

448
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:56,701
If I change too much,
you're gonna put two

449
00:22:56,737 --> 00:22:58,537
in my heart, like you did to Mario?

450
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:03,375
I'll talk to Harvey.

451
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,043
You came back to the job too soon.

452
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:06,144
You need some time off.

453
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,779
Yeah, you do that.

454
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:09,781
And I'll tell the commissioner
how I saw the acting captain

455
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:11,550
punch a suspect in the face.

456
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:16,154
Don't ever touch me again
or tell me what to do.

457
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:21,126
Jim, hey, it worked.

458
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:22,227
Dove gave it up.

459
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:23,528
Dwight's heading to Channel 9

460
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:25,230
to make some sort of announcement

461
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:26,498
on the 6:00 news.

462
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,533
All right, call the station.

463
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:31,113
- Have them evacuate...
- I'm already on it. Let's go!

464
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:36,675
The GCPD has asked us
to evacuate the building.

465
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,478
They assure me that
everything is under control.

466
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:43,982
No one's going anywhere.

467
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,092
We've got a show to do, people.

468
00:23:54,127 --> 00:23:56,928
And, as you know, the show

469
00:23:56,964 --> 00:24:00,065
must go on.

470
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:13,912
What the...

471
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:16,815
Boo. Ha, ha, ha...

472
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,111
Wow. Well, that is quite a story.

473
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,314
You know, I know I've been dead,

474
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,849
but doesn't that seem
kind of crazy to you?

475
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,551
Hey, maybe you're dreaming.

476
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,053
Try shooting yourself.

477
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:36,017
Huh. Oh...

478
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,041
Nah. Hey,

479
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,610
tell me more about this cult.

480
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,211
They think I'm pretty great, huh?

481
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,014
They're a bunch of raving
lunatics and idiots.

482
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,382
Lunatics and idiots?

483
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,917
Ooh, my kind of people.

484
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,555
Sorry.

485
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,723
Head's still a little fuzzy.

486
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,392
You know, I was just reborn.

487
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,794
Last year was nothing but darkness...

488
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,598
as far as the eye can see.

489
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,935
I know you, right?

490
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,737
- Yep.
- Hey,

491
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:10,474
did you and I ever, uh...

492
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,776
Oh, God, no.

493
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,045
Why? Gingers not your type?

494
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,546
Oh, I remember.

495
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:20,484
You're Jim Gordon's little... Twinkie.

496
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,752
Easy.

497
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,787
How's it going between you and Jimbo?

498
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,324
Huh? You still together, or...

499
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,792
- No.
- No?

500
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:32,362
Oh, that's a shame.

501
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,631
I really liked you guys.

502
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,800
What happened?

503
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,971
He killed my husband
on our wedding night.

504
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,376
Glad you find it funny.

505
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,377
I do.

506
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,448
I get why you don't.

507
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,552
Wow.

508
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,789
You miss a lot being dead.

509
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,358
You know what? Go ahead, enjoy it.

510
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,726
There's about a hundred cops

511
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,927
on the other side of that door

512
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,328
ready to kill you all over again.

513
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,665
I see your point.

514
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,067
It's a business.

515
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,170
So, when I was last, you know,

516
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,472
uh, alive,

517
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,674
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

518
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,010
I suppose I didn't manage to...

519
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,045
No. Right.

520
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,816
Theo Galavan killed me,
that jug-eared Judas.

521
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,851
Well, I suppose I should
start by killing him.

522
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,219
Theo Galavan's dead.

523
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,888
Oh... Who beat me to it?

524
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,257
W-Which time?

525
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,327
Galavan came back to life, too?

526
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,896
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm?

527
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,166
That son of a bitch
is always upstaging me.

528
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:47,604
Well, I guess I'm just
missing one thing, then.

529
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,274
Where is my face?

530
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,089
Something's not right.

531
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,361
Whoa! Hold your position.

532
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,430
Whoa! Hold!

533
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,104
Son of a bitch!

534
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,540
I'm on the scene now

535
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,941
and we're reporting live.

536
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,042
The Channel 9 news station

537
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,478
seems to have had a hostage situation.

538
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,081
Uh, we're not sure how many hostages...

539
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,223
It's all here?

540
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,292
200 grand.

541
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,795
We did it, baby.

542
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,630
Come on, let's just
get out of this town.

543
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,932
Hey, smile.

544
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,701
We won.

545
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:55,305
Yeah, smile. You won.

546
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,642
You're rich.

547
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,709
Go away, kid.

548
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,611
Shut up, Cole.

549
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,447
You caught me.

550
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,418
What do you want me to say?

551
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,420
I just want to make sure I got it right.

552
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,023
You find out Bruce Wayne

553
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,392
and your abandoned daughter are a thing.

554
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,560
You figure,

555
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:17,994
"There's an easy mark."

556
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,130
You come back, make nice,

557
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,365
do the whole mother/daughter
bonding thing,

558
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:25,168
and then pull this scam.

559
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:28,238
- That about it?
- Pretty much.

560
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,375
You want to hate me,

561
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,543
that's your choice.

562
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,946
- You're damn right.
- Why so angry?

563
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,714
It's not like your boyfriend
cares about the money.

564
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,126
I know he doesn't care about the money.

565
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:40,450
I don't care about the money.

566
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,587
I care that my mother,

567
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:46,356
who left me when I was a kid,

568
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,058
only came back to use me!

569
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,526
Easy.

570
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,228
Selina!

571
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:54,331
Please, don't.

572
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,702
Don't ever...

573
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,905
come back.

574
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,716
The time has come to reveal ourselves.

575
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,485
Gotham will remember...

576
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,055
No. History will remember.

577
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,591
Dwight?

578
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:22,726
Dwight?

579
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:25,428
The police are outside.

580
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,499
Detective Gordon is on the phone.

581
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,602
It's just like when he called Jerome
outside the Children's Hospital benefit.

582
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,742
Hello, Jimbo.

583
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,077
Shut up, Dwight. We have
the building surrounded.

584
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,613
There's no way out. Let the hostages go.

585
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,283
You're outside?

586
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,451
You are, aren't you?

587
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:49,686
Goody!

588
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,590
The cult will never follow you, Dwight.

589
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,459
I saw you, at the theater?

590
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,861
You don't have what it takes.

591
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,597
Breathe, James.

592
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,899
I haven't touched a hair on
your pretty girlfriend's head.

593
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,906
You're just repeating what
Jerome said to me last year.

594
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,708
I am Jerome.

595
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,043
No, no.

596
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,044
You're the understudy

597
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,079
pretending to be the star.

598
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,247
You're a fraud.

599
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,249
No, I am Jerome!

600
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,051
I am Jerome.

601
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:23,420
And soon Gotham will know it.

602
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,888
Well, for the record.

603
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,589
You're doing one thing Jerome never did.

604
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,758
Boring me.

605
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,495
So the back entrance is a no-go,

606
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,730
but we think we might have found a way

607
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,332
through the ventilation system.

608
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,234
All right, let's go.

609
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,836
Dwight's going live any minute.

610
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,473
The Penguin killed the Duke and his crew

611
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,442
because he thinks they kidnapped Nygma.

612
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,578
Meanwhile, they're still
looking for Tommy Bones.

613
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,947
Hmm. Who they won't find,
since you already killed him.

614
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,483
And now these nimrods are
terrified for their life.

615
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,653
Which is why they're here
with their guard down. Hmm.

616
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,822
You gotta hand it to Nygma.

617
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,024
He knew how to get Penguin
to turn on the five families.

618
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,527
Poor Ozzie is tearing
apart everything he built.

619
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,763
Remember, when this is
over, and we're in charge,

620
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,765
Nygma dies.

621
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
You made a promise.

622
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,439
Sealed with a kiss, baby.

623
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,541
Now, what about them?

624
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,144
We've got option "A,"
appeal to their reason...

625
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,780
Convince them we alone can
protect them from Penguin.

626
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,316
Seems unlikely. They are men. Hmm.

627
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,084
You just like option "B."

628
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,652
Mm.

629
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,588
Fine, option "B."

630
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,628
All right, we worked it out.

631
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,662
What the...

632
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,564
Ed, honey, everything's set.

633
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,133
Penguin's all yours.

634
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,504
Yeah, yeah, option "B".

635
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:55,812
Four... three... two... one...

636
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,748
Brothers and sisters,

637
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:01,684
my name is Dwi...

638
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,889
My name is...

639
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,692
Jerome.

640
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:15,698
History will call
tonight the night of...

641
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,200
Look at that.

642
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,603
No charisma, no stage presence.

643
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,906
The time has come to reveal ourselves.

644
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,742
Though he is a handsome fellow, huh?

645
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,611
Hey, Doc, keep watching.

646
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,781
You don't want to
miss what happens next.

647
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:34,732
Today, Gotham will remember.

648
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,037
Oh, sorry! Didn't see you.

649
00:32:56,178 --> 00:32:58,569
Put your weapons down.

650
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:00,561
We want to talk to Jerome.

651
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,653
We want to talk to Dwight.

652
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:08,022
We won't hurt you.

653
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:11,592
We just want to talk to you, Dwight.

654
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:25,105
The Prophet told us
that we're all prisoners,

655
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:28,509
slaves to a city that doesn't love us,

656
00:33:28,544 --> 00:33:31,345
but tonight...

657
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,949
tonight we rise up.

658
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:38,018
We are all Jerome.

659
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:40,521
Each of you...

660
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:42,890
is Jerome. That's the truth.

661
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:44,191
Stop.

662
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:48,829
All of us are Jerome.

663
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:50,965
We are all...

664
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:53,534
Drop it!

665
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:56,270
Cut the feed!

666
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
Keep them up where I can see them.

667
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:01,742
Dwight, stop!

668
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:06,246
- Just keep moving.
- All right, man, all right.

669
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:08,082
Don't make...

670
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:09,717
You can't do this. This is
the night of the awakening.

671
00:34:09,752 --> 00:34:11,285
This is the night of the awakening.

672
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,654
Not anymore.

673
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:24,331
Did you know?

674
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:28,202
That she was only after the money.

675
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:29,403
I-I wasn't sure.

676
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:30,904
Did you know?!

677
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,307
Yes.

678
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:34,461
It was obvious.

679
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:37,111
And you gave her the money anyway?

680
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:38,412
The money wasn't important.

681
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:39,447
She was lying!

682
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:40,748
What were my options, Selina?

683
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:43,217
If I didn't give her the money,
she would've skipped town.

684
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:45,753
So, you thought you'd pay her.

685
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:48,789
Have her stick around, maybe
get used to being my mom.

686
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:49,957
Is that it?

687
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:52,293
Yes.

688
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,062
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

689
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:57,064
- It's the same thing.
- Perhaps, but telling you

690
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,966
your mother was a con artist
who'd only sought you out

691
00:34:59,002 --> 00:35:01,903
for the purposes of
getting money from me...

692
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:04,305
didn't seem like a very
attractive alternative.

693
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,509
You... and her...

694
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:11,012
you both lied to me.

695
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:13,114
But for very different reasons.

696
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:22,189
Fight me!

697
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,391
Hit me!

698
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,059
Fight me!

699
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:29,429
Fight me!

700
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:30,697
No.

701
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:39,072
You know... the only reason
she came back to Gotham,

702
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:42,409
the only reason she tracked me down

703
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:47,013
after 11 years...

704
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:49,049
was you.

705
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:00,360
We love you!

706
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:02,195
We love you!

707
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:05,232
We love you, Dwight!

708
00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:09,236
I want Dwight taken
back for questioning.

709
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:11,204
So much for the big awakening, huh?

710
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,773
Yeah, still, we should get
some cars out on the street.

711
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,742
Dwight got his message out.

712
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,978
A few lunatics could still respond.

713
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,082
Lee? What is...

714
00:36:22,117 --> 00:36:23,083
Jim.

715
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:24,217
I don't know how,

716
00:36:24,253 --> 00:36:26,286
but Jerome is alive,

717
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:27,921
and I think he's coming after Dwight.

718
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:31,491
Where's Dwight?

719
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:33,260
I saw a uni walking him that way. Why?

720
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:42,569
Hang on, Dwight. We
got a busy night ahead.

721
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:44,671
What's that?

722
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,673
This guy's hilarious.

723
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,029
So... how's it look?

724
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:12,898
It's good. It looks good.

725
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:20,823
You wouldn't lie to me, right, Dwight?

726
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:22,625
No.

727
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,794
It looks good.

728
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:27,063
It's good.

729
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:34,470
Say... you're not mad, are you?

730
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:37,039
Mad?

731
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:43,245
What could I possibly be mad about? Huh?

732
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:45,748
You know, the whole
cutting off your face.

733
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:48,751
Oh, buddy...

734
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:51,520
you brought me back from the dead.

735
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:55,224
What's a cutoff face between friends?

736
00:37:55,895 --> 00:37:57,728
I guess that's true.

737
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:59,762
You guessed right. Bingo.

738
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:03,866
What are, what are we doing? Ooh.

739
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,536
You'll see.

740
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,811
Nothing? He is out
there! Someone has him!

741
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:18,414
Sorry, boss. Mr. Nygma wasn't at any

742
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:20,449
of Tommy Bones's or the Duke's hideouts.

743
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:22,918
Santino. Hit Santino.

744
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:24,920
He was close with Tommy Bones.

745
00:38:24,956 --> 00:38:26,922
I-I bet they are in this together.

746
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,390
Boss, got to tell you,

747
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:29,692
I'm hearing some weird things.

748
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:30,726
Ed is in danger.

749
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:31,861
I will tear this city apart

750
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:33,662
brick by brick!

751
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:36,866
What?

752
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:38,234
Oswald.

753
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:40,769
Ed, is that really
you? Are-Are you okay?

754
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:42,771
I... I can't talk long.

755
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:44,406
I snuck away to the phone.

756
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:47,042
Ed, who has you? Where are you?

757
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:48,777
Kane Chemicals.

758
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:50,646
Hurry. Oswald, hurry, please.

759
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,082
Ed? Ed?

760
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,216
Ed?

761
00:38:54,252 --> 00:38:56,085
Uh, uh, c-come on.

762
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,554
Now. No, Gabe. Not you.

763
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:00,156
You stay by the phone
in case he calls back.

764
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:02,658
Kane Chemicals, let's go. Move!

765
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:05,060
Nothing on the news van,

766
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:06,128
but reports are coming in.

767
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:07,730
Random attacks,

768
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:11,100
looting... at least six
fires in the past hour.

769
00:39:11,135 --> 00:39:12,168
You're telling me that ding-dong Dwight

770
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:13,602
actually got people to go ape?

771
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:15,538
You need to see this.

772
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,073
As has been reported,

773
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:19,308
Channel 9's van

774
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:21,310
was stolen this evening.

775
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,312
We are now getting video from the thief,

776
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:27,349
which we will play in hopes
it leads to his apprehension.

777
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:29,018
Testing. Testing.

778
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:30,452
Campos, call Channel 9!

779
00:39:30,488 --> 00:39:32,655
Tell them to stop broadcasting this now!

780
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,024
Am I live?

781
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:36,458
Am I on air?

782
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:38,194
Can you hear me? Ah, screw it.

783
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:41,096
Let's do it.

784
00:39:41,132 --> 00:39:42,665
Hi.

785
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:46,268
Some of you may know, I died.

786
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:47,670
Uh-oh.

787
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:53,475
But take it from me, death is...

788
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:56,779
dull...

789
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:59,181
but coming back...

790
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:02,151
that is something.

791
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:06,822
Leave it to dying to give you
a whole new perspective on life.

792
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:12,428
And I would like to share that with you.

793
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:14,663
Uh, Officer, you look terrible.

794
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,232
Hey, you got... oh.

795
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:19,034
Tonight, Gotham,

796
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,204
in the darkness, there are no rules.

797
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,474
So, tonight, Gotham...

798
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,209
do what you want.

799
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:31,413
Kill who you want. Hmm?

800
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:36,385
And when morning comes...

801
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,923
you, too, shall be...

802
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:42,825
reborn.

803
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:48,063
Oh, and, uh... Dwight.

804
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:51,667
I don't forgive you for my face.

805
00:40:58,576 --> 00:40:59,742
He's at the power
plant across the river.

806
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:01,043
You'll never make it in time.

807
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:04,218
Go to the roof. Let me call a chopper.

808
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,481
We need a bird to go now.

809
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,918
Oh, my God.
