1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,289
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,995
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:17,047
Now listen, we' re running a little late.

4
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,298
I know.

5
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:20,394
How do I look?

6
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:22,062
Perfect.

7
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:23,974
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,604
It's great.

9
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,899
You' re not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,572
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:32,692
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,240
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,909
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:39,118
Coming.

15
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,584
All right.

16
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:43,034
I' m ready.

17
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,772
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:02,931
Roz.

19
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:08,315
Okay, Roz, we' re going now.

20
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:11,363
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:13,902
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,742
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,872
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

24
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:21,699
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,005
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:27,465
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:30,347
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:32,305
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,227
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:36,811
You be good, baby.

31
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:40,439
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

32
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:52,991
- Victor, Illona.
- Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:55,742
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:56,124 --> 00:03:00,586
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,881
Alice, look at you.
God, you' re absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:06,001
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,962
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

38
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,180
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,761
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,470
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,098
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,022
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,041
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,871
Not a soul.

45
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:54,186
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:59,859
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:13,157
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:16,915
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,459
Really?

50
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,251
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,639
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,179
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you' re enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,850
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

54
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,565
Thank you.

55
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,661
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:51,280
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,498
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,084
Good.

59
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:08,977
Nightingale.

60
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:10,975
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,472
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:16,901
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:20,528
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,069
And a couple.

65
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,486
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

66
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,748
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,831
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,758
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,256
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,007
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,470
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:49,730
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor. "

73
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:54,233
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor. "

74
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,477
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,566
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:01,983
Cheers.

77
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,994
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,832
Be right with you.

79
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,712
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,704
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Café.

81
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:17,595
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

82
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:21,383
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:06,310
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:09,643
I' m absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:27,664
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I' m Hungarian.

86
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,715
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,100
I' m American.

88
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:45,681
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:52,022
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

90
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:57,777
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

91
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:00,738
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:04,707
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:08,839
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,625
A very good time.

95
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,885
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,060
With my husband.

97
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:24,355
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:29,978
But then I' m sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,034
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,950
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:44,124
...I' m looking for a job.

102
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:49,047
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,842
But it went broke.

104
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:55,474
What a shame.

105
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:59,723
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:02,604
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,022
Thank you.

108
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,843
Someone you know?

109
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:34,385
My...

110
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,478
...husband.

111
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,186
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

112
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:49,073
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:55,570
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

114
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,748
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

115
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,709
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,587
Is it as bad as that?

117
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,262
As good as that.

118
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:14,762
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:19,606
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:23,651
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:29,192
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:33,706
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:37,449
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,419
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:47,012
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

126
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:48,799
...on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,228
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:57,146
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

129
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,856
...which was also clean.

130
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,231
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:09,322
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:13,080
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:17,790
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:21,798
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

135
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:25,051
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:31,719
Fascinating.

137
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:39,441
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:44,572
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,908
They always seem so...

140
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:51,375
...knowledgeable.

141
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:56,209
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

142
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,293
...about all sorts of things.

143
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,384
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,674
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,928
You' re probably right.

146
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,732
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,946
Exactly?

148
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,947
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,411
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:30,074
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:33,377
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:35,248
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:38,301
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:42,799
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:46,305
Fine.

156
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:49,473
To be continued?

157
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,373
Bill, thanks for coming.

158
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:19,256
We had a little accident here.

159
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:21,014
What happened?

160
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:23,467
Well, she was...

161
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:28,141
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

162
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,146
What did she take?

163
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:35,646
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

164
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:37,692
It's heroin and coke.

165
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,654
Heroin and coke?

166
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,495
Anything else?

167
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,420
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

168
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,591
How long has she been like this?

169
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:57,255
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

170
00:13:57,472 --> 00:13:58,586
What's her name?

171
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:00,970
Mandy.

172
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,402
Can you hear me, Mandy?

173
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:17,364
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

174
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,954
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

175
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:23,743
You can hear me.

176
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,171
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

177
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:32,215
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

178
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:35,427
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

179
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:38,464
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:42,394
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

181
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,055
Good.

182
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:47,942
Good.

183
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:53,195
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

184
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,994
It's wonderful.

185
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,495
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

186
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:09,507
I haven't.

187
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:15,094
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

188
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,432
Do you like the period?

189
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,308
I do.

190
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:27,101
I adore it.

191
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:31,652
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

192
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:35,110
Would you like to see it?

193
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,999
I can show it to you.

194
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:45,497
We won't be gone long.

195
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,723
Maybe...

196
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:00,514
...not just...

197
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:03,101
...now.

198
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,418
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

199
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,339
Sorry.

200
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,472
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

201
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,641
Better.

202
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:56,749
You are a very, very lucky girl.

203
00:16:57,877 --> 00:16:59,253
You know that?

204
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:03,084
I know.

205
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:06,459
You' re gonna be okay this time.

206
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:10,972
But you can't keep doing this.

207
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,220
You understand?

208
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:21,516
You' re going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

209
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:24,899
I know.

210
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:37,283
Well, Victor...

211
00:17:39,464 --> 00:17:41,041
...I'll leave the rest to you.

212
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:44,010
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

213
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:47,920
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

214
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,634
Another hour?

215
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,477
Then I'd have someone take her home.

216
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,023
Good night, Mandy.

217
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,198
I can't thank you enough for this.

218
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,160
- You saved my ass.
- I' m glad I was here.

219
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,829
Bill, I probably...

220
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:17,209
I know I don't have to mention this...

221
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,334
...but this is just between us.

222
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:22,087
Of course.

223
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:23,881
Thanks.

224
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:49,489
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

225
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:56,210
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

226
00:18:56,422 --> 00:19:01,050
But I' m sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

227
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:04,973
Yes...

228
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,017
...but will I?

229
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,394
Of course you will.

230
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:19,359
I really have to go.
I have to go.

231
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,365
You don't, you know.

232
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:25,698
Yes, I do.

233
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,871
I must see you again.

234
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,288
- That's impossible.
- Why?

235
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,546
Because...

236
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,383
...I' m married.

237
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,756
Good morning, Lisa.

238
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,089
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

239
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:57,219
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

240
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,054
- Sure.
- Thank you.

241
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,595
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

242
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:05,848
'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...

243
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,935
...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

244
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:15,688
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

245
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:22,122
Hold this for Mommy.

246
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,500
Looking forward to Christmas?

247
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:28,295
Does this hurt?

248
00:21:42,604 --> 00:21:43,884
Right there?

249
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:56,777
Daddy's gonna like that.

250
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:59,203
Very good choice.

251
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:02,324
"...before me...

252
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:07,793
...when I jump into my bed. "

253
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:13,964
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

254
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:16,759
I've taken care of that.

255
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:19,769
Good.

256
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:24,104
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

257
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,983
Let's do that tomorrow.

258
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:16,160
Tell me something.

259
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,420
Those two girls...

260
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:28,880
...at the party last night...

261
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,720
Did you...

262
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,102
...by any chance...

263
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:42,808
...happen to...

264
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:47,274
...fuck them?

265
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,239
What?

266
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:56,828
What are you talking about?

267
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:04,504
I' m talking about the two girls...

268
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:08,669
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

269
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:13,427
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

270
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,474
Who were they?

271
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:25,444
They were just a couple of models.

272
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:34,039
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

273
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,208
Wait a minute.

274
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:44,582
I didn't disappear with anybody.

275
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:50,011
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

276
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:53,722
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

277
00:24:57,525 --> 00:25:00,479
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

278
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:09,537
A friend of the Zieglers.

279
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,625
What did he want?

280
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:15,911
What did he want?

281
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:24,256
Sex...

282
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:28,258
...upstairs.

283
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:31,225
Then and there.

284
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:35,191
Is that all?

285
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:38,100
Yeah, that was all.

286
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,107
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

287
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,953
That's right.

288
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:49,578
Well, I guess that's understandable.

289
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,744
Understandable?

290
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:57,789
Because you are a very...

291
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:01,001
...very beautiful woman.

292
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:05,474
Wait.

293
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,139
Because I' m a beautiful woman...

294
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:15,650
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

295
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:21,860
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you' re saying?

296
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:29,323
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

297
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:36,338
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

298
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:40,338
So on that basis...

299
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:45,549
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

300
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:50,516
There are exceptions.

301
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,060
And what makes you an exception?

302
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:02,490
What makes me an exception is that...

303
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:06,161
...I happen to be in love with you.

304
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,828
And because we' re married...

305
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,338
...and because I would never
lie to you...

306
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,585
...or hurt you.

307
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,309
Do you realize that
what you' re saying...

308
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:30,898
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

309
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,683
...is out of consideration for me?

310
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,942
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

311
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:40,072
Let's just relax, Alice.

312
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,860
This pot is making you aggressive.

313
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:46,492
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

314
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,325
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

315
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:52,121
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

316
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:55,545
I don't even know
what we' re arguing about here.

317
00:27:55,762 --> 00:27:57,968
I' m not arguing.

318
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:03,225
I' m just trying to find out
where you' re coming from.

319
00:28:03,603 --> 00:28:05,181
Where I' m coming from?

320
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:14,362
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

321
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:18,697
...standing in your office naked...

322
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:21,581
...and you' re feeling her fucking tits.

323
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,582
Now, what I want to know...

324
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:28,787
I want to know what you' re thinking
about when you' re squeezing them.

325
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:33,129
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

326
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,926
It's all very impersonal...

327
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:39,723
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

328
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:45,145
So when you' re feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

329
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,389
Exactly.

330
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:51,152
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I' m with a patient.

331
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:56,619
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

332
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:59,070
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

333
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:03,583
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

334
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:09,966
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

335
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:14,430
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

336
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,555
And what makes you so sure?

337
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:23,599
If for no better reason...

338
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,104
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

339
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,779
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

340
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:35,243
What then?

341
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:38,871
I don't know, Alice...

342
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:41,698
What then?

343
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:47,539
Women don't...

344
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:52,253
They basically just don't
think like that.

345
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,093
Millions of years of evolution, right?

346
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,388
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

347
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:05,812
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

348
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,277
...and whatever the fuck else!

349
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,239
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

350
00:30:12,786 --> 00:30:16,405
If you men only knew.

351
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,914
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

352
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:25,250
...and now you' re trying
to make me jealous.

353
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,590
But you' re not the jealous type,
are you?

354
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:28,966
No, I' m not.

355
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:31,255
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

356
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:32,464
No, I haven't.

357
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:35,174
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

358
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:39,351
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you' re my wife.

359
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:41,938
Maybe because you' re
the mother of my child...

360
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:44,939
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

361
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:49,449
You are very, very sure of yourself...

362
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,940
...aren't you?

363
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:52,610
No.

364
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:55,116
I' m sure of you.

365
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:09,256
Do you think that's funny?

366
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:19,982
All right. Fuck it.

367
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:24,567
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

368
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,502
Do you...

369
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:43,339
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

370
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:53,352
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

371
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:55,722
...there was this young naval officer...

372
00:31:55,941 --> 00:32:00,520
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

373
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:03,062
No.

374
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:09,906
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

375
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:12,793
Nothing rings a bell?

376
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:20,753
Well...

377
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:26,765
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

378
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,228
He was checking into the hotel...

379
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:33,978
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

380
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:36,642
...to the elevator.

381
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:45,576
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

382
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,573
Nothing more.

383
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:59,043
But I could hardly...

384
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,262
...move.

385
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:13,478
That afternoon...

386
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:19,823
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

387
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,700
...and you and I made love.

388
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:33,286
And we made plans about our future...

389
00:33:34,465 --> 00:33:38,463
...and we talked about Helena.

390
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,845
And yet...

391
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:45,679
...at no time...

392
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:49,648
...was he ever...

393
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:54,600
...out of my mind.

394
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:04,988
And I thought if he wanted me...

395
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:09,329
...even if it was only...

396
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:12,749
...for one night...

397
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:20,754
...I was ready to give up everything.

398
00:34:22,517 --> 00:34:23,846
You.

399
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:27,981
Helena.

400
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,310
My whole fucking future.

401
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,199
Everything.

402
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:49,121
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

403
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:53,049
...you were dearer to me than ever.

404
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:00,640
And at that moment, my love for you...

405
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,517
...was both...

406
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,020
...tender and sad.

407
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,621
I barely slept that night...

408
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:31,838
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

409
00:35:34,096 --> 00:35:37,928
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

410
00:35:39,393 --> 00:35:42,809
...or that he might still be there.

411
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,360
But by dinner...

412
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:56,864
...I realized he was gone...

413
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:05,492
...and I was...

414
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:08,498
...relieved.

415
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,331
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

416
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:47,383
When did it happen?

417
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:55,844
I have the address.

418
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:57,966
Thank you.

419
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:07,902
Lou Nathanson just died.

420
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,417
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

421
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:16,098
- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr. Harford.

422
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:21,273
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

423
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:22,601
Thank you.

424
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:39,126
Come in.

425
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:46,502
Marion...

426
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:50,265
Oh, Dr. Harford...

427
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:53,730
How good of you to come.

428
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:56,394
I came as soon as I got the message.

429
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:57,853
Thank you.

430
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:02,068
- I' m so sorry.
- Thank you.

431
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,073
Your father was...

432
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,030
He was a very brave man.

433
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:10,330
Oh, thank you.

434
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,748
How are you holding up?

435
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,746
I' m a bit numb.

436
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:20,090
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

437
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:23,508
Would you like to sit down?

438
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:55,495
It's so unreal.

439
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,838
Daddy had such a good day.

440
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,429
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

441
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,643
Then he had a little dinner...

442
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:14,273
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

443
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:20,488
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

444
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:24,946
...and when I went to see how he was...

445
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:27,452
...I just thought he was asleep.

446
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:36,508
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

447
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:43,890
From what you've said...

448
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,145
...I' m sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

449
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:52,147
Oh, God, I hope so.

450
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,278
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

451
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:02,074
...than his death itself.

452
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,618
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

453
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:13,249
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

454
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,676
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

455
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:19,721
...and he'll be coming over soon.

456
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:27,396
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

457
00:41:28,774 --> 00:41:31,775
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

458
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:34,025
A math professor.

459
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:40,741
We' re going to get married in May.

460
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:46,662
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

461
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:51,882
Thank you.

462
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:58,127
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

463
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,507
We'll be moving out there soon.

464
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:05,266
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

465
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,947
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

466
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,720
Oh, my God, no...

467
00:42:56,662 --> 00:42:58,405
I love you.

468
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,413
I love you.

469
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:05,296
I love you, I love you, I love you.

470
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:08,465
I don't want to go away with Carl.

471
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:10,798
Marion, I don't think you realize...

472
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:12,292
I do.

473
00:43:12,596 --> 00:43:17,554
Even if I' m never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

474
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:21,348
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

475
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:27,483
You' re very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you' re saying.

476
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:30,656
I love you.

477
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:34,946
We barely know each other.

478
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:39,621
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

479
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:41,536
I love you.

480
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:49,544
That's probably Carl.

481
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,005
Please don't despise me.

482
00:43:58,688 --> 00:44:00,811
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr. Thomas.

483
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:05,811
- Is she in the bedroom?
- Yes, she is.

484
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:07,191
Thank you.

485
00:44:18,543 --> 00:44:19,574
Come in.

486
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:26,122
Darling.

487
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:32,178
I' m so very sorry.

488
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:34,636
Are you all right?

489
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:36,722
I' m okay.

490
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:42,143
- Dr. Harford, good evening.
- Good evening, Carl.

491
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:45,238
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

492
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:48,401
- It's the least I could do.
- It means a lot to us.

493
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:49,815
Thank you.

494
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:57,537
I was actually on my way out.

495
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,543
Marion...

496
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:05,546
...your father was very proud of you...

497
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:10,756
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

498
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:13,431
Thank you.

499
00:45:20,026 --> 00:45:22,233
I'll show you out.

500
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:26,111
Good night.

501
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:16,452
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

502
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:19,163
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

503
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:22,758
I' m serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

504
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,844
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

505
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:27,464
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

506
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,428
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

507
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:31,970
Merry Christmas, Mary!

508
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,762
- Your butt-brothers are back there!
- Prime cut of meat!

509
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,477
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

510
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,485
You should have tits,
you' re standing so close!

511
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:46,781
- I got dumps that are bigger than you!
- Come on, macho man!

512
00:46:46,997 --> 00:46:50,247
- You want a piece of this, baby?
- Exit only, honey.

513
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:54,035
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

514
00:47:15,695 --> 00:47:19,443
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

515
00:47:20,408 --> 00:47:22,068
Ten past 12.

516
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,281
Going anywhere special?

517
00:47:26,707 --> 00:47:29,708
No, I' m just taking a walk.

518
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:36,874
How'd you like to have a little fun?

519
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:39,797
I' m sorry?

520
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:42,966
Have a little fun?

521
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:46,725
I just live right down there.

522
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:50,107
Would you like to come inside with me?

523
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:53,440
Come inside with you?

524
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:59,691
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

525
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,662
You live in there?

526
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:13,132
By yourself?

527
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:16,094
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

528
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,054
Hey, it's okay.

529
00:48:19,848 --> 00:48:21,888
Listen, no one will bother us.

530
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,429
It's okay. Come on.

531
00:48:25,187 --> 00:48:26,266
Come on.

532
00:48:52,592 --> 00:48:53,790
This is it.

533
00:48:57,973 --> 00:48:59,468
That's a nice tree.

534
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:09,522
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

535
00:49:24,376 --> 00:49:25,657
It's...

536
00:49:26,879 --> 00:49:28,671
...cozy. It's a...

537
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,997
...cozy place.

538
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,553
It's okay.

539
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:53,775
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

540
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,029
Yeah, I guess so.

541
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,781
That depends on what you want to do.

542
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:05,838
What do you want to do?

543
00:50:10,218 --> 00:50:11,926
What do you recommend?

544
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:18,434
What do I recommend?

545
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:35,948
I'd rather not put it into words.

546
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,908
How about you just leave it up to me?

547
00:50:41,419 --> 00:50:43,210
I' m in your hands.

548
00:50:46,091 --> 00:50:48,665
And how does 150 sound?

549
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,176
Sounds wonderful.

550
00:50:56,185 --> 00:51:00,136
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

551
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,903
Thank you.

552
00:51:09,116 --> 00:51:10,112
Prego, prego.

553
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,609
- Grazie.
- You're welcome.

554
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:16,071
If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.

555
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,709
Shall we?

556
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,439
Excuse me.

557
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:37,544
Is everything all right?

558
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:44,717
I was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer?

559
00:52:46,348 --> 00:52:51,224
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

560
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:53,936
It could be awhile.

561
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:57,557
Any idea how long?

562
00:52:58,402 --> 00:53:00,857
No, I don't really know.

563
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:03,991
We' re still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

564
00:53:06,077 --> 00:53:10,289
Well, I' m gonna go to bed now.

565
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:32,351
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

566
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:54,122
Do you have to go?

567
00:53:55,423 --> 00:53:57,546
Do I have to go?

568
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:03,882
I think I do.

569
00:54:06,685 --> 00:54:08,096
Are you sure?

570
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:16,483
Yes, I' m afraid so.

571
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:22,659
But listen, I want to pay you anyway.

572
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:27,539
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

573
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,004
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

574
00:54:35,216 --> 00:54:36,675
No, it's all right.

575
00:54:37,594 --> 00:54:40,714
- No, really. You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

576
00:54:43,308 --> 00:54:44,257
Really?

577
00:54:46,853 --> 00:54:48,812
Well, thank you very much.

578
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:34,735
Thank you.

579
00:55:49,255 --> 00:55:52,541
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

580
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:55,595
- I'd like a table.
- Please follow me.

581
00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:05,936
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

582
00:56:07,108 --> 00:56:09,101
Could I get you anything to drink?

583
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:12,604
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

584
00:56:23,418 --> 00:56:25,624
One, two, one-two-three-four.

585
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,086
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

586
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:34,008
On the bass, Mr. Larry Mc Vey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

587
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:38,302
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

588
00:56:38,518 --> 00:56:42,729
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

589
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:45,519
I' m Nick Nightingale. Good night.

590
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:58,491
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

591
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:02,206
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

592
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,954
I' m sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

593
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,209
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

594
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,010
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

595
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:15,630
Thank you.

596
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,682
So what brings you out at this hour?

597
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,063
- I have a patient in the neighborhood.
- You live in the Village?

598
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:26,192
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

599
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:27,814
You' re married?

600
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:29,822
Nine years.

601
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,194
- Any kids?
- Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

602
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,442
How about you?

603
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:37,284
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

604
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:38,874
You' re a long way from home.

605
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:42,003
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

606
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:43,833
Thank you.

607
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:52,337
- Is this your band?
- No, it's a pick-up band.

608
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:56,602
- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

609
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:59,309
I got another gig later tonight.

610
00:57:59,522 --> 00:58:01,432
You' re playing somewhere else tonight?

611
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,358
They only get started around 2.

612
00:58:04,152 --> 00:58:05,350
In the Village?

613
00:58:07,573 --> 00:58:10,989
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

614
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:12,442
You don't?

615
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:17,866
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

616
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,871
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

617
00:58:21,087 --> 00:58:23,758
- A different place every time?
- So far.

618
00:58:24,884 --> 00:58:26,082
What's the big mystery?

619
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:30,136
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

620
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:37,102
Nick, I' m sorry.
Is there something I' m missing here?

621
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,986
I play blindfolded.

622
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:45,275
What?

623
00:58:47,116 --> 00:58:49,689
I play blindfolded.

624
00:58:53,749 --> 00:58:55,291
You' re putting me on.

625
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:57,956
No, it's the truth.

626
00:58:58,962 --> 00:59:03,589
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

627
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,679
Oh, man.

628
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:13,178
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

629
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:15,222
...but never...

630
00:59:15,605 --> 00:59:18,013
...never anything like this...

631
00:59:18,775 --> 00:59:21,812
...and never such women.

632
00:59:32,082 --> 00:59:33,327
Excuse me.

633
00:59:37,212 --> 00:59:40,249
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

634
00:59:46,097 --> 00:59:47,924
I know where that is.

635
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:56,473
Right.

636
01:00:00,112 --> 01:00:02,022
Well, I' m on my way right now.

637
01:00:02,782 --> 01:00:05,320
Okay, sir. Thank you.

638
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:09,027
What is this?

639
01:00:10,624 --> 01:00:13,246
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

640
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:19,709
It's the password.

641
01:00:20,468 --> 01:00:21,962
The password?

642
01:00:23,221 --> 01:00:26,887
Yeah. Look, I' m really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

643
01:00:27,893 --> 01:00:31,761
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

644
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:40,770
You know there is no way on earth...

645
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:44,740
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

646
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:49,077
- Come on, buddy, give me a break.
- Nick, I'll tell you what.

647
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:52,541
I've already got the password.

648
01:00:53,462 --> 01:00:56,630
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

649
01:00:56,841 --> 01:01:00,424
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

650
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:07,303
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

651
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,477
...that I was prepared to do that.

652
01:01:10,815 --> 01:01:14,149
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

653
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,648
Why not?

654
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:21,407
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

655
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:25,910
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

656
01:01:45,853 --> 01:01:48,011
Thanks. Keep the change.

657
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:03,450
Yes? Who is it?

658
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:05,407
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

659
01:02:05,624 --> 01:02:10,037
I apologize for disturbing you
at this hour, but I need your help.

660
01:02:11,173 --> 01:02:13,082
Who is it that you want?

661
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:17,630
I' m very sorry.
I' m looking for Peter Grenning...

662
01:02:17,888 --> 01:02:20,344
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

663
01:02:22,476 --> 01:02:23,970
What's your name?

664
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:26,512
My name is Bill Harford.

665
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:28,938
I' m Mr. Grenning's doctor.

666
01:02:29,943 --> 01:02:31,852
You are Grenning's doctor?

667
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:36,194
Okay.

668
01:02:36,742 --> 01:02:38,200
Just a moment.

669
01:02:53,385 --> 01:02:55,461
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

670
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:57,252
Yes, I am.

671
01:02:57,765 --> 01:03:01,633
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

672
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:04,643
He moved to Chicago?

673
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,356
I wasn't aware of that.

674
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:14,905
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

675
01:03:15,117 --> 01:03:16,742
Yes, I am.

676
01:03:17,203 --> 01:03:18,116
Well, first of all...

677
01:03:18,371 --> 01:03:23,246
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr...

678
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:24,657
Milich.

679
01:03:24,877 --> 01:03:29,042
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

680
01:03:29,258 --> 01:03:32,259
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

681
01:03:33,178 --> 01:03:36,133
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

682
01:03:36,348 --> 01:03:39,764
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

683
01:03:39,977 --> 01:03:42,100
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

684
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:46,230
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was...

685
01:03:48,278 --> 01:03:53,190
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

686
01:03:53,659 --> 01:03:57,443
And I'd be happy to pay you
$ 100 over the rental price...

687
01:03:57,664 --> 01:03:59,324
...for the inconvenience.

688
01:04:01,168 --> 01:04:02,448
A hundred dollars?

689
01:04:05,964 --> 01:04:07,624
I don't think so.

690
01:04:11,094 --> 01:04:12,969
How about $ 200?

691
01:04:13,598 --> 01:04:16,136
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

692
01:04:27,988 --> 01:04:29,234
Come in.

693
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,324
Can't be too careful these days.

694
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,705
Please.

695
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:46,381
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

696
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:54,387
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

697
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:57,887
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

698
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:04,307
I think we'll find something for you.

699
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:06,730
Follow me, please.

700
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:08,277
Good.

701
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,409
Looks like alive, huh?

702
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:23,164
- It's wonderful.
- Come.

703
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:26,505
So what color cloak?

704
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,679
Red, brown, red?

705
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:32,137
Black.

706
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,885
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

707
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:38,726
- I don't think so.
- Clowns, officers, pirates?

708
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:41,604
No, just the tux, the black cloak...

709
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:44,060
With a hood and a mask.

710
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:48,027
May I take your coat?

711
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:53,197
- You are medicine doctor, yes?
- Yes, I am.

712
01:05:54,165 --> 01:05:57,998
- I have some problem with my hair.
- Your hair?

713
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:00,252
It's starting to fall down too fast.

714
01:06:00,465 --> 01:06:03,382
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

715
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,585
Look at this. Here.

716
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,044
You see?

717
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:09,927
And?

718
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:13,050
I' m afraid this really isn't my field.

719
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,263
What? You can't help me?

720
01:06:15,481 --> 01:06:19,064
No. You should see a trichologist.
It's a hair specialist.

721
01:06:19,277 --> 01:06:22,895
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

722
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:24,822
So if you don't mind...

723
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:27,109
I' m in hurry too, to get back to bed.

724
01:06:27,326 --> 01:06:28,607
I understand.

725
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:31,199
So black cloak?

726
01:06:36,128 --> 01:06:37,539
Did you hear something?

727
01:06:40,841 --> 01:06:42,419
What is this?

728
01:06:52,146 --> 01:06:53,937
What is it?

729
01:06:59,028 --> 01:07:00,986
What is this?

730
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:17,382
What on earth is going on here?!

731
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,713
Milich, I can explain everything.

732
01:07:19,926 --> 01:07:22,215
You! What are you doing here?

733
01:07:22,429 --> 01:07:24,220
I promise I'll kill you!

734
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:28,340
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

735
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,345
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

736
01:07:32,565 --> 01:07:36,183
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

737
01:07:36,402 --> 01:07:40,780
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

738
01:07:41,032 --> 01:07:43,784
- You will have to explain to police!
- To the police?!

739
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,830
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

740
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,622
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

741
01:07:50,835 --> 01:07:52,993
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

742
01:07:53,212 --> 01:07:57,162
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

743
01:07:57,383 --> 01:07:59,459
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

744
01:07:59,677 --> 01:08:01,337
Doctor, I' m sorry to keep you waiting.

745
01:08:01,554 --> 01:08:04,342
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

746
01:08:04,558 --> 01:08:07,180
You will please stay here
until I return.

747
01:08:07,394 --> 01:08:09,019
Let us out of here!

748
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:11,145
That's out of the question.

749
01:08:11,399 --> 01:08:14,981
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

750
01:08:15,194 --> 01:08:16,820
- Black?
- Black.

751
01:08:17,406 --> 01:08:21,024
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

752
01:08:21,243 --> 01:08:23,485
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

753
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:24,659
Sorry.

754
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:28,782
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

755
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:31,457
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

756
01:08:32,214 --> 01:08:34,965
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

757
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,998
Okay, that's $ 74.50.

758
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:28,537
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

759
01:10:29,716 --> 01:10:31,258
There's 80.

760
01:10:31,718 --> 01:10:34,590
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

761
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:40,307
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

762
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,062
Just let the meter run.

763
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:45,641
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

764
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:48,480
- Okay?
- How long you gonna be?

765
01:10:48,737 --> 01:10:52,071
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

766
01:10:53,326 --> 01:10:55,235
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

767
01:11:13,139 --> 01:11:14,514
Good evening, sir.

768
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:16,761
Good evening.

769
01:11:17,393 --> 01:11:18,768
Can we be of any help?

770
01:11:20,522 --> 01:11:22,432
I suppose you'd like the password.

771
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,274
If you'd like, sir.

772
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:25,482
Fidelio.

773
01:11:25,694 --> 01:11:28,779
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

774
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:10,527
Good evening, sir.

775
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,119
Good evening.

776
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,990
Password, sir?

777
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:15,827
Fidelio.

778
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,875
Thank you, sir.

779
01:18:23,358 --> 01:18:26,145
I' m not sure what you
think you' re doing.

780
01:18:26,528 --> 01:18:28,569
But you don't belong here.

781
01:18:29,407 --> 01:18:34,318
I' m sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

782
01:18:37,749 --> 01:18:40,750
Please! Don't be foolish.

783
01:18:41,461 --> 01:18:43,206
You must go now.

784
01:18:48,011 --> 01:18:49,256
Who are you?

785
01:18:49,512 --> 01:18:51,671
It doesn't matter who I am.

786
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,632
You are in great danger.

787
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,348
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

788
01:19:02,652 --> 01:19:05,688
Would you be so good
as to excuse us for a moment?

789
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:07,139
Have you been enjoying yourself?

790
01:22:09,063 --> 01:22:12,681
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

791
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,855
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

792
01:22:22,286 --> 01:22:23,317
Private?

793
01:22:26,082 --> 01:22:27,742
That might be a good idea.

794
01:22:27,959 --> 01:22:32,705
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

795
01:22:34,591 --> 01:22:36,667
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

796
01:22:36,927 --> 01:22:39,383
I promise to bring him right back.

797
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:52,484
I don't think you realize
the danger you' re in now.

798
01:22:52,694 --> 01:22:54,734
You can't fool them for much longer.

799
01:22:54,947 --> 01:22:57,948
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

800
01:22:59,868 --> 01:23:01,945
Why are you telling me this?

801
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:04,079
It doesn't matter.

802
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:05,406
Who are you?

803
01:23:07,168 --> 01:23:11,332
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

804
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:14,716
Will you come with me?

805
01:23:14,926 --> 01:23:16,670
That's impossible.

806
01:23:16,888 --> 01:23:17,919
Why?

807
01:23:18,139 --> 01:23:22,386
Because it would cost me my life
and possibly yours.

808
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:25,430
Let me see your face.

809
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:28,221
Go!

810
01:23:30,443 --> 01:23:32,068
Excuse me, sir.

811
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:38,657
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

812
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:41,284
Yes.

813
01:23:41,539 --> 01:23:45,751
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

814
01:24:47,903 --> 01:24:51,439
Please, come forward.

815
01:25:23,734 --> 01:25:27,020
May I have the password, please?

816
01:25:28,281 --> 01:25:30,072
Fidelio.

817
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:36,363
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

818
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:38,325
...for admittance.

819
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:43,997
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

820
01:25:49,596 --> 01:25:52,550
The password for the house?

821
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:05,481
I' m sorry, I...

822
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,698
I seem to have...

823
01:26:15,415 --> 01:26:16,957
...forgotten it.

824
01:26:18,752 --> 01:26:21,125
That's unfortunate.

825
01:26:21,923 --> 01:26:26,881
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

826
01:26:27,303 --> 01:26:29,973
...or if you never knew it.

827
01:26:31,266 --> 01:26:35,312
You will kindly remove your mask.

828
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:57,121
Now...

829
01:26:57,837 --> 01:26:59,414
...get undressed.

830
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:09,090
Get undressed?

831
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:13,470
Remove your clothes.

832
01:27:25,075 --> 01:27:28,325
Gentlemen, please...

833
01:27:31,206 --> 01:27:33,958
Remove your clothes.

834
01:27:34,168 --> 01:27:38,001
Or would you like us to do it for you?

835
01:27:39,549 --> 01:27:40,664
Stop!

836
01:27:46,556 --> 01:27:49,344
Let him go.

837
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:53,014
Take me!

838
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:58,149
I am ready to redeem him.

839
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:08,034
You are ready to redeem him?

840
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:11,535
Yes.

841
01:28:14,462 --> 01:28:18,542
Are you sure you understand
what you' re taking upon yourself...

842
01:28:18,925 --> 01:28:20,918
...in doing this?

843
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:31,730
Very well.

844
01:28:36,903 --> 01:28:38,647
You are free.

845
01:28:40,532 --> 01:28:42,276
But I warn you...

846
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:45,401
...if you make any further inquiries...

847
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:49,619
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

848
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:52,540
...about what you have seen...

849
01:28:52,754 --> 01:28:57,251
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

850
01:28:57,509 --> 01:28:59,502
...and your family.

851
01:29:01,221 --> 01:29:03,344
Do you understand?

852
01:29:43,142 --> 01:29:45,680
What is going to happen to that woman?

853
01:29:46,521 --> 01:29:49,557
No one can change her fate now.

854
01:29:50,483 --> 01:29:53,105
When a promise has been made here...

855
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:56,521
...there is no turning back.

856
01:29:57,783 --> 01:29:59,064
Go!

857
01:32:09,135 --> 01:32:10,593
It's okay.

858
01:32:11,805 --> 01:32:13,264
I' m sorry.

859
01:32:13,807 --> 01:32:18,350
I' m sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

860
01:32:18,937 --> 01:32:20,396
Oh, God.

861
01:32:21,482 --> 01:32:24,399
I just had such a horrible dream.

862
01:32:26,196 --> 01:32:27,773
What time is it?

863
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,113
It's a little after 4.

864
01:32:32,828 --> 01:32:34,820
Did you just get home?

865
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:41,290
It took longer than I thought.

866
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:43,871
You must be exhausted.

867
01:32:44,507 --> 01:32:47,876
Come on, lie down.

868
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,395
What were you dreaming?

869
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:07,488
Just these weird things.

870
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:09,241
What was it?

871
01:33:12,913 --> 01:33:15,583
It was so weird.

872
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:19,455
Tell me.

873
01:33:40,609 --> 01:33:43,777
We were in a deserted city...

874
01:33:48,785 --> 01:33:51,241
...and our clothes were gone.

875
01:33:53,165 --> 01:33:55,074
We were naked...

876
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:03,295
...and I was terrified...

877
01:34:08,306 --> 01:34:10,714
...and I felt ashamed.

878
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,471
Oh, God...

879
01:34:17,817 --> 01:34:21,862
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

880
01:34:24,449 --> 01:34:28,779
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

881
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:37,159
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

882
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,419
I felt wonderful.

883
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:52,596
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

884
01:34:53,147 --> 01:34:56,314
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

885
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,157
...and a man walked out of the woods.

886
01:35:08,372 --> 01:35:12,666
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

887
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,207
The naval officer.

888
01:35:22,096 --> 01:35:24,302
He stared at me...

889
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:31,429
...and then he just laughed.

890
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:36,518
He just laughed at me.

891
01:35:52,796 --> 01:35:54,623
But that's not the end...

892
01:35:55,715 --> 01:35:56,913
...is it?

893
01:36:02,724 --> 01:36:05,049
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

894
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,898
It's too awful.

895
01:36:14,736 --> 01:36:16,611
It's only a dream.

896
01:36:42,099 --> 01:36:44,175
He was kissing me...

897
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:53,444
...and then we were making love.

898
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:01,951
Then there were all these
other people around us...

899
01:37:02,164 --> 01:37:04,999
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

900
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:07,746
Everyone was fucking.

901
01:37:13,592 --> 01:37:15,134
And then I...

902
01:37:18,223 --> 01:37:20,714
I was fucking other men.

903
01:37:21,434 --> 01:37:23,142
So many...

904
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:27,565
...I don't know how many I was with.

905
01:37:30,694 --> 01:37:35,571
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

906
01:37:38,453 --> 01:37:41,323
...just fucking all these men.

907
01:37:45,794 --> 01:37:48,500
I wanted to make fun of you...

908
01:37:50,258 --> 01:37:52,665
...to laugh in your face.

909
01:37:55,972 --> 01:38:00,930
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

910
01:38:15,034 --> 01:38:18,202
That must have been
when you woke me up.

911
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:03,920
Shit!

912
01:39:41,003 --> 01:39:43,079
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

913
01:39:50,556 --> 01:39:51,801
Anything else?

914
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,843
No, thank you.

915
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,061
Excuse me.

916
01:40:04,071 --> 01:40:07,237
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Café?

917
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:10,865
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

918
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:19,913
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

919
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:23,084
He's playing piano
over there right now.

920
01:40:23,383 --> 01:40:24,877
Nick Nightingale?

921
01:40:25,302 --> 01:40:27,875
Sure, he comes in here.

922
01:40:30,682 --> 01:40:33,469
Look, maybe you can help me...

923
01:40:33,685 --> 01:40:37,305
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

924
01:40:38,525 --> 01:40:40,268
Do you know where he's staying?

925
01:40:43,947 --> 01:40:47,031
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

926
01:40:47,242 --> 01:40:49,615
It's okay, I' m a doctor.

927
01:40:49,912 --> 01:40:52,368
I' m actually an old friend of his.

928
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:55,452
Well, doctor...

929
01:40:57,962 --> 01:41:01,580
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

930
01:41:04,594 --> 01:41:06,504
To be perfectly honest...

931
01:41:08,808 --> 01:41:10,551
...it's a medical matter.

932
01:41:10,977 --> 01:41:15,271
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

933
01:41:42,553 --> 01:41:43,466
Excuse me.

934
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:47,387
Hi! How can I help you?

935
01:41:47,599 --> 01:41:51,349
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

936
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:55,515
I' m sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

937
01:41:55,775 --> 01:41:57,270
He checked out?

938
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:05,279
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I' m afraid not.

939
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:08,448
When did he check out?

940
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:11,915
About 5:00 this morning.

941
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:13,497
5:00?

942
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:17,122
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

943
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,128
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

944
01:42:24,223 --> 01:42:27,141
Did you notice anything...

945
01:42:27,477 --> 01:42:28,935
...I don't know...

946
01:42:29,604 --> 01:42:32,640
...unusual about him when he left?

947
01:42:34,651 --> 01:42:36,062
Unusual?

948
01:42:37,655 --> 01:42:39,647
Hey, you' re not Five-O, are you?

949
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,575
No, I' m an old friend of his.

950
01:42:42,785 --> 01:42:43,900
Really?

951
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:45,864
I' m a doctor.

952
01:42:49,167 --> 01:42:53,497
- Well, Bill...?
- Sure.

953
01:42:55,883 --> 01:42:58,800
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

954
01:42:59,053 --> 01:43:02,386
...because there was something
a little strange...

955
01:43:02,598 --> 01:43:05,089
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

956
01:43:05,434 --> 01:43:07,808
Really? What was that?

957
01:43:15,988 --> 01:43:20,531
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a. M...

958
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:23,028
...with two men.

959
01:43:24,039 --> 01:43:25,747
Big guys.

960
01:43:26,291 --> 01:43:29,245
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

961
01:43:29,461 --> 01:43:33,126
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

962
01:43:33,382 --> 01:43:35,125
...if you know what I mean.

963
01:43:37,929 --> 01:43:39,388
Anyways...

964
01:43:40,724 --> 01:43:45,469
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

965
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:51,140
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

966
01:43:52,152 --> 01:43:53,316
Scared?

967
01:43:56,074 --> 01:43:57,698
He said he wanted to check out.

968
01:43:57,909 --> 01:44:01,823
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

969
01:44:02,121 --> 01:44:05,989
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

970
01:44:06,751 --> 01:44:10,916
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

971
01:44:11,132 --> 01:44:12,840
But they saw it and took it...

972
01:44:13,092 --> 01:44:15,963
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

973
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:20,763
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

974
01:44:21,601 --> 01:44:24,093
And then they just
took him off in a car.

975
01:44:25,397 --> 01:44:27,723
Do you have any idea where they went?

976
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:30,024
No, not a clue.

977
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:44,324
I certainly appreciate your help.

978
01:44:44,543 --> 01:44:46,168
Anytime, Bill.

979
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:25,003
Oh, the good doctor!

980
01:45:26,714 --> 01:45:31,672
- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

981
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:33,500
Good, good.

982
01:45:33,721 --> 01:45:38,716
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

983
01:45:41,314 --> 01:45:45,062
I think you forgot the mask.

984
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:47,855
It's not there?

985
01:45:48,821 --> 01:45:51,359
Maybe you left it at the party?

986
01:45:56,413 --> 01:45:57,991
I don't think so.

987
01:45:59,959 --> 01:46:03,494
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

988
01:46:03,713 --> 01:46:04,708
Sure.

989
01:46:09,010 --> 01:46:10,884
Here we are.

990
01:46:12,431 --> 01:46:16,511
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

991
01:46:16,727 --> 01:46:20,178
...25 for the mask. Sorry...

992
01:46:22,942 --> 01:46:24,602
Three hundred seventy-five.

993
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:28,519
Yes, dear?

994
01:46:28,865 --> 01:46:30,324
Come, come.

995
01:46:31,577 --> 01:46:34,531
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

996
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,675
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

997
01:46:47,594 --> 01:46:49,503
Goodbye, gentlemen.

998
01:46:49,805 --> 01:46:53,055
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

999
01:46:54,017 --> 01:46:56,260
Well, Dr. Harford...

1000
01:46:57,522 --> 01:46:59,099
...here is your receipt.

1001
01:47:00,441 --> 01:47:02,683
I' m tearing up your deposits...

1002
01:47:03,862 --> 01:47:06,187
...and thanks for the business.

1003
01:47:10,786 --> 01:47:14,072
Mr. Milich, last night...

1004
01:47:16,876 --> 01:47:19,284
...you were going to call the police.

1005
01:47:20,838 --> 01:47:24,919
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1006
01:47:25,134 --> 01:47:30,094
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1007
01:47:30,725 --> 01:47:32,468
...anything at all...

1008
01:47:33,477 --> 01:47:36,015
...it needn't be a costume.

1009
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:04,755
Come in.

1010
01:48:06,472 --> 01:48:09,223
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1011
01:48:10,267 --> 01:48:13,305
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1012
01:48:13,521 --> 01:48:18,480
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1013
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:23,072
Well, something's come up, and I' m
not going to be able to see them.

1014
01:48:23,323 --> 01:48:26,988
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1015
01:48:27,203 --> 01:48:29,112
...and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1016
01:48:29,581 --> 01:48:33,661
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1017
01:48:33,877 --> 01:48:35,205
No problem.

1018
01:52:25,004 --> 01:52:27,673
Any calls for me?

1019
01:52:27,882 --> 01:52:31,833
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1020
01:52:33,138 --> 01:52:35,594
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1021
01:52:36,475 --> 01:52:38,432
Look, I got all these right.

1022
01:52:38,644 --> 01:52:40,636
You got all of those right?

1023
01:52:41,188 --> 01:52:42,932
Every single one of them?

1024
01:52:43,315 --> 01:52:44,596
That's good.

1025
01:52:44,817 --> 01:52:46,395
You hungry?

1026
01:52:47,487 --> 01:52:48,816
Sort of.

1027
01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:50,822
Want to eat at 7?

1028
01:52:51,033 --> 01:52:53,358
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1029
01:52:53,577 --> 01:52:57,527
I have some appointments
at the office.

1030
01:52:57,748 --> 01:52:59,787
You have to go out again tonight?

1031
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,996
I' m afraid so.

1032
01:53:01,210 --> 01:53:04,710
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1033
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,796
We'll see about that, okay?

1034
01:53:10,387 --> 01:53:12,463
He could be a watchdog...

1035
01:53:12,681 --> 01:53:14,175
We'll see.

1036
01:53:14,391 --> 01:53:17,144
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1037
01:53:17,395 --> 01:53:20,978
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $ 2.50.

1038
01:53:21,190 --> 01:53:25,817
And Mike has $ 1.75.

1039
01:53:26,029 --> 01:53:29,694
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1040
01:53:29,908 --> 01:53:32,234
$0.75?

1041
01:53:34,163 --> 01:53:37,532
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1042
01:53:41,295 --> 01:53:44,546
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1043
01:53:44,757 --> 01:53:47,795
Yeah, because you' re going
to be taking. Right.

1044
01:53:48,095 --> 01:53:51,381
And there were all these
other people around us.

1045
01:53:51,766 --> 01:53:54,221
Hundreds of them, everywhere.

1046
01:53:54,727 --> 01:53:56,969
Everyone was fucking.

1047
01:53:57,897 --> 01:54:01,396
And then I...
I was fucking other men.

1048
01:54:02,778 --> 01:54:04,438
So many...

1049
01:54:04,905 --> 01:54:07,859
...I don't know how many I was with.

1050
01:55:45,389 --> 01:55:48,094
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1051
01:56:18,759 --> 01:56:19,624
What is it?

1052
01:56:19,885 --> 01:56:21,084
Domino?

1053
01:56:21,429 --> 01:56:23,303
No, she's not in.

1054
01:56:27,268 --> 01:56:29,475
Are you expecting her back soon?

1055
01:56:29,688 --> 01:56:31,182
No, I' m not.

1056
01:56:37,822 --> 01:56:41,238
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1057
01:56:42,118 --> 01:56:43,398
Just a minute.

1058
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:52,252
Can I say who it's from?

1059
01:56:53,756 --> 01:56:56,128
Well, just tell her it's from...

1060
01:56:57,176 --> 01:56:58,172
...Bill.

1061
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:00,006
You' re Bill?

1062
01:57:01,597 --> 01:57:05,595
The Bill? You' re the doctor
who was here last night?

1063
01:57:06,645 --> 01:57:09,101
Well, I suppose I am.

1064
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,728
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1065
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:14,148
Did she?

1066
01:57:16,989 --> 01:57:18,982
Why don't you come in for a second?

1067
01:57:22,037 --> 01:57:23,068
Sure.

1068
01:57:43,852 --> 01:57:45,346
I' m Sally.

1069
01:57:46,104 --> 01:57:47,978
Hello, Sally.

1070
01:57:51,026 --> 01:57:56,022
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1071
01:57:59,577 --> 01:58:01,535
I have no idea.

1072
01:58:02,455 --> 01:58:04,448
You have no idea?

1073
01:58:09,964 --> 01:58:14,922
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1074
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:20,015
She may not even be coming back?

1075
01:58:40,748 --> 01:58:41,910
I...

1076
01:58:45,336 --> 01:58:46,450
You...?

1077
01:58:46,712 --> 01:58:51,090
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1078
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:52,714
Really?

1079
01:58:54,471 --> 01:58:57,258
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1080
01:58:57,474 --> 01:59:00,760
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1081
01:59:04,815 --> 01:59:07,104
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1082
01:59:12,741 --> 01:59:15,612
Why don't you have a seat?

1083
01:59:16,328 --> 01:59:18,119
Let's sit down.

1084
01:59:34,264 --> 01:59:38,594
- I don't quite know how to say this.
- You don't quite know how?

1085
01:59:42,982 --> 01:59:46,766
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1086
01:59:49,322 --> 01:59:53,736
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1087
01:59:56,872 --> 02:00:00,158
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1088
02:00:00,376 --> 02:00:03,626
...and it was HIV-positive.

1089
02:00:14,683 --> 02:00:16,510
HIV-positive?

1090
02:00:31,952 --> 02:00:36,828
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1091
02:00:44,049 --> 02:00:47,050
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1092
02:01:00,066 --> 02:01:02,771
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1093
02:01:03,278 --> 02:01:05,187
A cup of coffee maybe?

1094
02:01:13,873 --> 02:01:15,284
No, thank you.

1095
02:01:20,046 --> 02:01:21,624
I think...

1096
02:01:22,966 --> 02:01:24,875
...maybe I'd better be going.

1097
02:03:13,838 --> 02:03:15,415
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1098
02:05:05,251 --> 02:05:08,287
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1099
02:05:08,504 --> 02:05:10,295
I'll bring it over to you.

1100
02:05:10,506 --> 02:05:11,669
Thank you.

1101
02:06:51,742 --> 02:06:53,022
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1102
02:06:53,243 --> 02:06:54,702
I' m Dr. Harford.

1103
02:06:54,953 --> 02:06:59,283
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1104
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:01,577
Could you please
give me her room number?

1105
02:07:01,795 --> 02:07:05,579
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1106
02:07:05,966 --> 02:07:08,539
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1107
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,919
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1108
02:07:15,517 --> 02:07:17,345
Miss Amanda Curran?

1109
02:07:18,146 --> 02:07:19,426
That's right.

1110
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:23,641
I' m sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1111
02:07:27,697 --> 02:07:29,571
She died this afternoon?

1112
02:07:29,950 --> 02:07:33,284
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1113
02:07:33,746 --> 02:07:35,205
I' m sorry.

1114
02:08:23,384 --> 02:08:26,005
Because it could cost me my life...

1115
02:08:26,971 --> 02:08:29,010
...and possibly yours.

1116
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,671
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1117
02:10:18,842 --> 02:10:20,124
Tonight?

1118
02:10:20,845 --> 02:10:22,968
No, no, that's okay.

1119
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:30,061
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

1120
02:10:53,714 --> 02:10:54,995
Come in.

1121
02:10:57,051 --> 02:11:00,752
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1122
02:11:01,055 --> 02:11:03,760
- Let me have your coat.
- I was out anyway. Thank you.

1123
02:11:03,975 --> 02:11:05,387
How about a drink?

1124
02:11:05,936 --> 02:11:07,810
- Are you having one?
- Sure.

1125
02:11:08,272 --> 02:11:09,683
What would you like?

1126
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:11,429
Just a little scotch.

1127
02:11:11,651 --> 02:11:12,682
Good.

1128
02:11:14,695 --> 02:11:15,858
How do you take it? Neat?

1129
02:11:16,072 --> 02:11:17,186
Please.

1130
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:21,109
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1131
02:11:21,328 --> 02:11:25,112
- Alice and I had a wonderful time.
- Well, good.

1132
02:11:26,083 --> 02:11:27,874
It was great seeing you both.

1133
02:11:28,085 --> 02:11:29,544
Cheers.

1134
02:11:30,254 --> 02:11:31,665
Were you playing?

1135
02:11:32,131 --> 02:11:35,418
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1136
02:11:36,678 --> 02:11:39,383
- Beautiful scotch.
- That's a 25-year-old.

1137
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:42,095
- I'll send you over a case.
- No, please.

1138
02:11:42,309 --> 02:11:43,305
Why not?

1139
02:11:46,772 --> 02:11:48,930
You feel like playing?

1140
02:11:49,149 --> 02:11:52,484
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1141
02:11:55,031 --> 02:11:56,490
I was just...

1142
02:11:59,286 --> 02:12:00,400
Listen...

1143
02:12:07,003 --> 02:12:11,961
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1144
02:12:13,885 --> 02:12:16,293
...I need to talk to you
about something.

1145
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:18,425
Sure.

1146
02:12:21,644 --> 02:12:23,269
It's a little bit awkward.

1147
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:28,811
And I have to be completely frank.

1148
02:12:31,029 --> 02:12:33,068
What kind of problem are you having?

1149
02:12:37,703 --> 02:12:39,779
It isn't a medical problem.

1150
02:12:45,503 --> 02:12:46,878
Actually...

1151
02:12:48,798 --> 02:12:50,707
...it concerns you.

1152
02:13:03,773 --> 02:13:06,810
I know what happened last night.

1153
02:13:10,823 --> 02:13:14,441
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1154
02:13:19,123 --> 02:13:22,457
And I think you just might...

1155
02:13:23,879 --> 02:13:27,295
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1156
02:13:40,605 --> 02:13:43,061
I' m sorry, Victor, I...

1157
02:13:45,068 --> 02:13:48,271
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1158
02:13:50,407 --> 02:13:53,077
Please, Bill, no games.

1159
02:13:55,246 --> 02:13:56,705
I was there.

1160
02:13:58,666 --> 02:14:00,208
At the house.

1161
02:14:03,797 --> 02:14:06,881
I saw everything that went on.

1162
02:14:18,771 --> 02:14:22,721
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1163
02:14:26,405 --> 02:14:29,739
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1164
02:14:30,910 --> 02:14:32,570
...how you'd heard about it...

1165
02:14:32,787 --> 02:14:36,405
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1166
02:14:40,254 --> 02:14:45,212
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1167
02:14:45,426 --> 02:14:48,676
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1168
02:14:49,638 --> 02:14:52,639
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1169
02:14:57,105 --> 02:14:58,932
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1170
02:15:00,734 --> 02:15:02,276
It was mine.

1171
02:15:02,736 --> 02:15:04,729
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1172
02:15:05,113 --> 02:15:08,613
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1173
02:15:08,827 --> 02:15:11,531
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1174
02:15:11,746 --> 02:15:14,700
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1175
02:15:22,382 --> 02:15:24,292
What can I say?

1176
02:15:30,642 --> 02:15:31,970
I had...

1177
02:15:33,478 --> 02:15:35,056
...absolutely...

1178
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:40,644
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1179
02:15:42,071 --> 02:15:44,147
I know you didn't, Bill.

1180
02:15:46,075 --> 02:15:48,115
But I also know that you...

1181
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:51,693
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1182
02:15:51,956 --> 02:15:53,700
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1183
02:15:55,294 --> 02:15:56,919
How do you know that?

1184
02:15:58,923 --> 02:16:00,962
Because I had you followed.

1185
02:16:06,889 --> 02:16:08,597
You had me followed?

1186
02:16:10,978 --> 02:16:13,303
Okay, okay, I' m sorry.

1187
02:16:13,689 --> 02:16:15,598
All right? I owe you an apology.

1188
02:16:15,816 --> 02:16:18,521
This was for your own good, believe me.

1189
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:22,942
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1190
02:16:23,199 --> 02:16:26,403
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1191
02:16:26,787 --> 02:16:30,571
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1192
02:16:31,124 --> 02:16:33,034
...banging Mrs. Nick.

1193
02:16:34,378 --> 02:16:37,628
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1194
02:16:39,717 --> 02:16:42,884
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1195
02:16:43,972 --> 02:16:46,926
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1196
02:16:47,767 --> 02:16:51,896
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1197
02:16:53,315 --> 02:16:55,438
Who do you think those people were?

1198
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:58,233
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1199
02:16:58,446 --> 02:17:01,780
If I told you their names...
I' m not gonna tell you their names...

1200
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:05,740
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1201
02:17:09,374 --> 02:17:11,498
Was it the second password?

1202
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:14,622
Is that what gave me away?

1203
02:17:16,758 --> 02:17:18,999
Yes, finally.

1204
02:17:21,095 --> 02:17:23,421
But not because you didn't know it.

1205
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:28,268
It's because there was
no second password.

1206
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:33,976
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1207
02:17:34,193 --> 02:17:36,684
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1208
02:17:36,946 --> 02:17:40,647
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1209
02:17:40,867 --> 02:17:43,987
...made out to you-know-who.

1210
02:18:01,723 --> 02:18:05,175
There was a woman there...

1211
02:18:10,983 --> 02:18:12,775
...who tried to warn me.

1212
02:18:18,450 --> 02:18:19,695
I know.

1213
02:18:25,457 --> 02:18:27,201
Do you know who she was?

1214
02:18:41,224 --> 02:18:42,933
She was a hooker.

1215
02:18:52,487 --> 02:18:54,147
Sorry, but...

1216
02:18:55,323 --> 02:18:57,316
...that's what she was.

1217
02:19:01,747 --> 02:19:02,910
A hooker.

1218
02:19:17,765 --> 02:19:20,220
Suppose I told you...

1219
02:19:21,894 --> 02:19:24,812
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1220
02:19:26,315 --> 02:19:30,444
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1221
02:19:30,654 --> 02:19:33,406
...her last-minute intervention...

1222
02:19:33,615 --> 02:19:37,399
...suppose I said that all of that...

1223
02:19:38,787 --> 02:19:41,457
...was staged.

1224
02:19:43,585 --> 02:19:47,452
That it was a kind of charade.

1225
02:19:49,049 --> 02:19:51,006
That it was fake.

1226
02:19:55,597 --> 02:19:56,973
Fake?

1227
02:19:58,726 --> 02:20:01,300
Yes. Fake.

1228
02:20:12,824 --> 02:20:14,734
Why would they do that?

1229
02:20:15,578 --> 02:20:16,823
Why?

1230
02:20:18,122 --> 02:20:19,782
In plain words...

1231
02:20:20,708 --> 02:20:23,246
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1232
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:27,836
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1233
02:20:28,341 --> 02:20:30,050
...and what you'd seen.

1234
02:20:50,157 --> 02:20:51,735
Have you seen this?

1235
02:21:09,094 --> 02:21:11,087
Yes, I have.

1236
02:21:16,561 --> 02:21:19,681
I saw her body in the morgue.

1237
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:31,694
Was she the woman at the party?

1238
02:21:44,007 --> 02:21:45,467
She was.

1239
02:21:59,733 --> 02:22:02,307
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1240
02:22:04,322 --> 02:22:06,195
...was the woman at the party.

1241
02:22:14,874 --> 02:22:19,751
Well, Victor, maybe I' m
missing something here.

1242
02:22:20,631 --> 02:22:24,130
You called it a fake, a charade.

1243
02:22:25,761 --> 02:22:29,130
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1244
02:22:29,390 --> 02:22:33,223
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1245
02:22:39,151 --> 02:22:43,778
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1246
02:22:43,989 --> 02:22:46,778
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1247
02:22:47,035 --> 02:22:50,487
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1248
02:22:51,748 --> 02:22:55,413
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1249
02:22:55,627 --> 02:23:00,206
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1250
02:23:00,424 --> 02:23:04,043
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1251
02:23:04,262 --> 02:23:07,299
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1252
02:23:08,725 --> 02:23:13,138
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1253
02:23:13,772 --> 02:23:15,480
...and the rest is in the paper.

1254
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:19,392
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1255
02:23:19,612 --> 02:23:23,824
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1256
02:23:25,201 --> 02:23:30,159
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1257
02:23:30,498 --> 02:23:32,159
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1258
02:23:32,376 --> 02:23:36,244
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1259
02:23:53,149 --> 02:23:57,277
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1260
02:23:57,695 --> 02:24:00,364
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1261
02:24:01,824 --> 02:24:04,150
But life goes on.

1262
02:24:04,578 --> 02:24:05,989
It always does...

1263
02:24:06,246 --> 02:24:07,705
...until it doesn't.

1264
02:24:09,333 --> 02:24:11,207
But you know that, don't you?

1265
02:27:35,891 --> 02:27:38,383
I'll tell you everything.

1266
02:27:43,817 --> 02:27:46,106
I'll tell you everything.

1267
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:40,166
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1268
02:28:57,064 --> 02:29:01,358
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1269
02:29:26,137 --> 02:29:27,217
That's nice.

1270
02:29:27,472 --> 02:29:30,045
I could put Sabrina in here.

1271
02:29:30,809 --> 02:29:33,216
It's really pretty.

1272
02:29:33,436 --> 02:29:35,429
It's old-fashioned.

1273
02:29:44,574 --> 02:29:45,819
He's big.

1274
02:29:46,034 --> 02:29:49,450
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1275
02:29:49,662 --> 02:29:50,907
You do?

1276
02:29:53,249 --> 02:29:55,409
Well, you' re gonna
have to wait and see.

1277
02:30:09,602 --> 02:30:11,641
What do you think we should do?

1278
02:30:16,817 --> 02:30:18,276
What do I think we should do?

1279
02:30:18,527 --> 02:30:19,808
Look, Mommy!

1280
02:30:29,164 --> 02:30:31,834
What do I think?
I don't know.

1281
02:30:34,003 --> 02:30:35,794
I mean, maybe...

1282
02:30:47,809 --> 02:30:51,309
Maybe I think...

1283
02:30:52,022 --> 02:30:54,347
...we should be grateful.

1284
02:31:00,365 --> 02:31:01,943
Grateful...

1285
02:31:02,492 --> 02:31:07,487
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1286
02:31:08,373 --> 02:31:10,082
...adventures...

1287
02:31:12,503 --> 02:31:14,876
...whether they were real...

1288
02:31:15,381 --> 02:31:17,623
...or only a dream.

1289
02:31:26,894 --> 02:31:30,726
Are you sure of that?

1290
02:31:34,652 --> 02:31:36,277
Am I sure?

1291
02:31:52,088 --> 02:31:53,831
Only as sure as I am...

1292
02:31:54,048 --> 02:31:57,917
...that the reality of one night...

1293
02:31:59,221 --> 02:32:02,056
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1294
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:07,015
...can ever be the whole truth.

1295
02:32:13,779 --> 02:32:15,771
And no dream is ever...

1296
02:32:17,658 --> 02:32:19,449
...just a dream.

1297
02:32:27,919 --> 02:32:29,995
The important thing is...

1298
02:32:31,882 --> 02:32:33,590
...we' re awake now...

1299
02:32:34,926 --> 02:32:37,252
...and hopefully...

1300
02:32:40,307 --> 02:32:42,514
...for a long time to come.

1301
02:32:46,189 --> 02:32:47,683
Forever.

1302
02:32:49,859 --> 02:32:51,318
Forever?

1303
02:32:53,655 --> 02:32:55,149
Forever.

1304
02:32:57,535 --> 02:33:01,153
Let's not use that word. You know?

1305
02:33:02,498 --> 02:33:04,456
It frightens me.

1306
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:17,840
But I do love you...

1307
02:33:20,977 --> 02:33:22,637
...and you know...

1308
02:33:23,813 --> 02:33:25,971
...there is something very important...

1309
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:28,896
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1310
02:33:30,237 --> 02:33:31,518
What's that?

1311
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:36,159
Fuck.
