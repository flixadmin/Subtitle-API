1
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:26,943
Sir?

2
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,573
The telephone recordings you
requested. From La Picota.

3
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,699
Excuse me.

4
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,551
He killed the DEA rat.

5
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,971
He's beating the shit
out of the North Valley.

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,389
What do you want me to say?

7
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,433
- Miguel's surprised us, brother.
- Look, Pacho,

8
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,729
I'm proud too of how my brother's
handled things while I'm gone,

9
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,815
but we all have limitations.

10
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,278
I led our organization for 20 years,
always taking care of all of you.

11
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,779
I know.

12
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,825
But the thing is, I don't think
I'm ready to surrender, Gilberto.

13
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,995
Besides, I still have to find the
Salazars and resolve the situation.

14
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,499
I understand, Pacho. But
you need to keep a cool head.

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,795
For now, we need to focus
on the surrender plans.

16
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,773
A fucking fridge?

17
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,192
A message from Miguel
Rodríguez Orejuela.

18
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,237
Son of a bitch! What's that smell?

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,408
The surveillance team we sent to Cali.

20
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,009
Call me

21
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,689
It's a fucking leak.

22
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,776
Someone in the Colombian government
is telling them everything.

23
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,362
- Your CI told you this?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,905
I mean, it adds up.

25
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,992
Our most important witness gets
killed right before I get him to talk.

26
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,371
Sir, Botero knew that Franklin
Jurado was my only play.

27
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,873
The Minister of Defense?

28
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,085
- Your CI said that he was the leak?
- That we had one.

29
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,920
- Then I'd keep that to yourself.
- Sir...

30
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,299
The fact is, Agent Peña, you've got
nothing outside of scorched earth.

31
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,595
A dead witness, a cartel war, and
whatever the fuck that was in the jungle.

32
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,265
We have to turn this over
to Colombian authorities.

33
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,895
I told Botero that he will have
your case files by 5:00 p. m. today.

34
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,940
Sir, what if Botero is the leak?

35
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,735
Then we're handing it over to
the guy who works for the cartel.

36
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,364
Ambassador, our CI, he's done everything
we've asked him to do. He's... He's...

37
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,128
He risked his life.
He's risked his family.

38
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,286
- We'd be hanging him out to dry.
- So get him out now.

39
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,332
I'll authorize the paperwork. I can have
the Marines at his doorstep in 20 minutes.

40
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:54,294
No. We do that... Miguel
disappears and then we're done.

41
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,965
You're already done.

42
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,722
I thought you said I had until 5:00 p. m.

43
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,767
What's more important, Agent Peña?

44
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,313
Getting Miguel Rodríguez...
or your CI's life?

45
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,194
Crosby's handing it over
to the Colombians today.

46
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,655
Any move we make, we
risk the leak finding out.

47
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,406
Fucking us and Salcedo.

48
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,408
What did Salcedo say
about the new location?

49
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,995
David stepped up security. It would
take a battalion of cops to get Miguel.

50
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,039
He says our best bet's to
wait for Miguel to move.

51
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,499
Which we don't have time for.

52
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,835
So we don't wait.

53
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,256
Sir, maybe we should cut our
losses, get Salcedo out now.

54
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,883
Crosby won't go for it. I asked.

55
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,844
Guy's risked his life for us. His
wife and kids, for fuck's sake.

56
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,680
So it's up to us to help them.

57
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,431
We get Miguel, we get them out.

58
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,811
Call Salcedo again.

59
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,938
We take Miguel today.

60
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,400
General, Miguel Rodríguez
is on the 7th floor.

61
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:02,737
His son, David, doubled
security after the raid,

62
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,948
and, well, there's no way
to get inside that building

63
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,700
without attracting attention.

64
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,661
We have to get Miguel to move.

65
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,622
- And we capture him while they're moving.
- Exactly.

66
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,665
How?

67
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,960
Leave that to me.

68
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,298
I'll stay here in Bogotá. You
coordinate the operation in Cali.

69
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,967
But it has to be today.

70
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,385
There's no time.

71
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,429
Today.

72
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:39,190
Agent Peña, after our last
operation, my superior came to see me.

73
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,612
He was very diplomatic, but he made
sure to remind me of all I've achieved.

74
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,324
And that it could all be taken away.

75
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,352
What worries me is the only people

76
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,912
who could do more damage to
the country than the cartel,

77
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,332
are the sons of bitches they've bought.

78
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,628
And I don't want to risk bringing Miguel
Rodríguez to jail through the front door

79
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,796
so they can let him out
the back, you understand?

80
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,757
General...

81
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,180
you put him in jail and I'll
make sure he stays there.

82
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,184
All right.

83
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,770
Let's do it.

84
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,273
Let's hope the bastard enjoys
his last day of freedom.

85
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,528
In law enforcement, your only real power

86
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,156
comes from the strength of
the system that you represent.

87
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,867
You gotta believe it has your back.

88
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,703
But sometimes... sometimes it doesn't.

89
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,500
Sometimes it's so compromised, so
corrupt, that you can't trust it.

90
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,336
What do you do then,
when it tries to play you?

91
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,047
You look for a way
to play it right back.

92
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,926
All right, gentlemen, Miguel
is here in his apartment.

93
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,136
Protected by a small army.

94
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,807
Once I get the signal, I'll organize
a convoy and come down this way.

95
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,767
Carrera 15, until we get here.

96
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,396
There we will turn and go down
25th Street until Santa Rita.

97
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,481
How many cars?

98
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,860
Four SUVs. I'll be in the first
and Miguel will be in the third.

99
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,571
We set up roadblocks, close him in.

100
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,074
I think that gives him
an opportunity to escape.

101
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,410
I've got something far
more aggressive in mind.

102
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,919
I don't want to give that son of a
bitch opportunity to end up anywhere

103
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,331
other than the back of my truck.

104
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,502
You flush him out of the
apartment, and I'll take him down.

105
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,673
Sir, please believe me!

106
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,217
I swear it on my family, sir.

107
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,845
No! No, sir! Please wait!

108
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,264
I already told you the truth, sir!

109
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,520
Play it again. From the beginning.

110
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,980
But what for?

111
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,818
All you're going to hear is a man yelling
because he's being tortured, nothing more.

112
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,113
I told you, maybe he said something
that will help us nail the motherfucker.

113
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,823
But didn't we already catch the mole?

114
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,869
I'm going to tell you something.

115
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,247
I hate that motherfucker
Salcedo with all of my heart.

116
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,750
But what's your problem
with him? He may be clean.

117
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,837
The problem I have with him is that
he's a fucking lying son of a bitch.

118
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,921
And I know it.

119
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,258
Now start it from the fucking beginning.

120
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,302
You hear?

121
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,744
For this to work, I have
to leave my family again.

122
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,853
- Okay, we'll get them out. Don't worry.
- They're watching my house.

123
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,898
All right, so we wait, we stay
clear until we have Miguel,

124
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,621
and then we go in for
your wife and kids.

125
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,445
Are you gonna keep your word?

126
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,238
We'll keep our word.

127
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,868
Hey, what happened, Jorge?

128
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,874
All right. Hey, listen...
just use this to reach us.

129
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,257
My oldest daughter, she has her
first soccer practice tomorrow.

130
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,178
She's afraid they're
gonna make her play goalie.

131
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,143
I don't know what to tell her.

132
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,358
Hey, we're gonna get him, Jorge.

133
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,708
Put the clothes you
want to take on the bed.

134
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,045
Put any jewelry and
valuables under the clothes.

135
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,261
Anyone comes in, it will look
like you just did the wash.

136
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,848
When it's time, put everything
in the suitcases, okay?

137
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,642
Good. One more thing.

138
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,186
Come with me, please.

139
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,653
Paola, don't freak out.

140
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,948
- Wait, Jorge, wait.
- It's only a precaution, Paola.

141
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,244
Wow.

142
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,662
My love.

143
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,621
Eh...

144
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,831
Take it, Paola.

145
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,920
Like this. Hold on tight.

146
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,172
Here's the safety. Now it's ready...

147
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,716
And now it's not.

148
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,343
That's the only thing you need to do.

149
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,139
If anyone you don't know comes
through that door, use it.

150
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,058
- Okay?
- Yes.

151
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,518
My love, you can do this.

152
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,896
You can do this.

153
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,070
I'll leave it here.

154
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,162
I can do this.

155
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,332
It's my only choice.

156
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,960
As soon as the DEA gets here, you
go with them. You can't wait for me.

157
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,295
What about you?

158
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,297
I'll be fine.

159
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,426
Don't worry.

160
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,934
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

161
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,803
What I'm about to tell
you is a little delicate.

162
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,692
But it concerns all of our futures.

163
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,320
I've been concerned about
my brother, Gilberto.

164
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:22,325
The thing is, he's been speaking to
some of our partners without telling me.

165
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,161
Undermining me.

166
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,705
Making it very difficult
to run this business.

167
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,917
So...

168
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,632
I decided to have my
brother's phone tapped.

169
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,178
What the fuck are you saying, Miguel?

170
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,556
We don't tap each other's phones.

171
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,808
I know.

172
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,102
But in this case, it was necessary.

173
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,148
I heard you two talking
to him about the surrender.

174
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,904
You heard something I
wasn't supposed to say?

175
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,781
What is this shit, Miguel?

176
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,908
Now we can't talk to Gilberto?

177
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,035
Of course you can.

178
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,919
You're not going to make
a fucking speech now.

179
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,500
No, I'm not going to make a speech,
but I will tell you one important thing.

180
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,256
The surrender was Gilberto's
dream. It was never ours.

181
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:23,720
Besides, we all know how good
Gilberto is at promising things

182
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,304
when he wants something from us.

183
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
What did he promise you?

184
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,309
New York.

185
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,813
But did he tell you when? How?

186
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,815
You have shit.

187
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,152
Chepe...

188
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,867
here you have a passport, a
new social security number,

189
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,828
and the addresses to
two labs in New York...

190
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,498
so you can rebuild what's ours.

191
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,252
And what did he promise you?

192
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,254
The Salazars?

193
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,593
Here's the location where
the Salazars are hiding.

194
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,512
So you can avenge your brother.

195
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,777
Henao gave it to me.

196
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,280
So the North Valley war is over or what?

197
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,201
That's right. In our favor.

198
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,915
Of course, first I had to send
that motherfucker a little gift.

199
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,469
Look, Miguel... I think you
need to tell us the truth.

200
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,639
No fucking lies.

201
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,602
What the fuck have you done with
the real Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela?

202
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,025
Surrender's for pussies.

203
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,176
Listen up... Mr. Wiretap.

204
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,431
Never ever touch my phone.

205
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,059
Understood?

206
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,289
Don Miguel.

207
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,958
Sir.

208
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,713
- What?
- Excuse me.

209
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,257
I just heard DEA
agents are back in Cali.

210
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,679
Any update on the accountant?

211
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,976
Well, we're still looking, but no luck.

212
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,077
Motherfucker.

213
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,500
This has to be the place
Enrique told us about.

214
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,590
Look there.

215
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,176
See if you can find
anything about Salcedo.

216
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,725
Motherfuckers.

217
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,229
I know this isn't the ideal
situation for your team,

218
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,232
but I appreciate cooperation
with the transition.

219
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,315
Of course.

220
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,652
I'll put you in touch with the police
investigative team I've assigned.

221
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,529
I'll give you the phone number.

222
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,667
And they'll stop by for
the files this afternoon.

223
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,251
Thank you.

224
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,213
One more thing, Minister.
It almost slipped my mind.

225
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,172
What's that?

226
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,593
I received some information
regarding Miguel Rodríguez's hideout.

227
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,765
It seems he's in a building in Cali.
It's called Hacienda Buenos Aires.

228
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,143
Well done, Agent. Well done.

229
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,146
I'll get this information
to my men right away.

230
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,481
No, that won't be necessary.

231
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,568
I've already got my men there
preparing for the raid today.

232
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,111
Excuse me?

233
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,155
Well, we can't waste any time.

234
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,559
You want to catch him, don't you?

235
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,450
Of course I do.

236
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,869
This is the best option.

237
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,456
If we do get him, you
get the credit. I promise.

238
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,874
Thank you, sir.

239
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
Jorge?

240
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,015
Don Miguel wants to see you right away.

241
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,099
Coming.

242
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,312
Sir.

243
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,107
Just got off the phone
with our friend in Bogotá.

244
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,652
Seems those DEA agents
are here for a reason.

245
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,114
He says they're planning a raid.

246
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,535
We can take you to Santa Rita.

247
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,124
- Do it.
- Of course, sir.

248
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,675
We got some news.

249
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Get the cars ready.

250
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,231
Peña.

251
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,875
Your message went
through. Botero's the leak.

252
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,110
Miguel's on the move.

253
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,322
Good. Keep me posted on stage two.

254
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,405
Copy that.

255
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,121
Good morning.

256
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
Hello.

257
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,006
You seem happy.

258
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,012
Defense Minister Fernando Botero...

259
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,138
Mm-hmm.

260
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,767
...is working with the Cali cartel.

261
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,563
- What makes you so sure?
- Played a little "telephone. "

262
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,693
Something I said to him that
only I know was repeated in Cali.

263
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,280
Normally, I'd say you're crazy, but...

264
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,367
I'm going to show you something.

265
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,458
- Those Curaçao bank files you gave me.
- Yes.

266
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,877
I had a bank source
help me dig through them.

267
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,504
And?

268
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,091
What's interesting is who's listed
alongside Franklin Jurado's name

269
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,174
on this account.

270
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,721
Santiago Medina. Who's he?

271
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,056
He's an art collector.

272
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,643
But rumor is he does some money
laundering for upper class Colombians.

273
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,272
Cleans their cash through fancy
charities, dummy corporations,

274
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,607
campaign contributions.

275
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:40,197
Guess who Santiago Medina worked with
on the last presidential campaign?

276
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,201
Fernando Botero.

277
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,663
There's nothing.

278
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,586
Have you thought about the possibility
that Salcedo is telling the truth?

279
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,625
Just because you don't like him doesn't
mean everything he says is bullshit.

280
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,130
That's got nothing to do with it.

281
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,759
There's plenty of people I don't
like but still trust. Like you.

282
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,477
Darío. You see that camera?

283
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,024
Maybe it caught something. Huh?

284
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,066
Come on.

285
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,865
I found this one from last week.

286
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,662
Play it.

287
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,252
Fast forward.

288
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,213
Faster.

289
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,674
Hit play.

290
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,970
And stop... stop it there.

291
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,100
See? These motherfuckers
must be the DEA, right?

292
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,393
Mm-hmm.

293
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:52,894
Keep going.

294
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,953
His transport arrived.

295
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,043
We're in position.

296
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,816
I'll let you know when they come out.

297
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,179
Where are we?

298
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,015
Serrano's in position. Just
waiting for Miguel to come down.

299
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,483
Despite how difficult
this week has been,

300
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,652
we're making it out of the storm.

301
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,487
It would seem so, sir.

302
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,533
I've been thinking about
the promise I made to you.

303
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,664
Six months... until you
open your security business.

304
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,377
That's right, sir.

305
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,716
It's even possible that
I'll invest in your business.

306
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,093
What do you think about that?

307
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,220
It would be an honor
to have your support.

308
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,600
Can I help you with your bag?

309
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,727
No, this is almost ready.

310
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,521
Take those. I'll see you downstairs.

311
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
Of course, sir.

312
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,903
Keep going.

313
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,532
Stop it there.

314
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,375
No, that's Enrique. Keep going.

315
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,839
Open it.

316
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,927
Salcedo is downstairs.
We're waiting for Miguel.

317
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,012
Copy that.

318
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,517
Stop. Go back.

319
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,102
Go back.

320
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,771
More.

321
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,648
There.

322
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,113
- Isn't that Enrique again?
- Can you get this shit to stop shaking?

323
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,756
Man...

324
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,759
Man, you were right.

325
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,844
You were right, man.

326
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,931
I'm going to kill that motherfucker.

327
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Take this.

328
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,022
Careful with this.

329
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,670
Fuck, he's not answering.

330
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,734
Here.

331
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,819
Thank you.

332
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,658
- Hello.
- Dad.

333
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:35,951
It's him.

334
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,370
It's that bastard, Salcedo.

335
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,165
David, again with this
bullshit? When will you stop?

336
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,082
Listen to me.

337
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,252
I found the DEA hideout. The one
Enrique told us Salcedo knew about.

338
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:49,715
And on the same street, there's a hotel
with a camera pointed towards the street.

339
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,677
We checked the video with Darío,
and we saw the DEA, Enrique,

340
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,096
and that motherfucker Salcedo, Dad.

341
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,433
Are you sure about that?

342
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,269
One hundred percent.
I checked the plates.

343
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,730
Dad, think about it.

344
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,776
He's trying to take you out of a safe
place so they can catch you in the open.

345
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,401
It's a trap, Dad.

346
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,156
Dad...

347
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:16,950
I'll call you back.

348
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,881
Jorge. Don Miguel asked me to tell you

349
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,759
that he needs your help with
something before we leave.

350
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,763
Jorge?

351
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,809
Yes.

352
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,900
Fuck. They just called him back inside.

353
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,039
Shit.

354
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,715
David Rodríguez just
showed up at the Salcedos'.

355
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,807
NO SERVICE

356
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,520
They know.

357
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,980
- Are you sure?
- Has to be.

358
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,263
They called him back inside.
David's at the Salcedos'...

359
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,635
- Just wait, wait.
- We have to go in and get him.

360
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,196
We stick to the plan. When
Miguel moves, we get him.

361
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,281
They're gonna kill him.

362
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,241
Yeah, well, he might already be dead.

363
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,660
All due respect, sir, we have to go in.

364
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
All right, go.

365
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,001
Tell Serrano we're going in.

366
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,335
- Let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

367
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,419
General!

368
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,921
We have to go in now! Out!

369
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,434
You need me, Don Miguel?

370
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,395
Take a seat.

371
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,861
All right, but we should be going.

372
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,868
I think we're going to
be a little safer here.

373
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,875
You fucking son of a bitch!

374
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,252
What is this? What's
going on, Don Miguel?

375
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,132
Don Miguel!

376
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,301
Look how diligent! Very...

377
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,264
Girls, whatever happens, you
don't leave the room, all right?

378
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,767
- All right.
- Don't come out for any reason.

379
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,154
Cover his mouth.

380
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,322
Don Miguel!

381
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,032
Please!

382
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,659
Ah! Don Miguel!

383
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,338
Go to your room.

384
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,639
Mrs. Salcedo! We're
DEA! Open up, please!

385
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,518
Mrs. Salcedo! DEA!

386
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,937
- DEA?
- Yes!

387
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,274
Daniel Van Ness. There's
two men out front.

388
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,984
They're here for you. Stay close.

389
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,382
Let's go through the back.

390
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,338
I believed you over my own son.

391
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,259
You took my money.

392
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,554
I let you protect my family.

393
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:11,935
You listened to our private
conversations, you son of a bitch.

394
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,571
I gave you all my trust.

395
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,949
And what did it mean to you? Shit.

396
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,034
Nothing.

397
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,037
You're an animal.

398
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,708
You're a little wharf rat.

399
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,628
Not even that. A rat has
more dignity than you.

400
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,964
Do you know what I've
just done, motherfucker?

401
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,217
I told David to go to your house...

402
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:50,349
and kill your wife and
daughters, you motherfucker!

403
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,227
Mrs. Salcedo.

404
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
My kids.

405
00:30:56,897 --> 00:31:00,067
Get to their room. Stay there. Go.

406
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,654
Ma'am, please open up.

407
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,990
Girls, stop folding, please.

408
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,784
Back here. Go back here.

409
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,660
Back! Here.

410
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,955
I want to talk, Mrs. Salcedo. Open up.

411
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,189
Keep shooting!

412
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,528
I know you're in there, Mrs. Salcedo.

413
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,455
Don Miguel! The DEA is in the building.

414
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,636
Get María and the boy into a car.

415
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,251
Sir, you should come as well.

416
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,694
Get the fuck out of here!

417
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,666
Give me that shit.
Get out. Motherfucker!

418
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,968
Fucking rat, die!

419
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,371
Go!

420
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,106
Don Miguel, we have to leave right now!

421
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,859
Don Miguel! Don Miguel!

422
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,620
- Don Miguel, we have to go!
- Kill him!

423
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,274
You're okay. You're okay.

424
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,484
Where's Miguel?

425
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,238
Where's Miguel?

426
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,199
Go out the other door.

427
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,217
Hurry up, damn it!

428
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,193
Miguel Rodríguez...

429
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,279
you're under arrest.

430
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,839
- General.
- Agent Peña.

431
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,468
I've got Miguel Rodríguez,
handcuffed, at my side.

432
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,518
And Salcedo?

433
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,045
I got them. They're safe.

434
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,444
Get in.

435
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,363
Let me talk to my wife.

436
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:39,906
- Jorge.
- Jorge?

437
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,783
Hello, my love. You all right?

438
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,992
Yes, and you? The girls?

439
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:48,039
Yes. Yes, the girls are all right.
They're scared, but all right.

440
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,749
We did it, Paola.

441
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,836
Yes. Yes, we did it.

442
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,088
I'll be with you soon, my love.

443
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,021
Got a minute?

444
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,110
- We were wrong.
- Wrong?

445
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,864
Yes. I checked the
Samper campaign financials

446
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,242
and I found that in July of last
year, they had serious losses.

447
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,912
They needed money for
travel, ads, etcetera.

448
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,664
And they got $6 million.

449
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,667
Just happens to be the amount
Botero took from the cartel.

450
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,502
So...

451
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,797
- he wasn't laundering the money.
- No.

452
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,009
That money stayed in the campaign.

453
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,553
It was a contribution.

454
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,100
I need a word.

455
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,814
Right away.

456
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,579
- Have a seat.
- No, thank you. I'd rather stand.

457
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,291
- What's going on?
- We got Miguel Rodríguez.

458
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,292
You got him?

459
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,503
He's on a plane back
to Bogotáright now.

460
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,088
It'll be all over the news in an hour.

461
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,456
Couldn't let it go, could you?

462
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:26,679
Sir, there's another piece
of this that you need to know.

463
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:32,769
These are bank accounts opened
in Curaçao by a guy named Medina.

464
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,937
Yeah, I know him.

465
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,898
Well, good, because he was
working with Fernando Botero.

466
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,819
They received over six million
dollars from the Cali cartel,

467
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,822
which went into the Samper
presidential campaign.

468
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,406
And you know this how?

469
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,033
I did some digging.

470
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:52,247
Ambassador, I am certain that
the Minister of Defense is corrupt

471
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,581
and that it doesn't stop there.

472
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,054
You ask the president, he's gonna
say he didn't have a fucking clue,

473
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,004
but that money won him the election.

474
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,008
Gilberto, Miguel, they
walk right out of prison

475
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,928
unless these fucking politicians
are in there with them.

476
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:18,889
The voice you're about to hear

477
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,069
is the voice of the man you just
mentioned, Santiago Medina...

478
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,697
talking to Gilberto Rodríguez.

479
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,155
On the phone.

480
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,702
We've been talking, Mr. Rodríguez.

481
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,579
There's a lot of interest on our part.

482
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,956
If there's interest on your end...

483
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,917
Yes. Of course there is.

484
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:43,381
We would need to know what we would
be getting for our contribution.

485
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,464
Of course.

486
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:51,139
As you know, our goal is to reward
our supporters once we take office.

487
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,685
The terms we discussed
are certainly reasonable.

488
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,521
Then you have our support.

489
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:03,276
- How would we organize the payments?
- We should get together and discuss it.

490
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,778
How long have you known?

491
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,032
It's complicated.

492
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,912
The point, Agent Peña, is you're right.

493
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,205
But in this case...

494
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,875
it doesn't matter.

495
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,003
You're not gonna do anything.

496
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,508
Samper's a good friend to us.

497
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,182
So that's it.

498
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,644
They bought...

499
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,898
the president.

500
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,984
And for now...

501
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,154
they get to keep him.

502
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,751
We never had a chance.

503
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,622
I know it's difficult.

504
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,960
But you get used to being here.

505
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,048
You bastard.

506
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,844
Look, brother...

507
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,597
let's put the past behind us.

508
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,768
I know this isn't what
you wanted to hear...

509
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,522
but, regardless, we are winning.

510
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,359
I don't know what the fuck
we're winning, Gilberto.

511
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,613
By catching you, brother,
they did us a favor.

512
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,283
Now Pacho and Chepe have
to turn themselves in.

513
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,245
That's the only way we'll be
able to negotiate the terms.

514
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,666
Well, you better be right, because
I'm not staying in this shithole.

515
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,847
I heard about Miguel.

516
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,694
I'm going to surrender.

517
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,405
And Chepe too.

518
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,826
But before that, I have one
last thing I have to finish.

519
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,769
Gentlemen.

520
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,315
Mr. Santacruz, we have to
ask you to come with us.

521
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,150
You're under arrest.

522
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:36,364
There's room at the bar.
Make yourself comfortable.

523
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,830
Please, Mr. Santacruz.
You have to come with us.

524
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,583
Who do you think called the police?

525
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,045
Here's how this is gonna go.

526
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,464
When I'm done...

527
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,842
when I'm fucking ready...

528
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,886
then you can give me a ride to jail.

529
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,139
Take a seat.

530
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,307
Eat this. Come on.

531
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,976
Order whatever you want.

532
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,144
Come on.

533
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,773
Ah!

534
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,126
This your celebration?

535
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,044
Kind of a downer.

536
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,505
I was hoping for some alcohol.

537
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,342
How long have you had them?

538
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,639
The tapes Crosby played for me.

539
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,268
Let me guess. It's, uh...

540
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,854
it's complicated.

541
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,608
How about, uh... I tried to warn you?

542
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,907
Like you've never cut a corner
to get to the front of the line?

543
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,829
Question is... what you
do when you get there.

544
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,500
There's always gonna be new
bad guys to fight, Agent Peña.

545
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,544
We make new ones every day.

546
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,214
But... any way you slice it...

547
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:22,136
you're the agent that put
cuffs on two Cali godfathers.

548
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,307
No small feat.

549
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,562
Go on.

550
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,485
You earned it.
