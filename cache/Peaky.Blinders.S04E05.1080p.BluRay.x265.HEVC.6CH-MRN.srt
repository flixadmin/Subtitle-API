3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,557
Intelligence services in London have
sent seven officers up to Birmingham.

00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,313
<i>A t the top of their list

Alfie Solomons runs a fighter.
Says it's money for nothing.

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,273
That there, is the Southern Counties
welterweight champion,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,476
Name the day, Mr Shelby.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,916
Stop drinking whisky.
Switch to stout.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,396
And then go and see a doctor
about that baby.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,437
<i>Make sure Tommy
keeps that Friday free.</i>

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,273
<i>Tell him I have an appointment for him.</i>

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,320
You've agreed to give up Tommy
to save my life.

Listen to me. Stay inside.
Don't come out.

Get away from the window.

Right. Stay inside. Stay down.

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,678
Everyone, stay indoors!

39
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,832
Stay down!
By order of the Peaky Blinders!

40
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,195
Come on.

41
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,553
Come here.

42
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,034
Which way? Which way did he go?

43
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
You sure?

44
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Yeah?

45
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,394
Oi!

46
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,356
Hey!

47
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,073
I know you own the cops
in this dirty fuckin' town!

48
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,629
But you'll be dead
before they get here!

49
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,991
Come on, me and you, Tommy.

50
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,440
Come on.

51
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,236
Yeah.

52
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,999
Stop what you're doing!

53
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,513
Enough!

54
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,513
Get out of it!

55
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,440
Get away!

56
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,151
- Enough!
- What the fuck you doing here?

57
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,720
Saving your life. All this.

58
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,039
I'm a police officer, Tommy.

59
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,476
I'm a fuckin' police officer, right?

60
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,678
Doing my duty.
Stopping all this!

61
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,875
Three bodies need cleaning up.

62
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,192
No. Enough.

63
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,473
Tell the people who live in these houses

64
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,554
that they are free to go about
their lawful business!

65
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,793
Tell them that the rule of law
has been restored!

66
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,394
Haven't you heard, Tommy? Eh?

67
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,119
Soldiers are coming.

68
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,280
Do you know, I remember the very first
time you head-butted a policeman.

69
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,072
After you got your OBE from the King,
I didn't think there'd be a next time.

70
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,037
What do you think
you're gonna tell Arthur?

71
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,314
I'll tell him the truth.

72
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,035
They're here.

73
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,550
<i>So...</i>

74
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,195
What the fuck happened today, Tom?

75
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,152
We all heard,
shooting in Artillery Square.

76
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,754
Yeah, there was.

77
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,314
Today, I killed three men.

78
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,919
Now our enemies will have to act.

79
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,919
I suppose, they er...

80
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,597
I suppose they took you
by surprise, did they?

81
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,319
No, I knew they were coming.

82
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,430
Just after Christmas,
I received a letter

83
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,594
from Luca Changretta.

84
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,678
Offering to spare my son,
if I gave up Tommy.

85
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,320
And I gave Tommy up.

86
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,960
Because that was the plan
that Polly and I agreed on.

87
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,275
I knew that Luca,
would want to pull the trigger himself.

88
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,711
So I used the set-up as bait
to bring him in.

89
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,479
You're a fuckin' idiot, Tom.

90
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,509
Look, I didn't get Luca,
but I got three.

91
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,274
All right? That's it.
That's what happened.

92
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,839
- Come here, you.
- Ah, but, he's right.

93
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,397
I mean, I thought you'd gone soft.

94
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,831
- So you got three?
- Yeah, I got three.

95
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,075
Well, I'll drink to you, Tom.
You mad bastard.

96
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,714
Hmm.

97
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,279
Pretty soon, you're gonna get
the shakes. When your blood cools down.

98
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,520
Let go get a drink.

99
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,956
Dad, you got three what?

100
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,476
I got three shillings on a
two shilling horse, my boy.

101
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,479
You come with us, eh?

102
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,394
Want a drink, Lizzie?

103
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,074
I've had a hard day.

104
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,916
I don't drink
whisky or gin any more, Tom.

105
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,920
Why not?

106
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,759
As they say, it harms the baby.

107
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,435
Yes, it can only be yours.

108
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,993
That day by the canal, when you were
fucking somebody else in your head.

109
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,392
Except it wasn't her who got pregnant.

110
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,675
Have a seat, Lizzie.

111
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,632
- All right, I know a woman, Lizzie.
- There are lots of woman, Tommy.

112
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,990
If you don't know this already,
you don't know me.

113
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,234
I'm keepin' it.

114
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,158
Who's gonna run my fuckin' office?

115
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,954
I'll find somebody.

116
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,154
No.

117
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,151
You better put a fuckin' advert
in the paper, then.

118
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,953
I'm not laid up yet.

119
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,915
You're not gonna work
with a child of mine inside of you.

120
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,673
Fuck. Now my hand shakes.

121
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,839
It's okay, Tom.

122
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,119
We'll be okay.

123
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,599
All this death, Lizzie...

124
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,436
It'll be good to have some life, eh?

125
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,279
I got three.

126
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,314
I know, Tom.

127
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,438
One of them point-blank.

128
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,633
A baby, little you and me.

129
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,117
Point-blank, Lizzie.

130
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,273
And he looked up at me.

131
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,715
You'll get an allowance,
every week from the company.

132
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,359
Business is booming.

133
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,875
We'll erm... Buy a nice house, eh?

134
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,273
Come on, I'll drive you home.

135
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,953
I'm just lookin'.

136
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,590
Hmm?

137
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,560
- Fuck.
- Linda.

138
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,871
- Arthur, you scared me to death.
- Linda!

139
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,758
Linda, I need you to save me.
I'm dying.

140
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,911
You're drunk. Again.

141
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,196
I'm drunk again.

142
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,198
I am drunk again.

143
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,158
I need you to save me.

144
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,874
Tell me what you said to me
this morning.

145
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,550
Tell me... Tell me again.

146
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,394
Tell me.

147
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,434
Say it, say it, say it. Tell me.

148
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,829
We'll be back in our garden

149
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,152
before the time comes to plant
anything out.

150
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,393
Just one winter.

151
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,073
Just one winter.

152
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,355
Come to bed, Arthur.

153
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,799
They're coming, boys.

154
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,594
No.

155
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,434
No fucking way.

156
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,677
You've never eaten hedgehog, Michael?

157
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,913
I'm getting back in this car.

158
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,357
Michael, you're number two
on Luca Changretta's hit list.

159
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,193
Yeah, and I'll stay in a hotel.

160
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,318
If you stay in a hotel,
I'll know where you are.

161
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,920
So will the people who take you there.

162
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,912
So will the people
who work in the hotel.

163
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,316
And hotels don't move around.

164
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,391
They don't even know
where they'll be tomorrow.

165
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,472
They follow the patron and the crows.

166
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,597
And if anyone
should come for you, Michael,

167
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,199
the Palmers and the Boswells
will put up a fair fight.

168
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,474
Take your medicine.

169
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,196
- I'll take them.
- Pain killers.

170
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,839
The hills up there,
they'll heal you much quicker.

171
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,759
Fuckin' witches,
the lot of them.

172
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,472
Show some respect, Mr Gray.

173
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,231
They've agreed to welcome you
on account of your blood.

174
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,040
Take your medicine.

175
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,355
Take the gun.

176
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,359
I won't be able to contact you,

177
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,360
till you phone me.

178
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,120
We'll make a plan.

179
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,278
Tommy says it won't be long.

180
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,274
Then we'll be free.

181
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,432
You might learn something.

182
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,430
Tell them your grandmother
was a Gypsy princess.

183
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,838
Name of Birdy Boswell.

184
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,076
You're royalty up there, Michael.

185
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,999
Is that true, Mrs Gray?

186
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,550
What?

187
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,159
Don't I look like royalty?

188
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,118
Well, now that you mention it, you do.

189
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,036
I've been cooped up
in Small Heath too long.

190
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,992
I can smell spring in the air.

191
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,158
Do you know
a longer way back, Mr Gold?

192
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,673
I know ways back,
would take forever.

193
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,914
Get in, Your Majesty.

194
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,789
<i>♪ When your work is o ver</i>

195
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,398
<i>♪ Your day is done</i>

196
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,720
<i>♪ Put down your hammer... ♪</i>

197
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,110
I thought you were a busy woman.

198
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,676
<i>♪ Into my world come ♪</i>

199
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,955
Do you have time for this?

200
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,717
- Is it a buck?
- It is a buck.

201
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,919
Good, bucks taste better.

202
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,351
In this smoke, I'm 16 again.

203
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,874
When the police were after my dad,
he used to take us out.

204
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,476
We'd be gone for days living on
what he caught.

205
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,799
Oh... Do you have a sharp knife?

206
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,792
I heard you have second sight.

207
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,751
I heard that you speak with the dead.

208
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,080
Yes.

209
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,633
Your wife's often around you.

210
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,874
She watches you.

211
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,674
Is she watching me now?

212
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,950
No.

213
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,159
Your family were healers?

214
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,320
Yeah, long time ago.

215
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,036
Came back
when I put my head in a noose.

216
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,478
It's like putting your head through
a window and seeing the whole world.

217
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,910
Give me the rabbit.

218
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,440
And the knife.

219
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,554
You know, Polly.

220
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,515
I believe it's you who's kept
Tommy Shelby alive all these years.

221
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,792
How we've kept each other alive...

222
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,315
That I didn't just put my head
through that window.

223
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,159
I climbed through it.

224
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,794
First, I thought it was madness,
but, no.

225
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,191
When you put your head
out of that window,

226
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,314
you can do anything you want.

227
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,792
'Cause there are no rules.

228
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,472
'Cause there are no risks.

229
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,952
Now, give me the knife.

230
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,154
Now, come here.

231
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,033
I can do whatever I want

232
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,317
whenever the mood takes me.

233
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,156
And you are a strong handsome man.

234
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,439
And this is a beautiful place
in the world.

235
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,520
And it is.

236
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,000
This time.

237
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,270
Let me make one thing clear, Mr Gold.

238
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,554
I just gave Michael a little speech

239
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,836
about how no one would know
where to find him.

240
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,753
But you'd know how to get him.

241
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,911
If any harm comes to Michael,

242
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,117
you shall have me as your enemy.

243
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,234
And none of your knives can kill me.

244
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Do you understand?

245
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,279
Oh, I understand.

246
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,194
Mr Solomons.

247
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,795
Mmm.

248
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,597
My little cousin was born blind.

249
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,795
As a result, I now donate
a considerable sum of money to a charity

250
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,999
which gives dogs with eyes
to blind Jews.

251
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,275
The chairman of the board recommends

252
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,434
that those of us who were blessed
with the gift of sight,

253
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,560
and that we spend, you know,
at least half an hour a day

254
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,030
with our eyes closed
so that we may

255
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,635
that we may better understand the...

256
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,400
Well, the darkness, and erm...

257
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,397
Also, to increase
our donations and that. Mmm.

258
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,315
What time is it?

259
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,440
Twenty-nine minutes past eight.

260
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,274
Right. Well, then I

261
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,637
I have another minute to go,
actually, but you er...

262
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,673
You can begin. Go on.

263
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,797
I'm Luca Changretta.

264
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,390
Oh, yeah, I know who you are. Mmm.

265
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,631
You are a bit of a failure, aren't you?

266
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,474
You come all the way over here
to this country,

267
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,314
in order to kill Tommy Shelby,

268
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,437
but, I mean...

269
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,272
Well, he's not dead, is he? So...

270
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,919
- No.
- No.

271
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,156
He ain't.

272
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,556
How much time have I got left, mate?

273
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,350
Ten seconds.

274
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,120
Nine seconds.

275
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,520
Eight seconds.

276
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,754
Five.

277
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,514
Four.

278
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,949
Three.

279
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,675
Two.

280
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,115
One.

281
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,279
Right. Hello.

282
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,073
How can I help you?

283
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,995
- I have a proposition for you.
- Mmm. No, it's

284
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,357
I already know what do you want.

285
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,592
Yeah? I just want to
hear you say it out loud

286
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,752
so that I can check
how ridiculous it is.

287
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,515
I hear there's gonna be a little fight.

288
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,117
A boxing match between your boy
and Tommy Shelby's boy.

289
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,076
- Eh? Birmingham.
- Mmm-hmm.

290
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,436
And the whole Shelby family
is gonna be there.

291
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,954
Hmm.

292
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,154
And you, Mr Solomons,

293
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,398
you too will be there.

294
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,637
- Huh?
- Er, that's it.

295
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,798
I'll tell you what, all right?

296
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,589
Here's a gift. It's free.

297
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,911
A souvenir of your visit here.

298
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,550
Goodbye. Trot on.
Down there is Bonny Street.

299
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,116
You know, they say you're a smart guy.

300
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,680
I mean, you already know
what we want before we say it.

301
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,800
That's funny 'cause now I believe
I know what you want

302
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,839
- even before you say it.
- Mmm? Mmm.

303
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,720
So you gonna taste it?

304
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,839
You're damn fucking straight, mate.

305
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,799
Otherwise you wouldn't still be thieving
my oxygen, would ya?

306
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,560
Because I have 200 barrels
a month, yeah?

307
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,236
Cleared by your people, distributed
through your teams to this...

308
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,234
The thing is
that people want gin these days.

309
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,040
Well, the exit is still out there,
all right? On Bonny Street.

310
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,680
Yeah?

311
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,640
You're fucking crazy, you know that?

312
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,640
200 barrels, huh?

313
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,951
Huh. What do you think, huh?

314
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,117
And also, I want some cash.

315
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,635
Bang right,
'cause I've broken it down here,

316
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,634
the, uh, list of costs pertaining to
the assassination of a dear friend.

317
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,193
All right. Now you're normal dispatch,
well, is you know, £500 cost,

318
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,875
but you're gonna have to add
another 100 to that,

319
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,557
because Tommy Shelby, like me,
is from an oppressed people.

320
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,511
Then I need you to put another ton
on top of that,

321
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,116
because his brother is a fucking animal
and he will come after me.

322
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,150
Yeah. And then you will need to put
another 100 on top of that,

323
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,120
because, well, you are
a fucking wop, mate.

324
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,120
Hmm?

325
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,920
And you.

326
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,389
And then we have to deal with

327
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,234
the ugly business which
I've been incredibly clear of before.

328
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,439
I'll need another £500,
because, like I stated,

329
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,833
Tommy Shelby is
a very, very good friend of mine.

330
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,874
Take all of this down there
in black and white.

331
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,271
- All right? Crack on.
- It's okay.

332
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,512
Mr Solomons,

333
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,749
I'm gonna be
very fucking clear with you.

334
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,594
I don't need you to kill anybody.

335
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,151
I have people that I trust, okay?
So you're gonna take my boys,

336
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,800
and you're gonna bring them to the ring
as seconds.

337
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,235
Well, in order to qualify
as my seconds, right,

338
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,233
they will first have to qualify
as being Jewish, yeah?

339
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,320
And in order to do that,
they would have to replace

340
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,351
their natural Italian fucking arrogance
with a Jewish air of absolute certainty.

341
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,158
See, my good friend Tom Shelby,
he will know the difference.

342
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,832
These days,

343
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,595
back in the old country, mmm,

344
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,800
a lot of the, uh, you know,
the Jewish peoples, they, uh,

345
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,150
are having to pass themselves off
as Italian.

346
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,960
Right, well, you will have to add
another ton onto your bill

347
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,793
for being a cunt, mate.

348
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,040
All right?

349
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,512
You will bring my men to Birmingham.

350
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,557
And you will circumcise them.

351
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,432
Yeah, you will have to circumcise them,
because the Peakys will check, yeah?

352
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,194
Okay. Any other requests, huh?

353
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,830
Two hundred fucking barrels.
We have a deal.

354
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,040
Ah...

355
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,276
- What's the matter?
- Hmm. Well

356
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,272
I said we have a deal.

357
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,469
And you just made a deal
without a negotiation, didn't ya?

358
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,674
Yeah.

359
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,719
Yeah, Tommy Shelby was right about you,
wasn't he?

360
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,354
Ada Shelby?

361
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,036
No.

362
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,474
She was armed when we picked her up,
sir, so we strip-searched her.

363
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,074
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir.

364
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,797
I apologise, Miss Shelby.

365
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,433
The Territorials can be overzealous.

366
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,314
Your men watched.

367
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,954
And they will be reprimanded.

368
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,799
They won't see Saturday.

369
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,239
A naked woman alone making threats
against the entire British Army.

370
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,236
A significant indicator of character.

371
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,998
I'll turn my back while you dress,
and perhaps we can talk.

372
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,998
I have a dossier
on each member of your family.

373
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,836
I know your family's
extraordinary history.

374
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,195
Fuck you.

375
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,273
I also have a totally blank page

376
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,239
on which together we can write
your family's immediate future.

377
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,994
You rehearsed your speech.

378
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,959
A significant indicator
of a lack of confidence.

379
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,072
- What rank are you?
- Colonel.

380
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,280
- May I turn?
- Not unless you want to get blinded.

381
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,639
I'm sorry.
This has got off to a bad start.

382
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,914
What is "This"?

383
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,833
Three days ago,
you were seen at a meeting

384
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,832
for the Stechford Communist party.

385
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,760
You were then seen talking to a woman
called Jessie Eden.

386
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,550
Turn around.

387
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,874
I'm leaving.

388
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,273
And you can burn this. It's history.

389
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,640
Ada Shelby,

390
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,790
a person of interest and under
the surveillance of Special Branch

391
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,920
since you've joined the Birmingham
Communist Party in June 1919.

392
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,316
I'm no longer a member
of the Communist Party.

393
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,756
I know. Irrelevant.

394
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,557
Most of the more active subversives

395
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,075
shed their official allegiances
to avoid detection.

396
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,950
Okay. Let me explain it to you.

397
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,600
I'm no longer a member
of the Communist Party,

398
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,400
because I'm no longer
a believer in the cause of socialism.

399
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,960
Now open that door.

400
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,234
So in the past,
you were blinded by love.

401
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,753
No.

402
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,879
Blinded by faith.

403
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,354
I believed people deserve justice.
They don't.

404
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,000
So you've arrested me because I had
a drink with Jessie Eden.

405
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,280
Whisky with ice for you
and a beer for her.

406
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,032
I met Jessie Eden
to settle an industrial dispute.

407
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,674
Head of Acquisitions.
So you've swapped sides.

408
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,440
If you know what I drink,
you know what I do for a living.

409
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,313
Miss Shelby,

410
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,552
you must understand
that these are extraordinary times.

411
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,556
General strike is certain.
Attempted revolution, perhaps.

412
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,718
Soldiers on the streets very soon.
They're already drilling.

413
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,592
And here stands you,

414
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,394
a woman with her foot in both camps.

415
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,434
It's potentially very useful.

416
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,631
Useful to who?

417
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,598
Maybe you should ask
your brother Thomas.

418
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,958
Put some fucking effort into it,
son. The fight's in two days.

419
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,838
Make use of the reach.

420
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,437
Get used to the long arm on him.

421
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,719
Get under it!

422
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,153
That's it. On to the corner.

423
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,430
Talk to me about Colonel Ben Younger.

424
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,789
What about him?

425
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,277
He's just made me a proposition.

426
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,319
You're in my chair.

427
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,958
He said you knew about it.

428
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,797
And remember I know when you're lying.

429
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,590
Ben Younger was an officer in
the Warwickshire Yeomanry in Flanders.

430
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,715
The only cavalryman
who could ride a fucking horse.

431
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,152
I was strip-searched.

432
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,952
Two soldiers watched.

433
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,791
I'm sorry, Ada.

434
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,954
That...

435
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,276
The arrest was so all the neighbours
would see, and word would go around.

436
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,590
Younger is all right.

437
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,198
Younger came to me for help.

438
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,040
- He's been given Birmingham.
- Given Birmingham. By who?

439
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,357
By Churchill. By the fucking King.

440
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,232
By people that want to stop
the revolution.

441
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,631
No one's laughing any more, Ada.

442
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,910
The Home Office is making provisions.

443
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,871
This is part of those provisions.

444
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,278
And how is Tommy Shelby, OBE,
going to stop a revolution?

445
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,789
Jessie Eden has accepted
my invitation to dinner.

446
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,111
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

447
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,511
Tommy Shelby is gonna stop
the revolution with his cock.

448
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,717
It's not her
the military are interested in.

449
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,280
It's the people around her.

450
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,356
The people like you used to be.
Like Freddie used to be.

451
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,877
People that want an armed revolution.

452
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,232
If I get Jessie Eden's trust,

453
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,389
she gives me the names
of the instigators,

454
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,951
I give them up to the Crown forces.

455
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,275
Tommy. Tommy, sweetheart,

456
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,551
why would a man whose medals rust

457
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,599
at the bottom of the Saltley Canal
want to help the British military?

458
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,280
Because I've been offered
three five-year contracts

459
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,672
to supply military vehicles
to the British forces

460
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,719
in India, Ceylon, Singapore and Burma.

461
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,878
Total value, two million pound.

462
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,113
And there'll be no strikes
in your factory

463
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,839
'cause Jessie Eden will be in your bed.

464
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,434
Tommy, this can only happen
if you're still alive.

465
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,352
I'm planning on staying alive.

466
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,234
And if I'm dead, you can all go back
to being what you were.

467
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,271
The British Army came to me, Ada.

468
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,633
I said, "Why not?"

469
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,396
They'll put that on your grave, Tom.

470
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,112
"Tommy Shelby. Why not?"

471
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,478
You gonna help me or not?

472
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,999
Other way round.

473
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,880
Erm, will they want music, Charlie?

474
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,590
We have that gramophone we found
abandoned inside that gentleman's car.

475
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,679
No, they don't.
Tommy said they're here to talk.

476
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,310
Charlie, Curly, this isJessie Eden.

477
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,676
Jessie, this is my Uncle Charlie
and my... Whatever Curly is.

478
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,877
- This is actually lovely.
- We were just wondering

479
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,720
- if you'd like some music?
- No, we weren't.

480
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,071
- Actually, Jessie likes music.
- Don't go to any trouble.

481
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,516
No, Curly, go to some trouble.

482
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,675
Go on, then.

483
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,315
Right.

484
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,070
- Don't I get a choice?
- I want an opinion. Try it.

485
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,029
Don't really drink gin.

486
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,672
Then you're perfect. My gin is for women
that don't really drink gin.

487
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,430
Your gin?

488
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,960
Let's drink to something. You chose.

489
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,239
To the revolution.

490
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,796
Why not?

491
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,877
To the revolution.

492
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,278
All right, well, since I invited you
for dinner, I thought I'd cook.

493
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,518
These two beauties
were shot this morning

494
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,273
by a poacher friend of mine

495
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,717
at Lord Packwood's estate.

496
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,834
I thought you'd like that. These here,

497
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,753
these were stolen from under his trees.

498
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,272
Mr Shelby, I came to talk business.

499
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,755
Yes.

500
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,913
So did I.

501
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,712
Wage cuts withdrawn, parity between
men and women guaranteed.

502
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,720
You can instruct your members
to return to work tomorrow.

503
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,394
And all I have to do in return

504
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,597
is tell you everything I know
about socialism.

505
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,713
That's what your sister said.

506
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,080
You don't like your gin?

507
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,200
It's okay.

508
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,955
It's okay.

509
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,997
What do you want to know
about the cause?

510
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,239
I'm approaching
the current political crisis

511
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,354
as I would approach a horse race.

512
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,109
Assessing the runners and the riders.

513
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,672
Now the favourite is,
of course, the King's horse,

514
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,752
but the King's horse
was also the favourite in 1913

515
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,594
when Emily Davison
threw herself in front of it.

516
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,717
You know the names of Suffragettes?

517
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,880
I'm impressed.

518
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,595
Ah, everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look,

519
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,750
women with serious faces everywhere.

520
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,595
When I study a horse race, I study form,

521
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,314
and on the other horse, the one
that wants to beat the King's horse,

522
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,236
let's call her "Dangerous", shall we?
She's no form.

523
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,230
- That's what makes her so dangerous.
- Russia.

524
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,072
- Isn't that form?
- Ah.

525
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,076
The Russians are not like the English.
We're beer, they're petrol.

526
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,437
So I invited you here for dinner,

527
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,237
because you know people.

528
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,673
People that want to make this fight
real with guns and ammunition.

529
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,680
So before I place a bet
on who's gonna win,

530
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,318
I need to know how strong they are.

531
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,240
How serious they are.

532
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,078
Your concern is
that if the unthinkable happened,

533
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,352
you would find yourself
on the wrong side of the barricades.

534
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,312
Well, as you can see,

535
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,637
my natural side of the barricades,
is the same as yours and, as you know,

536
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,119
I once believed...

537
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,919
But the war changed you?

538
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,595
Yeah.

539
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,510
Man I love couldn't speak
when he got back.

540
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,634
Not one word.

541
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,315
I've said very few true words since.

542
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,315
Men who blew the whistles in France
are our enemy.

543
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,279
And you count yourself among those
who want a real fight?

544
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,989
I do.

545
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,752
- Well, well.
- Yes.

546
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,675
Not just in my dreams. In the day now.

547
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,793
And you're not alone.

548
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,040
I am not alone.

549
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,795
Well, well.

550
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,959
I've researched you.

551
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,159
We have researched you.

552
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,390
You've never been a friend
to the government.

553
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,393
They've used you.

554
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,990
And I imagine you've found out already
that no amount of money allows you

555
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,437
to pass through the steel sheets
that separate class from class.

556
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,160
Yes.

557
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,518
Yes, that I have learnt.

558
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,997
Men like you would terrify them.

559
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,037
I'm betting them, what they do.

560
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,512
Would I change the odds, do you think?

561
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,952
It's all wound up, Tom.

562
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,192
Erm, you just put the needle on
and let it spin.

563
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,998
And there are some popular records,
mostly romantic. Uh...

564
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,720
Thank you, Curly.

565
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,558
Food's nearly ready.

566
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,077
Let's eat before we dance, shall we?

567
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,514
So we're going to dance?

568
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,193
I think so.

569
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,872
Swear to God. Swear to God.

570
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,351
She gave me sixpence,
she sends me to the shop,

571
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,550
margarine, eggs and bread,
and I came back...

572
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,080
With a top hat and a coconut.

573
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,834
And that was all the money we had
for the whole fucking week.

574
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,399
And my mum beat me
with a fucking frying pan.

575
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,280
Why the hell did you buy
a top hat and a coconut?

576
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,478
Because I thought she deserved it.
I thought we all did.

577
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,797
And I could never understand

578
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,633
why people like us only had bread
and fucking lard.

579
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,517
And I wanted to be different.

580
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,913
That's what I wanted.

581
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,673
And you are.

582
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,840
Well...

583
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,758
When I showed you that photo
of Greta Jurossi, your face changed.

584
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,871
She wanted everything to be different.

585
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,078
The whole world.

586
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,119
As do I.

587
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,519
Shall we have some more music?

588
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,352
You were married, but she was killed.

589
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,112
<i>Bye Bye Blackbird reminds you
of your sweetheart, eh?</i>

590
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,155
Yes.

00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,914
You want it on fast or slow?

592
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,872

607

All right, boys. Lock her down.
