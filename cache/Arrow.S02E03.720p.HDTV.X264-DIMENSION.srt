1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:03,184
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:07,058
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:09,793
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,895
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:17,133
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:19,936
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:22,905
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:26,492
I must be...something else.

9
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:30,547
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,420
Where the hell
did you come from?

11
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:39,590
What do you think
you're doing, Officer Lance?

12
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:42,092
This is my daughter.
She was nearly killed tonight.

13
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:43,514
Well, as a parent,
you're welcome to stay.

14
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:45,815
But as a beat cop, your more
than free to go.

15
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:49,235
Let me help you.
Ok, you can help me.

16
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:50,987
To do what I do,
I need intel.

17
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,189
You can be my eyes
and ears in the Glades.

18
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,908
That's how you
can save the city.

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,694
How do I contact you?

20
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:59,028
Leave that in
the alley wall,

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,581
and I'll know
to contact you.

22
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,366
I told you
to stay away from me.

23
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:04,917
The copycats are still alive.

24
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,619
Tommy Merlyn isn't.

25
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,187
I lost a friend that day, too.

26
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,924
And I would gladly
have given my life for his.

27
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:13,993
Well, don't worry,
your life is over.

28
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,012
Your life
as a free man.

29
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:25,555
Put your weapon down.

30
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:29,175
I'm not your enemy.

31
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:32,895
Then put
your weapon down.

32
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:58,304
Don't move!

33
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:04,927
Nice mask.

34
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,230
Why'd you help me?

35
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,070

Oh, thank God.

38
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:27,214
Police scanner's been blowing up
for the past hour.

39
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,600
Laurel called in half the force
with that silent alarm.

40
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:31,969
Yeah, because going after
actual bad guys is so last year.

41
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:34,588
To her, I am the bad guy.
Since when?

42
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,725
Since I didn't make it
to Tommy in time.

43
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,643
How did you get out of there?

44
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:42,780
I had help from a masked
blonde woman in black.

45
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:44,865
Another copycat
vigilante?

46
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,366
No. She was different.

47
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,903
Trained, and she used
a sonic...thing.

48
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:51,989
Wait, sonic thing?
Could you be a bit more specific?

49
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:53,791
She turned it on
and the glass shattered.

50
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:55,442
Ok, well, who was she
and why would she help you?

51
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:56,910
And how did she know
to help you?

52
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:58,712
All good questions.

53
00:02:58,714 --> 00:02:59,797
I don't like the idea
of another player in town.

54
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,465
I'll see
what I can find.

55
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,300
Oliver, what I would
like to know is what

56
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:04,551
you're doing at Laurel's office
in the first place.

57
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:05,952
She makes you
public enemy number one

58
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,788
and you figure this is
a good time to chat?

59
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,790
Because I thought
that I could talk to her

60
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:12,092
and make her understand that
I'm doing things differently this time.

61
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:14,144
That I'm not the bad guy.

62
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:16,180
I was wrong.

63
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:18,482
Wonderful.

64
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:21,301
Now we have a dead Japanese
soldier in our home.

65
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:24,021
Those men on the island were
looking for these corpses.

66
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:25,823
Aren't you the least bit
interested in why?

67
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:27,858
I'm more interested in how
many more there are of them

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,860
and where
they're operating from.

69
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:31,862
They'll be coming for that,
which means they'll be coming for us.

70
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:34,865
And as we've already seen,
they're not the friendliest bunch.

71
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,867
So...

72
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:39,670
It kind of looks like
you've done that before.

73
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:42,172
Back in Xingjian,
I was pre-med.

74
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:44,341
She's a woman
of many talents.

75
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:47,127
Come on.

76
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,346
"Come on" where?

77
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,832
To higher ground.
We need to get to a vantage point

78
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,301
where we can establish
the enemy's position.

79
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:57,471
What about Shado?

80
00:03:57,473 --> 00:04:00,340
I'll be fine here.

81
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:02,109
We shouldn't
split up.

82
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,278
Let her play
with her corpse.

83
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,896
We'll be back
before she knows it.

84
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,989
Here you go, Bud.

85
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,574
On the house, Officer Lance.

86
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:19,960
Hey, no, no, no, here you go,
a dog this delicious?

87
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:22,028
I'd have to book myself
for robbery. Take it.

88
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,365
All right.
Take care.

89
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,801
All units,
1078 at Second and Fletcher.

90
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:29,586
Please respond.

91
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,556
Lance, patrol Delta Charlie 52,
10-60, officer responding.

92
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:34,875
Over.
Negative, DC-52.

93
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:37,811
Disregard 10-78
and resume patrol.

94
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,980
According
to whose orders?

95
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:42,516
Lieutenant Pike.

96
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,825
Excuse me.

97
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:54,060
Bill, what is
going on here, huh?

98
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:56,029
This is my beat.
Why did Pike wave me off of this?

99
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,564
Quentin, it's under control.

100
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:00,033
Excuse me,
what is under control?

101
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:05,122
That's Barton Mathis.

102
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:07,958
That seems to be
what the M.O. indicates.

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,761
He's doing consecutive
life sentences in Iron Heights.

104
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:12,412
Not anymore.

105
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:14,047
The quake split open
a section of Iron Heights.

106
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,864
Mathis was among the escapees.

107
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:19,200
The brass want to avoid
a panic, so they're keeping it quiet.

108
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,770
Are they keeping it
quiet from me, too?

109
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:21,937
Come on, man. Pike knows

110
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:23,618
what happened to you last time.
The man got in your head.

111
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:26,587
Yeah, and I caught him.
And no one knows  Mathis better.

112
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,623
And I've got all your notes
and your files. Pike's order.

113
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,635
If you go anywhere near this,

114
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,545
he's going to have you
arrested for obstruction.

115
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:51,595
I found a number
of police reports

116
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:53,763
from the last few months
that may involve our mystery girl.

117
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:58,068
They describe a masked woman
in black attacking attackers.

118
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,203
She put five would-be rapists
in the hospital so far.

119
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:01,788
Are you sure
it's her?

120
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,707
Broken limbs, ruptured ear drums...
Your sonic thing.

121
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,126
That's her. She's
targeting criminals.

122
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:08,128
Misogynist criminals.

123
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,447
First the hoods, now her.
Looks like you started a movement.

124
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,150
I don't want to start a movement,
so we catch her.

125
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:15,335
I'm not letting the city get overrun
with vigilantes.

126
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,757
Hi, Detective.

127
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,722
So...

128
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:39,242
Miss Smoak gives you
a way to call me now.

129
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:43,113
She vouches for you.

130
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,732
And you told me that you're trying
to help the city without dropping bodies.

131
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,101
That true?

132
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:51,038
What do you think?

133
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,875
Let's just say
I'm willing to be convinced.

134
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:58,545
This city is hurting.

135
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:00,263
And the police?

136
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,217
I always thought
we didn't need to go

137
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,353
outside of law
to find justice.

138
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,972
But in light
of recent events,

139
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:11,892
I'm not so sure anymore.

140
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:16,513
Barton Mathis.

141
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:20,150
The media calls him
the Doll Maker.

142
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:24,204
'Cause he suffocates
his victims with a flexible polymer

143
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,958
that he pours down their throats
and then he dresses them up like dolls.

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,660
I put him away.

145
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,878
Because of the quake...

146
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,582
He's out and he's killing again.

147
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:38,719
These are from
six years ago.

148
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,721
That's my personal file.

149
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:44,708
Maybe it's not just
the file that's personal.

150
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,761
Mathis killed eight girls
before I got him last time.

151
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,930
I don't want any more
on my conscience.

152
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:55,819
So why don't you let
the police do their job?

153
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,939
I could say
the same thing to you.

154
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,826
They're spread so thin,
they can't even risk

155
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,228
letting the public know
that Mathis is out.

156
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,748
You said you're trying
another way?

157
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,701
Maybe I am, too.

158
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:41,348
You have such beautiful skin.

159
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:58,231
Lance's file
give you anything?

160
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,784
Last time the Doll Maker
was active in Starling City,

161
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:03,069
he ramped up to one kill
every three days.

162
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:04,904
That gives us
two to catch him.

163
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:06,936
Can we connect the victims?

164
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,070
Young. Pretty.

165
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:10,387
According to Lance's file,

166
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,013
he couldn't figure
out how he chose them.

167
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,160
As if porcelain dolls weren't
creepy enough

168
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,945
all on their own.

169
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,114
Barton Mathis doesn't have
any family or known acquaintances.

170
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:22,367
Lone wolves
are harder to catch.

171
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:25,203
But they do have the right
to an attorney.

172
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,339
Call Lance.

173
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:28,757
Tell him to set up
a meeting for tonight.

174
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,208
Where?
At the office

175
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,577
of whoever represented
Barton Mathis.

176
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,746
So I'm assuming
this takes priority

177
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:37,465
over finding out the identity of
your secret admirer.

178
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,769
I got that covered.

179
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:49,144
Hey.

180
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:51,446
I was wondering when I was going
to see you again.

181
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:54,115
There's someone new
in town--a woman.

182
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:56,534
She's targeting men
who target women.

183
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:59,654
I know.
I've seen her.

184
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:02,624
Find her, but don't engage.

185
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:05,243
Leave that to me.

186
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:09,947
The archer
makes quite a mess.

187
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:12,500
I'll add that charge
to the indictment.

188
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,803
Well, you called it
right. He showed.

189
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:18,390
I know him pretty well.
At least better than others.

190
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:19,841
This place is a mess.

191
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:21,643
Twice in three weeks,
you're ducking bullets.

192
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:23,061
I'm fine.
You don't look fine.

193
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,629
You look tired.

194
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:27,649
I think I'll give
you two a moment.

195
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:31,236
Did you just come here
to tell me how tired I look?

196
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:33,238
No, I came here
to check up on you

197
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,024
and check up
on some court records.

198
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:40,361
Barton Mathis is out.
I'm looking for his attorney.

199
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:42,647
Why? You're no longer
a detective.

200
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:45,283
Yeah, well, I'm just doing a little
digging off the books.

201
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:47,836
Dad, this case...

202
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:50,488
It took you to such
a dark place last time.

203
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,510
Yeah, well, I think we both know
that it wasn't Mathis who did that.

204
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:58,680
Look, nobody knows
this guy better than me,

205
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,849
which means nobody's got a
better chance of stopping him, ok?

206
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:03,802
And that means every girl that he kills
is like another one on my conscience.

207
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,603
No.

208
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:08,523
No, dad, it's not.

209
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:11,843
Whatever guilt
you're feeling...

210
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:15,447
You're just using it
to justify a vendetta.

211
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:18,066
Well, maybe I'm not
the only one.

212
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:31,746
Are you ok?

213
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:34,382
Oh, Thea, you have to stop asking me
that every time you come to visit.

214
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,084
Ah, don't count on it.

215
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,035
Well, then, I'm afraid
you'll be asking me that

216
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:40,054
for the next
25 years to life.

217
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:42,173
Please don't talk like that.

218
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:45,226
Thea, there's not a lot of value
in the power of positive thinking

219
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:47,712
when you're being put on
trial for mass murder.

220
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:52,400
Let's just try to take things
one step at a time, ok?

221
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,819
Well, I'd have to check
with my lawyer,

222
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:56,571
but I don't think
retail therapy

223
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:58,356
is a viable legal strategy.

224
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,441
Well, I spoke with her,

225
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:01,266
and she said that you can

226
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,321
wear regular clothes
to your pre-trial hearing.

227
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:06,247
So I picked these.

228
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:08,333
Hmm.

229
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:12,504
I wish the fashion police
was all I had to worry about.

230
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,623
Please don't joke.
Thea, listen to me.

231
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,210
I need you to understand
what's happening here.

232
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:21,180
503 people are dead

233
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:23,518
and there is a measure
of guilt that is owed me.

234
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,719
I'm ready to accept
my punishment.

235
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:31,639
Even if that means spending
the rest of your life in here?

236
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,527
Yes.

237
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,323
Tony Daniel?

238
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:50,542
Help you with
something, Officer?

239
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:53,411
Barton Mathis.
According to the D.A.'s office,

240
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:56,130
you handled his post-trial appeals,
and I'd like to know where he is.

241
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:59,100
So you can give him
a parking ticket or something?

242
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:02,804
If you want to talk to me
about one of my clients,

243
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:05,757
come back
with a detective shield.

244
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,759
Or a court order.

245
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:10,395
What, you find that funny?

246
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:13,147
Well, a little bit.

247
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,486
Where do we
find him?

248
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,054
Iron Heights prison.

249
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:22,156
He got out.
What?

250
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,408
How?

251
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,109
You spent hours
with him!

252
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:27,579
Where would he run?
Where?!

253
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,364
I don't know, I--I swear!

254
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,503
What the hell are you doing?!
I thought you were done killing people!

255
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,005
He'll live.

256
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:38,673
Yeah, but he'll report me
to my lieutenant!

257
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:40,258
He won't talk
to anyone.

258
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,426
What makes you so sure?

259
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,211
Because he has
another shoulder.

260
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:46,047
Aah! Oh, ok, ok, ok!

261
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:51,135
There--there is another place.

262
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:53,054
He was always drawing it.

263
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,389
Sketching.

264
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,140
His cell walls were covered
with the place.

265
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,142
Yeah, well, what's the place?
Was it in Starling City?

266
00:13:58,144 --> 00:13:59,527
Yeah.

267
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:01,863
The Bisque Museum.

268
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:04,399
He said the building
reminded him of Germany.

269
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,985
Where porcelain dolls
were invented.

270
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:14,042
I'm sorry. I guess he just gets
enthusiastic sometimes.

271
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:24,552
The lady at the desk said a guy
matching Mathis' description

272
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:27,005
checked in last week,
room 52.

273
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,474
And he paid in cash.

274
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,227
Now listen,
just we're so clear,

275
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,046
when we go through that door,
we're here to arrest Mathis, ok,

276
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,598
not to torture him.
You asked for my help.

277
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,550
Yeah, and that wasn't either,
and neither is aiding and abetting.

278
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:41,903
And I am still
a police officer.

279
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:44,105
Do you want
to catch him or not?

280
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:48,276
Let's go.

281
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,597
Detective.

282
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,516
It's been too long.

283
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:13,634
Felicity,
I need a trace.

284
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,803
On it.

285
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:18,056
You sick son of a bitch.

286
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:20,441
Sick? I've never felt better.

287
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:22,360
Fresh air agrees with me.

288
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:24,395
Yeah, well, don't
get too used to it.

289
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:25,245
I caught you before.

290
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,512
It's just a matter of time
before I do it again.

291
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:30,451
Fair enough.
In the meantime, however,

292
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:33,121
I have someone who'd like
to say hello to you.

293
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,939
Say hello, dear.

294
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:42,046
She's a little inarticulate.

295
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:43,965
She's done nothing to you.

296
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,050
Please, don't hurt her,
just let her go.

297
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:47,668
And allow her to wither away

298
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,721
in a mediocre
and forgettable life.

299
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:51,973
No. No, no, no, no, no.

300
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:55,292
She deserves so much better.

301
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:58,980
She deserves to see
her beauty preserved.

302
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:01,849
Pristine.

303
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,935
Forever.

304
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,469
Don't worry.

305
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:08,689
I will turn her into
something special.

306
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,825
Pay attention,
Detective.

307
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:13,945
What comes next
is really quite exquisite.

308
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:17,999
The sound of an esophagus
slowly hardening.

309
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
Like a symphony.

310
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,506
Felicity...

311
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:27,341
We're trying, but he's
blocked the skip trace.

312
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:29,326
Barton, don't do it.
I'm begging you, ok?

313
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,846
Is that what you want?
I am begging you. Please, just stop!

314
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:36,434
It's for the world to enjoy.

315
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:39,020
After all...

316
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:43,608
Everyone loves
a pretty doll.

317
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:12,246
The police
found her body an hour ago.

318
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,465
Does the new victim
give us any forensics we can use?

319
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,366
CSI did a complete
forensics work-up,

320
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,802
but they sent everything out
to a private lab.

321
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,587
Can you get in?

322
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,173
No. They took
their system offline.

323
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,691
It seems like someone hacked

324
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:26,812
into a lot of police-related
systems last year.

325
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,681
Then we do it like
we did the Merlyn job.

326
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:41,659
So glad you invited me
to tag along.

327
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:46,263
Tranq dart. He'll be
out for 36 minutes.

328
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,666
Yeah, I remember.

329
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,252
You're up, Felicity.

330
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,254
So, this is what a typical
night's like for you, huh?

331
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,123
Just a little breaking
and entering.

332
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,793
All right, I got
toxicology first.

333
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:03,430
What are all these?

334
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,849
Chemical ingredients of all
the make-up found on the victims--

335
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,634
skin cream,
nail polish, lipstick.

336
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:10,020
Wait, wait,
wait, stop.

337
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,922
Scroll back.
Scroll back.

338
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,143
This one. Ethyl paraben.
Sodium laureth sulphate.

339
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,729
I've seen this before.

340
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,447
It's skin cream.

341
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,282
Forensics found traces
of it on her fingers.

342
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,318
Probably something
she used before he grabbed her.

343
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,986
Skin cream.

344
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,072
Mermaid something.
One of the victims from his last run,

345
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,957
she had this in her purse and
I had the lab analyze it,

346
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,543
and it's the same formula.

347
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,578
Felicity...
Already on it.

348
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,833
How the hell
could she do that?

349
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:42,720
Ethyl paraben
and sodium laureth sulphate

350
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,972
is Mermaiden's
proprietary formula.

351
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,890
Two victims with the same taste
in skin cream.

352
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,675
That can't be a coincidence.

353
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,345
I could never figure out how
he chose his victims.

354
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,397
I think you just did.

355
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:58,235
We shouldn't have left Shado.

356
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:02,322
Well, it's her life.
It's her choice.

357
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,158
You listen
to my advice.

358
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,577
What advice?
To avoid attachment.

359
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,829
Yeah. That was bad advice.

360
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,330
But it will
save your life.

361
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,533
Maybe I don't want
to live under those terms.

362
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,201
Yeah, well, maybe
you're an idiot.

363
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,987
Hey, you think that carrying
about people gets you killed.

364
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,256
I think it's what
keeps people alive.

365
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,209
I was wrong about you.

366
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:25,095
You're definitely
an idiot.

367
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,681
Then that's who I am.

368
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:30,801
I'm not changing.
Ohh!

369
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:43,730
You should be happy I haven't
avoided attachment to you.

370
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,405
Harper.

371
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,574
It's been a while, hoss.

372
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:54,992
I've been busy.

373
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,743
I can see that.

374
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,078
I'll give you a hundred.

375
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,964
Four.
Two-five.

376
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,966
Done.

377
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,335
If you throw in
some information.

378
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:09,006
Come on, man, you've got
your finger on the pulse.

379
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,257
I'm looking for someone.

380
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,392
A blonde, likes black leather.

381
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:13,977
Sounds like your type.

382
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,263
And beats the crap
out of guys with a bow staff.

383
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,065
That still sounds
like your type.

384
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,484
But I want to put eyes on her.
What do you know?

385
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,236
Not much.

386
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:23,437
You know Cindy?

387
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,656
Folks call her "Sin."

388
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,908
She's got short,
spiky hair.

389
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,610
Yeah, I've seen her
a couple times

390
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,446
hanging around with your black
leather girlfriend.

391
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:33,947
So where can I find sin?

392
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:36,900
Well, she hangs out
over at Fifth and Boyton.

393
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,587
And that
is what I know.

394
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,044
So this is it.

395
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,879
Skin cream, that's our lead?

396
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,664
It's something.

397
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,749
What do we know
about the product?

398
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,469
It's made from crushed mother of pearl
and it's super high-end.

399
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,554
Only carried
in a handful of boutiques

400
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,023
and it's marketed for women
with extremely delicate complexions.

401
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,359
He picks his victims
for their skin.

402
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,862
The cream is how
he finds them.

403
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,513
Only four stores
in the city carry it

404
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,782
and three have
surveillance systems.

405
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,400
I've ran facial recognition
through all of them looking for Mathis,

406
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,035
but come up empty.

407
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,704
He must be staking out
the stores from the outside.

408
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,155
Fine. So we'll
do the same.

409
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:17,507
That could take days
we don't have.

410
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,326
He's probably out there
right now looking for another girl.

411
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,961
So that's what
we give him.

412
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:23,714
I'll go to the stores
that carry Mermaiden,

413
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,465
and buy it in each one
to cover our bases.

414
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,117
It's too dangerous.

415
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,753
More dangerous than going
undercover in a mob casino

416
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,922
or jumping out of a plane?

417
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,590
It's my life.

418
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,642
It's my choice.

419
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:40,764
There are only two ways
onto this island--

420
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,684
by sea, and by air.

421
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:46,240
So what, you're going

422
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,225
to steal whatever they use
to get onto the island?

423
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:52,693
Well, I'm tired
of living here, aren't you?

424
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:01,335
Oh, my God.

425
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:04,254
It appears to be
two or three clicks offshore.

426
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,841
What the hell?

427
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,131
It's firing off
its location.

428
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,999
The plane!

429
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,268
They must have found it.
Shado!

430
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,021
Kid!

431
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:26,509
Left the last store.

432
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,895
You're going to reimburse me
for these, right?

433
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:30,948
I saved my receipts.

434
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,901
Go to
the rendezvous point.

435
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:37,571
Stay in public.

436
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,993
Just for the record,
I'm not a huge fan

437
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,079
of dangling helpless girls
in front of psychopaths like meat.

438
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,798
She volunteered.

439
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
Well, she must really
believe in you.

440
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,502
So did your daughter.

441
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,424
She suffered a loss.

442
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,543
Grief's got a way of shifting
a person's beliefs.

443
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,846
But then you know
all about that.

444
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,982
You've lost people, too, right?

445
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,901
Why would you say that?

446
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,604
Why else would you be
doing this?

447
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:13,740
My youngest, she died.

448
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,062
Less than a month
after it happened,

450
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,750
I--I ended up catching
the Doll Maker case.

451
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,585
Threw myself into it.

452
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:30,173
I think on some level,
with each girl I was trying to save...

453
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,409
Sara.

454
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,795
And just like with Sara,
I couldn't.

455
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,352
He killed eight girls
Sara's age before I caught him.

456
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:46,056
Someone's coming.

457
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,593
I got him.

458
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:56,283
Ok, I'm going to admit to being
seriously wigged out right now.

459
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:59,986
False alarm, but next time
I offer to be bait for your serial killer,

460
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:02,372
please turn me down.

461
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:08,879
Delta Charlie 52
to Central.

462
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,081
Code 99, possible 207
in progress,

463
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,334
immediate back-up required!

464
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:25,479
You're all right, you're all right.
Don't move.

465
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:28,482
She hit her head.

466
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:29,900
Go, go, go.

467
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,502
I thought there'd be more
ceremony to this moment.

468
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:51,037
I'm a little disappointed,
to be honest.

469
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:58,712
Get out of here!

470
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,167
Officer Lance, SCPD.

471
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,052
It's Mathis.
I almost had him.

472
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:08,522
Search the area.
Whole building.

473
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,673
Sorry.
For what?

474
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,193
Pike's orders. He wants you collared
for obstruction.

475
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,395
What, he--

476
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:19,699
Quentin Larry Lance,
you have the right to remain silent.

477
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,769
If you give up that right to remain silent,
anything you say can...

478
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:30,715
They're charging
Lance with obstruction.

479
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:32,990
He's in custody.
Mathis isn't.

480
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:34,675
He'll be looking
for another target.

481
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:36,377
I hacked Mermaiden
and sent out an email blast

482
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:38,762
from their servers telling stores
the product was defective.

483
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:41,015
That will slow them down.
Smart.

484
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:42,433
What about Lance?

485
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:44,435
One legal problem
at a time.

486
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:53,010
Docket ending 4587,
State versus Queen.

487
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:57,648
All right, I'll hear your motions,
ladies first.

488
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,034
Your Honor, we would like to be
heard once again

489
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,568
on the issue of bail.

490
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,088
Ms. Queen has languished
in the Iron Heights prison

491
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,689
now for five months.
And in those five months,

492
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,575
did the 503 people
she's charged with killing

493
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:10,360
miraculously return
from the dead?

494
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,662
If not, I'm a little unclear

495
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:13,180
on how the passage
of time is relevant.

496
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:15,049
Might I remind the court
that the defendant

497
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,650
is presumed innocent?

498
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,519
No need.
I want to law school.

499
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,887
It's where
I learned that bail,

500
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:22,089
once denied, cannot be set
in the absence

501
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,374
of change of circumstance.
Mr. Donner,

502
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,060
what do you have for me?

503
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:28,712
Your Honor, the State
has no pre-trial motions

504
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,681
to make at this time.

505
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:33,600
But we would like
to serve notice to the defense

506
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:36,854
pursuant to rule of
criminal procedure 15.

507
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:39,773
Your Honor, I would like
to conference with the district attorney.

508
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:42,443
There's really no need,
nor any obligation.

509
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,278
What about
professional courtesy?

510
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,729
I would like to have
a conversation with you

511
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:48,231
before you seek
the death penalty.

512
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:57,240
Your client aided and abetted
an act of mass murder.

513
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:00,077
503 conversations
wouldn't convince me

514
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,931
that Moira Queen
shouldn't be the 504th fatality.

515
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,383
Mom, we are going
to fight this.

516
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:09,687
No one is going
to take you from us.

517
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:12,439
We won't let it happen.

518
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:15,776
Oliver!

519
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,605
Oliver!

520
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,458
Shado!

521
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:06,827
I had to call in
a lot of favors to get those.

522
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,996
The only problem is that I've been
at the D.A.'s office

523
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:12,983
for less than a month,
and no one owes me any favors.

524
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,502
So how did you get
the charges dropped?

525
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,238
Your friend Pike and
I have been working together

526
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,322
on the anti-vigilante taskforce.

527
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,873
Do you remember?

528
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,675
Hmm. Last year you were
working with the Arrow.

529
00:28:21,677 --> 00:28:23,343
What a difference
a few months makes.

530
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:24,678
The Arrow?

531
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,264
Yeah. Seems more
appropriate than the Hood.

532
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,016
And now you're working with him.

533
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:31,602
Guess I'm not the only one
in the Lance family that's done a 180.

534
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:33,670
This city needs help.
I just became less particular

535
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:36,356
about where it
comes from.

536
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,358
What's your excuse?

537
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,060
Still Tommy?

538
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:43,614
What would you tell me
if I said it is?

539
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,651
That a guy with a bow and arrow
can't save a guy

540
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:50,187
whose had a building
fall on top of him.

541
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,458
What's going on with you
is not about the Arrow.

542
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,128
Then what is it, Dad? Hmm?

543
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,347
I mean, why don't you tell me?

544
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:02,382
You seem to have
all the answers.

545
00:29:02,384 --> 00:29:04,802
That crack that you made about me
feeling guilty about something.

546
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:07,504
Tommy's death.

547
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:10,557
Why would I feel guilty
about that?

548
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,092
I don't know.
I wish I did.

549
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,877
'Cause it's
eating you up.

550
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,562
Your psychoanalysis

551
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,181
would probably have
a bit more credibility

552
00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:20,100
if it wasn't being offered
under police custody.

553
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:23,854
Laurel, I'm worried
about you--

554
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:25,155
I'd stay away from Pike
if I were you,

555
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,940
and the Doll Maker case.

556
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,792
Excuse me.

557
00:29:45,794 --> 00:29:49,263
Step off,
Abercrombie.

558
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,849
Cindy?

559
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:53,267
Sin?

560
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:56,386
What do you want?
Can't you see I'm busy?

561
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:58,588
I'm looking
for a friend of yours.

562
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,591
Blonde.
Black leather, head to toe.

563
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:07,281
So I guess
that's a yes.

564
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,464
He said he would
go inside...

565
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:18,168
That's what he said.
He said he would go inside.

566
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,003
You all right, pal?

567
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:23,941
Need a doctor
or something?

568
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:25,692
No.

569
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:27,894
I'm fine, thanks.

570
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,630
I checked the order
and you shorted us

571
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:47,414
half a case
of champagne.

572
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,551
I'm not paying for
booze I didn't get.

573
00:31:57,475 --> 00:32:00,227
That won't help.

574
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:04,264
Yeah, well, neither
is yelling at my vendors, but...

575
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,149
I want to yell at
someone right now.

576
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:07,818
Mom's going to be ok.

577
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,888
Because we are going
to help her fight this.

578
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,356
As a family.

579
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:14,408
They want
to kill her.

580
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,643
I won't let them.

581
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:23,650
Thea, can you turn
to channel 52, please?

582
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:28,505
Officer Quentin Lance
and his daughter Laurel

583
00:32:28,507 --> 00:32:30,541
were abducted earlier today.

584
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:32,793
No ransom has been demanded.

585
00:32:32,795 --> 00:32:36,530
SCPD are urging anyone with information
regarding their whereabouts...

586
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:38,048
How did he get them?

587
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,967
I don't know
about Laurel.

588
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:41,768
Detective Lance was abducted from
the precinct parking lot.

589
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,537
Mathis shot a guard on the way out,
which sounded the alarm.

590
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:46,006
I pulled up the department's
security camera footage,

591
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,174
and a van from Metamorpho
Chemical caught my eye.

592
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,193
Metamorpho was condemned
after the quake.

593
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:52,045
Perfect place
to make some dolls.

594
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,530
Not tonight.

595
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:54,898
Cops will use tracers,
Oliver, same as we did.

596
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,683
They won't make it in time.

597
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:00,320
Hey.

598
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:03,707
- Wake up, Abercrombie.
- What?

599
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:12,532
Did they send you?

600
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,751
Did who what?

601
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,043
Not my face!

602
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:26,930
I have a disapproving
girlfriend.

603
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:28,649
Are you one of them?

604
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:30,567
One of who?

605
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,772
That's mine.

606
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:39,743
Let him go.

607
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,792
Isn't this nice?

608
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:57,794
All of us here together.

609
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:59,379
It's like Thanksgiving.

610
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:02,082
Laurel, just stay calm.
Stay calm.

611
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:04,968
Barton, I'm sorry.
I know you hate me.

612
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,887
I know you hate me, ok,
and I understand that.

613
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:11,108
But you hate me.
So please let my daughter go.

614
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,444
Now why would I do that?

615
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:16,429
Look at her.

616
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,782
She's so lovely.

617
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:24,371
Maybe a little too much melanin
in the skin,

618
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:28,108
but...it's the imperfections
that make art sublime.

619
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,328
I am the one who put you away.
She had nothing to do with it!

620
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,613
She had everything
to do with it!

621
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,132
She's your world,
she's your very soul.

622
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:36,950
You know,
I could kill you,

623
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:39,920
I could maim you, I could slice you up
into a thousand pieces,

624
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:41,454
but if your soul
remains intact,

625
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:44,624
what have I done? Huh?

626
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,292
Nothing.

627
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,795
I will kill you, you son of a bitch!
I will kill you!

628
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:50,964
You son of a bitch!

629
00:34:57,655 --> 00:34:59,823
Laurel...Sweetheart...

630
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:01,975
Close your eyes.

631
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,695
I'm here.

632
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:07,614
I'm here, honey.

633
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:11,001
If you struggle,
it will take longer.

634
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:24,497
Do whatever you need to do,
just get him. Get him!

635
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:58,026
Let's take a better look
at this face of yours.

636
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:00,214
You have such lovely skin.

637
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:07,257
You're going back to prison.

638
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:12,429
No, he's not.

639
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:15,599
It's ok, sweetheart.

640
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,984
It's ok,
he saved us.

641
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:19,936
I know.

642
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:23,223
I know he did,
and after I hunted him.

643
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,991
It's ok,
it's all right.

644
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:26,893
No. He came.

645
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,112
He came to save me.

646
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:30,947
Yeah, I know,
he saved us both.

647
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,732
No.

648
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,085
Not him.

649
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:37,737
Not the Arrow.

650
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,840
Tommy.

651
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:41,091
What?

652
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,592
Oliver, he--

653
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:44,544
he told me to stay
out of the Glades,

654
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:47,881
and he--he told me
to get out of CNRI,

655
00:36:47,883 --> 00:36:51,918
and I didn't.
Tommy was only there

656
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,603
because I was too stubborn!

657
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:56,306
To stubborn to get out
when I had the chance.

658
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:58,475
You were right.

659
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,361
I was blaming
the Arrow because...

660
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:03,930
Oh, my God.

661
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,766
It's all my fault, Dad.

662
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:10,954
It's all my fault
that Tommy died.

663
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:18,495
It's all right, honey.

664
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:55,684
How is she?

665
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:57,685
She'll be all right.

666
00:37:57,687 --> 00:37:59,553
In time.

667
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:02,106
I might not always agree
with your methods,

668
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:04,742
but I can't argue
with your results.

669
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:07,912
You saved my daughter.

670
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:10,097
Again.

671
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:12,767
She needed help.

672
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:17,371
And she wasn't the only one.

673
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:22,326
Thanks.

674
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:29,566
Moira.

675
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:32,342
I know how hard
this day has been for you.

676
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,256
Yes.

677
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:34,723
And believe it
or not,

678
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:36,725
I've actually been
in worse situations.

679
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:40,362
Listen to me. Donner knows
how strong our defense is.

680
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:43,432
Don't let him scare you with that
little death penalty stunt of his.

681
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:45,434
Oh, I'm not afraid
of dying, Jean.

682
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:49,405
I've made my peace
with this world a long time ago.

683
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:51,290
Then it's win the case
in the courtroom.

684
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,392
The trial is going to reveal
that you were living

685
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:55,794
under Malcolm Merlyn's thumb.
It's going to reveal everything.

686
00:38:55,796 --> 00:38:57,163
Yes.

687
00:38:57,165 --> 00:39:01,500
And that's what
I'm afraid of.

688
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:04,637
Moira, what don't I know?

689
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,338
Don't you do this.

690
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,007
You need to tell me.
I am your lawyer,

691
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:10,059
and I am also your friend.

692
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:11,627
Thea and Oliver.

693
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:14,463
I'm finally in a good place with
my children, Jean.

694
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:18,651
I have my family back.

695
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:22,955
But there are
some things...

696
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,645
that must never
be spoken of.

697
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:50,332
You shouldn't
have come here.

698
00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:54,119
I had no choice.

699
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:57,639
Ra's Al ghul
has ordered your return.

700
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:06,148
I'm not going back.
I can't.

701
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:10,149
That is not your decision.

702
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:13,986
Tell them that you
couldn't find me.

703
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:16,572
Tell them I ran.

704
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:22,362
I won't lie for you.

705
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:24,914
Fine.

706
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,203
Don't tell them
anything.

707
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,658
Something's going on
with this woman.

708
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,660
She keeps following you
around, helping you out.

709
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:39,212
We've got to find her.
To stop her,

710
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:40,680
or to send her
a thank you note?

711
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:42,682
That depends.
On what?

712
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:45,352
What side she's on.

713
