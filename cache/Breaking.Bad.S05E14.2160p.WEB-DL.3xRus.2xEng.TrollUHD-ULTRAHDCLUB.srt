1
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,273
Yo, so, what's next?

2
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,775
We wait.

3
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,820
We don't got like eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

4
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,406
The reaction has begun.

5
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,785
Yeah, I know. So how long?

6
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:39,331
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed
liquid would cool more quickly

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,668
because, of course,
this is an exothermic reaction

8
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,878
which means "giving off heat."

9
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,130
And our desired product is...

10
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:50,509
Put me into a coma, why don't you?

11
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,095
What did you just say?

12
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,181
What? What? Nothing.

13
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,401
No, no, no. Not in here.

14
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,861
Like I'm an idiot.

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,115
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.

16
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,866
Dick.

17
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,922
God. Jesus. God.

18
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,757
Shut up.

19
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,442
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,902
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

21
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,572
He's got a stick up his butt?

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,783
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

23
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,495
So anyway, he's insisting that I...

24
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,957
He's demanding that I stay,

25
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,376
and look over his system,

26
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,004
and I cannot get out of it.

27
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,549
Yeah.

28
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,686
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

29
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,648
- Hey, you. What's going on?
- <i>Nothing much.</i>

30
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:33,612
I was just calling to say I'm sorry,

31
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,073
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

32
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,450
Bogdan. He's got a bug up his butt.

33
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,704
That's okay. I wasn't planning anything
special for dinner, so...

34
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:47,209
In fact, you could take pity on us
and bring a pizza home.

35
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,586
They're having a two-for-one
at Venezia's.

36
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,339
At this point,
I could eat a whole one by myself.

37
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,051
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I can pick up a pizza.

38
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,303
Hopefully Bogdan won't keep me too late.

39
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,766
He better not. Trust me, he does not want
to piss off a hungry pregnant woman.

40
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:08,063
- What's that sound?
- <i>I just sold your favorite piece.</i>

41
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,899
The hideous crying clown.

42
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,528
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks
more than I paid for it.

43
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,738
Shows what I know about art.

44
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,491
<i>Hey, what do you think about Holly?</i>

45
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,077
<i>For the baby's name.</i>

46
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,829
Do you like it?

47
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,664
I think I really like it.

48
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,292
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.

49
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,711
Let me think about it.

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,172
Just feels right, you know?
It's my new favorite.

51
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,675
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.

52
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:48,186
Listen, I was thinking, maybe we can
have a little family time this weekend.

53
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,397
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

54
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,607
You know, just take a drive.

55
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,110
The almost four of us.

56
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,529
<i>Maybe we can head up the Turquoise Trail</i>

57
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,866
<i>stop at Tinkertown,
maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.</i>

58
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,410
Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

59
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,661
- <i>I know.</i>
- Yeah.

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,581
<i>So why don't we just do that?
Take a little break?</i>

61
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,542
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>

62
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,503
Holly. It's growing on me.

63
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,131
Yep. Me too.

64
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,926
All right, well, I had better go
and get this in the mail.

65
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,804
<i>Why don't you call me
when you're on your way home?</i>

66
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,266
- Will do. Love you.
- <i>Love you too.</i>

67
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,078
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.

68
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,336
What the hell did we just walk into?

69
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,964
Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

70
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,008
He was right here before.

71
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,468
- Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
- No.

72
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,139
What do you figure? He maybe
headed down that gully there?

73
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,141
That's the way I'd go.

74
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,269
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

75
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,104
Jack.

76
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,606
These guys are DEA.

77
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,158
No! Jack, no!

78
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,035
Jack! Jack! Jack!

79
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,995
No! No, don't!

80
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,372
Jack, don't. No.

81
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,209
No, Jack, Jack, Jack! Jack, no!

82
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,546
- Jack, no. Don't kill him.
- Back it up.

83
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,757
- Don't kill him, Jack.
- Get back here.

84
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,258
The hell not? He's DEA.

85
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,928
No, he's family.

86
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,263
Say again?

87
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,058
He's my family.

88
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,226
He's my brother-in-law.

89
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,604
Didn't cross your mind to maybe tell us

90
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,273
you had a DEA agent for a brother-in-law?

91
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,694
- Did you know about this?
- I called you off, remember?

92
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,365
- I told you not to come.
- Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.

93
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,242
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Too late now.

94
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,288
How's about you telling me
what was going down out here?

95
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,042
You and your brother-in-law
don't seem to be getting along too well.

96
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,170
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't concern you.

97
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,548
We just wasted his partner here,
and he's wearing a bullet,

98
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,385
so, yeah, I'd say it does concern me.

99
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,304
This is between him and me.

100
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,641
- No cavalry coming?
- No.

101
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,269
- You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.
- No, no, no! Jack...

102
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,649
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

103
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,151
Not yet.

104
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,240
Hank.

105
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,203
Nothing can change what just happened,

106
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,039
but you can walk out of here alive

107
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,919
if you just promise us
that you'll let this go.

108
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,924
Yeah, I thought as much.

109
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,802
Sorry, man. Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

110
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,971
No, no, no, listen! I have money!

111
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,225
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's...

112
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,856
It's $80 million.

113
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,363
Eighty million.

114
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,288
So that's what got
this party started, huh?

115
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,042
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

116
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,920
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything. Think about it.

117
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,424
You can have any future that you want.

118
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,135
Jack.

119
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,473
Eighty million.

120
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,434
And all you've got to do

121
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,270
is let him go.

122
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,314
That's a hell of an offer.

123
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,566
What do you think, fed?

124
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,610
Would you take that deal?

125
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,570
It's Hank.

126
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,990
His name is Hank.

127
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,161
How about it, Hank?

128
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,747
Should I let you go?

129
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,797
My name is ASAC Schrader.

130
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,800
And you can go fuck yourself.

131
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,806
Hank, listen to me.

132
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,849
You gotta tell him.

133
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,602
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

134
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,979
Please. Please.

135
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,942
What? You want me to beg?

136
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,405
You're the smartest guy I ever met.

137
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,450
And you're too stupid to see...

138
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,871
he made up his mind 10 minutes ago.

139
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,925
Do what you're gonna do.

140
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,964
Pretty specific directions.

141
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,551
Most people tell me to be somewhere,
they say, "West on the 40"

142
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,679
"this or that exit, second gas station
on the left." You know?

143
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,350
This here? This is a whole other story.

144
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,062
That fancy phone of yours,
where does it say this is exactly?

145
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,277
Yeah.

146
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,992
Look at this.
They even brought a shovel.

147
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,537
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.

148
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,003
All right.

149
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,547
Says this is it right here.

150
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,299
Dig.

151
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,870
What's that? A barrel?
Couple barrels?

152
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,544
- Jesus.
- Hell, yeah!

153
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,672
Oh, Jesus. Would you look at that?

154
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,132
- Hell, yeah!
- Goddamn.

155
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,181
What are you waiting for?

156
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,643
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.

157
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,688
- Let me get on this side.
- Get that out of there, man.

158
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,278
Okay. Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

159
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,614
- Seriously?
- Jack.

160
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,618
That's like 10 or 11 million right there.
You sure you wanna do that?

161
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,495
You gonna make me say it again?

162
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,748
Go, go. Chop, chop.

163
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,417
Jesus, what's with all the greed here?

164
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,669
It's unattractive.

165
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,341
Hey.

166
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,677
Hey.

167
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,555
I'm leaving you a barrel.

168
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,016
Boys are gonna load it for you.

169
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,144
You got the keys to these cuffs?

170
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,074
I'm sorry for your loss.

171
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,122
My nephew here, he respects you.

172
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:39,420
He would never forgive me
if things went another way.

173
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,423
Also you caught me in a good mood.

174
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,094
So here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get in your car,

175
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,680
and you're gonna drive out of here,
all right?

176
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,934
No hard feelings.

177
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,019
Understand me?

178
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,398
We square?

179
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:03,736
Hey, man, I gotta know we're square,
or we're gonna have to go that other way.

180
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,836
Pinkman.

181
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,715
Pinkman.

182
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,760
You still owe me.

183
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,598
If you can find him, we'll kill him.

184
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,853
Found him.

185
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,613
No!

186
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,825
Get off me!

187
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,076
Get off!

188
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,707
No, no.

189
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,891
Good to go?

190
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,814
Hey, Uncle Jack.

191
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,576
Well, he was out here with those feds.

192
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,080
Right? Working with them. Should we
maybe find out what he told them first?

193
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,125
Because, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

194
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,711
that might not be too good for us.

195
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,674
And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.

196
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,218
I mean, I can do it.

197
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,390
Me and him, we got history.

198
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,938
And then, you know,
we'd take care of the job after that.

199
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,067
Works for me. Work for you?

200
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,199
- Let's go, pal.
- No.

201
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,867
No!

202
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,619
No!

203
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,995
No!

204
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,705
Wait.

205
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,760
I watched Jane die.

206
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,311
I was there.

207
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,356
And I watched her die.

208
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:51,404
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

209
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,449
I could have saved her.

210
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,245
But I didn't.

211
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,812
- Hi.
- Hello.

212
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,649
That truck belong to you?

213
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,236
It does.

214
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,613
I'd like to buy it.

215
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,199
It's not for sale.

216
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,519
{\an8}Hey, Walt, it's me.

217
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,396
{\an8}Just thought I'd try you again.

218
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,524
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back,

219
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,778
{\an8}so just give us a call whenever you can.

220
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,989
Bye.

221
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,241
Hey, Aunt Marie.

222
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,286
Hey, sweetie.

223
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,039
Haven't seen you for a while.
What have you been up to?

224
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,459
Oh, you know. This and that.

225
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,253
Your mom and I need to talk,
so thought I'd stop by.

226
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,466
Well, I wish you'd called first.

227
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,093
This isn't the best time.

228
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,846
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

229
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,098
Why don't we go into your office?

230
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,814
I got it.

231
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,942
Okay, honey. Thanks.

232
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:21,418
- Marie, I have nothing to say.
- Well, I do.

233
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,505
So you can just sit there and listen.

234
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,050
I got a call from Hank.

235
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,719
He arrested Walt three hours ago.

236
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,471
It's over.

237
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,474
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

238
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:39,310
Hank and Steve Gomez are working
with a former associate of Walt's

239
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,689
Jesse Pinkman, whom I know you know,

240
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,360
and Pinkman has supplied them
with everything they need.

241
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,448
Hank is booking Walt as we speak.

242
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,243
And I, for one, could not be happier.

243
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,125
I almost didn't come here.

244
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,796
Christ, I barely even know who you are,

245
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,466
and I sure as hell don't know
if I can ever trust you again.

246
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,393
And then I think about
how you were so upset with Walt,

247
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,396
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

248
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:27,317
and all of this makes me believe
that there has got to be hope for you

249
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,321
that whatever he did to you
can be undone.

250
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:39,872
All I know, all I have been
forcing myself to remember

251
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,623
is that you are my sister.

252
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,252
And so I'm here.

253
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,882
- Marie...
- Everything changes now.

254
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,053
And you have got to prepare yourself.

255
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,389
Hank will help you as much as he can.
I know he will.

256
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,437
And I will support you through this.

257
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,772
But I have conditions.

258
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,276
Give me every single copy
of that obscenity

259
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,403
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank. That DVD.

260
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,949
Every single copy.

261
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,409
You understand me?

262
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,996
Answer me. Do you understand me?

263
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,623
Yes.

264
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,751
Good.

265
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,547
Now dry your eyes and get Flynn in here.

266
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,842
You are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything.

267
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,386
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

268
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,724
- Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.
- No. No. No, he cannot know.

269
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,061
You tell him, or I will.

270
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,688
There's no way around this.

271
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:50,734
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

272
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,060
No.

273
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,706
Look, I gave you what you wanted.

274
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,166
Come on, please.

275
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,710
Hey, please.

276
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,379
- I told you where to find the tape, okay?
- Yup.

277
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,881
Hey, just go.

278
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,592
Just go there.
Just go to his house and get it.

279
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,595
- We're on it.
- Get it!

280
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,267
No one else knows about it.
Just me and his partner.

281
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,437
- Okay.
- No one else knows, I swear!

282
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,343
Let's cook.

283
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,566
You're completely out of your mind.

284
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,652
- It's the truth.
- It is, Flynn.

285
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,113
Then both of you are out of your minds.

286
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,991
You're full of shit, is what you are.
Both of you.

287
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:30,162
If this is true, then how could you
keep this a secret?

288
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,708
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

289
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,254
I'll be asking myself that
for the rest of my life.

290
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:43,175
So you're saying all this time
you were lying about this?

291
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,720
I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.

292
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,889
You just admitted it.

293
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,684
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

294
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,269
Which lie is it?

295
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:57,147
Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

296
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,108
Right here, right now. Believe it.

297
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:04,279
You know what? This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

298
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,038
- Baby...
- I wanna talk to Dad.

299
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,242
Your dad's in custody.
You can't talk to him for a while.

300
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,454
- I'm calling Uncle Hank.
- I've tried. He's not answering.

301
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,248
He's probably in the thick of it
with your father.

302
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,960
Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn,

303
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,088
but if you could just breathe,
just try to breathe,

304
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,675
- and just trust...
- Really? Really? Try to breathe?

305
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,720
Oh, my God.

306
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,850
Go home.

307
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,728
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

308
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,897
I'll stop by later.

309
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,265
Flynn?

310
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,853
Could you put your seatbelt on, please?

311
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,734
Please. It's not safe.

312
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,611
You're shitting me, right?

313
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,745
If all this is true and you knew about it

314
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,248
then you're as bad as him.

315
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,886
Whose truck is that?

316
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,310
Dad?

317
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:04,357
Listen, I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

318
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,611
Mom, Aunt Marie, they said
that you were arrested?

319
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,169
- No, just...
- You're some kind of drug dealer?

320
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,365
No, just come inside, please. Now.

321
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,700
Come inside. Come on.

322
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,744
Go, go, go.

323
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:19,706
- Dad, stop. Just talk to me, please.
- Our priority right now is to pack.

324
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:24,044
- Uncle Hank, they said he arrested you?
- I will discuss all of this later, okay?

325
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,713
- Just tell me what...
- Just listen to me!

326
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,591
Go into your bedroom now,
grab anything important.

327
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,969
You understand? Go. Now.
Both of you. Go.

328
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,262
Walt.

329
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,724
Why are you here?

330
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,811
Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?

331
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,369
For you and the kids. Now.
This is our priority.

332
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:47,067
Hank had you in custody.
He wouldn't just let you go.

333
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,111
- Where is he?
- I...

334
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,197
- Where's Hank?
- I...

335
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,157
- I negotiated...
- Negotiated?

336
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,494
- Yes.
- What does that mean?

337
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,707
It means we're fine, okay?

338
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,585
We are. We're fine.
Everything is gonna be fine,

339
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,587
but we need to leave right now.

340
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,090
- All right? Can we do that?
- What happened?

341
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,342
Where is Hank?

342
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,969
Why do we need to leave?

343
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,681
I need both of you to trust me.

344
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,850
Right now, okay?

345
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,102
Please, just work with me here,

346
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,981
and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

347
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:30,819
Where is Hank?

348
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,032
Skyler.

349
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:45,709
I have $11 million in cash right outside.

350
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,503
We can have a fresh start.

351
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,756
Whole new lives.

352
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,969
All we have to do is go.

353
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,471
We have to go right now.

354
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,099
That's all we have to do.

355
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,272
You killed him.

356
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,278
You killed Hank.

357
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,030
- What?
- No, no, no.

358
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,782
- You killed him.
- No, no, no!

359
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,701
I tried to save him.

360
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,162
Uncle Hank is dead? I...

361
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,832
- Mom, it can't be true. It just can't be true.
- Just stop, please.

362
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,001
Everything is gonna be okay.

363
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,922
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise,
but we need to leave right now.

364
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,591
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.

365
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,177
Just stop for one second.

366
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,513
- Look, I told you to get your things.
- Stop walking away.

367
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,058
- There is no time.
- Tell me about Uncle Hank.

368
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,644
- No, just drop it!
- But what's wrong with you?

369
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:50,023
- We're going. We're going right now.
- You have to tell me. Dad, wait.

370
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,693
What happened to Uncle Hank?
What...?

371
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,157
Get out.

372
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,744
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

373
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,665
- Enough.
- Mom, what are you doing?

374
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,084
Skyler, put the knife down, please.

375
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:14,965
- I promise you, everything...
- Don't say one more word.

376
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,802
Get out of here now.

377
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,637
Skyler...

378
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,430
Get out!

379
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:31,314
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!

380
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:35,277
- Let go! Let go!
- Get away from us!

381
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,320
Just stop! Stop!

382
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,448
Dad, stop it! Stop!

383
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,284
Mom, stop it.

384
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,078
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.

385
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,039
Stop! Just, please, stop!

386
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,002
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

387
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:02,178
What the hell is wrong with you?!
We're a family!

388
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,436
We're a family.

389
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,275
What are you doing?

390
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,943
What are you doing?

391
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,403
Yeah, I need the police.

392
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,114
My dad, he pulled a knife on my mom.

393
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,867
He attacked her. He's dangerous.

394
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,162
I think he might have killed somebody.

395
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,039
Yeah.

396
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,542
He's still here.

397
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,587
Yeah, he's still in the house.

398
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,757
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

399
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,427
308 Negra Arroyo Lane!
You've gotta come quick.

400
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:47,057
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!

401
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,809
Oh, my God. No.

402
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,228
- Walt, no! Walt!
- Mom!

403
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,105
Walt, please, no!

404
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,567
No! No! No!

405
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,652
Walt, no! Let her go!

406
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,488
You can't take her!

407
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,532
Let her go, please! You can't take her!

408
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,826
Let her go! Walt!

409
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:10,330
Walt, please, no!

410
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,874
Walt, no! Walt, please!

411
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,835
Walt, no!

412
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,838
Walt, please, no!

413
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,925
Walt, please!

414
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,136
Please, stop! Walt!

415
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,527
Say, "Da-da."

416
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,029
{\an8}Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?

417
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,075
There. Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?

418
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,953
Don't be sad.
Where's your belly button?

419
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,581
Where's your belly button?

420
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,083
There. Now, don't you feel better?

421
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,794
You're all nice and dry.

422
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,338
That feels good? Oh, I know.

423
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:04,009
You were so wet and so cranky,
but now you feel better, don't you?

424
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:08,889
Next order of business
is to get you a brand-new car seat.

425
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,391
Won't that be nice, Holly?

426
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,189
Mama.

427
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,357
Mama.

428
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,943
Mama.

429
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,238
Mama.

430
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,120
Mama.

431
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,332
Mama.

432
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,379
Mama.

433
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,267
Confirming the abduction.

434
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,062
Amber Alert. Holly White.

435
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,356
Female, 18 months.

436
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,483
Blond hair, blue eyes.

437
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:06,738
Was last seen wearing
a pink and white jacket, pink pants.

438
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,531
Abductor is the father...

439
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:14,037
He was in handcuffs.
Hank had him in handcuffs.

440
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:18,625
Bald head, goatee,
gold, wire-framed glasses.

441
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,462
Are you expecting a call?

442
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:28,134
<i>Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.</i>

443
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,553
<i>Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.</i>

444
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,140
- That's him. That's my husband.
- <i>I need you to pick up the phone.</i>

445
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,849
Start a trace on the landline.

446
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:41,439
- The number's 505-177-8987.
- <i>I know you're there, so pick it up.</i>

447
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,692
<i>Skyler, you hear me?</i>

448
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,987
- Need the location of an incoming caller.
- <i>Answer the pho...</i>

449
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,201
Walt, where's Holly?

450
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,995
<i>Are you alone?</i>

451
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,955
<i>No police?</i>

452
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:01,376
No. No police.

453
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,005
Where are you? Where's Holly?

454
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:10,343
- Walt!
- <i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

455
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:14,514
<i>Why can't you do one thing I say?</i>

456
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,225
- What?
- <i>This is your fault.</i>

457
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,186
<i>This is what comes of your disrespect.</i>

458
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,105
I told you, Skyler.

459
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,898
I warned you for a solid year.

460
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,651
You cross me, there will be consequences.

461
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,903
What part of that didn't you understand?

462
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,823
You took my child.

463
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,408
<i>Because you need to learn.</i>

464
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,493
You bring her back.

465
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:39,914
Maybe now you'll listen.
Maybe now you'll use your damn head.

466
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,459
You know, you never believed in me.

467
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,754
You were never grateful
for anything I did for this family.

468
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,674
<i>"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop."</i>

469
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,720
<i>You have to stop this.
It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>

470
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,139
<i>"Someone might get hurt."</i>

471
00:41:56,348 --> 00:42:00,060
<i>You're always whining and complaining
about how I make my money</i>

472
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,189
<i>just dragging me down,
while I do everything.</i>

473
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,859
<i>And now...</i>

474
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:12,197
Now you tell my son what I do

475
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:19,120
<i>after I've told you and told you
to keep your damn mouth shut.</i>

476
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,249
You stupid bitch.

477
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,128
<i>How dare you?</i>

478
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,892
I'm sorry.

479
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:49,859
You have no right

480
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,363
to discuss anything about what I do.

481
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,824
What the hell do you know
about it anyway?

482
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,284
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>

483
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,578
<i>Me. Me alone. Nobody else!</i>

484
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,372
You're right.

485
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,000
You're right.

486
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,671
You mark my words, Skyler.

487
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,675
Toe the line,

488
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:17,637
or you will wind up just like Hank.

489
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,766
Walt.

490
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,937
Tell me what happened.

491
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,982
Where is Hank?

492
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,276
Please.

493
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,695
We need to know.

494
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,828
You're never gonna see Hank again.

495
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,210
<i>He crossed me.</i>

496
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,589
<i>You think about that.</i>

497
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,843
<i>Family or no.</i>

498
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,639
You let that sink in.

499
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,643
<i>Walt.</i>

500
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,898
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>

501
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,486
<i>Please, Walt.</i>

502
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,449
Just come home.

503
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,751
I've still got things left to do.

504
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,172
Hey.
