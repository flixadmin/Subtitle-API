[Mona] Dang it.

00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:21,272
Dang it!

3
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:46,131
Man, some days, rewriting history

4
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:49,593
to eradicate any notion of rebellion
and free will is hard.

5
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:51,845
Yeah.

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,098
You ever wondered
if what we're doing is, like, wrong?

7
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,600
How could it be wrong?

8
00:00:56,683 --> 00:01:00,854
The Fates give everyone food, shelter,
and television.

9
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,619
You don't want a world that looks like
these history books, do you?

10
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,027
Right. The Fates be praised.

11
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,446
Just doesn't feel quite right.

Can't you people see?
None of this is how it should be!

29
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,877
He's gonna get his dang thread cut.

Do I know you?
You look familiar. Do you recognize me?

My name is Gary,
but most people call me "Crazy Guy."

32

- Stay away from me, you weirdo.
- Yeah, they call me that, too!

This is your new home, little guy.

Another night, another bowl of mush.

00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,758
Let's see what's streaming on Fate Plus.

37
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,893
- I'm back!
- [studio audience cheering]

38
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:05,937
Hey, Behrad. Did you remember
the grey mush like I asked?

39
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:10,442
I got the green mush, the purple mush,
the sticky mush, the slimy mush...

40
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:12,611
and I forgot the grey mush.

41
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,280
- You forgot the grey mush?
- I forgot the grey mush.

42
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:16,404
[studio audience laughing]

43
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:20,786
[laughing] Behrad, you're so dumb!

44
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:24,039
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

Momma needs her <i>Ultimate Buds.</i>
[chuckles]

47
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:36,009
The oven's taking forever to preheat
and the mush is still cold.

00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,637
- My boss is gonna be here in 30 minutes.
- [knocking at door]

- Nate.

51
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:47,747
[speaking with British accent]
I don't know this Nate you speak off.

52
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,525
Me name is Robin of Loxley
of Starling City.

53
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,150
Why?

54
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:57,197
[in normal voice] I got an audition
to play Robin Hood in <i>Arrow,</i>

55
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,991
a show about a vigilante.

56
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:01,243
Mmm. Sounds dumb.

57
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,788
If it was dumb,
why would I stop crime with this?

58
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:06,665
[gasps]

59
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,543
The grey mush!

60
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,504
I guess I got the grey mush.

No, don't leave me here with...

Nate.

66
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:27,477
Are you still upset about the time
we almost kissed?

67
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,104
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,231
I'm sorry I missed the kiss.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,443
No, I'm mad
because you ruined the place,

70
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,248

any minute.

What's that thing doing?

73
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,198
Oh.

74
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,493
I don't know.
It's never done that before.

75
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:45,078
I say don't touch it.

76
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:47,122
Right. But on the other hand...

77
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:48,915
why not?

78
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,876
Ah!

79
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:57,382
This show's off the rails.
There's no ghost in <i>Ultimate Buds.</i>

Zari?

83

But how? You found me.

Oh, God.

- What?

87
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:25,535
Nate?

88
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,913
Yeah. Nate Heywood.

89
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,873
Actor and your neighbor.

90
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,751
Do you remember... us?

91
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:37,964
I mean,
I always wanted there to be an... "us."

92
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:44,429
Could I be more of a kiss misser?

93
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,265
Wow.

94
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,768
Lot going on here.

95
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,647
Right, need to take these off
immediately.

96
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:55,416
Right, I knew the timeline
would be different,

97
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,942
and you might not remember me...

98
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,152
but this is just bizarre.

99
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,656
Right, where is the <i>Waverider?</i>

100
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,117
Where's Sara and Mick and John
and the others?

101
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,621
Ava Sharpe? Mona Wu?

102
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,959
Did they just say "Mona Wu"?

103
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,713
Sure. All good questions. Great.

104
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:21,091
Hey, Behrad,
your sister might've hit her head again!

105
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,844
Behrad?

106
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,098
Is that really you?

107
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,309
I thought I'd never see you again.

108
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,997
- Did you eat an entire Behrad brownie?
- [knocking at door]

109
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,481
- What?
- Your boss!

110
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,650
Why don't you just stay
in this closet for a sec,

111
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,835
while we entertain your boss?

112
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,653
And your liver processes the brownie.

113
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,781
Welcome. I am Behrad, Zari's brother.

114
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:48,535
You must be the hot boss.

115
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,540
My, what a charming brother
the Fates have granted Zari.

116
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,254
- Where is she?
- Not in the closet, that's for sure.

117
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:12,434
Okay. Boss coming over for dinner?

118
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,019
Think I know what's going on here.

119
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,688
We're stuck in a TV sitcom.

120
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:20,692
Zari, do you have amnesia again?

121
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:21,985
[studio audience laughs]

122
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,821
You guys don't hear that. The laughing?

123
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:26,882
[whispering] She's hearing voices.

124
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,742
Sis, what do you think is happening?

125
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,411
I think you guys fought the Fates.

126
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,079
[all] Fates be praised.

127
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,248
And you lost.

128
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:39,169
And for some reason,
you've been loomed... here.

129
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,713
What's behind this door?

130
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,691
[Nate] I don't know. We never opened it.

131
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,759
- Never even occurred to us.
- Mmm-mmm.

132
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:47,719
Well, we're about to find out.

133
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:54,893
Huh.

134
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,060
[crackling]

135
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,440
Has that been here the whole time?

136
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:05,945
Coming, dummies?

137
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,157
- Buds stick together.
- Like glue.

138
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,214
Where are we?

139
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,423
[man] Ah.

140
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,052
We've been expecting you.

141
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:32,514
Welcome to Highcastle Abbey.

142
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,787
Lady Zari and Lord Behrad, the second
footman will see to your carriage.

143
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:57,789
What happened to the first footman?

144
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:58,998
[chuckles]

145
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,586
I've taken the liberty of ordering you
some Persian treats

146
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,171
to make you feel at home.

147
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,965
Shall I ask the kitchen
to prepare a tea?

148
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:08,842
Sure.

149
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,638
Unbelievable.

150
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,225
John Constantine,
self-proclaimed nasty piece of work...

151
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:18,977
is a butler.

152
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,163
Please tell me you guys recognize him.

153
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,897
- No.
- Sorry, sis.

154
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,817
- You think this is another TV show?
- [Nate] Right.

155
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,653
We were from a hilarious
yet heartfelt sitcom,

156
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:32,490
but now, we're stuck on
some stuffy BBC period piece.

157
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,663
[sighs]

158
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,332
With no obvious way to escape.

159
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:47,964
Well, it seems like the TV show
is adapting to our presence.

160
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:51,127
So, I think we just have to play along
until I can get John to snap out of it.

161
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,012
Okay, it looks like
we're some kind of aristocrats.

162
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,137
Nice.

163
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,849
Mmm. That must make you our servant.

164
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,225
[laughs]

165
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,192
Wouldn't you prefer wearing something
a tad more cheerful, dearest?

166
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:10,737
I would, if the prospect of your
matchmaking was worthy of cheer.

167
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:14,532
Lord Behrad is your father's
closest male heir.

168
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,577
A marriage to him keeps Highcastle Abbey
in our family.

169
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,373
Well... how is he, Mr. Constantine?

170
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:25,835
Lord Behrad is, as advertised,
a foreigner.

171
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,713
- Not you, too.
- Hmm.

172
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,804
Lord and Lady Tarazi, may I present

173
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,766
Lady Natalie and her daughter,
Lady Astra.

174
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,481
I do beg your pardon, Lord Tarazi,

175
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:49,776
but is it customary where you come from
for the valet to sit?

176
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,861
- [snaps fingers]
- Oh!

177
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:53,279
[clears throat] Oy!

178
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,574
[in British accent]
A thousand apologies... bro.

179
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,661
Mr. Constantine, why don't you show

180
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,871
the Tarazis' valet
to the servant's hall?

181
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,706
Happily, my lady.

182
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:10,630
Please have a seat.
You must be exhausted from your travels.

183
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,926
I'm so glad we could find the time
to get to know one another.

184
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,052
Yes.

185
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,681
Before we marry
and you inherit our family's estate.

186
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,058
[chuckles awkwardly]

187
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,686
I'm sorry, did you say "marry"?

188
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,437
I have to go to the bathroom.

189
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:28,982
To the lavatory.

190
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,234
Don't leave me.

191
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,198
Do you enjoy hunting, Lord Behrad?

192
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,286
Oh... I like to play among the animals,
not slaughter them.

193
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,999
Well... that is
an unconventional opinion.

194
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,504
In this household,
servants should be seen and not heard

195
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,381
in the company of their superiors.

196
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,425
Which means we should all be silent
around you.

197
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:56,735
Is that right, Mr. Constantine?

198
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,946
Mrs. Hutchins, trying to
hold your tongue would be as easy

199
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,139
as swimming through custard
in Wellington boots.

200
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:02,932
There you are, John.

201
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:06,895
I do beg your pardon, Lady Zari,
but this is most irregular.

202
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:08,938
Right, I need to talk to you.

203
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:10,397
Alone.

204
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,567
They got the blue mush. Fancy kind.

205
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,985
Yum.

206
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,403
[clears throat]

207
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:21,075
- How may I assist you, my lady?
- All right, listen to me.

208
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,370
You are not some buttoned-up butler.

209
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:28,416
You are a cynical, chain-smoking,
master of the occult.

210
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,669
You have an apprentice named Gary,
and you are capable of great...

211
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:33,504
[snarls]

212
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,634
Magic.

213
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:39,177
Did she just say "Gary" now?

214
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,514
Maybe that crazy guy
isn't so crazy after all.

215
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,228
Can I confide in you, Lord Behrad?

216
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,439
Confide away.

217
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,317
Sometimes, I wish I'd been born a man.

218
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,527
At least then,
I'd have a chance at adventure.

219
00:12:56,653 --> 00:13:00,114
Your parents can't hold you here.
You're a diva.

220
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,033
What is a diva?

221
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,578
A diva is a female version of a hustler.

222
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,517
Okay, let me get this straight.

223
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,753
You don't remember me or the Legends,
but you can still cast spells?

224
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,383
To my great shame,
I am at war with myself.

225
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,386
Part of me is...

226
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,390
seduced by dark magic.

227
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,641
That's the real you.

228
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,602
Are you going to inform Lady Natalie?

229
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,728
Yeah, maybe we should.

230
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:34,857
Please, don't. I beg you.
You see, I'd be sacked.

231
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,902
You know what?

232
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:41,030
If you cast one of your spells
and help us escape this world,

233
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,907
we will keep quiet.

234
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,077
- Maybe.
- We will.

235
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:52,792
Gary, I think people are trapped
on the TV, and they know us.

236
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,169
- You sound crazy.
- You were onto something.

237
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,630
The world's all wrong
and the cracks are starting to show.

238
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:58,923
Just watch.

239
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:02,051
<i>In order for this spell
to work properly,</i>

240
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:05,555
<i>I must first know where it is
that you intend to go.</i>

241
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:09,642
Can you send us to someone?

242
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,310
We need to find our captain.

243
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,106
What is your captain's name?

244
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,608
Sara. Captain Sara Lance.

245
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,654
The Jack of Wands.

246
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,949
Daring exploits and dangerous challenges
lay ahead.

247
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:27,452
- Great.
- I do hope this works.

248
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,454
I shall be glad to be rid of you.

249
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,166
Actually, John,
we really need you to come with us.

250
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,794
Amusing joke, my lady,
but I will never desert my post.

251
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,088
I tried to stop her.

252
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,258
Mr. Constantine,
I have made the most wonderful decision.

253
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,676
I'm moving to London.

254
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:47,346
London? What about Highcastle?

255
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:48,681
And your mother?

256
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,559
I am a diva.

257
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,977
My bad.

258
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:57,523
Everyone who wants to leave, link up.

259
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,232
Where are we going?

260
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,069
Lady Astra, I beg you, please step away.

261
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:04,238
To live a life that I love, I must know
the world outside these walls.

262
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:06,282
Lady Astra, I must insist.

263
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,203
Where did they go?

264
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,038
Did she say "Captain Lance"?

265
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,664
From <i>Star Trip?</i>

266
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,044
We have to get into Clotho Productions
and find out what's going on.

267
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,011
Officer Maala, report.

268
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,472
It's a Gromulan Warship, Captains.

269
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,724
Hail them, Officer Maala.

270
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:35,269
Or wouldn't it be more logical

271
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:38,439
to attack the warship
before it attacks us?

272
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:41,526
By that logic, we would attack
every ship we encountered.

273
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,195
Is there something wrong with that?

274
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,490
Fine, Officer Maala.

275
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,867
- Hail the Gromulans.
- Yes, Captain.

276
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:55,373
[speaking alien language]

277
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:00,878
Can we kill them now?

278
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:12,932
[Sara] <i>Space: the fatal frontier.</i>

<i>And blow them up with lasers.</i>

283

Captains, we've caught the Gromulans
with their pants down.

284
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:42,295
Charge the cannons.
Let's give them hell.

285
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:44,630
Engage the translator, Officer Maala.

286
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:46,174
I would like to talk to them.

287
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,135
Two captains is
an exciting power dynamic.

288
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,220
Charging cannons
and engaging the translator.

289
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,598
<i>Okay, sorry,
do you guys not understand me?</i>

290
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,016
We understand you.

291
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:56,893
We come in peace.

292
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:59,312

No, Nate. No.

00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,215
[Zari] Oh, God.

301
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,008
Who knew?

302
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:32,553
- That was bad.
- Can't even look.

303

I mean, it's an absolutely
remarkable vessel really, isn't it?

Okay, you're losing oxygen.

Sure, that works.
We're your crew, anyways.

I know it's complicated,

where you're our captains.

332
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,319
You are our crew.

May I interest you
in some rare Gromulan tea?

All right,
I know it's hard to believe, but...

338
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,422
No. It makes perfect sense.

339
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:33,966
We encounter this sort of thing
all the time.

340
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,302
You're probably our crew
from an alternate timeline

341
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,804
and you've been trapped
in some sort of...

342

late and early 20th century
prison dimension,

344
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:45,770
which calls the question

345
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,939
if we ourselves are existing
in a prison dimension.

346
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,484
It's perfectly logical.

a script for <i>Star Trip.</i>

It looks like it's being generated
automatically

00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,337
by some sort of
script-writing algorithm.

I have no idea.

We just can't keep hopping shows
ad infinitum now, can we?

who you really are,

But it's not because you do magic
or because you have superpowers, it...

Did someone say "problem"?

It sounds like being stuck

but why are you doing this, Clotho?

478

there are consequences to disobedience.

485
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,602
Mr. Parker, I know
you're trying to help, but you just...

489
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,599
<i>Than feel as awful as this</i>

490
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,185
Yeah, you're definitely not Mr. Parker.

491
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:35,280
Where did you send them?

492
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:38,408
I just pulled the plug
on this crossover, silly.

493
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,285
You all have to go home now.

504
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,536
I am so sorry.
I thought I was tackling Mr. Parker.

505
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,413
What kind of mush are we having tonight?

506
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,915
The "you gotta go" kind, come on.

[studio audience laughing]

00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,586
Yeah, how did we not hear that before?

509
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,630
After all that,
we're right back where we started.

510
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,592
Motherfater! I wanna see
the Buds break free!

511
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:41,471
Just try and make a move on us,
and I will burn you, you bastard.

512
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,181
John.

513
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:45,893
- We need to go back.
- Yeah, sure, love.

514
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,562
Why don't you really listen to her,

515
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,731
construction worker John?

516
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,985
I wanna see my mother.

517
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,995
You think your mother
will suddenly have all of her memories?

518
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,248
What if Natalie is just a character
on a TV show, love?

519
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,501
I have to know for sure.

We're back.

532
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,719
And it's Christmastime, apparently.

533
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:03,971
Yep.

00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,098
Oh. There you two are.

Mom.

My love.

537
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,979
What's all this?

538
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,565
Do you remember anything?
About your life before Highcastle Abbey?

539
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:17,984
I...

540
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,865
London? Magic?

541
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:24,950
Dad?

542
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,577
What on Earth are you talking about?

543
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,457
Nevermind.

544
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,877
I love you, Mom.

545
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,713
Oh...

546
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,508
I love you too, you goose.

547
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,720
You come upstairs and change for dinner.

548
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,271
Astra, listen to me.

549
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,814
I know what you're gonna say.

550
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,983
She's not real.

551
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,485
We can stay.

552
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,572
What?

553
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,407
What are you playing at?

554
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,867
It's no trick, love.

555
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,874
Astra, look at me.

556
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,711
What have I got to show for myself?

557
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:20,464
Thirty-eight crap years of pain
and broken promises.

558
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,842
You wanna know what my original sin was?

559
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,596
It was you.

560
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,931
Astra,

561
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,851
I rail against the angels and the demons
for being arrogant bastards,

562
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,896
but I'm worse than
the bloody lot of them.

563
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,857
And I thought that
I could use your innocent soul

564
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,692
as a bargaining chip
to save your mother.

565
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:41,776
Bollocks.

566
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,447
If you're happy here,

567
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,574
then I will spend an eternity

568
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:51,703
as ruddy Mr. Constantine
trying to make it up

569
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,497
to you and Natalie.

570
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:59,503
Is John Constantine really capable
of such a selfless act?

571
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,463
[chuckles softly]

572
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:11,598
Would it be acceptable to dine
at half past 7:00, Lady Astra?

573
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,559
Mrs. Hutchins is running a trifle late.

574
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:19,648
Perfectly acceptable, Mr. Constantine.

575
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,537
That's one show back on track.

576
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,705
My algorithm should take care
of the rest.

577
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,042
But I don't understand.

578
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:42,420
Why are real people trapped on TV?

579
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,758
The Legends, they're my friends.

580
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,302
And my sisters wanted them dead.

581
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,389
So... I made a deal.

582
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,559
Weave the Legends
into our streaming service,

583
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,812
where they help indoctrinate
the masses and...

584
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:00,856
they could live.

585
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,274
Huh.

586
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,734
I always thought of you
as the punk rock Fate.

587
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:07,988
- I didn't have a choice!
- [Mona] Nobody does here.

588
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,449
But that's how it starts,
and then you get used to it.

589
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,243
Obeying, I mean.

590
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,336
Come on, we have to escape.

591
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,172
What's our course, Captains?

592
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:27,674
Sara, wait. Let's think about this.

593
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,427
What's there to think about?
We have to get back to the real world.

594
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,721
I know, okay? Just...

595
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,389
In the real world, I saw you die.

596
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:35,849
Okay? And it...

597
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,393
It was awful.

598
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,038
And I just keep playing it
over and over again in my head, okay?

599
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:44,357
So... Look, out there, we lost.

600
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,194
But in here, we always win, Sara.

601
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:50,405
Look... You're right.

602
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,532
Okay? And that's why
Charlie did all this.

603
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:57,120
A crew that can't die,
us beating the bad guys every time,

604
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,331
it's what we asked for
back there in the pub.

605
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,669
But it doesn't exist.

606
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,258
Ava, life is beautiful and terrible

607
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,719
all at the same time.

608
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,472
But if we're only living part of it...

609
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,725
then we're not living at all.

610
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,650
Let's get the hell out of here.

611
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,903
Captains, I'm picking up
a strange transmission.

612
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,072
It's from your old enemy, Don.

613
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,075
<i>Captain Lance.</i>

614
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,409
<i>Captain Sharpe.</i>

615
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:39,037
<i>Old friends.</i>

616
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,248
- He looks kinda hot.
- Ugh. Mom.

617
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,750
- What? I'm not dead.
- That's gross.

618
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,419
So, that's where Rory's been?

619
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,007
<i>It was foolish to think
you could escape my wrath.</i>

620
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:54,678
Don's charging his torpedoes.
Should I raise the shields?

621
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:58,431
Hey... You said
that we always win, right?

622
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,810
What if the only way
to get Charlie to set us free is...

623
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,688
We have to lose.

624
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,357
What is she on about?

625
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,192
<i>You left me!</i>

626
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,737
<i>You left her at the center
of a dead planet!</i>

627
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,406
Yeah, just get to the revenge part.

628
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:15,907
<i>As you wish.</i>

629
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:19,702
[pressing button]

630
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,999
Torpedoes incoming.
Should I take evasive maneuvers?

631
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:26,042
Negative, Officer Maala.

632
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,214
What if real people die
in the TV, Clotho?

633
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,924
You have to save them.

634
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,561
Torpedo impact in five,

635
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:50,317
four, three, two... one!

636
00:35:58,575 --> 00:35:59,659
No!

637
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:01,828
- What just happened?
- Did they die?

638
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,375
What did you do?

639
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,255
I canceled their show.

640
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,175
[Mick] <i>You idiots!</i>

641
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:16,843
Have you any idea what you've done?

642
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,762
I loved <i>Star Trip</i> and my hair.

643
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:21,848
- Wait, where are we?
- And where are the others?

644
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,438
Darling.

645
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,191
But before we go in for dinner,

646
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,860
just open one present.

647
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:39,657
What's this?

648
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,285
I overheard you talking
to Lord Behrad earlier.

649
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,204
It's a ticket to London.

650
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,040
I don't understand.

651
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:52,504
I couldn't bear it if you sacrificed
your happiness for my own.

652
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:58,426
But... what about Highcastle Abbey?

653
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,180
Please... Don't make me do this.
I can't say goodbye to you.

654
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,306
Darling...

655
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,017
I'll always be here.

656
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,813
But you have your whole life
ahead of you.

657
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:12,190
Be courageous, my love.

658
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,818
Live it well.

659
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:21,908
Mr. Constantine.

660
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:23,993
Your ladyship.

661
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,042
Is Lady Astra really leaving Highcastle?

662
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,008
Do I have to say it?

663
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,469
Say what, my lady?

664
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,388
You smug bastard.

665
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,349
We can't stay here.

666
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,523
Nat would be proud.

667
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,736
Do it fast before I change my mind.

668
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:09,247
[speaking foreign language]

669
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,542
John, you made it.

670
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:16,045
Yeah, just about. What about the others?

671
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,755
Come on, Z.

672
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,426
You didn't live in a totem for a year
just to get stuck on a TV show.

673
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,888
I can't go back to eating mush again.

674
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,806
Not even blue mush.

675
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,016
[studio audience] Ooh!

676
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,354
Yeah, because no one should eat mush.

677
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,398
[studio audience] Ooh!

678
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,443
It's horrible.

679
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:41,988
And all the colors are deeply unnatural.

680
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:45,658
And it has the texture of wet cement.

681
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,204
[Nate] <i>But, Z,</i>

682
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:52,457
<i>the Fates said we all have to eat mush.</i>

683
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:53,833
<i>You know what, Nate?</i>

684
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:55,960
Screw the Fates.

685
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,754
[studio audience] Ooh!

686
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,676
Those imbeciles can't do this.

687
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,803
They'll inspire an insurrection.

688
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:09,492
- They're gonna get themselves canceled.
- They're gonna get themselves canceled.

689
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,268
For too long,
we've let the Fates rule our lives!

690
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:15,605
I happen to like mush,
but that's not the point!

691
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,817
Stop being so obedient.

692
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,446
Get off your couches
and take control of your lives.

693
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,285
[cheering]

694
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,039
So good to see you.

695
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,628
So nice to see you.

696
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,715
So, hey, that was
pretty crazy back there.

697
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,634
We were, like, engaged.

698
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:46,803
It's a good thing
we're not brainwashed anymore.

699
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:51,307
Great. Out of the TV show,
still in heels.

700
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,102
[Charlie over loudspeaker] <i>You morons!</i>

701
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:56,437
<i>You just couldn't leave it alone,
could you?</i>

702
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,523
I gave you everything that you wanted.

703
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,316
<i>You stuck us on TV!</i>

704
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,278
I brought Sara and Behrad back to life.

705
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,698
Mick, I made you a criminal again!
It's just like you wanted!

706
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,576
I even gave Astra
a happy childhood for you, John-o.

707
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,412
Yeah, bollocks. You just used us
to keep people under control.

708
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,337
[Charlie]
<i>It's better that, than you lot dead.</i>

709
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,834
I still have your life threads.

710
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,837
I can put the shows back on air,
I'll do rewrites.

711
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:26,009
Behrad, you want the old Zari back?
I can do that. Look.

712
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,857
Behrad, is that really you?

713
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,442
You're alive.

714
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,613
- What's happening?
- Yeah, it's like a Zari clone.

715
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:47,864
I totally get it.

716
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:51,868
Oh.

717
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,203
Wait, what? Two sisters?

718
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:57,874
Yeah, this is weird.

719
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,460
Good weird.

720
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:01,961
[speaking foreign language]

721
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,046
It's really you.

722
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:09,344
Charlie, you can't bribe us
into taking the blue pill.

723
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:12,555
I'm not bribing, I'm begging.
My sisters will kill you.

724
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,806
That's for sure.

725
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,683
Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.

726
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,436
Lita's out there somewhere.

727
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,729
I'm not staying here.

728
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:21,773
Let's get out of here.

729
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,566
Yeah, so long, Charlie.

730
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,652
Wait, just accept your fates.

731
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:28,237
Don't walk out that door.

732
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:31,240
On the other hand...

733
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,659
Why not?

734
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,797
They're free!

735
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,257
Then I can't help them anymore.

736
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:55,556
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

737
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,559
<i>They're Tarazis and Nate
Terrific mates</i>

738
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,645
<i>Keep watching because</i>

739
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,272
<i>They've got an ultimatum</i>

740
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,900
<i>And they'll follow it verbatim</i>

741
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:08,319
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

742
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,405
<i>And they're fated to have some fun</i>
