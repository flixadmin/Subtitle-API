1
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,786
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,585
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,123
Open it.

4
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:53,501
Take this.

5
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,165
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:25,162
Yes.

7
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,208
Send up more paking sheets
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,502
I can't get it 'til tomorrow.

9
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,708
OK.

10
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:40,164
I also wanted a needle,
some thread and scissors.

11
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,627
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,255
Yes.

13
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,746
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:29,247
For burn victims,
saving their lives is't enough.

15
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,839
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,210
A face with features...

17
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:39,047
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,666
I have participated in

19
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,245
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,871
carried out in the world...

21
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:50,413
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,870
Good...

23
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:56,536
For a shapeless mass to gain
features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,252
We have to mold the muscles...

25
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,455
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,296
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:57,127
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,124
OPERATING ROOM

29
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,210
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:36,287
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,040
Don't be stupid.

32
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,335
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:46,215
Your skin is softer than I tohught.

34
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,710
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,085
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,330
you would have tried to cut your cervical.

37
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,505
In any case...

38
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:59,917
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:09,874
Here it is...

40
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,710
Taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,381
Thank you.

42
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:29,131
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:33,335
You said that a year ago.

44
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:36,129
I was hasty.

45
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,253
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:47,089
No.

47
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,290
And now?

48
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,540
No.

49
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:57,255
Now!

50
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:58,922
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:01,335
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,454
it for some time.

53
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:05,251
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:08,629
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,042
No.

56
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,253
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:15,712
...malaria, for example.

58
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:19,870
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

59
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:22,834
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:23,918
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:26,004
and the results...

62
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:30,872
...have been spectacular.

63
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,790
This leads me to suppose

64
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,878
that they would be equally positive...

65
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,755
in human mammals.

66
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:42,329
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,041
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:46,378
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:49,297
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:54,373
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:56,213
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,837
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,588
and it smells different.

74
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,338
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,994
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,662
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:10,754
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,464
That isn't enough.

79
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:16,667
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,749
Excuse me.

81
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,044
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,585
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,463
By mutating it.

84
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:29,749
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,498
Transgenesis.

86
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,002
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:39,671
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,459
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,338
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:44,916
You're insane!

91
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,373
You know the application
of transgenetic therepy...

92
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:50,047
with humans it's completely forbidden!

93
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:51,252
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,037
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:58,209
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,587
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:05,454
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,916
You know how many diseases...

99
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,997
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,460
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:12,964
Don't go on!

102
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,169
I know the list by heart...

103
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,126
and I think of it every day.

104
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:20,412
But even so...

105
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:23,872
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

106
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,997
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,671
to the scientific community.

108
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,712
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:33,792
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:39,167
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,752
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,542
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:45,580
I remember...

114
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,588
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,955
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:52,874
And it still is.

117
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:56,372
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,753
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,704
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:07,546
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:10,422
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,121
I don't know.

123
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:16,290
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:19,172
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:15,787
Do you like what you see?

126
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:19,336
What do you mean?

127
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:24,042
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,881
No.

129
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:29,834
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:33,881
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,582
Yes...

132
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:40,295
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,622
And now what?

134
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,840
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,795
and smoke it.

136
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:56,087
I mean us.

137
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,541
Me.

138
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:01,748
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:05,039
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,245
When?

141
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,876
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:12,505
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,128
Live together.

144
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,503
Live together?

145
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:21,880
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:26,132
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:30,377
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,833
Living together as equals.

149
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:34,756
That's it!

150
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:43,922
Here.

151
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,043
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:55,005
I'm yours.

153
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,330
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:01,749
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,998
Did I say that?

156
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,835
I know you look at me.

157
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,207
Since you brought me here,

158
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:15,006
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:22,833
In this pocket.

160
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:06,249
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

161
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:15,459
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:19,045
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:21,668
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,831
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,710
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,119
No.

167
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:32,416
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:36,499
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,832
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:42,330
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:45,338
No! Not this one!

172
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:49,413
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,747
You're sick.

174
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:53,422
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,670
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:22:57,423 --> 00:23:00,126
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,293
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:09,630
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,507
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:23:49,215 --> 00:23:51,005
What do you want?

181
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:55,079
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

182
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:56,412
If she was a servant...

183
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:58,835
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,792
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

185
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,541
<i>My mother is prettier.

186
00:24:04,632 --> 00:24:06,587
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,915
Zeca!

188
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:26,421
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,290
How dare you come here!

190
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:29,833
Open the door!

191
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:35,671
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,498
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:45,380
Little tiger!

194
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,877
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:50,797
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:52,791
Whatever you say.

197
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:57,497
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,964
How did you find us?

199
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:28,172
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,082
He was giving a...

201
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:33,499
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,497
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:36,627
Can't I come in?

204
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:40,004
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,209
It smells good.
I'm hungary.

206
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:46,631
Brute!

207
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:57,962
<i>The main new items today...

208
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:00,797
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...

209
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:04,087
<i>and the daring robbery commited
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

210
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:06,122
<i>in the heart of Madrid.

211
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:07,536
<i>It happened last night...

212
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:10,127
<i>and today we have the first images
recorded by one...

213
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:16,371
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

214
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:19,955
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

215
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:23,538
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

216
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:27,626
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

217
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,005
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,252
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,663
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,334
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:41,296
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:45,292
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:47,664
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:49,214
Hide you here?

225
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:50,370
Not a chance.

226
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:53,334
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:55,414
I know how to hide.

228
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:59,080
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,921
Robert?

230
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:03,039
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,207
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:08,840
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,297
after what you did?

234
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,496
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:18,497
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:21,912
You're raving mad.

237
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:24,752
I'm just a servant.

238
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:27,922
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:30,833
Even better.

240
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,502
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:38,756
Where are you going?

242
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,293
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:47,254
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:14,704
What's this?

245
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,381
It's a film!

246
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:18,249
Go away!

247
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,704
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:47,999
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:50,714
Mom...

250
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:54,249
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:58,877
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,043
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:03,672
How could it be her?

254
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,748
Get out of here!

255
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:07,291
Keep away!

256
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:16,380
Marilia?

257
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,620
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:21,666
Is anything wrong?

259
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:23,712
<i>I heard voices too.

260
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,421
<i>Marilia?

261
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,249
Marilia!

262
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:52,506
There.

263
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:21,794
Who is it?

264
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,879
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:25,797
I can't.

266
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:28,838
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:30,671
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,210
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

269
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,454
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:08,878
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:12,003
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:32:12,507 --> 00:32:14,332
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:16,088
No, where is it?

274
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,502
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:29,252
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:36,623
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:40,703
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,703
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,287
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:54,751
Open your mouth!

281
00:32:56,423 --> 00:33:00,369
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:04,084
It all fit before.

283
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:52,380
Did Robert send you?

284
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:54,661
No.

285
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,336
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:05,131
He saved me.

287
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:08,747
Get me out of here!

288
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,878
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:14,171
You're saying that...

290
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:15,998
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,209
No!

292
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,455
Ask me for anything!

293
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:25,505
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:28,203
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,255
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,586
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:36,505
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:38,964
Great.

299
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:42,168
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:45,997
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,547
Yes.

302
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:51,621
I'll take you with me.

303
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,712
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:59,171
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:03,423
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:09,709
Listen...

307
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:11,413
What?

308
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:13,793
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:17,792
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,962
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:28,380
Don't you like it?

312
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,172
You're hurting me.

313
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,422
It's very big.

314
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:35,297
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,798
Yes...

316
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:39,465
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:44,289
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:36:57,923 --> 00:36:59,582
Kill her!

319
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:02,249
Kill them both!

320
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,087
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:39,664
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,878
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:45,916
Yes.

324
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,208
They're brothers...

325
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:51,336
but they don't know it.

326
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,413
At least I've never told them.

327
00:37:56,465 --> 00:38:00,127
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:06,003
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:11,454
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,961
It's my fault.

331
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:25,706
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:28,923
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:31,335
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:36,497
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,131
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:46,835
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:51,833
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:56,166
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:01,960
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:07,918
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:12,089
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:21,712
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:25,713
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:29,455
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:33,415
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,043
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,793
Their car crashed,

348
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,621
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,289
But she...

350
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:56,585
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,037
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:11,958
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:13,958
He didn't sleep.

354
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,665
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:23,204
covered with gauzes.

356
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:28,002
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:32,381
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:37,415
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:42,252
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:40:42,382 --> 00:40:45,380
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:50,629
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:57,580
One day...

363
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:02,462
whe she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:07,711
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:12,120
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:41:14,465 --> 00:41:17,132
And she got emotional.

367
00:41:18,757 --> 00:41:24,090
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,833
And it was...

369
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:30,956
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,507
When she opened the window...

371
00:42:12,048 --> 00:42:16,089
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:26,916
She didn't look human.

373
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:29,912
She was a cinder.

374
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:36,292
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:38,621
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:54,213
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:58,290
went in search of her mother...

378
00:42:59,548 --> 00:43:03,459
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:43:06,382 --> 00:43:08,538
Through the window.

380
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:51,373
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:52,999
Did you pray?

382
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,337
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:03,420
Shall we go inside?

384
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:44,791
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,505
for tomorrow?

386
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:50,963
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:53,623
As you wish.

388
00:44:57,507 --> 00:44:59,130
But hold me!

389
00:45:06,132 --> 00:45:08,620
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:12,374
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,381
Thank you!

392
00:45:29,882 --> 00:45:32,252
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:41,794
Sleep, my love.

394
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:03,998
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:46:36,215 --> 00:46:38,585
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:41,292
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:46,334
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:46:46,465 --> 00:46:48,870
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:58,499
Your daughter is getting on well
with my neices.

400
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:00,957
She seems much better...

401
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:03,834
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:07,540
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:10,962
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:26,374
To you!

405
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:20,334
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:48:20,382 --> 00:48:22,005
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:35,958
Excuse me.

408
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:46,957
Norma!

409
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,631
Norma!

410
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:50,790
Norma!

411
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,630
Norma!

412
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:54,374
Norma!

413
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,038
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:51:02,965 --> 00:51:05,454
There, there!

415
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:14,745
What about this one?

416
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,037
Yes, but...

417
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,293
no.

418
00:52:17,423 --> 00:52:18,537
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:20,836
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:52:20,923 --> 00:52:23,377
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:52:23,465 --> 00:52:25,954
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,583
Not stripes either.

423
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:29,089
No stripes.

424
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:41,839
Something graphic?

425
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:44,584
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:46,587
I'll come back another day.

427
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:49,790
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:54,835
Cristina...

429
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,831
Here. On the house.

430
00:52:57,923 --> 00:52:59,831
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:52:59,965 --> 00:53:01,506
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:04,244
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,956
It'll look great on you.

434
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,081
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:53:11,215 --> 00:53:12,921
You're so mistaken!

436
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:14,914
Because I don't like men?

437
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:17,294
Because you don't like me.

438
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:19,541
In any case...

439
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:23,372
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:25,544
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:53:28,715 --> 00:53:30,789
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,131
I'm off.

443
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,964
Where to?

444
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,464
Home, to get changed.

445
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:37,792
How come?

446
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,412
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,042
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:53:42,257 --> 00:53:43,287
Were you invited?

449
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:45,456
Jorge knows one of the neices.

450
00:53:45,548 --> 00:53:47,290
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:50,579
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,996
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:53:54,923 --> 00:53:56,251
Good afternoon.

454
00:53:56,423 --> 00:53:57,881
Hello.

455
00:53:59,215 --> 00:54:01,336
My wife has left us...

456
00:54:01,423 --> 00:54:03,959
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:07,003
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:54:08,548 --> 00:54:09,922
Well...

459
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:12,336
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:18,546
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,290
They're very nice.

462
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,622
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:54:22,757 --> 00:54:26,336
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:54:26,382 --> 00:54:27,330
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:54:27,423 --> 00:54:28,833
It certainly is.

466
00:54:28,923 --> 00:54:30,297
But...

467
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:33,002
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,170
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:54:35,257 --> 00:54:38,255
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,046
So the next time she does it...

471
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:43,213
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:31,912
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:55:32,007 --> 00:55:34,756
What a party!

474
00:55:34,882 --> 00:55:36,339
Fresh air!

475
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,123
You're all stoners!

476
00:55:44,298 --> 00:55:46,005
I'm Vicente.

477
00:55:46,882 --> 00:55:48,458
I'm Norma.

478
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,380
Your friends have gone.

479
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,877
All the better, right?

480
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:12,541
Are you stoned?

481
00:56:13,257 --> 00:56:14,666
Stoned?

482
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:17,129
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,630
Yes.

484
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:22,247
Cipralex 20...

485
00:56:23,215 --> 00:56:26,047
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,414
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:56:29,507 --> 00:56:31,165
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:56:31,548 --> 00:56:34,002
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:56:34,132 --> 00:56:35,411
Shit!

490
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:37,504
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:38,959
High?

492
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,833
Yes.

493
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,747
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:49,956
No. Are you?

495
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:52,876
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:57:11,923 --> 00:57:14,708
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:57:20,632 --> 00:57:22,208
And this jacket!

498
00:57:23,715 --> 00:57:27,626
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:31,829
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,369
Wait.

501
00:57:36,382 --> 00:57:38,088
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:58:18,382 --> 00:58:20,123
You're so pretty...

503
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:23,547
and different.

504
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:27,421
I'm different too.

505
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:29,872
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:58:31,673 --> 00:58:32,752
No.

507
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,878
Do you think I should be?

508
00:58:34,965 --> 00:58:36,374
I don't know.

509
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:40,580
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:58:40,757 --> 00:58:42,084
"I Need To Love".

511
00:58:42,173 --> 00:58:44,129
This is also for the bride...

512
00:58:44,257 --> 00:58:45,998
with all my affection.

513
00:59:45,507 --> 00:59:50,792
No!

514
00:59:55,673 --> 00:59:57,711
Shut up!

515
01:00:00,173 --> 01:00:02,330
Stop!

516
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:38,172
Cristina...

517
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:41,545
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,214
Yes...

519
01:01:43,298 --> 01:01:45,088
but where are you going?

520
01:01:45,173 --> 01:01:48,124
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
01:01:48,298 --> 01:01:49,874
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:51,416
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,130
Then it's because of that.

524
01:01:53,882 --> 01:01:56,003
So should I take it or not?

525
01:01:56,048 --> 01:01:57,589
It's best not to.

526
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,047
I'm going out.

527
01:02:01,507 --> 01:02:03,414
Now? Without finishing it?

528
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:04,413
Yes.

529
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,708
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
01:02:09,798 --> 01:02:12,501
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
01:02:12,548 --> 01:02:15,582
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,878
Are you leaving that mess?

533
01:02:18,923 --> 01:02:21,377
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:18,957
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:01,505
Son of a bitch!

536
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:04,829
Bastard!

537
01:04:13,007 --> 01:04:14,547
Are you crazy?

538
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:17,962
Don't shoot!

539
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:16,128
Help!

540
01:06:20,298 --> 01:06:21,791
<i>Help!

541
01:06:34,132 --> 01:06:35,541
Come in.

542
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:38,834
Sit down, please.

543
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:42,208
Thank you.

544
01:06:44,257 --> 01:06:46,247
I was told there's news.

545
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:51,832
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:06:53,507 --> 01:06:55,083
And the body?

547
01:06:55,507 --> 01:06:56,834
Nothing.

548
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,496
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:05,880
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,796
My son is alive.

551
01:07:10,465 --> 01:07:13,629
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:07:13,673 --> 01:07:15,296
but my son?

553
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:19,287
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:07:21,965 --> 01:07:25,331
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:07:25,423 --> 01:07:27,379
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:07:27,465 --> 01:07:31,506
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,161
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:39,540
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:07:39,632 --> 01:07:42,832
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:44,623
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:46,001
Cristina heard him.

562
01:07:46,173 --> 01:07:49,621
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:08:06,923 --> 01:08:08,879
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:08:23,507 --> 01:08:27,204
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:32,331
Norma...

566
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:35,245
Sweetheart...

567
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:36,542
Sweetheart...

568
01:08:36,632 --> 01:08:39,583
I won't touch you.

569
01:08:41,882 --> 01:08:43,458
Where are you going?

570
01:08:50,382 --> 01:08:52,088
Where are you going?

571
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:02,122
Norma, love.

572
01:09:06,632 --> 01:09:07,710
Everything OK?

573
01:09:07,757 --> 01:09:10,162
Yes.

574
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:16,540
It's me, Norma.

575
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:18,955
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:23,131
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:09:23,215 --> 01:09:24,708
We tried...

578
01:09:25,257 --> 01:09:28,373
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,123
She rips it off.

580
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:35,999
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:40,414
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,664
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:09:42,757 --> 01:09:45,790
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:09:45,923 --> 01:09:47,297
I just found her lying there!

585
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:49,752
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,589
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:09:53,673 --> 01:09:54,953
Maybe...

588
01:09:55,048 --> 01:09:57,916
we let her out too soon.

589
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,709
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:10:00,757 --> 01:10:03,376
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:10:03,507 --> 01:10:04,537
How could I know...

592
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:07,541
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:11:33,548 --> 01:11:38,419
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:41,421
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:46,169
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,380
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:11:48,465 --> 01:11:51,582
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:11:51,715 --> 01:11:54,796
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:11:55,757 --> 01:11:58,541
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:12:09,965 --> 01:12:11,339
Turn around!

601
01:12:42,298 --> 01:12:44,834
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:48,247
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:12:49,257 --> 01:12:51,378
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:13:28,632 --> 01:13:30,124
Eat.

605
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:32,958
Thank you!

606
01:13:38,965 --> 01:13:41,205
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:13:42,048 --> 01:13:44,502
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:13:47,382 --> 01:13:50,582
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:13:54,632 --> 01:13:56,788
Please, don't go!

610
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,003
We have to talk.

611
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:28,422
My condolences.

612
01:14:31,923 --> 01:14:33,914
We did what we could.

613
01:14:34,215 --> 01:14:36,704
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,712
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:14:38,798 --> 01:14:40,421
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:14:40,465 --> 01:14:43,214
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:14:46,923 --> 01:14:48,748
You really want to work today?

618
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,002
Yes.

619
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:53,248
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,421
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:14:56,507 --> 01:14:58,995
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:15:17,132 --> 01:15:19,122
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,370
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:15:32,298 --> 01:15:34,372
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:15:40,465 --> 01:15:42,207
Why do you say that?

626
01:15:43,798 --> 01:15:45,706
The toys...

627
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:47,540
My daughter is dead.

628
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,911
We buried her today.

629
01:15:54,507 --> 01:15:56,414
I'm sorry.

630
01:16:05,507 --> 01:16:08,173
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:12,919
Why did you shave me?

632
01:16:13,382 --> 01:16:15,372
That's a good question.

633
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:09,793
Yes?

634
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,214
<i>It's us.

635
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,749
I'll let you in.

636
01:17:31,882 --> 01:17:33,458
If he says we're late,

637
01:17:33,507 --> 01:17:35,746
say there were two
accidents on the road

638
01:17:36,007 --> 01:17:37,879
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:42,963
Good evening.

640
01:17:43,048 --> 01:17:44,376
You're late.

641
01:17:44,548 --> 01:17:46,373
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:17:46,798 --> 01:17:49,465
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:17:49,548 --> 01:17:51,871
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:56,256
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:18:37,048 --> 01:18:40,544
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,046
He isn't.

647
01:18:43,798 --> 01:18:46,962
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,088
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,545
What's happened?

650
01:19:32,173 --> 01:19:34,129
What did you do to me?

651
01:19:34,798 --> 01:19:37,038
A vaginoplasty

652
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,212
No...

653
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:37,709
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:20:37,798 --> 01:20:39,421
It's very important.

655
01:20:41,757 --> 01:20:45,087
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:50,039
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:20:50,132 --> 01:20:53,295
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:54,828
You...

659
01:20:56,132 --> 01:20:58,964
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:20:59,048 --> 01:21:02,414
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:21:03,548 --> 01:21:08,170
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:21:08,257 --> 01:21:10,627
that you breathe through it.

663
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,714
In this case...

664
01:21:15,298 --> 01:21:18,498
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:25,380
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:21:27,715 --> 01:21:29,955
It will hurt at first...

667
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:33,334
but in a few months...

668
01:21:33,465 --> 01:21:36,546
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:21:36,673 --> 01:21:38,380
and the skin...

670
01:21:38,548 --> 01:21:42,624
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:54,705
This is very good.

672
01:21:56,507 --> 01:21:58,960
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:00,707
Four weeks.

674
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,589
Can I go now?

675
01:22:03,007 --> 01:22:05,578
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,045
But we've just started.

677
01:22:22,965 --> 01:22:24,920
What else are you going to do?

678
01:22:26,965 --> 01:22:29,584
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:22:31,757 --> 01:22:34,043
Why are you doing this?

680
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,459
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:48,167
In that spectacular house?

682
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:53,791
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:22:55,382 --> 01:22:57,419
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:22:57,465 --> 01:23:01,790
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:23:02,757 --> 01:23:07,628
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:23:07,673 --> 01:23:12,212
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:23:12,298 --> 01:23:14,088
What are you going to do now?

688
01:23:35,132 --> 01:23:38,912
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:23:42,757 --> 01:23:46,205
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:23:46,298 --> 01:23:50,506
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:02,208
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,293
There's still work to do.

693
01:24:06,382 --> 01:24:10,838
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:18,331
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:24:18,423 --> 01:24:21,754
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:24:22,423 --> 01:24:26,713
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:24:28,007 --> 01:24:29,499
like a second skin.

698
01:24:30,923 --> 01:24:32,464
Put it on.

699
01:25:17,965 --> 01:25:20,252
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:25:40,715 --> 01:25:42,042
Bitch!

701
01:26:30,673 --> 01:26:32,047
Stop!

702
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,829
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:26:37,965 --> 01:26:39,671
Stay where you are!

704
01:26:55,548 --> 01:26:57,373
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:26:57,423 --> 01:26:59,497
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:02,415
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:27:37,423 --> 01:27:39,213
We were lucky.

708
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:42,755
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:28:26,673 --> 01:28:29,458
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:28:32,465 --> 01:28:36,790
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:30:23,923 --> 01:30:26,329
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:30:26,423 --> 01:30:28,829
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,582
Do what you want with them.

714
01:30:53,382 --> 01:30:55,953
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...

715
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:58,874
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.

716
01:31:19,465 --> 01:31:22,665
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...

717
01:31:23,132 --> 01:31:25,916
<i>a place inside you...

718
01:31:26,007 --> 01:31:27,796
<i>a place to which...

719
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:30,205
<i>no one else has access...

720
01:31:30,257 --> 01:31:32,923
<i>a place that no one can destroy.

721
01:31:33,465 --> 01:31:35,752
<i>To access that place there is yoga...

722
01:31:36,007 --> 01:31:38,921
<i>an ancient technique.

723
01:31:39,798 --> 01:31:43,294
<i>It's a flace where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

724
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,963
<i>freedom.

725
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:46,796
<i>But you must practice it...

726
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:49,501
<i>continuously, intensely...

727
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:53,915
<i>and then you'll achieve it.

728
01:31:54,382 --> 01:31:56,372
YOGA BOOKS

729
01:32:57,715 --> 01:32:59,622
My Cigarral!

730
01:33:00,465 --> 01:33:02,372
I missed it so much!

731
01:33:03,923 --> 01:33:06,626
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:33:06,757 --> 01:33:10,454
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:33:11,007 --> 01:33:13,673
I tohught you'd forgotten me.

734
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:16,213
I thought that...

735
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:19,629
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:33:20,173 --> 01:33:22,330
My poor child.

737
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:24,664
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:33:24,798 --> 01:33:27,204
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:33:27,882 --> 01:33:29,754
As you wish.

740
01:33:30,757 --> 01:33:33,162
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:33:35,007 --> 01:33:36,962
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:33:37,382 --> 01:33:38,791
I'm parched.

743
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,795
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:48,913
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:33:49,132 --> 01:33:52,663
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:33:53,007 --> 01:33:55,377
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:33:55,507 --> 01:33:59,796
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:33:59,923 --> 01:34:01,713
I'll explain.

749
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:05,079
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:34:05,173 --> 01:34:09,084
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:15,084
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,546
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:40,710
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:34:40,757 --> 01:34:42,297
I like the uniform...

755
01:34:42,423 --> 01:34:45,042
because it means we're together again.

756
01:34:52,965 --> 01:34:54,458
Who is she?

757
01:34:55,715 --> 01:34:57,836
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:34:58,632 --> 01:35:00,373
What's she doing?

759
01:35:01,257 --> 01:35:02,963
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:05,377
I can see that.

761
01:35:07,132 --> 01:35:08,957
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:35:11,382 --> 01:35:13,586
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:35:13,715 --> 01:35:16,499
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:35:16,882 --> 01:35:19,833
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:24,458
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

766
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:29,415
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:32,543
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:35:32,673 --> 01:35:36,335
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:35:36,465 --> 01:35:40,672
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:35:51,882 --> 01:35:55,330
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:36:07,673 --> 01:36:10,376
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,580
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:36:30,215 --> 01:36:32,999
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:36:35,298 --> 01:36:37,917
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:39,838
I don't trust you.

776
01:36:40,173 --> 01:36:43,373
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:46,214
Pass me the tray.

778
01:36:46,298 --> 01:36:49,332
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,329
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:36:57,715 --> 01:36:59,208
Thank you.

781
01:38:01,757 --> 01:38:03,498
Good morning.

782
01:38:09,298 --> 01:38:11,005
Breakfast.

783
01:38:14,507 --> 01:38:16,296
Thank you.

784
01:38:26,215 --> 01:38:28,087
Where's Marilia?

785
01:38:28,257 --> 01:38:30,294
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:34,670
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:38:45,173 --> 01:38:46,832
Last night...

788
01:38:47,673 --> 01:38:49,545
before we went to bed...

789
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:52,588
we talked alot and we made a promise.

790
01:38:54,132 --> 01:38:57,414
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:38:59,382 --> 01:39:02,498
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:39:03,298 --> 01:39:05,917
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:09,211
that I was free.

794
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,373
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:39:15,632 --> 01:39:17,587
Don't let me down.

796
01:39:18,173 --> 01:39:20,627
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:39:21,257 --> 01:39:23,496
Your promise and mine.

798
01:39:32,882 --> 01:39:35,631
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:39:36,757 --> 01:39:40,205
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:39:40,298 --> 01:39:42,040
She promised not to.

801
01:39:42,132 --> 01:39:45,379
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:39:45,923 --> 01:39:49,752
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:39:49,798 --> 01:39:51,374
That's enough!

804
01:39:54,423 --> 01:39:56,663
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:00,588
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:40:01,048 --> 01:40:04,496
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:40:04,673 --> 01:40:06,249
Thank you.

808
01:40:22,257 --> 01:40:23,915
Come along, child!

809
01:40:30,382 --> 01:40:32,419
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:40:32,965 --> 01:40:36,247
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:40:38,007 --> 01:40:41,372
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:43,581
I told you on the phone.

813
01:40:44,465 --> 01:40:46,088
After talking to the president...

814
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:49,669
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:40:51,423 --> 01:40:54,338
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:40:54,423 --> 01:40:56,046
It's not just that.

817
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:00,120
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,419
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:41:05,507 --> 01:41:08,339
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:41:08,465 --> 01:41:11,297
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,836
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:41:18,673 --> 01:41:21,209
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:25,504
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:41:58,757 --> 01:42:00,747
Are you still here?

825
01:42:02,132 --> 01:42:03,376
I'm leaving now...

826
01:42:03,507 --> 01:42:07,168
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:42:11,465 --> 01:42:13,171
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:42:13,298 --> 01:42:15,455
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:42:16,215 --> 01:42:19,830
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:42:20,048 --> 01:42:21,162
as you can see.

831
01:42:21,298 --> 01:42:22,839
And?

832
01:42:23,548 --> 01:42:25,954
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:42:26,215 --> 01:42:28,005
without hormones.

834
01:42:28,132 --> 01:42:30,122
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:42:30,632 --> 01:42:34,044
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:42:34,173 --> 01:42:37,669
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:42:42,048 --> 01:42:45,663
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:42:45,757 --> 01:42:47,913
Don't go there.

839
01:42:48,048 --> 01:42:50,454
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

840
01:42:50,882 --> 01:42:51,830
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:42:51,923 --> 01:42:54,672
we accepted false documents.

842
01:42:54,798 --> 01:42:57,417
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:42:57,465 --> 01:43:00,380
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:43:01,048 --> 01:43:05,089
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:43:05,173 --> 01:43:07,413
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:43:07,715 --> 01:43:08,829
You told us...

847
01:43:08,923 --> 01:43:11,542
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

848
01:43:11,632 --> 01:43:13,421
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:43:13,507 --> 01:43:16,837
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:43:16,923 --> 01:43:18,795
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:43:19,132 --> 01:43:23,042
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:43:23,132 --> 01:43:25,087
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:43:25,173 --> 01:43:27,211
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:43:27,257 --> 01:43:29,876
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:43:32,215 --> 01:43:34,751
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:43:38,048 --> 01:43:40,916
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:46,162
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:43:49,548 --> 01:43:50,496
And...

859
01:43:50,590 --> 01:43:52,545
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:43:53,923 --> 01:43:55,665
A cream?

861
01:43:57,923 --> 01:44:00,590
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,704
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:44:06,048 --> 01:44:07,671
Vera Cruz!

864
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:11,626
And I was always a woman!

865
01:44:33,715 --> 01:44:35,291
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:44:44,965 --> 01:44:46,707
Thank you.

867
01:44:47,007 --> 01:44:49,791
No, I thank you.

868
01:45:16,715 --> 01:45:18,457
Does it still hurt?

869
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:20,166
Yes.

870
01:45:22,257 --> 01:45:24,247
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:45:25,465 --> 01:45:27,752
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:45:28,548 --> 01:45:30,290
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:45:30,382 --> 01:45:32,538
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:35,126
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:45:50,132 --> 01:45:52,288
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:45:52,423 --> 01:45:53,585
but I can't find it.

877
01:45:53,673 --> 01:45:56,244
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:45:56,423 --> 01:45:59,540
I'll go and get it.

879
01:46:33,173 --> 01:46:36,420
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:51,671
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:46:54,173 --> 01:46:55,666
Not yet.

882
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:02,964
Come on...

883
01:47:04,798 --> 01:47:06,421
What are you doing?

884
01:47:09,048 --> 01:47:10,873
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,998
This is a joke, right?

886
01:47:13,882 --> 01:47:15,623
Call it what you want.

887
01:47:17,132 --> 01:47:19,087
But you promised!

888
01:47:19,215 --> 01:47:21,087
I lied.

889
01:48:00,465 --> 01:48:01,922
Robert?

890
01:48:03,882 --> 01:48:05,339
Robert?

891
01:48:05,465 --> 01:48:07,006
He's asleep.

892
01:48:08,298 --> 01:48:10,040
I heard a noise.

893
01:48:10,298 --> 01:48:11,839
Yes, so did I.

894
01:48:12,215 --> 01:48:14,999
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:48:21,673 --> 01:48:23,249
Robert!

896
01:48:24,173 --> 01:48:25,832
My son!

897
01:48:36,882 --> 01:48:40,164
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:43,915
Where are you?

899
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:01,128
I knew it.

900
01:51:00,298 --> 01:51:01,921
Hello.

901
01:51:11,715 --> 01:51:13,706
You see to her.

902
01:51:15,923 --> 01:51:17,499
Good morning.

903
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:32,165
What did you want?

904
01:51:34,048 --> 01:51:36,086
Is anything wrong?

905
01:51:37,173 --> 01:51:39,247
Are you all right?

906
01:51:43,090 --> 01:51:45,839
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:51:47,923 --> 01:51:49,879
Do you know me?

908
01:51:50,715 --> 01:51:54,543
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:59,086
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:52:01,507 --> 01:52:04,588
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:52:06,632 --> 01:52:08,788
You have to help me.

912
01:52:13,715 --> 01:52:15,421
Look.

913
01:52:16,132 --> 01:52:18,169
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:52:20,465 --> 01:52:24,541
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:52:24,882 --> 01:52:27,003
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:52:27,423 --> 01:52:29,959
just to see how it looked.

917
01:52:30,048 --> 01:52:34,421
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:52:36,465 --> 01:52:41,288
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:52:48,548 --> 01:52:50,622
Is anything wrong?

920
01:52:52,798 --> 01:52:55,252
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:53:08,507 --> 01:53:11,209
Why are you crying?

922
01:53:22,382 --> 01:53:24,752
I'm Vicente.

923
01:55:22,382 --> 01:57:24,752
