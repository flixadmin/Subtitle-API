1
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:16,725
Dad?

2
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:20,854
Nora?

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,650
How are you...

4
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,779
Don't worry, Dad.
I know we've been through a lot,

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,490
but everything's gonna work out
like it's supposed to.

6
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,573
I promise.

7
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,034
It's really you.

8
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:34,494
I love you.

9
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:35,745
I love you, too.

10
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:38,081
We've missed you so much.

11
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,274
Iris, hey.

12
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,194
This is gonna sound crazy, but...

13
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,532
I think we're pregnant.

14
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,763
This must be why
you're feeling so sick. You know?

15
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:40,602
And since meta-DNA signatures
can misrepresent hCG levels,

16
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:41,686
I gotta...

17
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,897
Hey, do you know where my keys are?

18
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,526
I gotta drive these samples
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

19
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,655
Otherwise, the chemical integrity
could be compromised.

20
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,240
Of course. Right here.

21
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:56,284
I'll call you
as soon as I know the test results.

22
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,331
- Cecile. Hey, what are you doing here?
- Oh, hey.

23
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,751
I have a file that Iris needed
for the Kord case. Is she in?

24
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,838
No, she is... at work already.

25
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,215
Isn't that her work computer
right there?

26
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:14,884
Yes, it is.

27
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:18,806
But she's been more of a pen and
paper kind of reporter lately.

28
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,266
You know, old-school.

29
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:21,934
You're feeling very nervous.

30
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:23,770
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

31
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,397
You're feeling nervous and excited.

32
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,150
Ecstatic, even.

33
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:30,985
Barry, what's going on?

34
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,570
I'm just running late for work.

35
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,090
It makes me kind of nervous and ecstatic
'cause I love my job.

36
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,617
So... And I'll make sure she gets this,
and I'll see you later.

37
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,886
Hey, I thought
we were having lunch today.

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,411
- Us?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,789
Oh, uh...
Our monthly Tuesday lunch date.

40
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:43,915
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,125
No, I'm really looking forward to that.
As always.

42
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,921
This is just a bag of protein bars.

43
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:53,591
Speedster metabolism.
I'm always hungry. So...

44
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:56,469
- See you later. Bye.
- Okay, I...

45
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,520
<i>Clink your glasses
Melt the eyes like ice</i>

46
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,730
<i>Raise your glasses
Melt the thighs like ice</i>

47
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:08,981
<i>Clink your glasses
Hot flashes</i>

48
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:10,065
<i>You weren't ready for it to...</i>

49
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:13,612
Girl, you getting your art mojo on.
I can dig it.

50
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,656
Ooh. Okay, well, my bad.

51
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,450
I did not mean to disturb
the artist at work,

52
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,577
but a friend of yours
is out and about.

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Who, Mark?

54
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,623
Yeah, and I just figured
it was something you should see.

55
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,000
Why? What do you know?

56
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,378
Caity told you everything, didn't she?

57
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,840
No, I just remembered you two fought
at that bar the night you got arrested.

58
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,217
Yeah, and again
the night of the Force Storm.

59
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,013
Well, says here that he handed in
state's evidence and got parole.

60
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,558
So maybe he's turning
over a new leaf.

61
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,977
Like Captain Cold.

62
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,354
Uh-uh. I don't buy it. Not for a second.

63
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,690
I'm just waiting
till he shows his true colors,

64
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,359
and then I'm gonna kick his butt
right back to Iron Heights.

65
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,363
Sounds kind of like
you're gonna stalk him or something.

66
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:00,533
You know, like watch his every step.
That would be crazy.

67
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,577
Great idea, Chester.

68
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,623
Wait, what?
No, I said that sounds like it's crazy.

69
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,001
I said "crazy," right?

70
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,463
You're a damn good detective.

71
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:17,800
You dug up more on Operation Griffin
in one week than I did in years.

72
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,510
And I hit the same dead end.

73
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:23,014
So, the last we saw your perp,
Warrant Officer Adam Creyke,

74
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:27,560
was on a security camera
stealing five M18 Claymore mines

75
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,562
from the barracks armory.

76
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,064
Which he used to eliminate my unit.

77
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,524
One thing I don't get...

78
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:38,529
The explosive output and close proximity
of five Claymores?

79
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,031
That would have been lethal.

80
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,657
Creyke would've known that.

81
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,577
How did you survive?

82
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,414
Honestly, I have asked myself
that same question over and over.

83
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,709
Well, what exactly do you remember
about the attack?

84
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,420
Fragments.

85
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,051
Just screams, mostly.

86
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,137
The heat of the explosion.

87
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,140
Adam's eyes.

88
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,311
Somehow I could tell
he knew he'd survive.

89
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,689
Thanks to whatever
his damn meta ability is.

90
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:17,276
Creyke was like
a brother to you. What...

91
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:18,777
What drove him?

92
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,864
Adam and I are both
Wet'suwet'en First Nations.

93
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,826
Adam loved open waters.

94
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,578
He wanted to join the Navy

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,664
but followed me into the Army.

96
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,543
Said he didn't trust anyone else
to look out for me.

97
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,713
I had an uncle who used to take me
fishing every summer on a schooner.

98
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,550
Sailors take naming their vessels

99
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,802
as seriously as they
name their firstborn.

100
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,345
Did Adam have a callsign?

101
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,639
- Yeah. Rasputin.
- Rasputin.

102
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,688
Yo. A schooner named <i>Rasputin</i>
is registered in Midway City

103
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:57,275
six weeks after Operation Griffin.

104
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,902
He's been a few hours away
this whole time.

105
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,406
There's no way in hell
I'm letting him get away again.

106
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,075
Kramer.

107
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,758
What are you gonna do when you find him?

108
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,789
This has to be about justice.

109
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:15,543
If this is gonna be about vengeance,
you can do this by yourself.

110
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:25,802
Lead the way.

111
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:27,826
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

112
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,223
Did you drive here?

113
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,516
What's up, party person?

114
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,893
Yo!

115
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,938
So, why's the Flash driving a car?

116
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,902
Oh, wait, do you have a Flashmobile?

117
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,864
No. It just isn't safe
to zoop these samples.

118
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,281
Samples for what?

119
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,953
Blood and urine.

120
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:36,457
For my annual physical with Caitlin.
Who's my GP.

121
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:41,212
Right. Isn't it kind of weird
to have a teammate as your doctor?

122
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,130
No.

123
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,050
I mean, it was at first,
but it's cool now.

124
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,010
I should get to the med lab.

125
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:52,056
Hey, good luck, 'cause Caitlin's in
there running a medical consult with...

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Ultraviolet.

127
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,298
- Oh.
- I guess she accidentally

128
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:56,978
double-booked your appointments.

129
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:58,728
Yeah.

130
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:01,565
- Catch you later.
- Not if I catch you first.

131
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,669
- I get it. 'Cause you're fast, right?
- Yep.

132
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:04,860
- Yeah.
- That's... Yeah.

133
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,698
Iris, Caitlin's in the med lab,

134
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,992
and we don't want anyone to know yet
until we're sure.

135
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,410
Yeah, you're right.

136
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,011
My lab at C.C.P.D. has everything I need

137
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,706
to create a neutralizing
meta-gene variant

138
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,749
that'll track your hCG levels.

139
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,376
All right, Thanks. Love you, too. Bye.

140
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,421
What did they do to me?

141
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,802
Black Hole introduced
a deliberate irregularity

142
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,904
into your vascular system.

143
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,638
One that creates a 40% decrease

144
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:35,182
in your body's ability
to maintain oxygen intake.

145
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,728
They made it so the mask
keeps her alive to ensure her loyalty.

146
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,522
Actually, the mask is hiding
the real damage.

147
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,150
Implantation circuitry
grafted to your vocal cords.

148
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,483
Okay.

149
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:46,819
How do we help my cousin?

150
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,822
So, the software in the chip requires
regular software updates,

151
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,198
just like your smartphone.

152
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,076
But no Black Hole means
no more software updates.

153
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,705
So, pretty soon it'll stop working,
and I won't be able to repair it.

154
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,545
Caitlin thinks she has
a way to fix this. Permanently.

155
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,423
Right. It's risky,
but I think I can repair the damage.

156
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,134
It doesn't matter. I won't do it.

157
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,264
I'll leave you two alone.

158
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,946
Esperanza.
Why won't you let Caitlin operate?

159
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,783
Will you trust me?

160
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,326
I know this team.

161
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,246
I've fought with them,
suffered losses alongside them.

162
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,832
They're good people.

163
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,502
So, if Caitlin thinks
she can help you, let her.

164
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,825
I don't need help.

165
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,423
Unlike you, I don't fear dying.

166
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,764
Maybe so.

167
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,664
Look, I get it.

168
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,690
Surgery is how this nightmare
started for you.

169
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,192
But Caitlin isn't Black Hole.

170
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,946
It's my life, not yours.

171
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,240
Then why am I the only one
who gives a damn about it?

172
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,868
Don't you get it?
This isn't about saving Ultraviolet.

173
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,830
It's about saving Esperanza Garcia.

174
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,790
<i>Mi familia.</i>

175
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,103
You boys really know how to throw
a welcome home party.

176
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:48,566
Yeah, well, the only rats welcome here
are the ones in the kitchen.

177
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,277
That's funny
coming from you, punk.

178
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:53,278
Leave.

179
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,910
Now.

180
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Snowflake.

181
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,398
As always,

182
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,276
you have perfect timing.

183
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,777
So what happened?

184
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,738
Came to ask your old boss
for your job back?

185
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,698
- Didn't go so well?
- That...

186
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,078
plus something about,
"snitches get stitches."

187
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,665
Ah. No one's buying this whole
"turned over a new leaf" crap.

188
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,791
Look...

189
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,546
You ready for that dinner date yet?

190
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,715
I mean...

191
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,220
I should probably be a gentleman
and change first.

192
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,346
Whoa, whoa.

193
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,932
Come on.
I'm taking you to Danville General.

194
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,015
No.

195
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,411
They're probably still pretty upset
about the CAT scan machine

196
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,978
that I sabotaged a few years back.

197
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:09,980
Okay, fine. Leawood Med, then.

198
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:11,774
I kinda blew up their bio-chem lab.

199
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,734
Okay, um...

200
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:17,905
Fine. There is a shady vet
down on Fairview. He won't ask...

201
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,242
Dr. Haley.
Yeah, I love that guy.

202
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,953
He's wanted to kill me
ever since Tijuana, though.

203
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,664
It's actually a really funny story
for some other time.

204
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,334
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

205
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,630
I will take you to S.T.A.R. Labs
and have Caity fix you.

206
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,343
But if you step out of line,
I will let you bleed out.

207
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,264
I wouldn't expect anything less.

208
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Is that urine?

209
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:59,822
Hey. Um... Is it lunch already, or...

210
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,156
Yes, and I'm starving.

211
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,450
Please tell me you're not still
the middle of something.

212
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,618
No. Um...

213
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:09,623
Yeah, I'm just waiting to see if this
chemical compound reacts and turns blue.

214
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,333
Oh. Cool.

215
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,417
What does blue mean?

216
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,884
- Barry.
- Cecile.

217
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,386
Are you and Iris...

218
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,180
No. No, no, no, we're not...

219
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,030
You all right?

220
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,542
It was Godspeed?
He must have broken out of Iron Heights.

221
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,961
Either that, or there's another clone
in Central City.

222
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,045
Great.

223
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,048
But why would they attack downtown?

224
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,841
I thought they wanted
to steal your speed.

225
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,009
The last one did.

226
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,886
When Rathaway and I took him down,

227
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,305
he said whoever sent him
wants infinite velocity.

228
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,515
Well, now it looks like
he wants infinite chaos.

229
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,642
Oh, man.

230
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,771
I just picked up
two different reports in progress.

231
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,648
One has Godspeed causing
a multi-car collision near City Hall.

232
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,293
And the other one has him
at a gas station,

233
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,317
like, three miles away.

234
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,861
Man, he's fast.

235
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,544
Even you can't be in two places at once.

236
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,240
Neither can he. There's two of them.

237
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,678
- Frost, if I run you downtown...
- I'm already ahead of you.

238
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,763
All right, I'm gonna take
the gas station.

239
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:30,787
Wait.

240
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,539
Where'd they go?

241
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,668
Satellites aren't picking up anything.
They're just gone.

242
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,922
Okay, maybe Iris
can rally Team Citizen.

243
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,173
They can canvass the sites,

244
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,976
- find out what they were looking for.
- No.

245
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,011
What I mean is, there's two of them.

246
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,263
So that means
they have the advantage now.

247
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:52,935
So anybody that's not a speedster
should stay put where it's safe.

248
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,187
And since Iris is already
home sick anyway,

249
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,106
so she's already in
the safest place possible.

250
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,399
Okay.

251
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,817
What are we supposed to do?

252
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,777
I've been thinking about that.

253
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,195
A cryptographic algorithm.

254
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,156
Might help us decode their modem-speak
and figure out why they're back.

255
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,492
All right. Do it. Yeah.
I'm gonna search the city.

256
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,205
So, here's a question.

257
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,666
Confidentially speaking, I mean...

258
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,918
what is your sister into?

259
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,547
Is it horror movies, Westerns,
single malt, blended...

260
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,465
<i>"Cardigan"</i> or <i>"Blinding Lights"?</i> Go.

261
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,592
- Confidentially speaking...
- Uh-huh.

262
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,139
You can't handle her.

263
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,016
Rest up.

264
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,022
Hey, what's with our sonic booms?

265
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,276
Oh... Don't mind me.

266
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:47,239
Let's play a guessing game, shall we?

267
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,784
Let's see, a sonic boom
at ground level...

268
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,496
And with this being Central City,
aka meta heaven,

269
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,665
I am guessing a speedster's behind it.

270
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,002
And since there's been one, two...
That's math.

271
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,295
Five Godspeeds

272
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,256
running around Central City
in the last year and a half alone,

273
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,301
I'm also guessing another one
just showed up to the party.

274
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,135
I hate you.

275
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,471
There's two more.

276
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,432
Yep. You heroic types
have quite the dilemma.

277
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,893
How are we gonna stop
both of them at the same time?

278
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,603
That's a good question.

279
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,396
We aren't doing anything.

280
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,773
You need to focus
on Ultraviolet's surgery.

281
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,275
Who's Ultraviolet? Is...

282
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,943
- Will you just be quiet?
- Shut up.

283
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,281
Stay here.

284
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,617
I've got a job to do.

285
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,701
Do you need any help?

286
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,036
I could stay, you know.

287
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,581
Come on, put me in, Coach.

288
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,501
You just got patched up.

289
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,959
You're benched.

290
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,337
Right.

291
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,259
You, Caitlin, and whoever else is part
of your S.T.A.R. Labs posse

292
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,595
think you get to just sit up here
in your ivory tower

293
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,180
judging who's good and who's bad.

294
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,306
But guess what?

295
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:57,309
Life isn't binary.

296
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,478
It's everything in between.

297
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,562
Now, you don't trust me?

298
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,646
That's fine.

299
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,358
But you cannot decide
who someone's gonna

300
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,193
be today based on
what they did yesterday.

301
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,109
And you should know that
better than anybody else...

302
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,657
Killer Frost.

303
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,121
I'm sorry. I just want to help you.

304
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,582
No.

305
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,754
Okay.

306
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,508
Is this really necessary?

307
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,302
Great.

308
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,151
She's gonna be okay, right?

309
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,945
Of course. Hey...

310
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,073
She's in good hands.

311
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,712
They're back, aren't they?

312
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,548
One of the Godspeed clones is attacking
the Central City Power Plant.

313
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,484
If he takes it out
like he did with the gas station,

314
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,343
the blast radius will be
over 40 square miles.

315
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,385
All right.

316
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,822
You should take
Allegra and Frost with you.

317
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,765
No, if the other Godspeed attacks,
they're our last line of defense.

318
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,947
Look, I know you're not
the real Godspeed,

319
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,700
but I won't let you harm
this city anymore,

320
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,493
so why don't you
just tell me who sent you?

321
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,376
Barry, my algorithm is
translating what Godspeed said.

322
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:47,918
What is it?

323
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,257
"I have him."

324
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,051
Oh, frak, it's a trap!

325
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,259
<i>Get out of there!</i>

326
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,515
<i>Barry, get out of there!</i>

327
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,232
Chester, initiate Babel Protocols!

328
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,586
But Barry, if I drop the force field,
you'll be locked out.

329
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,610
Do it now!

330
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,082
So, what, they couldn't phase through,
so now they're trying to punch through?

331
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,625
How long will the force field hold?

332
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,752
At the rate they're going,
an hour, maybe?

333
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,966
Wait. What are you going to do?

334
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,049
Get reinforcements.

335
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,051
Maybe.

336
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,103
Barry, are you okay?

337
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:33,066
Yeah, I'm just thinking
I'm glad Iris is home and not here.

338
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,152
At least she's safe there.

339
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,780
I still put the rest of you in danger.

340
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,780
Hey, man...

341
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,159
Look, we're Team Flash.

342
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:42,993
Hey, we can handle this.

343
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,205
Plus, look at it this way. With all
the clones here, the city's safe.

344
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,792
Wait, Chester, is there a way
to evacuate

345
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,294
without raising the force field?

346
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,672
Even if there was, Caitlin's mid-surgery
with Ultraviolet right now.

347
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,010
So, if she stops,
Allegra's cousin might die.

348
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,764
- All right, we need a new plan. Fast.
- Yeah, on it.

349
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,140
I'm gonna check in with Iris.

350
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,065
Hey, Iris, you must still be resting.
That's good.

351
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,567
Um...

352
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,277
I'd come check on you in person,

353
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,781
only it's kind of turned into
a hell of a day here at the old office.

354
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,199
Anyway, um...

355
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,929
I know it's supposed to be
one of the happiest days of our lives,

356
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,122
and I don't want you to worry,
just rest.

357
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:32,876
But know that whatever happens,

358
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,879
I'm gonna do everything I can
to keep you and the baby safe.

359
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,842
I knew it! You're having a baby!

360
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,486
I'll check in with you later. Love you.

361
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:43,887
Congratulations.

362
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,556
Thank you, Chester,
but we haven't told anybody yet,

363
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,451
so if you could
please help me keep it that way...

364
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,893
Oh, no, I got you. I got you.

365
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,895
- Consider it locked and zipped.
- Okay.

366
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,981
Whoa. Little baby speedster.

367
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,692
Maybe his first steps
will be a fathwoom.

368
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,778
It's a girl, not a boy.

369
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,280
Wait, have you already met this kid?

370
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,699
Is this like
a <i>Back to the Future-</i>type thing?

371
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:05,784
Not exactly.

372
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,954
Then how do you know the gender?
'Cause relatively speaking,

373
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,288
you just knowing
you have a kid

374
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,041
introduces a whole new set
of temporal variables,

375
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,419
all of which can have an effect
on present and future timelines,

376
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,214
and change what was once
predetermined outcomes.

377
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,132
I guess I don't know for sure.

378
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:25,178
I mean, I have seen so many
different versions of our future.

379
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,890
Just like the Godspeeds...

380
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,743
If it looks like those clones
are gonna break through,

381
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,519
I want you to hide in the Time Vault.

382
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,105
Cisco turned it
into a panic room before he left.

383
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,440
Just in case
I ever went Dark Flash again.

384
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,608
Nothing can get inside.

385
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,987
Oh, snap, I completely forgot
why I came here.

386
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,823
I have a plan.
So remember that trap from earlier?

387
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,575
- Yeah.
- That was the Godspeed clones

388
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,703
creating a set of variables
designed to predict a fixed outcome,

389
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,997
that you'd come to save the power plant.

390
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,040
But they didn't predict
that you'd get away.

391
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,835
Which means that our best defense
against them would be...

392
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:57,919
The unpredictable.

393
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,717
How much longer?

394
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,635
Allegra, honey, she's gonna be fine.

395
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,888
Okay, but...

396
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,599
how can you do that
with all hell breaking loose out there?

397
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,392
I don't have a choice.

398
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,484
Oh, like you're really surprised.

399
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,530
Well, that's getting worse.

400
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,824
Guess those two Godspeeds
need a place to crash.

401
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:28,992
Can't be good.

402
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,285
There's six of them now.

403
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,248
And if they get in here,
they could kill us all.

404
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,792
You brought Derek and Nancy?
It's worse than I thought.

405
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,296
First, I need you to promise me
that if I give these to you,

406
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,673
you won't stab me in the back
at the first chance you get.

407
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,550
I'm serious, Mark.

408
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,636
Today, you need to be a good guy.

409
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,430
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

410
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,182
Because I'm not a good guy.

411
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,643
I mean, you know that.
It's why you're attracted to me.

412
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,978
Please, can we not do that right now?

413
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,647
Fair enough.

414
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,983
But if you really want my help,
then you need to at least try

415
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,611
to speak to me in a way
that someone like me can understand.

416
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,279
'Cause I'm no hero.

417
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,281
I'm never gonna be.

418
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,742
Fair enough.

419
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:14,621
If those six speedsters get in here,
we're screwed.

420
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,539
So, I need all the backup I can get.

421
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,251
'Cause I don't wanna die,
and I'm pretty sure you don't, either.

422
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,174
All right.

423
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,427
I'm in.

424
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,941
It takes a lot to gain my trust.

425
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,861
Break it? You won't get it back.

426
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,622
So what's the plan?

427
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:58,831
<i>So, here's the plan.</i>

428
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,752
You know how those Godspeed clones use
that modem-speak to communicate?

429
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,254
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, I can take audio of it.

430
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,964
Then I can transmit that sound

431
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,687
through C.C.P.D.'s
Emergency Alert System.

432
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:08,757
Like this.

433
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:14,764
Yeah, okay. Now, imagine
one of these staticky clone voices

434
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,767
coming through
every speaker, every radio,

435
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,561
and every cell phone in Central City.

436
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,772
It'd be like trying to talk
to a friend over a loud dance floor.

437
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,149
Impossible, right? And...

438
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,232
They wouldn't be able
to predict where to go first.

439
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,193
And in the confusion,

440
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,965
Frost, Mark and I would have a chance
to take them down one at a time.

441
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,509
And I can boost the signal loud enough

442
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,826
to scramble their brains like eggs
for good measure.

443
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,370
But first, I gotta prep
the C.C.P.D. server

444
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,496
by uploading the signal.

445
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,290
- How long will that take?
- Five minutes.

446
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,085
Make it four.

447
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,627
Got it.

448
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,385
Is that supposed to be happening?

449
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,305
No. Whatever Black Hole did
removing the chip

450
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:58,391
has caused some sort
of systemic neural trauma.

451
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,770
I don't understand.
The anesthesia should be working.

452
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,606
She's hurting, you have to do something.

453
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,067
What I have to do
is finish this and close the wound.

454
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,153
Okay, hey, Caitlin,

455
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,613
can I try something?

456
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,895
Her reaction's stabilizing.

457
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,151
What did you do?

458
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,491
The only thing I could.

459
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,537
I can share my feelings with others now.

460
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,998
So I gave Esperanza the peace

461
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:08,002
that I feel knowing that you and Caitlin

462
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,840
and the rest of Team Flash are out there

463
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,468
saving the world one day at a time.

464
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,298
Barry, we have a big problem.

465
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,181
Brute force and phasing
didn't work, so now...

466
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,618
They figured out something better.

467
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,511
Draining energy from
the force field itself

468
00:27:58,595 --> 00:27:59,971
like they would with my speed.

469
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,537
We have a perimeter breach.

470
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,252
He's calling the others.

471
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,421
Chester, get out of here.

472
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,230
Gideon... Gideon, secure the room!

473
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,732
Tachyon nullifiers activated,
Chester P. Runk.

474
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:54,191
Time Vault secured.

475
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,997
- Can I change my mind about helping?
- Too late.

476
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,630
Chester P. Runk,
multiple Godspeeds

477
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,048
are assaulting S.T.A.R. Labs.

478
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,384
Do you need assistance
formulating a plan?

479
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,177
I already had one, Gideon!

480
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,621
I was gonna pipe their clone-speak

481
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,056
into C.C.P.D.'s systems
and confuse the hell out of them.

482
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,076
But, you know...
stuck in a room...

483
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,410
Would you like
to play the signal

484
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,645
through S.T.A.R. Labs'
intercom system instead?

485
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,064
Yes, Gideon! Yes, I would!

486
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,542
And hopefully this'll give
Barry and the others

487
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,669
the distraction that they need.

488
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,735
Okay, Gideon!

489
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,073
Pipe audio file number 2808
into every room in this facility.

490
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,284
And crank it. I mean, P-Funk loud.

491
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,034
Of course.

492
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,640
<i>Yo, I used to check out lyrics
Upon the formats</i>

493
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,101
<i>Built with skill with technique

494
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,353
<i>My lyrical form is clouds

495
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,605
<i>I get hyped, think, thought

496
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,149
<i>Sync the track, pump the track</i>

497
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,860
<i>Dance missions clubs like spores
React by strobe visions</i>

498
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,863
<i>And hurrying more reflects
On the dance floor</i>

499
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,282
<i>Blowing up

500
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,409
<i>Packing crowds, jam packed venues</i>

501
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,745
<i>Needles collapse
While atmosphere continues</i>

502
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,788
<i>Sprinkle that, win it like that
Move it like that</i>

503
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,124
<i>Hitting like that, the melody is phat</i>

504
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,792
<i>Yo, I'm on the energy source</i>

505
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,544
<i>The cosmic boss with Prodigy</i>

Drastically, fantastically</i>

517
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,893
<i>Blows your mind
Drastically, fantastically</i>

518
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,104
Oh, crap.

519
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,281
Come on!

520
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:20,935
What the hell?

521
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,695
Ultraviolet's recovering,
but she's gonna be okay.

522
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:31,904
Good.

523
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,573
Thanks. Both of you.

524
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,409
Without that chip, she's free.

525
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,370
Now I just have
to help her adjust back to...

526
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,664
you know, normal.

527
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:45,084
Yeah, well, with you in her corner,
that'll be easy-peasy.

528
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,587
Thanks, Chuck.
'Cause with everything that's going on,

529
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:48,939
we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

530
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:52,133
Allegra's right.
How do we stop a dozen Godspeeds?

531
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,376
Oh, yeah, Barry, how much
of your speed did they steal?

532
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,970
Barely any.

533
00:34:56,095 --> 00:35:00,391
The other clones attacked the first ones
before they could do any real damage.

534
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,268
But why fight each other?

535
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:05,730
Yeah, and why would any Godspeed
wanna protect the Flash?

536
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,107
I don't think they wanted to help me.

537
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,111
I just think
they were trying to kill the other six.

538
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,696
Speedsters fighting speedsters?

539
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:16,490
Yeah, that ain't
no regular bad guy battle.

540
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,454
Whatever it is,
we're stuck in the middle of it.

541
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,829
All this time, we assumed
the Godspeeds were aligned,

542
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,914
but if they're not...

543
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,419
It's a civil war.

544
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:35,968
You know, technically,

545
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,262
we didn't win.

546
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,474
But we are alive.

547
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,977
Something I didn't think
would be the case an hour ago.

548
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:51,317
That is cause for celebration.

549
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,721
So now I guess that you're done with me,
you're not gonna let me spend the night.

550
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,955
Uh...

551
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,709
No one's kicking you out.

552
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:09,793
Not yet.

553
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,336
Wow.

554
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,589
One little near-death experience...

555
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:15,925
Are we becoming friends?

556
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:17,717
You tell me.

557
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:20,971
Well, you gotta admit,
we do have explosive chemistry.

558
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,017
It's kind of like sucrose
and potassium chlorate with heat.

559
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,603
What a nerd.

560
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,736
You know,
when those two Godspeeds had us pinned,

561
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,406
I really thought that was it.

562
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,910
But somehow, I was okay with it.

563
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:45,830
I'll tell you why?

564
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:52,086
It was because you were with me.

565
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:58,551
And somehow, knowing that you would be
the last face that I would see

566
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:03,097
or the last voice that I'd hear,

567
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,808
just made everything okay.

568
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,309
Everything.

569
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,440
I didn't think
we were gonna make it, either.

570
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,192
But we did.

571
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:21,532
What are you thinking about now, Mark?

572
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,203
You, Snowflake.

573
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:39,967
What the hell was that?

574
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,608
Sucrose and potassium chlorate, my ass.

575
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:57,734
Mark?

576
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,128
- Barry.
- Hm?

577
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,672
Stop worrying.
You're gonna be a great dad.

578
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,216
We all know it.

579
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,301
Thanks, Cecile.

580
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:23,927
I just...

581
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,014
wish Iris was feeling better
and could be here.

582
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,014
I know, I know.

583
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,895
But you're gonna call her
as soon as we're done.

584
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,143
Yeah.

585
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:35,147
Okay, what is it?

586
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,358
I was just thinking.

587
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:44,281
I hope our child has Iris' heart
and her fearlessness.

588
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,367
Aww. She will.

589
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,755
It's negative.

590
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:04,760
I don't...

591
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,056
I mean, my dream...

592
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,101
Nora said everything was gonna work out.

593
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:14,686
It will, honey.

594
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,689
- I know it will.
- How?

595
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,735
If this isn't the future
for me and Iris...

596
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,573
what is?

597
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:48,178
Creyke hasn't shown up all day.
Maybe he moved on.

598
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,180
No, he'll be here.

599
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:51,807
I can feel it.

600
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:57,938
It's strange, being so close
to almost closing this case.

601
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,610
Are you worried
about arresting an old friend?

602
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,447
After we joined the service,

603
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,699
I went into intelligence.

604
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,328
Adam ended up in Special Forces.

605
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,891
Turns out he had a knack for killing,

606
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,957
one the Army used to great effect.

607
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,962
Something changed in him, West.

608
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,214
And I didn't see it.

609
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:28,636
And since you two grew up so much alike,

610
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:34,266
now you're worried that
whatever broke him might break you, too?

611
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,518
All our lives we had each other's backs.

612
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,273
Until he stabbed me in mine.

613
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,443
Left me for dead.

614
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,117
What can change a person enough
to do that?

615
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,127
What the hell is that?

616
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,254
Get out of the car!

617
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:12,278
