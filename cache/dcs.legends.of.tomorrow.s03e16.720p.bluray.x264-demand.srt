<i>Previously on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,503
The more the timeline is corrupted,

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,546
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,586
Maybe these totems are the keys
to stopping him.

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,338
<i>The Fire Totem
wasn't meant for me.</i>

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,629
Damien Darhk?
What has he promised you?

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,421
A chance to protect our village.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,135
- No.
<i>- We'll fix this.</i>

9
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,266
<i>We'll get your totem back.</i>

10
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,093
<i>Gideon, delete file 354-Z.</i>

11
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,470
<i>Yes, Director Hunter.</i>

12
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,771
Sara can never find out
the truth about Ava.

13
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,939
Look, I don't deserve you.

14
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,395
- Sara, yes, you do.
- No, Ava, I don't.

15
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,061
I'm not gonna do this. I'm sorry.

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,824
I am not just walking out
on the team, Ray.

17
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,780
She says as she's literally
walking away.

18
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,831
Sara, we appreciate
that you may need a break

19
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,395
after what happened
with the Death Totem,

20
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,231
but this is the absolute worst time
for you to leave.

21
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,917
At least let us lock you up
in the brig.

22
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,463
We need you here now more than ever.

23
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,985
Yeah, we've almost won
the totem race.

24
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,750
Which is exactly why I need to go.

25
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,753
Look, we are so close
to gaining control over the six,

26
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,926
and getting the upper hand on Mallus.
I just...

27
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,342
I need a day to clear my head.

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,706
Who's gonna stop Mick from burning
down the ship with the Fire Totem?

29
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,370
Someone's gonna have to fill in
the role of captain while I'm gone.

30
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,777
Oh. Well, I hadn't exactly thought I'd
pick up the mantle this soon, but...

31
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,111
I'm putting Amaya in charge.

32
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,822
Good luck.

33
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,534
Sorry about that, big guy.

34
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,334
Hey, hi.

35
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,884
Um, do you think that maybe you could
do that somewhere else?

36
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,419
We do have a galley.

37
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,597
You want a dog?

38
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,506
It's pork.

39
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,641
So what?

40
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,973
No, thank you.

41
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,765
Ah.

42
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,185
Wow, I'm sure that's what those
ancient folks had in mind

43
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,645
when they created the Fire Totem.

44
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,277
- Every man's gotta eat.
- There you are, Mick.

45
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,071
- You ready?
- For what?

46
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,031
Training. Do you remember?

47
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,483
We spoke about learning
to harness the powers of the totem.

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Hmm.

49
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,371
I got a new trick. Pull my finger.

50
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,494
- What?
- Pull my finger.

51
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,708
Do not pull his finger.

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,832
Let's just say hot dogs
aren't the only thing

53
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,291
he's learned how to light on fire.

54
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,343
<i>Sorry to interrupt, Ms. Jiwe,</i>

55
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,591
<i>but Dr. Heywood requests
your presence in the library.</i>

56
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,720
Captain's duties
are never over.

57
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,560
But, seeing as you're not busy...

58
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,642
No. Please no, please don't ask me.

59
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:32,063
I can't think of anyone better
to learn to train a new totem bearer.

60
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,482
Yeah, sure.

61
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,108
I'll get right on it.

62
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,699
Good luck.

63
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,617
So, what's going on?

64
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,086
It's your granddaughter, Mari.
She's been hurt. A minor wrinkle

65
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,297
- in the 2018 timeline.
- How badly?

66
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,860
The article says she was burned
trying to save people

67
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,001
from a warehouse fire in Detroit.

68
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,586
Doesn't she have superpowers, though?

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,512
This is all my fault.

70
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,881
Ever since I lost my totem,

71
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,224
the timeline
must be starting to solidify.

72
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,268
Which means, in this new reality,

73
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,183
the totem
was never passed down to her.

74
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,431
So, Mari is a vigilante
without her totem.

75
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,102
I have to go and talk to her.

76
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,818
What? No. You cannot talk
to your own granddaughter.

77
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,465
- That would cause...
- Unforeseen consequences.

78
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,369
I know, but how much worse
can things truly get?

79
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,364
Sara put me in charge
while she steps away.

80
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,158
All the more reason why you
should stay on the ship, okay?

81
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,947
I'll go to Detroit,
and I'll talk to her.

82
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,416
- And I'll help him.
- Yeah.

83
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,127
There's nothing this dynamic duo
cannot do.

84
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,458
Okay, fine.

85
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,831
Just be careful.

86
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,345
Look, Sara.

87
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,717
For what it's worth, I know it wasn't
the real you who tried to kill us.

88
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,935
That's just it, Ray.
That was the real me.

89
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,970
Which is why I need to...

90
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,398
Ms. Lance? It's Gary.

91
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,392
Sorry to drop in on you like this.

92
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,735
What are you doing?
Open your eyes, Gary.

93
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,688
Oh, hi.

94
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,733
Sorry, I didn't wanna accidentally
portal into your quarters

95
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,735
and catch you and Director Sharpe,
you know...

96
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,058
- Together.
- You don't have to worry about that

97
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,493
anymore because we broke up.

98
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,034
Wait, what? Why didn't you tell us?

99
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,163
No, no, you guys can't break up.
I was shipping you so hard.

100
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,338
That's why you're leaving.

101
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,165
That is not why I'm leaving.

102
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,506
And if you're looking for Ava,
I suggest you check her office.

103
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,637
Uh, well, that's the thing.
She hasn't been to work

104
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,673
in a few days,
which is very unlike her.

105
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,328
I've already been covering for her.
I forged her signature twice.

106
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,413
What am I supposed to do next?

107
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,237
Put on a wig and pantsuit
and pretend I'm her?

108
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,397
- No, don't do that.
- What if she's in trouble?

109
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,878
I mean,
we already lost Director Bennett.

110
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,963
What if Grodd got to her, too?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

111
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,423
Gary, Gary, deep breaths.

112
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,447
Deep breaths.

113
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,652
Don't worry, Gary,

114
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,951
because we're gonna find her.

115
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,115
"We" will find her?

116
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,669
Thanks for taking the time
to talk with us, Mr. McCabe.

117
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,301
Mari's resting.

118
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,798
I'll have someone come grab you
when she wakes up.

119
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,175
We're from the <i>Detroit Chronicle,</i>

120
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,550
and we'd like to do a story
about your foster daughter's heroism.

121
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,102
To tell you the truth,

122
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,645
I wish she was less interested
in saving everyone else's lives

123
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,309
and more compelled
to protect her own.

124
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,898
Mari's a brave woman.

125
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,312
But, maybe you should remind her

126
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,485
that there are police
and firefighters, too,

127
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,981
and that the safety of Detroit
isn't, you know, her responsibility.

128
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,607
You don't have to tell me that.

129
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,103
Sometimes I feel like my daughter,

130
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,001
she's walking around
with a target on her back.

131
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,615
Excuse me for a second.

132
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,131
Ava comes back and finds us
snooping through her office...

133
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,300
We're only snooping
to find out where she went.

134
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,186
What are you doing?

135
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,976
I'm hacking into the Bureau's network
to access Ava's personnel file.

136
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,855
- Huh.
- What is it?

137
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,944
Director Sharpe's personnel file
has been erased.

138
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,234
Someone deleted it remotely
from the <i>Waverider.</i>

139
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,074
Wow, she must've really
wanted to go off the radar.

140
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,574
Wait, you think Director Sharpe
erased her own file? That's crazy.

141
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,619
Yeah, so was putting on a wig
and impersonating your boss, Gary.

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,957
I didn't actually do it.

143
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,373
Mmm-hmm.
- What are you doing?

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,963
Looking for clues
as to where she might have gone.

145
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,000
Birthday card from her parents
in Fresno.

146
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,385
Think she might have gone to Fresno?

147
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,512
That mean we have to go to Fresno?

148
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,591
You sure you saw Kuasa?

149
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,928
Yeah, just be on the lookout
for a badass in a leather outfit.

150
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,896
Or a suspicious puddle of water.

151
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,145
Hey, there she is!

152
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,944
I got her.

153
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,857
Whoa!

154
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,575
Dude, don't just stand there.

155
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,129
Hello.

156
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,250
Not so fast.

157
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,048
- Wally, wait, she's...
- Dangerous, I know.

158
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,064
Soon as I catch my breath, I'm gonna
stop you from hurting your sister.

159
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,473
Hurt Mari?

160
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,219
I'm here to protect her, you idiots.

161
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,865
Well, this isn't exactly
how I imagined meeting Ava's parents.

162
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,157
Not that I imagined
meeting Ava's parents, I just...

163
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,493
Hello. How can we help you?

164
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,211
Pam and Randy Sharpe?

165
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,456
Says so on our marriage license.

166
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,778
Looks like they stepped right out
of an L.L. Bean catalog.

167
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,011
Now we know where Director Sharpe
gets her perfect bone structure.

168
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,845
And you are?

169
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,431
We're friends of your daughter.

170
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,140
Well, unfortunately, Ava...

171
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,704
Hasn't shown up for work
in a few days,

172
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,128
and we're getting a little worried.

173
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,892
We haven't seen her in months.

174
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,189
I hope she's okay.

175
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,835
We were hoping that
we could come inside.

176
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,146
Maybe, together we could figure out
where she's gone.

177
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,362
Sure. Pammy here just baked up
a storm of her famous cookies.

178
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,698
Snickerdoodles.

179
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,783
Come on in.

180
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,243
If you folks work with Ava,
you must work for the government.

181
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,493
Yep, we're government suits.

182
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,268
Our daughter won't tell us what
she does. It's all so "top secret."

183
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,584
You have so many photos of her.

184
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,091
Where was that one taken?

185
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,136
Oh, that's at the Grand Canyon.

186
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,389
Hmm.

187
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,842
Such a beautiful family.

188
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,682
Almost too good to be true.

189
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,431
Sara, why don't you try one
of Mrs. Sharpe's snickerdoodles?

190
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,105
I don't want a snickerdoodle, Ray.
What about this photo?

191
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,103
Where was this one?

192
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,939
Oh, yes, that's Ava's
15th birthday party.

193
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,236
She had friends in for a sleepover.

194
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,281
They stayed up all night long
watching horror movies.

195
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,906
Uh-huh.

196
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,033
- Sleepover, really?
- Uh-huh.

197
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,127
I remember it well.

198
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,706
Well, I know for a fact

199
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,671
Ava went paintballing
for her 15th birthday.

200
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,589
Oh.

201
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,199
Pam meant her 16th birthday.
She always gets that part mixed up.

202
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,506
Always.

203
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,634
Who the hell are you guys?

204
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,530
- Oh, God, I hate the sight of blood.
- Sara.

205
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,892
Okay, fine, we'll tell you
everything, just don't kill us.

206
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,732
- And, why the hell shouldn't I?
- Because we're just actors.

207
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,153
What?

208
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,819
Yeah. Okay, four years ago,

209
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,383
we responded
to this online ad for a gig.

210
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,885
They gave us backstories
for our characters,

211
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,749
they told us if Ava
ever comes around to visit,

212
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,993
we just act like her parents.

213
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
And who hired you?

214
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,286
No idea.

215
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,079
The money is automatically deposited.

216
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,032
Look, it's not such a bad gig,

217
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,118
considering Ava rarely
ever comes home to visit.

218
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,087
Why in the world would you agree
to be a part of such a charade?

219
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,008
Do you know how hard it is
to get an acting job in Fresno?

220
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,799
Right, well, I apologize
about the knife thing.

221
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,388
It is a gut reaction.

222
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,849
Nothing personal.

223
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,925
Sorry to bother you.
We'll be on our way now.

224
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,055
You have a lovely home, Mr. and Mrs.
Whatever your real names are.

225
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,860
Okay, you said to wait until
after your second lunch.

226
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,150
This is your fourth.

227
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,987
Amaya wants me to teach you
how to use your totem,

228
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,826
so let's get cracking.

229
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,954
If I wanted to learn,
I would have gone to school.

230
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,490
You know, you are a...

231
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,294
Okay.

232
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,955
Be patient, be kind,
abstain from negative thoughts.

233
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,550
Sorry, blood sugar thing. Fasting.

234
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,053
Fasting?

235
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,382
Yeah, I'm not eating.

236
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,467
Trying to lose some fat, huh?

237
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,472
No, I love my body.
I'm trying to observe Ramadan.

238
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,390
So observe it on a full stomach.

239
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,155
Is this bacon?

240
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,522
You're Jewish.

241
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,737
I don't even know what... I can't.

242
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,166
What kind of person invents
a fake family and backstory?

243
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,627
When I was a kid, I told my friends
my dad was an orthodontist.

244
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,793
Sounded much cooler than dentist.

245
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,318
If she was lying
about where she's from,

246
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,833
there's no telling what else she...

247
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,304
Sara, what are you doing here?

248
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,724
Uh...

249
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,222
Gary was worried
that you were missing, so...

250
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,930
Naturally, we were concerned,

251
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,222
and thought we'd
investigate it further.

252
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,269
Clearly, I'm no longer missing, so...

253
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,355
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

254
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,104
Don't I look fine?

255
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,068
Where have you been?

256
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,988
If you must know...
Gary, straighten your tie.

257
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,185
I was visiting my parents in Fresno.

258
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,532
Home-cooked meals and all.

259
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,663
- Hmm. Fresno?
- Mmm-hmm.

260
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,745
Nothing like a tray
of snickerdoodles.

261
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,249
I mean, any other kind of cookie
to mend a broken heart.

262
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,983
You know what,
I have a lot of work to do.

263
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,714
I'm sure you two
can see yourselves out.

264
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,930
You okay?

265
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,009
No one likes running into their ex.

266
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,099
I'm fine.

267
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,054
Like I said,

268
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,061
let's find out what else
she's hiding from us.

269
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,606
So, this is Mari's Vixen cave.

270
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,984
Ever since my grandmother
lost her totem,

271
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,202
I figured I better start
keeping tabs on her.

272
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,155
It's a good thing I did.

273
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,663
I thought you hated Mari.

274
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,868
She's still my sister.

275
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,497
And even though I resented her
for inheriting the Anansi Totem,

276
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,882
I'd rather see it around her neck
than on Nora Darhk's.

277
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,002
So, let's get it back
to where it belongs.

278
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,512
- You wanna help me?
- We wanna help Amaya.

279
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,927
You wanna help your sister.

280
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,179
Either way,
we have to get that totem back.

281
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,914
The Darhks will kill me
if I turn on them.

282
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,457
Don't worry,
this isn't the first totem

283
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,097
that we've lifted
from under their noses.

284
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,644
Soon we'll have five totems.

285
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,771
Do you really wanna be one
against five?

286
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,611
If we work together, we can defeat
the Darhks and Mallus.

287
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,223
And you get to protect your family.

288
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,691
Isn't that what you really want?

289
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,453
Fine.

290
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,866
But we do this my way.

291
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,160
Maybe Ava wasn't lying
about where she was,

292
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,787
but when she was.

293
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,045
I thought the worst thing about her
is she's from Fresno.

294
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,341
Well, I'm not...

295
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,462
I'm not seeing anything
in her Time Courier records

296
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,356
that wasn't Bureau-sanctioned
and by the book.

297
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,719
Wait, what's that?

298
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,603
Her first mission,
Vancouver 2213. I can't access it.

299
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,519
The Bureau sanctioned 2213
a no-fly zone.

300
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,692
Meaning?

301
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,481
Meaning the Courier you stole
from Ava doesn't do you any good,

302
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,211
and the <i>Waverider</i>
can't fly there, either.

303
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,815
And the only person
who can override the restriction...

304
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,282
Is the Time Bureau director.

305
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,410
Yeah.

306
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,621
- But, why wouldn't Director Sharpe...
- Want us to know who she really is?

307
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,992
I'll give you one guess, Gary.

308
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,541
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

309
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,251
Do you think
my boss is an anachronism?

310
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,087
The only way to know for sure
is to go to 2213.

311
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,382
So how do we get there?

312
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,251
I guess the only way
would be to hijack the mothership,

313
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,127
but unfortunately,
I failed flight training.

314
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,674
Damn astigmatism.

315
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,217
Like I'd let you fly.

316
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,643
Let's go.

317
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,553
Wait, what?

318
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,257
What do you mean the mothership
is on the move?

319
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,863
I mean, someone's stealing it, ma'am.

320
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,899
Track it.
I'm going after it personally.

321
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,541
Should we really be doing this?

322
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,480
I mean, I'm sure
there's a good reason

323
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,504
why no one is supposed to come
to this time period.

324
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,038
Maybe Gary's right.

325
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,857
Maybe we should just ask Ava
what her connection is to this place.

326
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,759
Why? She's just gonna lie
to us again.

327
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,634
Well, if you wanna ask her,
now's your chance.

328
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,226
Director Sharpe.

329
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,772
Director Sharpe?

330
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,361
Just down across, make a left.

331
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,820
Director Sharpes.

332
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,525
What kind of world is this?

333
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,404
Paradise?

334
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,075
I'm surrounded by my exes, Gary.

335
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,538
This is hell.

336
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,843
Pleasant day, citizens.

337
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,263
I had a dream like this once.

338
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,596
Yeah, me too,
but mine involved less clothing.

339
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,022
Mine, too.

340
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,228
Okay.

341
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,945
Well, I guess this is why
they declared 2213 a no-fly zone.

342
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,754
Director Sharpe
didn't want us to find out

343
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,193
that she's secretly a robot.

344
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,571
I did not have sex with a robot.

345
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,783
No, you didn't, Sara.
You had sex with a clone.

346
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,620
<i>Here at Advanced Variant Automation,</i>

347
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,871
<i>we are working to bring
a brighter future.</i>

348
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,499
<i>Our cloning program
has produced the Ava.</i>

349
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,922
<i>Ava is the perfect woman
designed to keep us safe</i>

350
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,591
<i>and restore order to the chaos.</i>

351
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,009
It makes sense they'd clone Ava.

352
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,753
She is the perfect woman.

353
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,506
Oh, calm down, Gary, she's okay.

354
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,803
Before I have an Ava overload,

355
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,393
should we return to the comfort
and safety of the Time Bureau?

356
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,475
No.

357
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,229
We're not done here yet.

358
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,697
I think an ambush would work best
in this situation.

359
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,117
Sure,

360
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,159
if you wanna die a quick death.

361
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,786
Quite frankly, you two...

362
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,457
Oh.

363
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,407
Are no match for the Darhks.

364
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,126
Okay,
so what's your plan?

365
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,538
We lure them to us, with bait.

366
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,340
No, no. You are not using a totem.

367
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,468
No.

368
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,343
We have the next best thing.

369
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,930
A Legend.

370
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,264
That's crazy. Why don't we just go
to where they're at,

371
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,869
I'll swipe it
like I did the Fire Totem.

372
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,304
You overplayed your hand.

373
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,101
Now, they know you have a...
Whatever you are on the team.

374
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,565
What I am is the fastest man alive.
Thanks.

375
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,776
Second fastest.

376
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,740
She didn't need to know that.

377
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,856
<i>Nathaniel?</i>

378
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,196
Amaya, hey.

379
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,782
- How's Mari?
<i>- Her doctor says she's gonna be fine.</i>

380
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,822
She's strong, just like you.

381
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,611
<i>Thank you for checking in on her.</i>

382
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,200
So when are you coming back?

383
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,018
We're gonna stick around for a while.

384
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,242
You know, talk her out
of this whole superhero business.

385
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,251
<i>Or at least until you get
your totem back</i>

386
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,704
<i>and the timeline's back in order.</i>

387
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,377
In that case,
just take care of yourself, okay?

388
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,463
I love you, Nathaniel.

389
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,722
Yeah, me too.

390
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,971
Shouldn't we be bringing
Amaya into this?

391
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,103
- No.
- No.

392
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,347
We already have one Vixen
in the hospital as it is.

393
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,482
Agreed.

394
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,604
My grandmother will want
to play the hero

395
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,855
and get herself killed.

396
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,813
If that happens, Mari and I
will be wiped from existence.

397
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,309
Right, so, we're gonna need you
to keep her out of our hair.

398
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,363
- But...
- I know, I know.

399
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,070
I'll be fine. I just need you
to keep an eye on Amaya.

400
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,788
Damn it, Wally.

401
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,928
This place is creepy.

402
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,094
How about I wait outside?

403
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,187
How about you calm down?

404
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,475
Is it too late to mention my fear
of things covered in sheets?

405
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,856
Hey, guys, over here.

406
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,039
How is this even possible?

407
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,826
Looks like they created Ava
from what they believe

408
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,994
are the best genes from
around the world

409
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,169
to make the perfect woman.

410
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,915
Though she's a little pale,
if you ask me.

411
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,218
I should've known
she was too good to be true.

412
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,427
That doesn't mean that what you guys
had wasn't real.

413
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,917
That is exactly what it means.

414
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,389
Uh... Guys?

415
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,416
Everything that she's told me
about herself has been a lie.

416
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,726
- Guys?
- What, Gary?

417
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,559
Oh, crumbs! I think I woke one up.

418
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,652
Your are in violation of Bylaw 575.

419
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,568
You do not have clearance
to be in this room.

420
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,527
We were just leaving.

421
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,907
Just let us go, it'll be fine.

422
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,076
If I let you go,
I have to let everyone go.

423
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,040
You must be terminated.

424
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,375
I think she wants to kill us.

425
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,744
You don't say.

426
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,504
Should we help?

427
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,685
Not unless you want both of them
to kill you.

428
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,676
All right, tie her up
before she comes to.

429
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,222
This is weird.

430
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,896
Ah.

431
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,473
These chains won't be nearly
as convincing

432
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,932
if you can turn to steel.

433
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,109
You know, I'm a good actor.
I could have sold it.

434
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,232
And what's with these vigilantes
and their dark spaces?

435
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,744
It's like they're afraid
of that healthy bronze look. Hmm?

436
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,490
Oh, I know.
I didn't mean you.

437
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,541
You look great, honey.

438
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,539
I underestimated you, Kuasa.

439
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,630
You brought us
a valuable bargaining chip.

440
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,923
Uh-uh-uh.

441
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,499
I want something in exchange.

442
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,426
My grandmother's totem.

443
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,928
It belongs to me.

444
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,014
You didn't actually think she was
gonna hand that over to you, did you?

445
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,849
- She's right.
- You what?

446
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,435
The power of Mallus flows through me.

447
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,103
I don't need some trinket.

448
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,108
Besides,

449
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,901
Kuasa's proven herself
a loyal acolyte.

450
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,861
The plan worked. Free me.

451
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,405
I once thought that losing this totem

452
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,238
was the greatest threat to me
and my family.

453
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,457
But you are in love with my Nana Baa.

454
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,831
And should she choose
to love you in return,

455
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,330
me and my sister
will never even exist.

456
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,341
- This is not the plan.
- Plans change.

457
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,149
This is better than
<i>The Brave And The Bold.</i>

458
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,470
For a PhD,
you're remarkably gullible.

459
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,464
Kuasa, you're better than this.

460
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,179
Be the woman your grandmother
believed you to be.

461
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm being the woman
she knows me to be.

462
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,273
When you kill him, do it slowly.

463
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,581
Is that too tight? I can never tell.

464
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,040
Not that I have experience
tying people up, because I don't.

465
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,874
Stop talking to it, Gary.

466
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,252
Sara, she isn't an "it."

467
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,838
She's a real person, they all are.

468
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,264
Our Ava's just an anachronism,

469
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,476
somehow displaced 200 years
in the past, a.k.a. our present.

470
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,748
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- I know.

471
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,104
I mean, I get it.

472
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,349
Why would she tell me she comes
from a place where she's just

473
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,900
one of a million copies?

474
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,982
- There you are.
- Oh, God, another one?

475
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,863
Gary, that's our Ava.

476
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,274
What does he mean "another one"?

477
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,163
Don't mind Gary.

478
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,310
You know, it's interesting,
I would've found you sooner,

479
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,417
except I seemed to have misplaced
my Time Courier.

480
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,078
What are you three doing in 2213?

481
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,049
We are investigating an anachronism.

482
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,629
An anachronism, really?

483
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,002
What is this place anyway?

484
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,337
Oh, come on, Ava.

485
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,054
The jig's up. We know.

486
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,593
What are you talking about?

487
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,149
Oh, my God.

488
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,780
Well, maybe she's not a card-carrying
member of the clone club after all.

489
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,154
I must prepare
for the master's arrival.

490
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,958
I trust you'll be able
to make him talk.

491
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,994
No problem, Nora-doll.

492
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,000
Talk? You don't have
to torture me to talk.

493
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,091
The trick is, you gotta get me
to shut up.

494
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,079
It's not much of a trick.

495
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,349
You will have the Legends
bring the missing totems to me.

496
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,518
Or you will die.

497
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,612
Your, um, daughter,

498
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,690
she looks different. No offense.

499
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,411
None taken.

500
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,667
Her face...

501
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,035
How long has that been a situation?

502
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,566
You know what, since you're gonna
die, I might as well tell you.

503
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,957
The closer that Mallus gets
to escaping his prison,

504
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,500
the worse the situation gets.

505
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,613
You know, stop looking at me.
Don't look at me. I'm just gonna...

506
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,180
I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me.

507
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,761
Torture just doesn't bring me
the same joy anymore.

508
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,184
It's okay, you're distracted,
I get it.

509
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,515
You made a deal with the devil,

510
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,837
now he's come back to claim
your little girl, am I right?

511
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,147
Yes!

512
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,695
I wanted to burn the world down
and rebuild it in my image,

513
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,444
not lose the person
I was doing it for.

514
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,237
Damien, this is deep stuff, man.

515
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,068
Let's just keep digging.
Let's keep digging.

516
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,573
- Just do me one favor.
- Yes, what?

517
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,493
Can you lose the cattle prod?
I mean, I'm gonna die anyway.

518
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,245
Let's just make this a safe space.

519
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,327
- A safe space.
- A safe space.

520
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,956
- Director Sharpe?
- Mmm.

521
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,466
Director Sharpe, are you okay?

522
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,218
Oh, Gary! God! Get out of my face.

523
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,304
I'll take that as a yes.

524
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,474
What do you remember
before you hit your head?

525
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,344
Uh...

526
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,557
I came to 2213
to find the mothership,

527
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,267
and I stepped out of the portal,

528
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,943
and then you were breathing
in my face.

529
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,562
Is there something I'm forgetting?

530
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,111
Well, before your little mishap,

531
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,033
you were commending us
on our great work,

532
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,889
and you even mentioned something
about a promotion.

533
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,120
- This is terrible.
- Okay.

534
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,447
Can we just tell her the truth?

535
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,957
That what? She was hatched
in a government lab?

536
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,813
God, this whole time, I thought
that she was hiding who she was,

537
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,088
but clearly, she had no idea
she was a clone.

538
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,961
Did you see the way she reacted?

539
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,054
- What was that?
- Uh...

540
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,700
- Nothing.
- No, don't.

541
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,225
Don't...

542
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,146
Don't what?

543
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,479
- Thank God she's gone.
- Who's gone?

544
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,979
We gotta get out of here
before that fembot sounds the alarm.

545
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Fembot?

546
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Come on.

547
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,448
Okay, now concentrate on the target.

548
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,906
It's about focus and precision.

549
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,450
Like I need help
lighting things on fire.

550
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,410
Okay.

551
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,410
One, two...

552
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,044
Rory, could you focus on something
other than your stomach for a second?

553
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Whatever.

554
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,093
I said just the target, you idiot!

555
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,258
- I'm the idiot?
- Yeah.

556
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,678
You're the one who doesn't eat
when you're hungry.

557
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,556
Maybe if you did,
you wouldn't be such a bitch!

558
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,853
What did you just say?

559
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,526
You heard me.

560
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,207
Whoa. What is going on?

561
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,826
Zari's training Rory.

562
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,337
Or killing him.
But now you're back on the ship,

563
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,234
we need to get out of Detroit
and back to work.

564
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,466
Uh... Nate is actually still
trying to convince Mari

565
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,044
not to be a vigilante,
and she is stubborn.

566
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,095
I wonder where she gets that from.

567
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,466
Kuasa, what are you doing here?

568
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,261
- I come with a peace offering.
- How did you get that?

569
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,304
Wait, where is Nate?

570
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,857
I gave him to the Darhks
in exchange for the totem.

571
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,605
- That wasn't the plan.
- What plan?

572
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,397
Nate thought it'd be better
not to tell you.

573
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,218
Because you're in love
with him, Nana Baa.

574
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,905
And that love is a threat
to both Mari and me.

575
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,244
- So you betrayed him?
- He's not my grandfather.

576
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,283
Every moment that you spend with him

577
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,240
is a threat
to our entire family's future.

578
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,117
How can you be so selfish?

579
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,161
You're the selfish one.

580
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,418
Our family's destruction
looms in 1992.

581
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,337
You promised you'd save us,

582
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,425
and yet, you continuously
search for ways

583
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,879
to abandon your family and Zambesi.

584
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,802
I have done everything in my power
to try to redeem you.

585
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,305
And in doing so, Mari got hurt.

586
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,914
She understands
that being a totem bearer

587
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,271
means protecting all people,
not just our own.

588
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,725
It's no wonder this totem
ended up with Mari and not you.

589
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,023
You're beyond redemption.

590
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,782
Mothership is this way.

591
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,207
Sara listen, I really need to confess
something to you.

592
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,034
- Can we do this later?
- No, listen.

593
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,605
I wasn't really visiting
my parents in Fresno.

594
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,691
I don't even know why I said that.
I never visit my parents.

595
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,595
- They're like strangers to me.
- You don't say.

596
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,175
When we broke up,
I actually called my ex in Vegas.

597
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,548
I'm so ashamed,
but it's worse than that, all right?

598
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,592
I created an Upswipz profile...

599
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,660
And, I actually went
really overboard on the swiping.

600
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,472
It really is more intuitive
to go up and down, but...

601
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,123
That's not even the point.
The point is,

602
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,184
I realized
that it's not for me, okay?

603
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,017
And, I know that we aren't
together anymore, Sara,

604
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,172
but I really just felt like
I needed to be honest with you.

605
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,860
Okay? Great. Now you all hate me.

606
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,778
Not that I can blame you, I just...

607
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,682
Can you, please, stop looking at me
like that? I can't take it.

608
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,241
Ava, look, it's not you...

609
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,750
It's them.

610
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,285
What the hell are those things
and why do they all look like me?

611
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:51,853
Uh... Well, short version,
you're a clone.

612
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,022
I'm a...

613
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,016
I'm a clone? From the future?

614
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,351
I'm a future clone thing?

615
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,603
Hey, Ava.

616
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,924
- Shh.
- It's okay, Director Sharpe.

617
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,905
- Gary will take care of everything.
- No.

618
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,907
She deserves to know.

619
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,569
I don't understand.
This can't be happening.

620
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,950
You're saying I'm one of them?

621
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,601
Hey, look, this might be
where you're from,

622
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,741
but it is not who you are.

623
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,826
Then who the hell am I?

624
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,579
You are the same person
that you have always been.

625
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,423
You are the woman who has
worked her way to the top

626
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,166
to becoming the head
of the Time Bureau.

627
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,752
- You are extraordinary.
- No.

628
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,756
My life, my memories,
they're all manufactured.

629
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,762
They're not real. I'm not even real.

630
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,218
Ava, you are real.

631
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,471
You are as real as I feel about you.

632
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,854
How can you say that when I'm
just like one of those things?

633
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,019
Because I know you.

634
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,981
And I know that you are a badass.

635
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,487
And you are different.

636
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,110
And now that we both know that,

637
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,196
I need you to act exactly
like one of those clones

638
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,497
if we wanna get out of here.

639
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,867
Go ahead, Darhk.

640
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,164
Make my day.

641
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,420
You asked for it, steel boy.

642
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,438
- Was that good?
- Really good, really good.

643
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,193
- Just a lit bit bigger this time.
- Okay.

644
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,305
Here we go.

645
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,843
Oh, no! My God!

646
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,637
There's blood everywhere.

647
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,429
There's so much blood.

648
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,355
You know better
than to play Mallus for a fool.

649
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,189
No, no, no. Honey, I can explain.

650
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,401
Such a waste of a good head of hair.

651
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,399
Hey, get your hands
off that hard body.

652
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm sorry, that sounded
way better in my head.

653
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,069
What the hell?

654
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,663
Seems that you and Kuasa
have resolved your family squabble.

655
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,749
So much drama over a silly trinket.

656
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,202
Pathetic.

657
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:25,173
I wouldn't expect you to understand
anything about honor or legacy.

658
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,557
Amaya!

659
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,652
I've apprehended the intruders.

660
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,071
I'll escort them from the premises
and terminate them.

661
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,203
Move.

662
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,225
Don't move.

663
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,519
This one's a fake.
She's not one of us.

664
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,811
Step forward.

665
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,113
You are to be
reprocessed immediately.

666
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,620
That feel fake to you?

667
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,506
Stay close.
I don't wanna lose you in this crowd.

668
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,942
Is this as weird for you
as it is for me?

669
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,231
I've had messier breakups.

670
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,912
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

671
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,292
This is the second-worst
attack of the clones I've seen.

672
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,753
Please, please,
I don't wanna do this.

673
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,850
Gary.

674
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,136
Thank God. It's the real you.

675
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,126
Let's get back to the ship
before more show up.

676
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,186
Yeah.

677
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,193
You were right, Sara.
I'm never gonna be a mindless clone.

678
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,202
I'm keeping the suit.

679
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,881
Your totem
is still governed by my powers.

680
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,970
No.

681
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,430
No.

682
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,056
What are you doing here?

683
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,104
I'm not here for you.

684
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,315
Get your ass up.

685
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,745
Nathaniel.

686
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,330
Love you, too.

687
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,542
Hardly seems like a fair fight.

688
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,165
Then I'd give up now.

689
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,176
I was talking about all of you.

690
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,932
If you cannot defeat me
in this vessel,

691
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,637
how will you stop me once
I've assumed my true form?

692
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,685
She's too strong. We have to leave.

693
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,938
I gave you life, Kuasa.

694
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,903
Offered you real power.

695
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,367
Family is true power.

696
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,863
I know you're in there
somewhere, Nora.

697
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,120
You have your father,
I have my grandmother.

698
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,040
We don't have to become our demons.

699
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,090
I like my demons.

700
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,769
Nana Baa.

701
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,096
Kuasa.

702
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,938
She should have known,

703
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,489
there's no running from Mallus.

704
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,440
- Amaya, we gotta get out of here.
- No!

705
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,144
- Amaya, we gotta go!
- Kuasa, no.

706
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,555
I'll do what you want,
just put me down.

707
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,020
Thanks.

708
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,140
No, it wasn't me, it was our totems.

709
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,567
Something's wrong.

710
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,151
It's Kuasa.

711
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,947
She's dead.

712
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Yeah.

713
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,830
I need a drink.

714
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,371
Gary, you cannot tell anyone
about what you saw in 2213.

715
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,080
If you do,
I will straight up kill you.

716
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,923
But, I'm terrible at keeping secrets,

717
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,092
and every time I close my eyes,
all I see is you.

718
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,573
- I'll never get it out of my head.
- I wouldn't worry about it, Gary.

719
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,305
Gary, right this way.
I got a flasher with your name on it.

720
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,440
If I had known
that was gonna happen...

721
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,112
It's not your fault.

722
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,323
Still, I shouldn't have gone
behind your back.

723
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,364
And I shouldn't have tried
to outsmart the Darhks on my own.

724
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,366
You wanted me to have my totem back,

725
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,325
and now I do.

726
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,582
Come on, Amaya, just say it,

727
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,707
I got Kuasa killed.

728
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,965
I got my granddaughter killed.

729
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,718
You?

730
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,845
How?

731
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,133
By goading her
to be more like her sister.

732
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,389
Kuasa wanted to prove
that she was worthy of this.

733
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,897
She died proving
that I was wrong about her,

734
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:00,477
by saving the life of a man
who threatened her existence.

735
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,402
Exactly, and if
I didn't get captured,

736
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,981
- then Kuasa would have...
- Was doomed either way.

737
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,907
I mean, that's how time works.

738
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,031
Well, clearly,
time wants my family to suffer.

739
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,489
Amaya, you have to believe
you're in charge of your own destiny.

740
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,999
You know, there are times that I wish
I had never set foot on this ship.

741
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,047
If I'd never left 1942,

742
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,377
I would have returned to Zambesi
like I was supposed to.

743
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,511
With no idea of the tragedy
that awaited me.

744
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,342
I would have died an old woman.

745
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,181
Murdered by warlords.

746
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,346
And you and I never would have met.

747
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,568
Is that what you want, Amaya?

748
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,649
I don't know, Nathaniel.

749
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,794
Mmm.

750
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,591
I thought you couldn't eat.

751
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,586
Yeah, I told Gideon to tell me

752
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,720
when sundown would have been,
if I had been at home.

753
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,799
I mean, Ramadan's just a stupid

754
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,633
1,400-year-old tradition
to you, right?

755
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,305
So, why am I even talking about it?

756
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,682
Well, uh, how about
if I help you heat it up?

757
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,025
Try it, it's good for you.

758
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,618
You know,
I can't stop thinking about Kuasa.

759
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,415
I felt her die.

760
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,584
Well, me too.

761
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,378
Mind you, she did try
to kill us a couple times.

762
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,340
But she was a totem bearer
and Amaya's granddaughter.

763
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,926
And the totems supposedly
connect us to something larger.

764
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,300
Yeah, for better or worse.

765
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,393
You know, I think that's kind of
why I still fast.

766
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,637
When I was little,
my mom tried to get me to do it,

767
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,348
and I wouldn't, but she did make me
learn how to cook Iftar,

768
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,606
it's the meal we eat
to break the fast.

769
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,612
And while she cooked,
she would say that Ramadan's

770
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,030
not just a time for honoring God,

771
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,779
but a time
to honor tradition, family,

772
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:14,995
community.

773
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,748
So, whenever I fast or cook Iftar,

774
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,539
it makes me feel connected to my mom.

775
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,249
I'm hungry.

776
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,009
Still pork.

777
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,842
Still good.

778
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,886
You all right?

779
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,887
You know, maybe you should wipe
my memory, too.

780
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,731
How am I supposed
to face the Time Bureau now,

781
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,137
knowing what I know about myself?

782
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,560
The same way that I faced my team.

783
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,405
We don't have the luxury
of running away and hiding,

784
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,357
not with the fight we have
ahead of us.

785
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,988
Our team's gonna need us
to lead them through this.

786
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,911
You know, there must be some reason

787
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,114
that I don't remember anything
about 2213.

788
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,040
Anything about being a clone.

789
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,627
I'm sure there is.

790
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,038
Who recruited you for the Bureau?

791
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,717
Rip.

792
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,132
Well, I bet you that entire bottle,

793
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,644
he's the one who wiped your file
from the Bureau

794
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,050
and put 2213 off-limits.

795
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,977
- Why would he do that to me?
- I don't know.

796
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,223
But we're gonna find out.

797
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,154
Gideon, initialize the time drive
and set a course.

798
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,445
<i>Traveling to this time period
is inadvisable.</i>

799
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,367
<i>I'm sure Captain Lance
would not allow it.</i>

800
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,537
Please, Gideon.
I have to save my granddaughter.

801
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,490
I have to save my family.

802
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,371
And no one is going to stop me.

803
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,085
Now, lock in the coordinates.

804
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:51,081
<i>Course set for the M'Changa Province
of Zambesi, 1992.</i>
