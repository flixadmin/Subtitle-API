1
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:51,361
PUSSY

2
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,082
Leave it there.

3
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,920
Enjoy your meal.

4
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:30,025
Hello?

5
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:33,403
<i>Hi, brother, it's me. How are you doing?</i>

6
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:37,407
Better if I knew how this happened.

7
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:39,451
<i>Gilberto, someone betrayed us.</i>

8
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:43,205
<i>Where the fuck were those pigs we pay?</i>

9
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:46,082
It was an American operation.
It was the DEA.

10
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:49,628
Our friends knew nothing about it.

11
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:53,548
Unless our friends
have been lying to us all along.

12
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:57,177
Maybe they need a reminder
what all that money was for.

13
00:04:58,762 --> 00:04:59,805
<i>Relax, Miguel.</i>

14
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:02,474
My situation will be rectified soon.

15
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:05,769
<i>The truth is that things
are getting more complicated</i>

16
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:09,231
and our friends in the North Valley
need reassurance.

17
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:12,400
You need to set a meeting with Henao.

18
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,653
<i>Compliment him.</i>

19
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,615
-On what?
-Doesn't matter. Offer him something.

20
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:22,410
<i>He likes tequila. Have a bottle ready.</i>

21
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,580
Tell him... this is just a small setback.

22
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:31,920
<i>In the meantime,
business goes on as usual.</i>

23
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:34,798
Increase your personal security.

24
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:37,926
<i>The Americans will come after you next.</i>

25
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:41,137
<i>Your freedom is our best leverage,
brother.</i>

26
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,932
Gilberto, this is getting dangerous.

27
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:48,103
What if there's a leak?

28
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,816
There may be.

29
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,443
Find out.

30
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,029
<i>I need to go, brother. I love you.</i>

31
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,781
I love you too, brother.

32
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,457
Justice can be hard to find.

33
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,752
And a man as powerful
as Gilberto Rodriguez

34
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,337
won't stay in custody for long.

35
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,133
If you want to keep him behind bars,
you need someone to testify.

36
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:09,095
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

37
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:13,892
I'm working on a high-level target.

38
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,688
I suggest you work fast,
because without it,

39
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:20,398
nothing else will matter.

40
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,738
<i>We went through the machine, sir.</i>

41
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,698
We've got nothing.

42
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,870
So what am I supposed to do with that?
What does this mean?

43
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,958
If somebody sold us out,
we'd know about it.

44
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:44,380
Like you knew about the raid?

45
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:50,512
Look, gentlemen...

46
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,848
I want to know why my brother
is sitting in a fucking cell.

47
00:09:57,352 --> 00:10:00,355
And if any one of us is involved in this,
I want to know by the end of the day.

48
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,361
Of course. Consider it done, sir.

49
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,709
Miguel's paranoid.

50
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,922
Maybe they used one of their spy planes
and spotted Gilberto from space.

51
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,760
You're not taking this seriously.

52
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,181
Miguel doesn't think they got lucky.
He thinks there's a leak.

53
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:38,309
And the system would tell us
about the leak.

54
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,312
This is about the surrender, right?

55
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:44,107
You're worried your retirement plans
are ruined now.

56
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:45,817
Listen to me.

57
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:49,821
People love drama, brother. You know that.

58
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:51,739
This isn't drama. He wants names.

59
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:54,367
And there's no reason to think
they couldn't be ours, Carlo.

60
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,411
We designed the system.

61
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:09,966
Mr. Cordova.

62
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:15,680
80? Anything good?

63
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:20,018
Just a bunch of shit-talking.
Gossip. Typical.

64
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:23,354
And what about internally?
Anyone suspicious you've flagged?

65
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:25,356
No, not really.

66
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,526
Truth is, I have no idea
who would rat these guys out.

67
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,696
I want to hear everything you've flagged
all the same. Quickly.

68
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:35,200
Yes, sir. I'll get that right away.

69
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,253
<i>These guys were supposed to have
all this under control.</i>

70
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,756
<i>But it's clear they don't.</i>

71
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:54,844
<i>I thought those guys
were supposed to surrender.</i>

72
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:56,679
<i>Does this mean it's not happening?</i>

73
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,433
<i>Somebody tipped off the Americans,
stabbed us in the back.</i>

74
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:08,608
<i>Where was his fucking security team?
What do they pay them for?</i>

75
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,780
<i>They better do something quick,</i>

76
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:16,491
<i>or else it's going to be
every man for himself.</i>

77
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:25,792
You have many powerful allies,
Don Gilberto.

78
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,294
Your situation pains them deeply.

79
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:32,006
We're confident this will soon be
behind us. The surrender will proceed.

80
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:35,093
But we need to wait.
It's a matter of time.

81
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,178
Wait for what?

82
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:40,598
For the government to do something
they already agreed to? Fuck.

83
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:42,475
What did Medina say?

84
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,523
Currently, we don't have
an official position from Santiago Medina.

85
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:49,983
Why not?

86
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:57,365
Because we're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting.

87
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,077
Are you fucking kidding me?

88
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:02,870
You didn't talk to him yet?

89
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:06,165
You're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting?

90
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:08,751
I don't wait on him!

91
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,670
He waits on me!

92
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:12,839
You go to his office and fix this mess!

93
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:16,592
And remind him who the fuck
Gilberto Rodriguez is!

94
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:21,139
For fuck's sake! Open this damn thing!

95
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,684
Nicolas, your father needs to understand
his arrest changes things.

96
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,603
It's political now.

97
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:31,024
Dad?

98
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:34,944
Sometimes you have to put on
a little show.

99
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,155
Helps bring the best out of people.

100
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:39,407
I need to talk to Medina.

101
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:41,367
I don't want you anywhere near this.

102
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,620
Dad, the circle is too big.

103
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,957
Medina won't meet anyone he can't trust.
He won't trust the lawyers.

104
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,919
But he will trust you?

105
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:54,756
Yes, I'm your son.

106
00:13:55,757 --> 00:13:59,010
That's right. And you'll obey my wishes.

107
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:54,459
You want something to drink?

108
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,753
I never refuse.

109
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,600
That's a great shirt, no?

110
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:15,188
That pocket...

111
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,316
on the left.

112
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,321
Where the heart is.

113
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:37,001
Hey, this situation with Gilberto,

114
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:38,794
what a disgrace, huh?

115
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:43,299
After all your family's done
for this city. For this country.

116
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:50,556
Just the gringos meddling
where they shouldn't.

117
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:54,560
But our friends in Bogotà
are working to...

118
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:58,231
rectify the situation.

119
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:03,402
Business proceeds as usual, right?

120
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:06,822
And how does this clerical error
affect the timeline of the surrender?

121
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:12,245
As I said...

122
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,289
this was just a mistake.

123
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:17,166
Nothing more.

124
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:21,546
Glad to hear that.

125
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,943
I see a lot of new faces.

126
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:11,721
Did you notice that?

127
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,641
The woman, the Salazar girl?

128
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,351
The fear.

129
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,104
Miguel was scared.

130
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,403
These guys are in big trouble.

131
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:38,664
Little early for number three, no?

132
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,542
The fuck else am I supposed to do
around here?

133
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,169
You didn't have to come.

134
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,963
Who else was gonna watch your back?

135
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:53,846
You gonna tell me what went down
in Juérez?

136
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:55,306
I told you...

137
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,933
we talked.

138
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,897
The Mexican made you an offer.

139
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:05,691
Didn't he?

140
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:12,073
Yes.

141
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,992
Pretty good one, too.

142
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,665
He says we're getting out
at the wrong time.

143
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,919
Maybe he's right.

144
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:29,757
Gilberto's in jail.

145
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:33,969
Maybe this is fate.

146
00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:12,610
No, the bill, please.

147
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:14,320
Compliments of the gentleman.

148
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,372
Thank you, but I don't...

149
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:05,783
The bill.

150
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:11,372
And they don't appear
on the next flights either?

151
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:22,007
Motherfucking gringos
never got on a plane back to Bogotà.

152
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:26,178
-Our friend with the badge lied to us.
-Or he made a mistake.

153
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,555
There are no mistakes.

154
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:38,649
Hey. Here he comes.

155
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:41,360
There he is, the fucking bastard.

156
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:45,531
I would have gladly met you
in the usual place.

157
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,325
That's what you're worried about?

158
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:52,788
How about earning the money we pay you
to keep our bosses out of jail?

159
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:55,749
-You couldn't give a fuck about that.
-The fuck you want from me?

160
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:59,253
Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.
All that shit came out of Bogotà.

161
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,838
By the time we knew
what they were up to...

162
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:04,466
Martinez had already been
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,

163
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,343
you useless piece of shit.

164
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:10,764
You know what else is odd?

165
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,476
It looks like the DEA never left Cali.

166
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,520
And you were the one who confirmed.

167
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,649
You. Only you confirmed those two fucking
gringos took the plane to Bogotà.

168
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:29,241
Do you know where you are?

169
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:32,411
You want to hang me out to dry
with your boss? Do you know where you are?

170
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:39,752
I asked the Americans how they found
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?

171
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:42,463
They followed someone there.

172
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:49,470
I know it wasn't me.

173
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,032
Fucking Calderón.

174
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:12,951
What he said made sense.

175
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:16,497
The DEA followed someone
to Gilberto's house.

176
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:20,751
It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows
who he is and where he works.

177
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:24,171
They must have come back
and tailed him to Gilberto.

178
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:32,513
Didn't you say you drove Pallomari
to Gilberto's that night?

179
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:41,563
It could just as easily have been me
driving him.

180
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,318
Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?

181
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,530
You think Miguel will let this slide?

182
00:26:51,448 --> 00:26:53,117
Not a fucking chance.

183
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:56,620
Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,
it comes back on you,

184
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:58,330
and then we're both fucked.

185
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:01,500
The only thing we need is a name,
and we have it.

186
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:06,088
We have to get on the same page here.

187
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:10,509
Calderón told us those fuckers from
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotà, right?

188
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,178
He burned us.

189
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:16,849
He is the one responsible
for what happened.

190
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:19,184
He's a dirty cop...

191
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:23,397
who takes money from a drug cartel.

192
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,654
But you and me, we are brothers.

193
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:45,127
Let me cut to the chase.
My father still wants to retire.

194
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,593
I didn't realize you were taking such
an active role in your father's affairs.

195
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:59,641
No other choice when friends
don't return our lawyer's calls.

196
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:02,186
Of course.

197
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:05,731
Well, then...

198
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:08,901
tell your father there is still a path
to what he wants most.

199
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:17,284
No one here is happy
with the current predicament.

200
00:28:18,285 --> 00:28:21,288
The DEA blindsided all of us, and it's
been difficult to carry out our old deal.

201
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:26,793
"Old deal"?

202
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:37,346
Politics is about appearances.

203
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,849
For us, it's extremely difficult
to accept the surrender terms of a man

204
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:43,852
who's already in prison.

205
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:47,314
That just looks bad.

206
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:53,278
But different terms...

207
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:55,489
new terms...

208
00:28:57,532 --> 00:28:58,867
What do you say?

209
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,338
So what did you find out?

210
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:17,052
The DEA team Calderón was escorting
never left Cali.

211
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:19,763
He reported that they had.

212
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,310
What do you think, Jorge?

213
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,604
It was a mistake.

214
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:30,482
Born of incompetence.

215
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:33,694
The DEA got lucky...

216
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:36,071
and Calderón took the bait.

217
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,742
Well, we're not paying for incompetence.

218
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:45,539
Besides, that doesn't explain
how they found my brother.

219
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:49,293
How did they get that information?
Was that also Calderon?

220
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:52,129
It's unlikely.

221
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:56,216
It's possible the DEA used
some high-end aerial surveillance.

222
00:30:03,765 --> 00:30:07,728
From here on out, keep an eye on Calderón.

223
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:11,940
Limit what we tell him.

224
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,776
No more lapses in security.

225
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:16,403
Yes, sir.

226
00:30:32,794 --> 00:30:33,670
Thank you, Jorge.

227
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:37,924
It's either him or us.

228
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:41,762
What if they kill him?

229
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,223
They wouldn't kill a cop.

230
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,896
But they can question him.
And then what? What?

231
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:55,275
By the time they get to it,
this shit will all be over.

232
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,054
Hello?

233
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:27,224
<i>Good afternoon. Someone is here for you,
Mrs. Jurado. Mr. Eliot Ness.</i>

234
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,138
Don't you even want to know what he said?

235
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,351
How dare you disregard my wishes.

236
00:34:18,144 --> 00:34:20,230
Nobody was going to get into a room
with Medina, and I did...

237
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:23,400
I don't want you involved.
I won't even discuss it.

238
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,696
The old deal is dead.

239
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:36,830
But we can make a new one,
with certain adjustments.

240
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,377
Motherfuckers.

241
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:47,132
Adjustments how?

242
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:51,136
There has to be some jail time.

243
00:34:51,886 --> 00:34:55,890
For you, Uncle Miguel, Pacho, and Chepe.

244
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:57,392
Three years.

245
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:00,520
Three years? No chance.

246
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:05,191
You surrender your illegal assets,
do the three years,

247
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:10,614
and the legitimate assets, the cash,
the business, will all be retained.

248
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,200
That's not the deal.
And you won't speak of this again.

249
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,785
Dad, stop being so stubborn!

250
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:32,302
You don't get to surrender.

251
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:34,387
You are in jail.

252
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:36,181
You are a narco-trafficker.

253
00:35:36,348 --> 00:35:39,351
No politician is going to stand up
and say, "Let him go,"

254
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:44,481
no matter how much money
you've put in his pocket.

255
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:48,943
But son, it's three years...

256
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:58,244
It's not the old deal,
but it's a good one.

257
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,289
The best we're going to get.

258
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,461
But there's one loose end.

259
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:11,091
Medina is worried about his exposure.

260
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:17,180
More specifically, the accountant...
Pallomari.

261
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:19,599
He knows too much.

262
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:18,092
The Americans are back
on the accountant's office,

263
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:19,928
<i>hoping he shows.</i>

264
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:22,889
Knowing that idiot, he might.

265
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,644
If that's all they've got,
then they don't have much.

266
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:30,647
<i>Stay on them.</i>

267
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:34,234
<i>Find out where they sleep at night.</i>

268
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:36,110
All right.

269
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:39,656
Hey, boss. You doing okay?

270
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,783
<i>You sound tired.</i>

271
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:44,744
Yeah. I'm fine.

272
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:47,330
Keep me posted.

273
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,550
-How was the science test?
-Good.

274
00:38:58,716 --> 00:38:59,884
Daddy!

275
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:01,678
Daddy!

276
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:05,223
My princess. Hello, my princesses.
How are you all?

277
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,267
Hello. What are you doing here?

278
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:08,643
Hi, my love.

279
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,062
Was it your turn or mine
to pick up the girls?

280
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:14,899
Yours. I was in the neighbourhood.
Just wanted to see how my girls are doing.

281
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:18,027
-Daddy, today we have piano lessons.
-I know, my love.

282
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:20,321
My little virtuosos.

283
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,490
And you? Everything okay?

284
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:24,117
I'm fine.

285
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:28,162
I just felt like I needed to see my girls.
That's why I came.

286
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:32,709
Excuse me.

287
00:39:36,212 --> 00:39:39,215
Looks like I have to go.
Would you excuse me? Okay?

288
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:44,596
-Girls... I love you.
-Bye.

289
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,472
Bye, be good.

290
00:39:49,851 --> 00:39:53,229
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-What can I do for you, David?

291
00:39:53,396 --> 00:39:57,108
<i>My dad called a meeting. Top personnel.</i>

292
00:39:57,692 --> 00:40:00,570
What do you mean, a meeting?
We just had one.

293
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:02,614
<i>Well, we're having another one.</i>

294
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,242
<i>2611 Avenida 14. Out by Jamundi.
See you there.</i>

295
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:24,344
<i>It's Carlo Cordova, leave a message.</i>

296
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,429
Carlo, I just talked to David.

297
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:28,681
Are you on your way to the meeting?
Call me.

298
00:42:52,825 --> 00:42:55,119
<i>It's Carlo Cordova, leave a message.</i>

299
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:11,677
I'm sitting there,
enjoying my dick getting sucked,

300
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:14,764
when all of the sudden she stops.

301
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,559
I open my eyes and I ask her, "What's up?"

302
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:21,562
She's all quiet, looking at me like this.

303
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:23,147
Not a word.

304
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:26,567
I'm like, "What the fuck?"
I turn to see Toque.

305
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:29,737
Fuck, he has a gun pointed at him.
Like this.

306
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:35,409
And the other girl,
the one with the gun, says to me:

307
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:39,330
"Give me the money,
or she bites your dick off."

308
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,965
-So what did you do?
-I gave her the fucking money!

309
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:51,467
I even tipped her, Pacho.

310
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,219
You don't mess around with that.

311
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:55,471
-You want some ice?
-Sure.

312
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:00,893
I'm having a great time.

313
00:44:01,394 --> 00:44:03,354
I'm heading to Juérez tomorrow.

314
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,775
Got some business with my partners.

315
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:11,112
What am I going to tell them, Pacho?

316
00:44:12,113 --> 00:44:15,116
I want to give them an answer.
Some good news.

317
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:25,835
My turn to tell you a story, Amado.

318
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,798
About the time my father
found me in my room with a boy.

319
00:44:30,965 --> 00:44:34,302
Hey, I never judged you for that stuff.

320
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:39,557
My father told me I wasn't a man,
that I'd never be one.

321
00:44:39,932 --> 00:44:41,475
It was the last time he spoke to me.

322
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:43,853
What a fucking bastard.

323
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:48,691
For a long time, I thought he was right.

324
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:51,485
Even after I started working
for Gilberto and Miguel.

325
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:55,156
Up until the day some motherfucker
told them I was a faggot.

326
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,952
And that it was a mistake
to let me be part of the business.

327
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:04,790
You know what they did?

328
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:09,629
They made me a partner.

329
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:15,593
Gilberto, Miguel, and Chepe,
they are my family.

330
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:19,597
I can't just leave them
when they need me the most.

331
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,311
What can I say?

332
00:45:27,396 --> 00:45:30,399
I admire your loyalty.
You're one of a kind.

333
00:45:34,403 --> 00:45:35,655
There you go.

334
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:25,997
You better get inside.
Don't want to be late.

335
00:46:48,894 --> 00:46:50,313
Has your dad arrived?

336
00:46:52,064 --> 00:46:53,316
No, not yet.

337
00:46:54,817 --> 00:46:55,776
Let's go.

338
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:37,276
Let me go, asshole!

339
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,783
Let me go, motherfucker!

340
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:47,370
You don't have the balls!

341
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,122
Let me go!

342
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:02,718
Up!

343
00:48:06,722 --> 00:48:08,474
You motherfucker.

344
00:48:09,058 --> 00:48:10,976
What the fuck did you tell them,
motherfucker?

345
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:14,188
Gilberto getting caught wasn't on me.

346
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:17,274
You feel so safe, motherfucker.

347
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:19,735
When it's your turn...

348
00:49:21,297 --> 00:49:22,590
He was a tiger.

349
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:27,470
Let's go.

350
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,959
What the fuck is this?

351
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:01,337
Tell him what you did.

352
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:05,674
Tell him. Tell him where we caught you.

353
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,930
While you were visiting
your wife and children,

354
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:14,808
this fucking rat
was on his way to the airport.

355
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:17,978
With his wife, bags packed.

356
00:50:19,021 --> 00:50:22,316
About to leave you holding the blame.
Your friend, Jorge.

357
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,402
You had your bitch follow me?

358
00:50:27,112 --> 00:50:30,241
-What did you say?
-Me? And my children?

359
00:50:31,575 --> 00:50:34,286
You should be thankful, motherfucker.

360
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,123
It's why you're standing there...
instead of sitting next to him.

361
00:50:41,043 --> 00:50:43,754
You're making a big mistake, David.

362
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:46,882
I don't give a fuck what you think.

363
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,719
He's a loyal man. He always has been.

364
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:54,014
-He's a piece of shit, Jorge.
-He's a good man and loyal.

365
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:56,016
-A good man? Then why was he running?
-What are you doing?

366
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:58,602
-This is a good man...
-He's a fucking snitch!

367
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,950
Look at me.

368
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:15,286
Sophia is inside.

369
00:51:16,287 --> 00:51:18,205
She's inside that room.

370
00:51:20,082 --> 00:51:23,168
Don't let them touch her.
Don't let them put a hand on Sophia.

371
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:24,920
She has nothing to do with this, brother.

372
00:51:25,504 --> 00:51:27,715
These fucking bastards are crazy.
They want to...

373
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:28,716
David, no!

374
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,432
Your friend was right, Jorge.

375
00:51:37,016 --> 00:51:38,392
Go check on Sophia.

376
00:52:14,595 --> 00:52:17,806
My brother is in prison
because we were weak.

377
00:52:19,642 --> 00:52:22,227
Because mistakes were made.

378
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,483
Because we allowed people
to be dishonest with us.

379
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:35,741
These are the consequences.

380
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:42,873
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

381
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:53,801
Jorge, when he tried to run,

382
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:57,805
he proved he was willing
to turn against us, all of us.

383
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:02,643
Men with nothing to hide don't run, right?

384
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:11,485
Now... I trust you can take over
Cordova's responsibilities.

385
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:20,494
As our new head of security, Jorge.

386
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:22,246
What do you think?

387
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,965
I'm glad I can count on you.

388
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:39,782
My little girl, you're going to eat
a little bit of salad, okay?

389
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:43,285
Vera is going to teach you.
Look how much she ate.

390
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:46,455
Just a bit, sweetie.
Please, just eat a little bit.

391
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:50,501
-Hi. I thought you'd be home later.
-Daddy's here!

392
00:54:54,213 --> 00:54:55,631
Give me a minute.

393
00:56:21,884 --> 00:56:24,887
