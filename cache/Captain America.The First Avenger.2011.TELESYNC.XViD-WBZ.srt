Captions synched to:
Captain America:First Avenger.TS.XVID.V2.IMAGiNE

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:06,000
Lovingly cooked by Bakemstr

3
00:00:56,394 --> 00:00:58,232
You the guys from Washington?

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,170
You get many other visitors out here?

5
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,775
How long you been on site?

6
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,878
Since this morning.

7
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:06,307
A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.

8
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,668
How come nobody's spotted it before?

9
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,480
It's really not that surprising.

10
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:13,000
This landscapes changing all the time.

11
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,584
You got any idea what this thing is exactly?

12
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,619
I don't know, it's probably a weather balloon.

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,915
I don't think so.

14
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,814
You know we don't have the
equipment for a job like this.

15
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:23,463
How long before we can start craning it out?

16
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,050
I don't think you quite understand.

17
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:28,292
You guys are going to need one hell of a crane.

18
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,601
Base, we're aft.

19
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:23,850
What is this?

20
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,595
Careful.

21
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:02,722
Lieutenant.

22
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:08,894
- What is it?
- My god.

23
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,462
Mays, give me a line to the Colonel.

24
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:14,023
It's 3am, sir.

25
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,803
I don't care what time it is.

26
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:18,466
This one's waited long enough.

27
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,580
Tønsberg, Norway
March - 1942

28
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:35,099
They've come for it.

29
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,205
They have before.

30
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,154
Not like this.

31
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,442
Let them come.

32
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:42,988
They'll never find it.

33
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:31,636
Open it.

34
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:34,772
Why can't you find it?

35
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:50,336
It has taken me a long time to find this place.

36
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:54,600
You should be commended.

37
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:56,350
Help him up.

38
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,822
I think that you are a man of great vision.

39
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:06,581
And in this way we are much alike.

40
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:08,282
I am nothing like you.

41
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:12,061
Of course but what others see as superstition,

42
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,434
you and I know to be of science.

43
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,714
What you seek is just a legend.

44
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,018
Then why make such an effort to conceal it?

45
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,107
The tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

46
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:53,064
It's not something one buries.

47
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:58,258
But I think it is close, yes.

48
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,144
I cannot help you.

49
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,236
No.

50
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,899
But maybe you can help your, uh village?

51
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,063
You must have some friends out there.

52
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,829
Some little grandchildren, perhaps.

53
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,777
You have no need for them to die.

54
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,099
Yggdrasil.

55
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:32,245
The Tree of the world.

56
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,586
Guardian of wisdom.

57
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,703
And fate for some.

58
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:15,554
And the Führer digs for trinkets in the desert.

59
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,977
You have never seen this.

60
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:22,106
Have you?

61
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,223
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

62
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:27,827
Exactly.

63
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:33,124
Give the order to open fire.

64
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:34,536
Jawohl.

65
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,536
Fool.

66
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,706
You cannot control the power you hold.

67
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,069
You will burn.

68
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,450
I already have.

69
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,818
O'Connell, Michael.

70
00:07:57,807 --> 00:07:59,781
Kaminski, Henry.

71
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,144
Boy a lot of guys getting killed over there.

72
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,927
Rogers, Stephen.

73
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,955
Kinda makes you think
twice about enlisting, huh?

74
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,451
Nope.

75
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,928
Rogers.

76
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:21,421
What did your father die of?

77
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:22,421
Mustard gas.

78
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,549
He was in the 107th infantry.

79
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,960
- I was hoping I could be assigned.
- Mother?

80
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,732
She was a nurse in a TB ward.

81
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,322
Got hit.

82
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:32,478
Couldn't shake it.

83
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,616
Sorry son.

84
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,751
Well just give me a chance.

85
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,912
You'll be ineligible on your asthma alone.

86
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:43,036
Is there anything you can do?

87
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:44,039
I'm doing it.

88
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:45,780
I'm saving your life.

89
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:52,782
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

90
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,409
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

91
00:08:56,366 --> 00:09:00,298
<i>Every able bodied young man is

92
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:06,036
<i>Even little Timmy is doing his part.</i>

93
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,536
<i>Collecting scrap metal.</i>

94
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:10,232
<i>Nice work, Timmy.</i>

95
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,294
Who cares!

96
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,049
Play the movie already.

97
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,965
Hey, want to show some respect.

98
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:17,217
<i>Meanwhile, over seas...</i>

99
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:19,953
<i>..our brave boys are showing the axis powers...</i>

100
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:22,435
<i>..that the price of freedom is never to high.</i>

101
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,906
Let's go, get on with it.

102
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,670
Hey, just start the cartoon.

103
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:28,920
Hey, you want to shut up.

104
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,168
<i>Together with allied forces,</i>

105
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:34,117
<i>we'll face any threat, no matter the size.</i>

106
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,305
You just don't know when to give up, do you.

107
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,116
I can do this all day.

108
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,940
Hey, pick on someone your own size.

109
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,454
Sometimes I think you like getting punched.

110
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:15,720
I had him on the ropes.

111
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,715
How many times is this?

112
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,731
Oh, your from Paramus now.

113
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,570
You know it's illegal to lie
on your enlistment form.

114
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,296
Seriously, Jersey?

115
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:29,268
You get your orders?

116
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:33,645
107th.

117
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,314
Sergeant James Barnes.

118
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:37,384
Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.

119
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:42,232
I should be going.

120
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:47,551
Come on, man.

121
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,231
My last night.

122
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,647
Gotta get you cleaned off.

123
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:52,047
Why, where we going?

124
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:53,732
The future.

125
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,394
I don't see what the problem is.

126
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:03,142
You're about to be the last
eligible man in New York.

127
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:05,421
You know there's three and a half women here.

128
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,474
Yeah, I'd settle for just one.

129
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,729
Good thing I took care of that.

130
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,455
Hey, Bucky!

131
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,023
What'd you tell her about me?

132
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,335
Only the good stuff.

133

<i>Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion.</i>

00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,363
Oh my god.

138
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:34,878
It's starting.

139
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,233
Ladies and Gentlemen,

140
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:40,062
Mr. Howard Stark.

141
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,987
Ladies and Gentlemen.

142
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:59,390
What if I told you that in just a few short years,

143
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:04,332
Your automobile won't even
have to touch the ground, at all.

144
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,130
Yes.

145
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,565
Thanks, Mandy.

146
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,972
With Starks Gravitic reversion technology.

147
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:12,977
You'll be able to do just that.

148
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:22,614
Holy cow.

149
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:36,900
Well I did say a few years, didn't I?

150
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:49,031
Hey, Steve.
What do you say we treat these girls...

151
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,780
Come on, Soldier.

152
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,773
Come on, kinda missing
the point of a double date.

153
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:08,282
We're taking the girls dancing.

154
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,025
You go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

155
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:14,896
You really gonna do this again?

156
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:17,440
Well it's a fair, I'm going to try my luck.

157
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,443
As who, Steve from Ohio?

158
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,786
They'll catch you or worse they'll actually take you.

159
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:23,440
Look I know you don't think I can do this.

160
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,207
This isn't a back alley, Steve, it's war.

161
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,070
- I know it's a war.
- Then find kin to fight,

162
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:28,207
..start looking for a job.

163
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,909
- What am I going to do, collect scrap.
- Yes, I know that I'm

164
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,586
I'm not going to sit in a factory, Bucky.

165
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:35,241
Bucky come on, there are
men laying down their lives.

166
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,406
I got no right to do any less than them.

167
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:39,676
That's what you don't understand.

168
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:41,425
This isn't about me.

169
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,489
Right.

170
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,406
'Cause you got nothing to prove.

171
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,980
Hey Barnes. Are we going dancing?

172
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,124
Yes we are.

173
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,887
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

174
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,883
How can I?

175
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,570
You're taking all the stupid with you.

176
00:14:07,676 --> 00:14:08,824
You're a punk.

177
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,146
Jerk.

178
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,086
Careful.

179
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,856
Don't win the war 'til I get there.

180
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:25,475
Come on girls, playing our song.

181
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:45,804
Wait here.

182
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:48,388
Is there a problem?

183
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:49,718
Just wait here.

184
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:10,015
Thank you.

185
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,829
So.

186
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:17,620
You want to go overseas.

187
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,785
Kill some Nazis.

188
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:21,425
Excuse me.

189
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:24,013
Doctor Abraham Erskine.

190
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:27,044
I represent a Strategic scientific research.

191
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:28,002
Steve Rogers.

192
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,601
Where are you from?

193
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:35,313
Queens.

194
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:38,405
73rd street and Utopla parkway.

195
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,562
Before that, Germany.

196
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:43,208
This troubles you?

197
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,582
No.

198
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:47,509
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?
Hmm?

199
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,397
Is it, New Haven?

200
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,912
Or, Paramus?

201
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,681
Five exams in five different...

202
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:56,396
It might not be the right file.

203
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:58,307
It's not the exams I'm interested in.

204
00:15:58,308 --> 00:15:59,823
It's the five tries.

205
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:03,032
But you didn't answer my question.

206
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,065
Do you want to kill Nazis?

207
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:09,679
Is this a test?

208
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:11,435
Yes.

209
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:16,432
I don't want to kill anyone.

210
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:18,768
I don't like bullies.

211
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,570
I don't care where they're from.

212
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:25,911
Well, there are already so many
big men fighting this war.

213
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:27,939
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

214
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Huh?

215
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,844
I can offer you a chance.

216
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,229
Only a chance.

217
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:36,148
I'll take it.

218
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,381
Good.

219
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:40,036
So where is the little guy from?

220
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,475
Actually.

221
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,610
Brooklyn.

222
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:47,507
Congratulations.

223
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,965
Soldier.

224
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:14,530
Are you ready, Doctor Zola?

225
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:19,762
The machine requires the most delicate calibration.

226
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,187
Forgive me if I seem over cautious.

227
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,412
Are you certain that those combatants of yours

228
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,664
...can withstand the energy surge,

229
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,395
...long enough for a transference?

230
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,651
With this artifact.

231
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,665
I am certain of nothing.

232
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,306
I fear it may not work at all.

233
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,157
Twenty percent.

234
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:18,503
Forty.

235
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:22,408
Sixty.

236
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:27,884
Stabilizing at seventy percent.

237
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,925
I have not come all this way,

238
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:33,594
...for safety, Doctor.

239
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:53,109
What was that?

240
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,797
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

241
00:18:57,193 --> 00:18:59,795
Your designs does not disappoint.

242
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,567
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

243
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:07,849
Nothing has changed, it's stable.

244
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:09,246
Amazing.

245
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:14,379
The energy patch, you called it,
equipped all my designs.

246
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,005
All my designs.

247
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,708
This will change the war.

248
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,906
Don't think so, Zola.

249
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:27,604
This will change the world.

250
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:33,227
Recruits, attention!

251
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,266
Gentlemen, I'm Agent Carter.

252
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:39,157
I supervise all operations for this division.

253
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,299
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

254
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,661
Thought I was signing up for the U.S. army.

255
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:45,798
What's your name, soldier?

256
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:47,919
Gilmore Hodge, your majesty.

257
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,130
Step forward, Hodge.

258
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,511
Put your right foot forward.

259
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,884
We gonna wrestle?

260
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,576
'Cause I gotta a few moves I know you'll like.

261
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,836
Agent Carter.

262
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:05,426
Colonel Phillips.

263
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:08,669
I can see that you are breaking
in the candidates, that's good.

264
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:10,698
Get your ass up out of that dirt,

265
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:11,987
..and stand up in that lineup at attention until,

266
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:14,275
- ...somebody comes and tells you what to do.
- Yes, Sir.

267
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:19,336
General Patton.

268
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:20,550
Has said.

269
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:24,492
<i>"War's are fought with weapons
but they are won by men."</i>

270
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,764
We are going to win this war, because...

271
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:28,686
...we have the best men.

272
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,433
And because they're gonna get better.

273
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:36,767
Much, better.

274
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,647
The Strategic Scientific Reserve.

275
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:41,618
Is an allied effort.

276
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:44,391
Made up with the best minds of the free world.

277
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,314
Our goal.

278
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,443
Is to create the best army in history.

279
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,104
But every army starts with one man.

280
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,350
Rogers! Get up from there.

281
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,404
At the end of this week, we will chose that man.

282
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,090
He'll be the first.

283
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:59,791
Of a new breed of super soldiers.

284
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,263
Rogers, get your ass out of that line.

285
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:11,489
And they, will personally escort Adolph Hitler

286
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,039
Through the gates of hell.

287
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:15,214
Pick up the pace, sweeties.

288
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,805
Let's go, let's go.

289
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:19,346
Double time.

290
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:22,791
Come on, faster, faster.

291
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:23,832
Move.

292
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,050
Move.

293
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,141
Squad halt.

294
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,915
That flag means you're only at the half way point.

295
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:34,436
First man to bring it to me,
gets to ride back with Agent Carter.

296
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,942
Move, move!

297
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:38,694
Come on, get up there.

298
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,094
That's what you got?
This army is in trouble.

299
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,537
Get up there, Hodge.

300
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:45,709
Come on, get up there.

301
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:50,852
Nobody's got that flag in seventeen years.

302
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:55,542
Come on, come on, fall in.

303
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:57,900
Let's go, get back in formation.

304
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,470
Rogers!

305
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:03,075
I said, fall in.

306
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,277
Thank you, Sir.

307
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,855
Faster ladies, come on.

308
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,621
My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul.
Move it!

309
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,658
You're not really thinking
of picking Rogers, are you?

310
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:40,779
I am more than just thinking about it.

311
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,008
It is a clear choice.

312
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:44,638
When you brought a modicum
asthmatic onto my army base.

313
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,817
I let it slide. I thought what the hell.

314
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:48,519
Maybe he could be useful to you, like a gerbil.

315
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,645
- Never thought you'd pick him.
- Up.

316
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:56,111
Stick a needle in that kids arm,
it's going to go right through him.

317
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:57,112
Come on, girls.

318
00:22:57,773 --> 00:22:58,558
Look at that.

319
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,226
He's making me cry.

320
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:03,575
I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.

321
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,844
Do you know how long it
took to set up this project.

322
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:07,600
-Yes.
- All the groveling I had to do in front...

323
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:08,705
...of Senator whats-his-name committees.

324
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,733
Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.

325
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:11,849
Then throw me a bone.

326
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,986
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

327
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,302
He's big, he's fast.

328
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:17,778
- He obeys orders, he's a soldier.
- He's a bully.

329
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:20,368
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.

330
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,527
You win wars, with guts.

331
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,907
Grenade!

332
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:31,051
Oh, no!

333
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,512
Stay away.

334
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:37,319
Get back.

335
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:46,505
Phony grenade.

336
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:49,772
Men, back in formation.

337
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:54,898
Is this a test?

338
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:57,963
He's still skinny.

339
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:07,893
- May I?
- Yeah.

340
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:12,379
Can't sleep?

341
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,800
Got the jitters I guess.

342
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,614
Oh, me too.

343
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:20,100
Can I ask you a question?

344
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,538
Just one?

345
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:25,111
Why me?

346
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,975
I suppose that is the one question that matters.

347
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,011
This is from Augsburg.

348
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:37,463
My City.

349
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:43,937
So many people forget that the first
country the Nazi's invaded was their own.

350
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,300
You know after the last war they,

351
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,559
My peoples struggled, they..they..

352
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,935
They felt weak, they felt..

353
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,355
...slow, then Hitler comes along.

354
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:54,999
With the marching and the big show,
and the flags and all that

355
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:59,036
And he, hears of me.

356
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:01,284
My work, and he finds me.

357
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,573
Then he says, you.

358
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:05,737
He says, you will make us strong.

359
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:06,943
Well.

360
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,239
I am not interested.

361
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:12,470
So he sends the head of Hydra.

362
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:14,509
East research division.

363
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:17,688
A brilliant Scientist by the name of, Johann Schmidt.

364
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,141
Now Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.

365
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:21,920
And he's ambitious.

366
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,565
Even Hitler shares his passion for,

367
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,559
occult power and tatanic myth.

368
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:31,301
Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.

369
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:33,581
But for Schmidt it is not fantasy.

370
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:35,454
For him, it is real.

371
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:38,528
He has become convinced
that there is a great power.

372
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:39,965
Hidden in the earth.

373
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,041
Left here by the gods.

374
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,698
Waiting to be seized by superior men.

375
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:46,948
So when he has found my
formula and what it can do.

376
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:49,362
He cannot resist.

377
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,208
Schmidt wants to become that superior man.

378
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:01,814
Did it make him stronger?

379
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:02,833
Ja.

380
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,689
But, it has other effects.

381
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:12,401
The serum wasn't ready.

382
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,497
But more important.

383
00:26:15,164 --> 00:26:16,774
The man.

384
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:20,206
The serum amplifies everything
that is inside, so..

385
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:22,328
Good becomes great.

386
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:24,939
Bad becomes worse.

387
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,404
This is why you were chosen.

388
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:33,830
Because a strong man.

389
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,244
Who has known power all his life.

390
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:38,075
They lose respect for that power.

391
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:39,278
But a weak man.

392
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:41,862
Who values of strength.

393
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:43,614
And loves

394
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:45,458
Compassion.

395
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:51,062
Thanks.
I think.

396
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:54,949
Give this.

397
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:59,977
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

398
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:05,166
That you must stay who you are.

399
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,854
Not a perfect soldier.

400
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:11,548
But.

401
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,448
A good man.

402
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:20,336
To the little guys.

403
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:24,877
No, wait, wait. What am I doing?

404
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:26,521
No, you have procedure tomorrow.

405
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:27,471
No fluids.

406
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,822
All right, we'll drink it after.

407
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:32,093
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.

408
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:33,604
I can't after, I can now.

409
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,878
Is there something in particular you need?

410
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,647
I uh, understand you found  him.

411
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:02,874
See for yourself.

412
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,746
You disapprove.

413
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,231
I just don't see why you
need concern yourself.

414
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:22,483
I can't imagine he'll succeed.

415
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,464
Again.

416
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:29,104
The serum is the allies only defense.

417
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:30,916
against this power we now possess.

418
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,910
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

419
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,422
I shall give the order.

420
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,928
It has been given.

421
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:45,539
Good.

422
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:49,857
Doctor Zola.

423
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:54,807
What do you think?

424
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:03,474
Masterpiece.

425
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:15,855
I know this neighborhood.

426
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,215
I got beat up in that alley.

427
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:21,841
And that parking lot.

428
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:25,201
And behind that dinner.

429
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,247
Did you have something against running away?

430
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:33,430
You start running they'll never let you stop.

431
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:35,667
You stand up, push back.

432
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,606
You can't say no forever, right.

433
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,922
I know a little of what that's like.

434
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,816
To have every door shut in your face.

435
00:29:42,462 --> 00:29:44,653
I guess I just don't know why you
would want to join the army.

436
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:47,483
You're a beautiful dame.
Beautifu..oh a woman. I mean...

437
00:29:47,556 --> 00:29:49,460
An agent, not a Dame.

438
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:54,159
- You are beautiful.
- You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?

439
00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:56,631
I think this is the longest
conversation I've had with a woman.

440
00:29:57,927 --> 00:30:01,022
They're not exactly lining up to dance
with a guy that might step on them.

441
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:03,497
You must have danced.

442
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:06,423
Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying.

443
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,453
And the past few years just...

444
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:10,666
Didn't seem to matter that much.

445
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,027
Figured I'd wait.

446
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:14,339
For what?

447
00:30:14,992 --> 00:30:16,339
Right partner.

448
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:31,905
This way.

449
00:30:35,748 --> 00:30:36,968
What are we doing here?

450
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:38,615
Follow me.

451
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,360
Wonderful weather this morning.

452
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:57,183
- Isn't it.
- Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

453
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:55,949
Good morning.

454
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:59,194
Please, not now.

455
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,213
You ready?

456
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Good.

457
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:10,741
Take off your shirt your tie and your hat.

458
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:18,192
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

459
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:20,133
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

460
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:21,936
We needed access to the cities power grid.

461
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:24,002
Of course if you had given
me a generalized requisition.

462
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:26,492
A lot of people are asking for funds, ....

463
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:27,870
Oh, this is Clem uh...

464
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:29,243
Gregg Clemson, state department.

465
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,227
If this project of yours comes through.

466
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:33,972
We'd like to see that it doesn't get into the headlines.

467
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:35,040
Jesus.

468
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,022
Somebody get that kid a sandwich.

469
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,927
Comfortable?

470
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:55,437
It's a little big.

471
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,968
You save me any of that schnapps?

472
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:01,583
Not as much as I should have.

473
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:04,143
Sorry, next time.

474
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,513
Mr. Stark.

475
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:07,745
How are your levels?

476
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:09,400
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

477
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,866
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn.

478
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,730
But we are ready.

479
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,830
Good as we'll ever be.

480
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:19,930
Agent Carter, don't you think you would
be more comfortable in the booth?

481
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,303
Oh yes, ah, sorry.

482
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:35,793
Can you hear me, is this on?

483
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:37,935
Ladies and Gentlemen.

484
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:42,027
Today we take not another
step towards annihilation.

485
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:45,779
But the first step towards the path to peace.

486
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:50,510
We begin with a series of micro injections,

487
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:52,916
into the subjects major muscles.

488
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,774
The serum infusion will cause
immediate cellular change.

489
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,322
Then to stimulate growth.

490
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
The subject will be saturated,

491
00:34:04,062 --> 00:34:05,464
...with Vita rays

492
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,693
That wasn't so bad.

493
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,703
That was penicillin.

494
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:20,989
Serum infusion.

495
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:23,194
Beginning in, five...

496
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:25,647
Four...

497
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:28,038
Three...

498
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:30,237
Two...

499
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,037
One.

500
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:45,249
Now, Mr. Stark.

501
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:09,798
Steven.

502
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:11,412
Can you hear me?

503
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:14,330
Probably to late to go to the bathroom, right?

504
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,683
We will proceed.

505
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:31,976
That's ten percent.

506
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:34,084
Twenty percent.

507
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:35,248
Thirty.

508
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,613
That's forty percent.

509
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,967
All signs are normal.

510
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,170
That's fifty percent.

511
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:44,798
Sixty.

512
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:47,179
Seventy.

513
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:54,772
Steven, Steven.

514
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:56,155
- Shut it down!
- Steven.

515
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,265
Shut it down.

516
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:01,906
Turn back, Mr. Stark. Turn it off kill it, turn back.

517
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:03,288
No!

518
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:04,379
Don't

519
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:06,144
I can do this.

520
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,726
Eighty...Ninety.

521
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,011
That's one hundred percent!

522
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:42,566
Mr. Stark.

523
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,982
Son of a bitch did it.

524
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:07,694
- I did it,
- Yes, yes.

525
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,564
I think we did it.

526
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,768
You actually did it.

527
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,038
How do you feel?

528
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:20,062
Taller.

529
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:24,834
You look taller.

530
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,920
How do we look now, Senator?

531
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:30,464
I guess the folks in Berlin
are about to get very nervous.

532
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:34,750
Congratulations.

533
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:36,983
Thank you, sir.

534
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:49,607
Stop him!

535
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,890
- They're coming, come on.
- Now.

536
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:57,602
You all right? Hey!

537
00:38:57,684 --> 00:38:58,993
This guy's been shot.

538
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,168
I had him.

539
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,650
Sorry.

540
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:34,183
I'm sorry.

541
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,410
Whoa, whoa.

542
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,553
No.
No, darling no.

543
00:40:50,462 --> 00:40:51,943
Tommy no. Don't hurt him.

544
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,033
Go on.

545
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,366
Let me go.

546
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,844
No, don't hurt him.

547
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:11,256
Wait don't.

548
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:12,257
Don't.

549
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,014
No, don't.

550
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:22,829
Go get him, I can swim.

551
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,372
Who the hell are you?

552
00:42:16,373 --> 00:42:17,708
The first of many.

553
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,035
I got off one hit.

554
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:23,636
Two more shall take it's place.

555
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,107
Heil Hydra.

556
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:49,681
The Führer is not accustomed to
being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

557
00:42:49,682 --> 00:42:52,552
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

558
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,535
You serve at his pleasure.

559
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:57,777
He gave you this facility as
a reward for your injuries.

560
00:42:57,777 --> 00:43:00,029
Reward, call it what it is, exile.

561
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,881
I no longer effect his image of Aryan perfection.

562
00:43:02,885 --> 00:43:04,726
You think this is about appearances?

563
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:07,113
Your Hydra division has failed,

564
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:09,730
...to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.

565
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:12,115
And we have learned through local intelligence.

566
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:15,297
You have mounted a full
scaled incursion into Norway.

567
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:17,601
The Führer fears, how does he put it?

568
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,163
The Red Skull has
been indulged long enough.

569
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:33,945
Gentlemen.

570
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:40,352
You have come to see the
results of our work, hmm?

571
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:42,767
Let me show you.

572
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:47,714
Hitler speaks of a thousand year Reich.

573
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:49,458
But he cannot feed his armies for a month.

574
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:52,230
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe.

575
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:56,430
But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.

576
00:43:57,188 --> 00:44:00,957
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic.

577
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:05,249
Science, but I understand your confusion.

578
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:08,466
Great power has always baffled primitive men.

579
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:13,003
Hydra is assembling an arsenal that will
destroy my enemies in one stroke.

580
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:16,093
Wherever they are, regardless
of how many forces they possess.

581
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,544
All in a matter of hours.

582
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:19,043
Your enemies?

583
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:21,739
My weapons contain enough destructive power,

584
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,832
...to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

585
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,521
Quite simply, gentlemen.

586
00:44:29,452 --> 00:44:32,004
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

587
00:44:34,093 --> 00:44:35,465
Thank you, Schmidt.

588
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:36,563
For what?

589
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:39,636
For making it clear how obviously mad you are.

590
00:44:39,988 --> 00:44:41,517
Berlin is on this map!

591
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,398
So it is.

592
00:44:45,868 --> 00:44:48,203
You will be punished for your insolence.

593
00:44:48,423 --> 00:44:50,733
You will be brought before the Führer and ....

594
00:45:07,116 --> 00:45:09,106
My apologies, Doctor.

595
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:14,182
But we both knew Hydra could
grow no further in Hitler's shadow.

596
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:17,087
Heil Hydra.

597
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:19,040
Heil Hydra!

598
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,061
Heil Hydra.

599
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,389
Think you got enough?

600
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:44,096
Any hope of reproducing the
program is locked in your genetic code

601
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:47,303
But without Erskine it would take years.

602
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:50,422
He deserved more than this.

603
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:53,797
If it could work only once.

604
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:55,254
He'd be proud of you.

605
00:45:58,491 --> 00:46:01,523
Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.

606
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,158
Great, why don't we start with how a German spy,

607
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,854
..got a ride to my secret installation in your car?

608
00:46:06,855 --> 00:46:07,859
What do we got here?

609
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:11,381
Speaking modestly I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

610
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,489
But I don't know what's inside this thing.

611
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,502
Or how it works.

612
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,490
We're not even close to this technology.

613
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:17,491
Then who is?

614
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:20,448
Hydra, I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.

615
00:46:20,526 --> 00:46:22,786
I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.

616
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,115
Hydra is a Nazi Deep science division.

617
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,620
It's led by Johann Schmidt.

618
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,407
But he has much bigger ambitions.

619
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:32,128
Hydra's practically a cult, they worship Schmidt,
they think he's invincible.

620
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:33,401
So what are you going to do about it?

621
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:35,840
I spoke to the President this morning.

622
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:38,630
As of today, the S.S.R. is being retasked.

623
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:40,785
- Colonel?
- We are taking the fight to Hydra.

624
00:46:40,786 --> 00:46:42,604
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

625
00:46:42,605 --> 00:46:43,702
You too, sir.

626
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,712
We're flying to London tonight.

627
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:46,939
Sir.

628
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:48,746
If you're going after Schmidt, I want in.

629
00:46:48,747 --> 00:46:50,550
Your an experiment, you're going to Alamogordo.

630
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:52,311
The serum worked.

631
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:54,529
I asked for an army, and all I got was you.

632
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:55,939
You.

633
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,512
You're not enough.

634
00:47:01,582 --> 00:47:03,268
With all due respect to the Colonel.

635
00:47:03,326 --> 00:47:05,270
I think we may be missing the point.

636
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,381
I've seen you in action, Steve.

637
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:09,141
More importantly.

638
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:10,379
The countries seen it.

639
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
Paper.

640
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:15,960
The enlistment lines have been around the block
since your picture hit the news stands.

641
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:19,510
You don't take a soldier, a symbol like that.

642
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:21,763
And hide him in a Lab.

643
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,230
Son.

644
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:25,672
You want to serve your country.

645
00:47:26,294 --> 00:47:29,589
On the most important battlefield of the war.

646
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,597
Sir.

647
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,036
That's all I want.

648
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:34,843
Than congratulations.

649
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,895
You just got promoted.

650
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:41,042
I don't know if I can do this.

651
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:42,178
Nothing to it.

652
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:44,161
Sell a few bonds, bonds buy's bullets.

653
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,858
Bullets kill Nazi's, bing, bang, boom.

654
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:47,505
You're an American hero.

655
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:49,806
It's just I don't think I'm getting there.

656
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:52,851
The senator's got a lot of pull up on the hill.

657
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:54,232
You play ball, with us.

658
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:56,034
You'll be leading your own platoon in no time.

659
00:47:56,378 --> 00:47:57,535
That's you.

660
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:00,159
Go!

661
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,937
<i>*Who's strong and brave,
here to save the American way.*</i>

662
00:48:07,337 --> 00:48:09,200
Not all of us can storm a beach.

663
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:10,346
Or drive a tank.

664
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,377
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

665
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:16,839
<i>*Who loves to fight like the
man for what’s right by day.*</i>

666
00:48:17,016 --> 00:48:18,968
Series E Defense bonds.

667
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:22,493
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guys gun.

668
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:25,862
<i>*Who built and came door to door for America?*</i>

669
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,585
<i>*Carries the flag shore to shore for America.*</i>

670
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,735
<i>*From Hoboken to Spokane.*</i>

671
00:48:32,736 --> 00:48:38,926
<i>*The Star Spangled Man, with the plan.*</i>

672
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,110
Cut.

673
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:44,022
All right, don't look at the camera.

674
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:48,432
<i>*We can't ignore there's a
threat and the warning is big.*</i>

675
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:50,988
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guys gun.

676
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:56,625
*Who'll hang the noose on the
goose that we loosed from Berlin.*

677
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:01,234
*Who will redeem heed the call for America.*

678
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,800
*Who buys it all, gives his all for America.*

679
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,214
*Who stands to prove that task.*

680
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:14,153
*The Star Spangled Man, with the plan.*

681
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:16,853
We all know it's about trying to win the war.

682
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:18,897
We can't do that without bullets and bandages.

683
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:20,138
Tanks and casts.

684
00:49:20,139 --> 00:49:21,295
And that's where you come in.

685
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:24,255
Every bond you buy will help
protect someone you love.

686
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:27,031
Look out there, he's there behind you.

687
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:29,465
The Germans will think twice
about trying to get the drop on us.

688

<i>*Stalwart, and steady and true.*</i>

702
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:37,035
How many of you are ready
to help me sock ol' Adolph on the jaw?

703
00:50:42,183 --> 00:50:43,183
Okay.

704
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,173
I need a volunteer.

705
00:50:48,174 --> 00:50:50,835
We already volunteered,
how do you think I got here?

706
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,665
Bring back the girls.

707
00:50:57,956 --> 00:50:59,331
I think they only know the one song.

708
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:00,341
But, um...

709
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:02,874
Let me...I'll see what I can do.

710
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:04,297
You do that, sweetheart.

711
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:07,169
Nice boots, Tinkerbell.

712
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:09,805
Come on guys.

713
00:51:09,806 --> 00:51:11,546
We're all on the same team here.

714
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:12,668
Hey, Captain.

715
00:51:12,746 --> 00:51:13,879
Sign this.

716
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:33,095
Don't worry about it, they'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

717
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:42,722
Hello Steve.

718
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:45,482
Hi.

719
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:48,598
- Hi
- What are you doing here?

720
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:50,803
Officially I'm not here at all.

721
00:51:51,621 --> 00:51:53,018
That was quite a performance.

722
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,420
Yeah, uh...

723
00:51:55,975 --> 00:51:57,754
I had to improvise a little bit.

724
00:51:58,091 --> 00:52:00,283
The crowds I'm used to are usually more, uh...

725
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:05,200
- Proud.
- I understand you're America's new hope.

726
00:52:05,286 --> 00:52:08,006
Bond sales take a ten percent
bump on every state I visit.

727
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:09,424
That's Senator Brandt's idea.

728
00:52:11,126 --> 00:52:12,595
At least he's got me doing this.

729
00:52:13,192 --> 00:52:15,258
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.

730
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,984
And these are you only two options?

731
00:52:17,788 --> 00:52:20,004
A lab rat or a dancing monkey.

732
00:52:20,935 --> 00:52:22,781
You were meant for more than this, you know.

733
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:30,449
What?

734
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:33,823
You know, for the longest time I dreamed about,

735
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,419
...coming over seas and...

736
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:37,975
..being on the front lines.

737
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:40,264
Serving my country.

738
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:42,793
Finally got everything I wanted.

739
00:52:46,783 --> 00:52:48,131
And I'm wearing tights.

740
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:57,815
Look like they've been through hell.

741
00:52:58,606 --> 00:53:00,524
These men move the most.

742
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:06,491
Schmidt sent out a force to a zone.

743
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,085
200 men went up against him.

744
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:11,252
Less than 50 returned.

745
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:15,239
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

746
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,751
The rest were killed or captured.

747
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,410
The 107th?

748
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,110
What?

749
00:53:21,442 --> 00:53:22,442
Come on.

750
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:26,384
- Colonel Phillips.
- Well if it isn't the Star Spangled Man with the plan.

751
00:53:26,385 --> 00:53:27,975
What is your plan today?

752
00:53:27,976 --> 00:53:29,498
I need the causality list from Bolzano.

753
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:30,886
You don't get to give me orders, son.

754
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:33,786
I just need one name.
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

755
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:37,232
You and I are going to have a conversation
later that you won't enjoy.

756
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:38,972
Please tell me he's alive, sir.
B-A-R...

757
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:39,982
I can spell.

758
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:50,065
I've signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

759
00:53:50,956 --> 00:53:51,956
But...

760
00:53:51,957 --> 00:53:53,337
The name does sound familiar.

761
00:53:53,673 --> 00:53:54,818
I'm sorry.

762
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,920
What about the others?

763
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:01,703
Are you planning a rescue mission?

764
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:03,128
Yeah, it's called winning the war.

765
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:06,245
But if you know where they are, why not...

766
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:07,468
They're thirty miles behind the lines.

767
00:54:07,781 --> 00:54:10,850
Through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

768
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:12,586
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

769
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:13,934
I don't expect you to understand that,

770
00:54:13,935 --> 00:54:15,364
because you're a chorus girl.

771
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:18,815
I think I understand just fine.

772
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:20,715
Well then understand it somewhere else.

773
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,884
If I read the posters correctly, you've got
someplace to be in thirty minutes.

774
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,341
Yes, sir.

775
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:32,951
I do.

776
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,151
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

777
00:54:45,172 --> 00:54:47,383
What do plan to do, walk to Austria.

778
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,511
If that's what it takes.

779
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,046
You heard the Colonel,
your friend is most likely dead.

780
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,194
You don't know that.

781
00:54:52,195 --> 00:54:54,756
Even so, he's devising a strategy, it takes time.

782
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:56,402
By the time he's done that, it could be to late.

783
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:58,109
Steve.

784
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,267
You told me you thought I
was meant for more than this.

785
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,975
Did you mean that?

786
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:11,257
Every word.

787
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:14,720
Then you gotta let me go.

788
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,115
I can do more than that.

789
00:55:20,479 --> 00:55:21,607
On stage, girls.

790
00:55:24,773 --> 00:55:25,773
Where's my helmet?

791
00:55:25,774 --> 00:55:27,479
Anyone seen, Rogers?

792
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:33,601
The Hydra camp is in
Krossberg.

793
00:55:33,602 --> 00:55:35,621
It's up between these two mountain ranges.

794
00:55:35,622 --> 00:55:36,794
It's a factory of some kind.

795
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,927
We should be able to drop you
around the doorstep.

796
00:55:38,928 --> 00:55:40,428
Just get me as close as you can.

797
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,903
You know you two are going
to be in a lot of trouble when you land.

798
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:44,704
- And you won't.
- Where I'm going if any anybody,

799
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:46,285
...yells at me I can just shoot them.

800
00:55:46,287 --> 00:55:47,810
And they will undoubtedly shoot back.

801
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:49,999
Well lets hope this is good for something.

802
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:51,210
Agent Carter.

803
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:52,587
If you're not in too much of a hurry I thought

804
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:55,539
we could stop off in Usurea
for a late night Fondue.

805
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:04,175
Stark is the best civilian pilot I've ever seen.

806
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:06,913
He's mad enough to brave this air space.
We're lucky to have him.

807
00:56:08,536 --> 00:56:09,743
So you two?

808
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:10,744
Do you?

809
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:13,876
Fondue?

810
00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:17,360
This is your transponder,
active it when you're ready.

811
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:19,318
And the signal will lead us straight to you.

812
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:22,091
Are you sure this thing works?

813
00:56:23,027 --> 00:56:24,659
It tested more than you, pal.

814
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,731
Get back here, we're taking you all the way there.

815
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,819
I'm jumping this plane, turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here.

816
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,502
You can't give me orders.

817
00:56:39,952 --> 00:56:41,258
The hell I can't.

818
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,717
I'm a Captain.

819
00:57:00,938 --> 00:57:02,264
As you can see.

820
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:05,130
Production and the work here is progressing on schedule.

821
00:57:05,285 --> 00:57:07,227
Even with components of this size.

822
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,049
Increase the output by sixty percent.

823
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,533
And speak with our other facilities to do the same.

824
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:19,455
But these prisoners, I'm not
sure they have the strength.

825
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:22,598
Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor.

826
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,876
There are always more workers.

827
00:57:28,496 --> 00:57:29,496
Not now.

828
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,402
You know, Fritz.

829
00:57:47,571 --> 00:57:50,174
One of these days I'm going
to have a stick of my own.

830
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,167
Fellas.

831
01:00:25,946 --> 01:00:27,203
Who are you suppose to be?

832
01:00:27,451 --> 01:00:28,451
Um...

833
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,645
Captain America.

834
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:33,903
I, beg your pardon?

835
01:00:36,707 --> 01:00:38,496
What are we taking, everybody?

836
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:40,810
I'm from Fresno, ace.

837
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:41,916
There anybody else?

838
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:43,726
I'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.

839
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,480
There's an isolation ward in the factory.

840
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:46,649
No one's ever come back from it.

841
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,728
All right.

842
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,404
The tree line is northwest,
it's eighty yards past the gate.

843
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:51,873
Get out fast, and give them hell.

844
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,496
I'll meet you guys in the
clearing with anybody else I find.

845
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:56,579
- Wait.
- You know what you're doing?

846
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,477
Yeah. I knocked out Adolph Hitler over 200 times.

847
01:01:24,404 --> 01:01:25,740
You know how to use that thing?

848
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:32,004
Okay.

849
01:01:33,996 --> 01:01:34,996
What is happening?

850
01:01:42,962 --> 01:01:43,962
Hey.

851
01:01:44,863 --> 01:01:46,088
Not exactly a Buick.

852
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,849
- That's Zündung. (Ignition)
- Zündung?

853
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:51,207
Get going, Dum Dum.

854
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,266
I didn't know you spoke German.

855
01:01:52,267 --> 01:01:55,429
I recently mastered at Le Havre.
Plus the French girls much cuter.

856
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,942
Get after the Russian babes.

857
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,294
No, no, what are you doing?

858
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,098
Our forces are out matched.

859
01:02:59,284 --> 01:03:00,284
Keep moving.

860
01:03:00,285 --> 01:03:01,644
Grab a grenade.

861
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:46,470
Bucky.

862
01:03:47,898 --> 01:03:49,021
Oh my God.

863
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,607
It's me, it's Steve.

864
01:03:56,965 --> 01:03:57,965
Steve.

865
01:03:57,966 --> 01:03:59,216
- Come on.
- Steve.

866
01:04:03,323 --> 01:04:04,476
I thought you were dead.

867
01:04:05,284 --> 01:04:06,843
I thought you were smaller?

868
01:04:14,858 --> 01:04:15,858
Come on.

869
01:04:18,342 --> 01:04:19,520
What happened to you?

870
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:20,633
I joined the army.

871
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:28,372
Did it hurt?

872
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:29,389
A little.

873
01:04:30,077 --> 01:04:32,363
- Permanent?
- So far.

874
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,890
Captain America.

875
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:05,599
How exciting.

876
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:09,252
I am a great fan of your films.

877
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,030
So Doctor Erskine managed it after all.

878
01:05:15,513 --> 01:05:19,350
Not exactly an improvement, but, still.

879
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:20,626
Impressive.

880
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,109
You've got no idea.

881
01:05:28,034 --> 01:05:29,124
Haven't I.

882
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:48,024
No matter what lies Erskine told you.

883
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:50,770
You see I was his greatest success.

884
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:06,521
You don't have one of those, do you?

885
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,778
You are deluded, Captain.

886
01:06:09,309 --> 01:06:12,317
You pretend to be a simple soldier.

887
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,337
But in reality you are just afraid to admit,

888
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:18,941
...that we have left humanity behind.

889
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:21,815
Men like you.

890
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:23,664
They embrace it proudly.

891
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:25,871
No fear.

892
01:06:25,872 --> 01:06:27,009
Then how come you're running?

893
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,498
Come on, let's go.

894
01:06:44,306 --> 01:06:46,350
Sir, we go to the roof?

895
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,133
What about me?

896
01:06:51,518 --> 01:06:53,051
Where will I sit?

897
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,720
Not a scratch, Doctor.

898
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:57,251
Not a scratch.

899
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,843
Let's go.
One at a time.

900
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:02,328
Gotta get a rope or something.

901
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,072
Just go, get out of here.

902
01:08:04,073 --> 01:08:05,557
No, not without you.

903
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:32,395
SENATOR BRANDT, I REGRET TO INFORM YOU,

904
01:08:32,396 --> 01:08:33,813
...CAPTAIIN STEPHEN G. ROGERS

905
01:08:33,814 --> 01:08:35,216
...WENT MISSING BEHIND ENEMY LINES,

906
01:08:35,217 --> 01:08:38,351
...ON THE THIRD AREA.
RECONNASANCE HAS PROVEN

907
01:08:38,352 --> 01:08:40,881
...UNFRUITFUL AS A RESULT,

908
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:43,644
...I MUST DECLARE CAPTAIN ROGERS,

909
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,538
...KILLED IN ACTION.
PERIOD.

910
01:08:50,538 --> 01:08:52,124
The last surveillance flight is back.

911
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:56,221
No sign of activity.

912
01:08:57,656 --> 01:09:00,315
- Go get a cup of coffee, corporal.
- Yes, sir.

913
01:09:03,275 --> 01:09:04,953
We can't touch Stark, he's rich.

914
01:09:05,357 --> 01:09:07,748
And he's the army's number
one weapons contractor.

915
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:09,398
- You are neither one.
- With respect, sir.

916
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:10,842
I don't regret my actions.

917
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,191
And I don't think Captain Rogers did, either.

918
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:15,537
What makes you think I give
a damn about your opinions.

919
01:09:15,946 --> 01:09:17,637
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

920
01:09:17,638 --> 01:09:20,786
And now America's golden boy,
and a lot of other good men are dead.

921
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:22,822
'Cause you had a crush.

922
01:09:22,823 --> 01:09:23,822
It wasn't that.

923
01:09:23,934 --> 01:09:25,178
I had faith.

924
01:09:25,378 --> 01:09:27,485
Well I hope that's a big comfort to you,

925
01:09:27,486 --> 01:09:29,099
...when they shut this division down.

926
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:31,774
There they are, I can't believe it.

927
01:09:32,449 --> 01:09:34,008
What the hell's going on out there?

928
01:10:45,528 --> 01:10:47,434
Some of these men need medical attention.

929
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:48,475
Medic, I got wounded.

930
01:10:49,841 --> 01:10:52,375
I'd like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.

931
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:55,250
That won't be necessary.

932
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,510
Yes, Sir.

933
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,190
Faith, huh?

934
01:11:09,926 --> 01:11:11,021
You're late.

935
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:16,900
Couldn't call my ride.

936
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,300
Hey!

937
01:11:20,887 --> 01:11:23,077
Let's hear it for, Captain America.

938
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:41,229
I am honored to present,

939
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,681
...this medal for valor.

940
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,561
To my personal friend.

941
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,202
Captain America.

942
01:11:49,378 --> 01:11:50,560
Captain America?

943
01:11:52,429 --> 01:11:53,987
Captain, that's your cue.

944
01:11:58,337 --> 01:12:00,269
I thought he'd be taller.

945
01:12:12,852 --> 01:12:15,535
They one here in Poland, and the Baltic.

946
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:17,422
and the sixth one was...

947
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:19,146
About...

948
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:23,340
...here. 30, 40 miles west of the maginal line.

949
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,158
I just got a quick look.

950
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:28,974
Well nobody’s' perfect.

951
01:12:32,586 --> 01:12:34,464
These are the weapon factories we about.

952
01:12:35,597 --> 01:12:38,981
Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra
shipped all the parts to another facility,

953
01:12:38,982 --> 01:12:39,984
...that isn't on this map.

954
01:12:40,115 --> 01:12:41,739
Agent Carter co-ordinate with MI6.

955
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:44,728
I want every allied eyeball looking
for that main Hydra base.

956
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,738
What about us?

957
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,292
We are going to set a
fire under Johann Schmidt's ass.

958
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,734
What do say, Rogers?

959
01:12:50,028 --> 01:12:52,553
It's your map. You think you
can wipe Hydra off of it?

960
01:12:52,555 --> 01:12:53,571
Yes, Sir.

961
01:12:53,864 --> 01:12:54,864
I'll need a team.

962
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:56,761
We're already putting together the best men.

963
01:12:56,995 --> 01:12:58,440
With all due respect, Sir.

964
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:00,157
So am I.

965
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:02,820
So let's get this straight.

966
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:05,075
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

967
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:07,542
Pretty much.

968
01:13:07,836 --> 01:13:10,582
Sounds rather, fun actually.

969
01:13:10,654 --> 01:13:12,932
(Burp) I'm in.

970
01:13:14,226 --> 01:13:18,334
(Speaking French)

971
01:13:25,538 --> 01:13:27,090
We're in.

972
01:13:27,727 --> 01:13:29,355
Hell, I'll always play.

973
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:31,269
But you gotta do one thing for me.

974
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,270
What's that?

975
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,542
Open a tab.

976
01:13:39,175 --> 01:13:40,265
Well that was easy.

977
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:41,653
Another round.

978
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,486
Where are they putting all this stuff?

979
01:13:45,952 --> 01:13:49,667
*There is a tavern in the town..*
- See, told  you.

980
01:13:50,157 --> 01:13:51,670
They are all idiots.

981
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:53,818
What about you?

982
01:13:55,099 --> 01:13:58,269
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jowls of death?

983
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,270
Hell, no.

984
01:13:59,615 --> 01:14:02,045
That little guy from Brooklyn.
I was too.

985
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:03,807
I don't like to run away from a fight.

986
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:06,490
I'm following him.

987
01:14:10,577 --> 01:14:12,239
Hey, you keeping your outfit, right?

988
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,499
You know what?

989
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,166
It's kinda growing on me.

990
01:14:18,825 --> 01:14:21,989
<i>*And remember that the best of
friends must part, must part*</i>

991
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,374
<i>*Adieu, adieu...*</i>

992
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:31,278
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

993
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:34,726
Ma'am.

994
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:36,564
Howard has some equipment for you to try.

995
01:14:36,585 --> 01:14:38,819
- Tomorrow morning.
- Sounds good.

996
01:14:43,577 --> 01:14:46,168
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

997
01:14:47,003 --> 01:14:48,276
You don't like music?

998
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:49,683
I do, actually.

999
01:14:51,255 --> 01:14:53,416
I might even, when this is all over,

1000
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:54,518
...go dancing.

1001
01:14:54,519 --> 01:14:56,011
Then what are we waiting for?

1002
01:14:57,387 --> 01:14:58,813
The right partner.

1003
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:01,638
Pay attention, Captain.

1004
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:03,729
Yes, Ma'am.

1005
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:04,730
I'll be there.

1006
01:15:05,328 --> 01:15:06,430
I'm invisible.

1007
01:15:07,149 --> 01:15:08,759
I'm turning into you.

1008
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:10,107
It's a horrible dream.

1009
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:11,884
Don't take it so hard.

1010
01:15:12,282 --> 01:15:13,550
Maybe she's got a friend.

1011
01:15:15,813 --> 01:15:18,112
Initial signature is unusual.

1012
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,349
Alpha beta remain neutral.

1013
01:15:22,009 --> 01:15:24,249
No doubt Rogers picked up on that.

1014
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:27,889
Seems harmless enough.

1015
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:31,092
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1016
01:15:40,528 --> 01:15:41,750
Write that down.

1017
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,481
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Mr. Stark.

1018
01:15:46,482 --> 01:15:48,007
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1019
01:15:53,543 --> 01:15:56,090
Oh, of course you're welcome to wait.

1020
01:16:01,071 --> 01:16:02,071
I uh,

1021
01:16:03,427 --> 01:16:04,720
Read about what you did.

1022
01:16:05,123 --> 01:16:07,042
Oh, that...yeah.

1023
01:16:07,724 --> 01:16:09,135
Well that's, you know...

1024
01:16:10,706 --> 01:16:12,353
Just doing what needed to be done.

1025
01:16:12,354 --> 01:16:13,862
Sounded like more than that.

1026
01:16:13,863 --> 01:16:15,506
You saved nearly 400 men.

1027
01:16:21,714 --> 01:16:23,681
Really, it's not a big deal.

1028
01:16:24,676 --> 01:16:26,558
Tell that to their wives.

1029
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:31,776
Uh, I don't think they were all married.

1030
01:16:31,777 --> 01:16:32,936
You're a hero.

1031
01:16:33,514 --> 01:16:34,663
Well, that...you know.

1032
01:16:34,664 --> 01:16:36,341
Tha..that depends on the definition of...

1033
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,718
And the Women of America.

1034
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:39,313
They owe you their thanks.

1035
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:43,632
And um, seeing as they're  not here.

1036
01:16:52,436 --> 01:16:53,436
Captain!

1037
01:16:53,437 --> 01:16:56,053
We're ready for you.
If you're not otherwise occupied.

1038
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:58,682
Agent Carter, wait.

1039
01:16:58,683 --> 01:17:01,068
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

1040
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:02,852
Hey, that's not what you thought it was.

1041
01:17:02,853 --> 01:17:05,278
I don't think anything, Captain.
Not one thing.

1042
01:17:05,893 --> 01:17:07,801
Always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are.

1043
01:17:07,802 --> 01:17:09,073
Just like all the rest.

1044
01:17:09,683 --> 01:17:10,866
Well what about you and Stark?

1045
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:12,466
How do I know you two haven't been...

1046
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:13,739
...fondueing.

1047
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,923
You still don't know a
bloody thing about women.

1048
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:24,279
Fondue's just cheese and bread, my friend.

1049
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,280
Really?

1050
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:26,771
- I didn't think...
- Or should you, pal.

1051
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:28,648
The moment you think you know what's going on in...

1052
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:31,415
a woman's head. Is the moment your
goose is well and truly cooked.

1053
01:17:31,636 --> 01:17:33,201
Me, I concentrate on work.

1054
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:36,955
Which at the moment, is about making sure
you and your men do not get killed.

1055
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:38,874
Carbon polymer.

1056
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:42,202
Should withstand your average German bayonet.

1057
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:45,739
Although, Hydra's not going to attack
you with a pocket knife.

1058
01:17:46,147 --> 01:17:48,970
I hear you're uh, kinda attached.

1059
01:17:48,971 --> 01:17:50,606
It's handier than you might think.

1060
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:52,653
I took the liberty of coming up with some options.

1061
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,757
This one's fun.

1062
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:57,368
She's being fitted with electrical relays.

1063
01:17:57,369 --> 01:17:58,796
- That will allow you to..
- What about this one?

1064
01:17:58,797 --> 01:17:59,797
No, no that's just a prototype.

1065
01:17:59,798 --> 01:18:00,798
What's it made of?

1066
01:18:01,092 --> 01:18:02,173
Vibranium.

1067
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,946
It's stronger than steel, and a third of the weight.

1068
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,877
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1069
01:18:10,764 --> 01:18:12,288
How come it's not standard issue?

1070
01:18:12,289 --> 01:18:13,983
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1071
01:18:13,984 --> 01:18:15,038
What you're holding there.

1072
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,092
That's all we got.

1073
01:18:16,093 --> 01:18:17,390
Are you quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1074
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,137
I'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business.

1075
01:18:20,138 --> 01:18:21,138
What do you think?

1076
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:33,503
Yes, I think it works.

1077
01:18:42,995 --> 01:18:44,613
I had some ideas about the uniform.

1078
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:46,640
Whatever you want, pal.

1079
01:20:51,206 --> 01:20:53,650
You are failing!

1080
01:20:54,498 --> 01:20:58,239
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet.

1081
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,316
And we are continually delayed because,

1082
01:21:00,317 --> 01:21:02,946
...you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield.

1083
01:21:02,947 --> 01:21:04,896
It's hardly my area of expertise.

1084
01:21:04,897 --> 01:21:07,497
I, I merely develop weapons.

1085
01:21:07,498 --> 01:21:09,120
I..I..I cannot fire them.

1086
01:21:09,759 --> 01:21:13,701
Finish your mission, Doctor.
Before the American finishes his.

1087
01:21:13,996 --> 01:21:14,996
Sir!

1088
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,737
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.

1089
01:21:19,813 --> 01:21:21,519
We fought to the last man.

1090
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:26,779
Evidently not.

1091
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:41,790
Remember when I made you
ride the Cyclone on Coney Island?

1092
01:21:42,313 --> 01:21:43,798
Yeah, and I threw up.

1093
01:21:45,053 --> 01:21:46,701
This isn't pay back, is it?

1094
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:48,180
Now why would I do that?

1095
01:21:48,674 --> 01:21:51,095
You were right, Doctor Zola is on the train.

1096
01:21:51,504 --> 01:21:54,403
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

1097
01:21:55,142 --> 01:21:57,158
Wherever he's going, they must need him bad.

1098
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,763
Let's get going because
they're moving like the devil.

1099
01:22:07,377 --> 01:22:09,017
We only got about a ten second window.

1100
01:22:09,018 --> 01:22:10,293
You miss that, window.

1101
01:22:10,523 --> 01:22:11,963
We're bugs on a windshield.

1102
01:22:11,964 --> 01:22:13,214
Mind the gap.

1103
01:22:13,215 --> 01:22:14,623
Gotta get moving, buds.

1104
01:22:16,589 --> 01:22:17,828
Maintenant. (Now)

1105
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:23,968
Now!

1106
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:24,150
Stop him.

1107
01:23:24,151 --> 01:23:25,609
Fire again.

1108
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:19,219
I had him on the ropes.

1109
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,220
I know you did.

1110
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:22,179
Get down!

1111
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:25,639
Fire again.

1112
01:24:26,218 --> 01:24:27,779
Kill him, now.

1113
01:24:35,335 --> 01:24:36,335
Bucky!

1114
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,440
Hang on.

1115
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:44,619
Grab my hand.

1116
01:24:45,345 --> 01:24:46,345
No!

1117
01:25:49,931 --> 01:25:50,931
So.

1118
01:25:57,677 --> 01:25:58,711
What is this?

1119
01:25:58,712 --> 01:25:59,559
Steak.

1120
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:02,378
What is in it?

1121
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:04,033
Cow.

1122
01:26:07,468 --> 01:26:09,060
Doctor, do you realize,

1123
01:26:09,061 --> 01:26:11,218
...how difficult it is to get a hold,

1124
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:13,102
...of a prime cut like that out here?

1125
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,494
I don't eat meat.

1126
01:26:17,186 --> 01:26:20,181
- Why not?
- It disagrees with me.

1127
01:26:20,182 --> 01:26:23,371
How about Cyanide, does
that give you the rumbly tummy too?

1128
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:29,748
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive,

1129
01:26:29,749 --> 01:26:32,246
..has crushed a little pill before we can stop them.

1130
01:26:32,825 --> 01:26:33,941
But not you.

1131
01:26:34,937 --> 01:26:37,881
So, here's my brilliant theory.

1132
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,220
You want to live.

1133
01:26:42,716 --> 01:26:45,004
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1134
01:26:45,574 --> 01:26:46,973
I brought you dinner.

1135
01:26:52,612 --> 01:26:55,964
Given the valuable information that he has provided,

1136
01:26:56,263 --> 01:26:59,369
And in exchange for his full co-operation.

1137
01:27:00,316 --> 01:27:03,334
Doctor Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.

1138
01:27:03,335 --> 01:27:05,312
I sent that message to Washington this morning.

1139
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:07,357
Of course it was encoded.

1140
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:09,821
You guys haven't broken
those codes, have you?

1141
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,650
That would be awkward.

1142
01:27:11,651 --> 01:27:13,622
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1143
01:27:13,623 --> 01:27:14,940
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.

1144
01:27:15,518 --> 01:27:17,190
You're a liability.

1145
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,473
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.

1146
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:20,781
And...

1147
01:27:21,573 --> 01:27:25,055
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers closest friend.

1148
01:27:25,056 --> 01:27:27,592
So I wouldn't count on the very best of protection.

1149
01:27:28,955 --> 01:27:30,117
It's you,

1150
01:27:30,118 --> 01:27:31,469
...or Schmidt.

1151
01:27:32,177 --> 01:27:33,974
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1152
01:27:36,467 --> 01:27:40,110
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1153
01:27:40,452 --> 01:27:41,452
Hmm.

1154
01:27:41,516 --> 01:27:44,633
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1155
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:46,560
You do realize that's nuts, don't you.

1156
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:48,013
Of course.

1157
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:51,112
The certainty of the plan is of no consequence.

1158
01:27:51,113 --> 01:27:53,473
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it.

1159
01:27:54,076 --> 01:27:55,369
What's his target?

1160
01:27:56,597 --> 01:27:59,212
He's darkened.

1161
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:02,263
He's everywhere.

1162
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:23,818
Tomorrow...

1163
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:27,799
Hydra will stand master of the world.

1164
01:28:28,831 --> 01:28:32,045
Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.

1165
01:28:32,504 --> 01:28:36,469
Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us.

1166
01:28:36,939 --> 01:28:39,005
If they shoot down one plane.

1167
01:28:39,006 --> 01:28:41,836
Hundreds more will rain fire upon them.

1168
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,569
Where they cut off one hand.

1169
01:28:49,227 --> 01:28:51,962
Two more shall take it's place.

1170
01:28:51,963 --> 01:28:54,094
Heil Hydra.

1171
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,586
Heil Hydra!

1172
01:28:55,587 --> 01:28:57,174
HEIL HYDRA!

1173
01:28:57,175 --> 01:29:00,286
Heil Hydra...Heil Hydra!

1174
01:29:00,287 --> 01:29:03,122
Heil Hydra,
Heil Hydra!

1175
01:29:03,123 --> 01:29:04,801
Heil Hydra.

1176
01:29:32,697 --> 01:29:34,565
Doctor Erskine said that,

1177
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:37,448
...the serum wouldn't just affect my muscles.

1178
01:29:37,449 --> 01:29:39,172
It would affect my cells.

1179
01:29:40,637 --> 01:29:42,857
Create a protective system,

1180
01:29:42,858 --> 01:29:44,701
..of regeneration and healing.

1181
01:29:44,702 --> 01:29:45,858
Which means, um...

1182
01:29:48,323 --> 01:29:50,005
I can't get drunk.

1183
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,225
Did you know?

1184
01:29:53,484 --> 01:29:57,812
Your metabolism burns four times
faster than the average person.

1185
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,687
He thought it could be one of the side effects.

1186
01:30:07,006 --> 01:30:08,651
It wasn't your fault.

1187
01:30:10,361 --> 01:30:11,710
Did you make the report?

1188
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:12,710
Yes.

1189
01:30:12,711 --> 01:30:14,651
Well, then you know that's not true.

1190
01:30:14,652 --> 01:30:16,045
You did everything you could.

1191
01:30:19,589 --> 01:30:21,316
Did you believe in your friend?

1192
01:30:22,007 --> 01:30:23,565
Did you respect him?

1193
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,569
Then stop blaming yourself.

1194
01:30:27,124 --> 01:30:29,139
And that was the dignity of his choice.

1195
01:30:29,535 --> 01:30:31,660
He damn well must have
thought you were worth it.

1196
01:30:34,103 --> 01:30:35,673
I'm going after Schmidt.

1197
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:40,324
I'm not going to stop 'til all
of Hydra is dead, or captured.

1198
01:30:42,546 --> 01:30:43,855
You won't be alone.

1199
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:48,903
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house.

1200
01:30:48,904 --> 01:30:52,017
He thinks he's a god and he's willing to
blow up half the world to prove it.

1201
01:30:52,018 --> 01:30:53,753
Starting with the U.S.A.

1202
01:30:53,754 --> 01:30:56,168
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1203
01:30:56,676 --> 01:30:58,223
He gets across the Atlantic.

1204
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:01,670
He'll wipe out the entire
eastern seaboard in an hour.

1205
01:31:05,675 --> 01:31:06,837
How much time we got?

1206
01:31:06,838 --> 01:31:09,530
According to my new best friend,
in twenty four hours.

1207
01:31:09,762 --> 01:31:10,817
Where is he now?

1208
01:31:10,818 --> 01:31:12,611
Hydra's last base is here.

1209
01:31:13,328 --> 01:31:14,437
In the Alps.

1210
01:31:14,438 --> 01:31:16,325
500 feet below the surface.

1211
01:31:18,869 --> 01:31:20,296
So what are we suppose to do?

1212
01:31:20,627 --> 01:31:22,797
It's not like we can just knock on the front door.

1213
01:31:23,498 --> 01:31:24,498
Why not?

1214
01:31:29,919 --> 01:31:31,573
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1215
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:41,983
Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait.

1216
01:33:41,984 --> 01:33:44,438
But I must say you do it better than anyone.

1217
01:33:46,991 --> 01:33:52,253
But, there are limits, to what
even you can do, Captain.

1218
01:33:52,721 --> 01:33:56,173
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1219
01:33:56,174 --> 01:33:57,885
He told me you were insane.

1220
01:33:58,579 --> 01:33:59,579
Ah.

1221
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:04,255
He resented my genius,

1222
01:34:04,256 --> 01:34:07,701
and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.

1223
01:34:07,702 --> 01:34:10,018
But he gave you everything.

1224
01:34:11,911 --> 01:34:12,911
So.

1225
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:17,370
What made you so special?

1226
01:34:20,658 --> 01:34:21,658
Nothing.

1227
01:34:23,055 --> 01:34:24,915
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1228
01:34:36,077 --> 01:34:37,822
I can do this all day.

1229
01:34:37,823 --> 01:34:40,036
Oh of course you can, of course.

1230
01:34:40,037 --> 01:34:43,206
But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule.

1231
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:50,482
So am I.

1232
01:35:02,797 --> 01:35:03,797
Rogers.

1233
01:35:04,515 --> 01:35:05,878
You might need this.

1234
01:35:05,879 --> 01:35:06,879
Thanks.

1235
01:35:18,417 --> 01:35:20,915
We're in, assault Team now!

1236
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:21,916
Fire!

1237
01:36:12,729 --> 01:36:14,535
I'm hit, full force.

1238
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:17,633
Let's go find ten more.

1239
01:36:40,883 --> 01:36:42,542
Cease fire.

1240
01:36:44,678 --> 01:36:45,678
You're late.

1241
01:36:48,417 --> 01:36:49,861
Weren't you about to...

1242
01:36:50,039 --> 01:36:51,039
Right.

1243
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:05,681
Get in.

1244
01:38:34,812 --> 01:38:35,837
Keep it steady.

1245
01:38:35,838 --> 01:38:36,838
Wait!

1246
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:42,624
Go get him.

1247
01:38:44,925 --> 01:38:46,099
I'm not kissing you.

1248
01:42:25,844 --> 01:42:27,638
You don't give up, do you?

1249
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:29,070
Nope.

1250
01:43:37,658 --> 01:43:40,228
You could have the power of the gods.

1251
01:43:41,204 --> 01:43:45,847
Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think
you fight a battle of nations.

1252
01:43:46,511 --> 01:43:49,176
I have seen the future, Captain.

1253
01:43:49,509 --> 01:43:52,195
- There are no flags.
- Not my future.

1254
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:07,761
What have you done?

1255
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:09,110
No!

1256
01:45:17,702 --> 01:45:19,951
Come in this is, Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?

1257
01:45:20,075 --> 01:45:21,287
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1258
01:45:21,288 --> 01:45:22,669
Steve is that you, are you all right?

1259
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:24,412
Great, Schmidt's dead.

1260
01:45:24,929 --> 01:45:26,352
What about the plane?

1261
01:45:28,204 --> 01:45:29,944
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1262
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:32,819
Give me your coordinates I'll
find you a safe landing site.

1263
01:45:33,804 --> 01:45:35,751
There's not going to be a safe landing.

1264
01:45:36,217 --> 01:45:37,834
I'm going to try and force it down.

1265
01:45:37,835 --> 01:45:40,020
I'll get Howard on the line, he'll know what to do.

1266
01:45:40,021 --> 01:45:41,039
There's not enough time.

1267
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,562
This thing's moving to fast and
it's heading for New York.

1268
01:45:48,258 --> 01:45:49,786
I gotta put her in the water.

1269
01:45:50,138 --> 01:45:51,422
Please, don't do this.

1270
01:45:51,423 --> 01:45:53,476
We have time, we can work it out.

1271
01:45:53,477 --> 01:45:54,890
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1272
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:56,829
If I wait any longer a lot
of people are going to die.

1273
01:46:02,592 --> 01:46:03,592
Peggy.

1274
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:06,868
This is my choice.

1275
01:46:31,221 --> 01:46:32,221
Peggy.

1276
01:46:33,229 --> 01:46:34,350
I'm here.

1277
01:46:37,148 --> 01:46:39,515
I'm going to need a rain check on that dance.

1278
01:46:47,929 --> 01:46:49,486
All right.

1279
01:46:52,834 --> 01:46:55,375
A week next Saturday at the Stork Club.

1280
01:46:56,687 --> 01:46:57,687
You got it.

1281
01:46:59,811 --> 01:47:00,937
Eight O’clock, on the dot.

1282
01:47:00,938 --> 01:47:02,331
Don't you dare be late.

1283
01:47:03,437 --> 01:47:04,437
Understood?

1284
01:47:06,327 --> 01:47:07,873
You know I still don't know how to dance.

1285
01:47:14,465 --> 01:47:15,712
I'll show you how.

1286
01:47:15,715 --> 01:47:17,272
Just be there.

1287
01:47:18,507 --> 01:47:20,675
We'll have the band play something slow.

1288
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:26,025
I'd hate to step on your....

1289
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:30,042
Steve?

1290
01:47:32,308 --> 01:47:33,582
Steve.

1291
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:38,268
Steve.

1292
01:48:37,072 --> 01:48:38,294
To the Captain.

1293
01:48:51,076 --> 01:48:52,076
Sir.

1294
01:49:02,232 --> 01:49:03,793
Take us to the next grid point.

1295
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,856
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1296
01:49:06,951 --> 01:49:09,114
And the energy signal trace stops here.

1297
01:49:10,714 --> 01:49:12,535
Just keep looking.

1298
01:50:19,164 --> 01:50:21,926
<i>There's a pitch, it's a ball high outside.</i>

1299
01:50:24,558 --> 01:50:26,578
<i>So, the dodges tied four to four.</i>

1300
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:31,055
<i>At the count no doubt, one swing of his bat.</i>

1301
01:50:31,056 --> 01:50:33,793
<i>This fella is capable of making it
a brand new game again</i>

1302
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:38,072
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets field.</i>

1303
01:50:39,223 --> 01:50:41,745
<i>Philly's have managed to tie it up four to four.</i>

1304
01:50:43,147 --> 01:50:45,454
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1305
01:50:50,148 --> 01:50:51,533
<i>Pitch, it's a strike.</i>

1306
01:50:56,825 --> 01:51:00,867
<i>He leans in, here's the pitch,
swung on, it's a line drive.</i>

1307
01:51:00,867 --> 01:51:02,390
<i>It gets past Grissom.</i>

1308
01:51:03,822 --> 01:51:06,825
<i>Rizzo will score, Reiser heads to third.</i>

1309
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,881
<i>Durocher is going to wave him in.</i>

1310
01:51:09,923 --> 01:51:12,250
<i>They look to relay but they hold steady.</i>

1311
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:14,817
- Pete Reiser with an inside the park...
- Good Morning.

1312
01:51:16,906 --> 01:51:18,111
Or should I say, afternoon.

1313
01:51:18,346 --> 01:51:19,760
<i>Oh my god.</i>

1314
01:51:19,805 --> 01:51:20,877
Where am I?

1315
01:51:21,511 --> 01:51:23,360
You're in a recovery room in New York city.

1316
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:31,030
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, it's eight to four
Oh ho, dodgers!</i>

1317
01:51:31,415 --> 01:51:33,422
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.</i>

1318
01:51:33,423 --> 01:51:34,607
<i>Fine game indeed.</i>

1319
01:51:34,608 --> 01:51:35,979
Where am I really?

1320
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,941
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1321
01:51:40,103 --> 01:51:41,103
The game.

1322
01:51:41,742 --> 01:51:43,143
It's from May, 1941

1323
01:51:43,144 --> 01:51:44,319
I know, 'cause I was there.

1324
01:51:48,829 --> 01:51:50,107
Now I'm going to ask you again.

1325
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,321
Where am I?

1326
01:51:53,451 --> 01:51:54,786
- Captain Rogers
- Who are you?

1327
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,478
Captain Rogers, wait.

1328
01:52:06,016 --> 01:52:07,601
All agents, code 13.

1329
01:52:08,376 --> 01:52:10,512
...13, all agents code 13.

1330
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:32,911
At ease, soldier.

1331
01:52:41,706 --> 01:52:44,695
Look I'm sorry about that
little show back there, but.

1332
01:52:45,839 --> 01:52:48,428
We thought it best to break it to you slowly.

1333
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:50,080
Break what?

1334
01:52:52,674 --> 01:52:54,178
You've been asleep, Cap.

1335
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,564
For almost seventy years.

1336
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,908
You gonna be okay?

1337
01:53:13,963 --> 01:53:14,963
Yeah.

1338
01:53:14,964 --> 01:53:16,697
Yeah, just...

1339
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,069
I had a date.
