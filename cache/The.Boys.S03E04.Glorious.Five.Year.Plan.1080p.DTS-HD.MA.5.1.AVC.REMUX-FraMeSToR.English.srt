00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,458
That's to cover Cherie's debt.

159
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,713
Plus a hundred grand for your troubles.

160

[bag unzips]

161
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,515
Does your bureau know
you're giving me their nice clean money?

162
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,475
Well, it's the US government, love.

163
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,519
They'll just print more.

164
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:17,938
- Hmm.
- [entry bell jingling]

165
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,651
Yeah, the money is good for my trouble,

166
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,113
but what about my pain and suffering?

167
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,826
Then there is the time spent
and my stress.

168
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,623
[sighs] I have been sleeping so poorly.

169
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,795
And what would ease your pain?

170
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,548
Cherie.

171
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,508
<i>Non.</i> [chuckles] No way.

172
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,260
That is all I want.

173
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,973
You and I, we're just
getting started, dear love.

174
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:55,017
Don't tell me there ain't no, uh...

#HomeLight?

184
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,813
You agreed to this?

185
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,107
It's like what you said, Hughie.

186
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,485
Whatever it takes. This is...

187

This is what it takes.

Hey.

189
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,121
It's gonna be okay.

190
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,081
Really.

Hughie.

194
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,302
This has to work.

195
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,016
It'll work.

196
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,269
What'll work?

197
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:25,023
Uh, my Vought Sonic speaker setup.

198
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,067
I'm sorry, uh, how did you get in?

199
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,652
I have a key.

200
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,947
Yeah, I got to keep an eye
on my best girl, right?

201
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,867
By the way,
you're a sound sleeper, Starlight.

202

Oh, look at you two. I'm kidding.

203

Come on, lighten up. I'm joking.

204
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,542
But we got to go. Running late.

Don't you worry, Hughie.

This little love affair
is strictly for the cameras.

209
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,268
Although that's how
me and Maeve started out,

210
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,855
and that... [inhales sharply]
...got quite spicy. [laughs]

Yeah, I'm not kidding, man.

212
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,194
Let's just say that Maeve
can bend a steel pipe

She a good fuck?

00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,542
Whoa.

Touch him or anyone he cares about,

220
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,635
And I'll take my approval points with me.

Come on, Starlight.

00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,358
Mario's waiting.

226
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,485
I'll call you later.

229
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,450
[Ashley] Blue Hawk?

230
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,952
- Mm-hmm.
- Who cares about Blue Hawk?

231
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,537
He's way below your pay grade.

232
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,580
He's brutalizing Black people in Trenton.

233
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,624
I think Vought has a responsibility here.

234
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,417
Mm-hmm. [laughs]

235
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,378
Right.

236
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,921
Wait, you're serious?

237
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,798
- I just want to talk to him.
- Of course.

238
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,759
Social justice
is so important around here.

239
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,594
- Since when?
- A-Train,

240
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,972
"Black Lives Matter"
is my favorite hashtag.

My Insta? Nothing but black screens.

242
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,061
And look at you. You look amazing!

243
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,980
This whole new thing you did,

244
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,233
that is exactly what inspired
this entire campaign.

245
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,193
To be silent is to be complicit.

246
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,863
So let's shoot the spot,
and we'll chat about Blue Hawk later.

247
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:36,989
When, Ashley?

248
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,490
Later, A-Train.

We're here today for peace
and love and prosperity!

Where all those people going?

253
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,711
There's a protest down the street.

Almost ready to shoot.

256
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,636
This is important.

Uh, I'm no good to you, Vicky.

Thanks, Vick.

[sighs] First time out of the country.

280
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,417
Five years, I work for Nina, 23 contracts.

281
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,837
Never she's giving anything away.
What is this?

282
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,632
Now she giving us the plane,
those shiny passports?

Fucking hell, Frenchie.

285

What kind of monster
do you think I am, eh?

[Starlight] Hi.

293
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,289
Can we talk?

294
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,792
- No.
- Maeve, please.

I heard that you stopped training.

00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,428
Yeah?

299
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,639
You also hear that I wake up
six days a week hungover,

300
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,933
tits-deep in some random fuck pile?

301
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,229
People think what I want them to.

302
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,648
Okay, listen.

303
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:20,444
Have you ever heard of something
called "BCL RED"?

304
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,699
You mean a weapon
that can kill Homelander,

305
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,576
if Butcher can find it?

306
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,827
You know?

307
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,665
Who do you think sent them
down the rabbit hole?

308
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,959
It's why I'm training.

309
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:40,338
Or haven't had a drink
in four awful, shit-eating months.

310
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,550
Maybe I can buy Butcher a second or two
to get a good shot.

311
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,887
At the very least,
I'll get a couple of licks in.

312
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,181
Okay.

313
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,642
Okay, okay. So there's you and me.

314
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,478
Maybe we can find some others.

315
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,854
Right. Yeah.

316
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,650
I'm sure you and Duluth's Most Mighty
would really get the job done.

317
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,860
This is my problem.

318
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,613
I'm the one who was with the asshole.

319

No, that's not rhetorical.

642
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,612
Answer me.

643
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,785
What if I said yes?

644
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,043
Then I would have to punish you.

645
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:09,381
How would you punish me?

The girls who shot you?

655

They were just scared.

You're right.

Maybe it's time we leave.

660
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,601
Really.

661
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,563
Well, Butcher, he can, uh...

662
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,523
Well, he can lick my asshole.

[chuckles softly]

664
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,361
But Hughie and, uh, and MM, they need us.

665
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:36,987
So we do this job.

666
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,367
And then where do you want to go?

667

[chuckles]

668
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,666

Be honest.

You thinking of popping my melon?

678
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,331
Who knows? Give it a whirl?

679
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,963
Can we make this quick?
It's been a long day.

680
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,048
It has.

681
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:41,260
It can't have been easy
shanking the old man like that.

682
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,972
But, if it's any consolation,

he was ready
to do exactly the same to you.

What's this?

685
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:55,441
Just a little oppo research
that I borrowed from Edgar's office.

686
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:00,112
How do you think I found out
you were one of us?

- [paper rustling]
- This isn't his. This is someone else's.

No.

00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,535
It's his.

You're not his daughter.

691
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,332
You're his weapon.

692
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,751
It's what they do.

693
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,837
They all do it. All of them.

694
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,132
Look, the point is,

695
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,676
they have to do that to us.

696
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,304
They have to, because they know

697
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,514
deep down when they lie awake at night...

698

Do you have it or not?

Vicky.

702
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,627
I'm glad you chose your own kind.

703
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,173
That was smart.

[Butcher breathing heavily]

What are you doing?

Contingency.

712
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,979
In case things go ass over tit at the lab.

713
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,280
I want to try some.

714
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,660
Don't be daft.
This shit is poison, Hughie.

715
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,328
A lad like you don't want no part of it.

716

What, you mean like a loser?

A fuckup?

718
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,169
Sooner or later,
Homelander will find Ryan.

719
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,047
Okay? It's just a matter of time.

720
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,799
I have to do this, all right?

721
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,301
You don't.

722
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,885
Annie's in just as much danger.

723
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,264
Homelander almost lasered me
in half in front of her,

724
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,640
and it was like...

725
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,685
it was like I was back with every bully
that I ever had, just taking it.

726
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,396
And then she had to save me again.

727
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,901
Butcher, please. Please.

728
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,029
Please.

729
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:51,658
Because right now, I am so angry
that I can't even breathe.

- [exhales]
- Oh, Hughie.

It's shittier.

732
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,420
It's not power.

733
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,173
It's punishment.

734
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,592
You don't deserve none of it.

735
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,180
What, and you do?

736
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,481
Get ready to go.

[door closes]

738

You do have a hell of a view from up here.

739
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,658
I'll give you that.

740
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,411
[Homelander] You should see it from space.

741
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,458
Unbelievable. Eighty over 60.

742
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,460
Your entire life is imploding,

743
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,672
and it's as if you're reading
fucking John Grisham.

[chuckles, exhales]

745
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:56,848
I heard about your, uh,
temporary leave of absence, by the way.

746
00:41:56,932 --> 00:42:00,602
Those things do have a nasty habit
of becoming permanent, though, don't they?

747
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,112
- Don't blame Vicky. You...
- I don't.

748
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:14,282
If there's one thing I taught her,
it was to play all sides.

749
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,246
She's more like me than I ever imagined.

750
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,165
But I am curious.

751
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:23,667
What did you give her?

752
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,085
A little respect, Stan.

753
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,295
Something you should've given me.

754
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:29,589
What good would that do?

755
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,925
Where would it even go

756
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:36,930
but to the bottomless,
gaping pit of insecurity you call a soul?

757
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,808
[shudders playfully, laughs]

758
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,728
Oh, God. You want to know something?

759
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,355
I used to be intimidated by you.

760
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:46,898
I did.

761
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,735
And now I look at you, I-I'm just...

762
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:53,071
I-I have no idea why. Truly.

763
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:56,491
Y-You're not even pathetic.

764
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:59,786
You're-you're just... nothing.

765
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,538
Then why are you still here,

766
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:04,583
looking for my approval
like I'm your daddy?

767
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,045
And even if I were, what would
there be to approve of?

768
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,881
The company is yours.

769
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:12,632
No one left to stand up to you.

770
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:18,472
But I think you'll come
to sorely regret that.

771
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:21,224
And why is that?

772
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:24,811
Because there's no one left
to cover for you, either.

773
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:29,691
Eventually, probably soon,
the world will recognize you

774
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,819
for the pitiful disappointment you are.

775
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,072
You are not worthy of my respect.

776
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,283
You are not a god.

777
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,787
You are simply bad product.

778
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,717
I'm scared.

779
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,385
I know.

780
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:03,850
You know, when I was little,
they did the same thing to me.

781
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,144
And I'm all right.

782
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,817
We have to, okay?

783
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:16,196
'Cause you know what?
It's gonna make you so strong and safe.

784
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:18,740
Forever.

785
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,826
- Okay?
- Okay.

786
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:23,829
Okay, turn around. On your belly.

787
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,646
Just a pinch.

Okay. Okay.

It's okay. Shh.

- It's gonna be okay.

Shh, shh. It's okay.

I've got you. I've got you. Shh.

[Zoe screams]

800

That chick Nina didn't do us no favors.

801
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,565
That ain't a lab.
It's a military compound.

802
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,358
Russian military compound.

803
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,028
Be like storming a Baja Fresh. [grunts]

804
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:45,035
Baja Fresh ain't shooting us

930
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:12,185
I, uh, I have a view
I really want to show you.

931
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,395
It's gonna blow your mind.

This really is a beautiful city.

936

You know, you don't need to do this.
The cameras are gone.

937
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,162
[laughs]

938
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,371
Yeah.

939
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:36,167
But, see, that's the thing
about me, Starlight.

940
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,336
If I promise something, I deliver.

941
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:42,548
Now, that is the view of a lifetime.

942
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:46,719
Alex?

943
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:51,724
Alex!

944
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,309
Oh, my God.

945
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,186
You fucking psycho!

946
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,314
Stop it. You know how that ends.

947
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:02,443
You know, besides, this is your fault
as much as it is mine.

948
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:03,778
What?

949
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:07,323
A-Train told me about you two mutineers
and your little plot.

950
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,201
You just don't get it, do you?

951
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:14,789
I mean, you have no fucking grasp
of the situation you're in at all, right?

952
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:18,292
I'm gonna break it down one more time,
and I'm gonna make it crystal clear

953
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:21,003
so that even you can understand it, okay?

954
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:24,799
There will be no more plotting,
planning, playing around.

955
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,884
That is over, okay?

956
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:32,139
From here on out,
there is only my dutiful, loving

957
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:36,978
main squeeze Starlight,
worshipping me and me alone.

958
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,938
Because if you step one inch out of line,

959
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,649
I mean, i-if you so much
as fucking blink the wrong way,

960
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,736
then that, my love, will be Hughie.

961
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,535
Do you understand this time?

962
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,582
Good.

963
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:02,044
Then say it, so I know.

964
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:04,630
"That'll be Hughie."

965
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:10,636
