00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,269
Gwyn and Sarah and I talked it out.

967
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,839
Yeah, and Nate and I are besties again.

968
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:13,374
No, apologies to me
and Gideon, you jerks.

969
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,609
She wouldn't have had to
switch over to robo mode

970
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,446
if you guys didn't make
her second-guess herself

971
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,781
and then make her feel guilty
about our relationship!

972
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:21,549
Thank you, Gary.

I've noticed that you've all found love

975
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,522
in some of the most chaotic of times,

976
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:31,259
and you've still done your
jobs with terrific aplomb.

977
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:33,228
So, you know, the fact that you think

978
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:35,462
that Gary and I cannot find comfort

979
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,665
in each other's sweet embrace,

980
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,166
it's a bit hypocritical.

yeah, actually, you're...
you're completely right.

It's quite nice feeling emotional again.

00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,986
It's like a warm and gooey feeling

as opposed to a cold and
calculated urge to murder.

But, hey, since you are

where do you think we should go?

00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,441
I'm glad you asked, Captain,
because I've given it

998
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,642
much tactical and
emotional consideration,

my gut, as us humans say,

to plot a course

for Sarajevo in 1914.

1002

We need to save Archduke Franz Ferdinand

1003

and stop World War I.
