1
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:10,316
<i>The day
I went missing...</i>

2
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:12,818
<i>was the day I died.</i>

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,021
<i>Five years in hell
forged me into a weapon,</i>

4
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:18,991
<i>which I use to honor
a vow I made to my father,</i>

5
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:22,294
<i>who sacrificed
his life for mine.</i>

6
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:25,381
<i>In his final moments,
he told me the truth...</i>

7
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:29,551
<i>that our family's wealth had been
<i0 built on the suffering of others.</i>

8
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:31,303
<i>That he failed our city,</i>

9
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:35,374
<i>and that it was up to me to save it
and right his wrongs.</i>

10
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:38,844
<i>But to do that without endangering
the people closest to me,</i>

11
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:41,230
<i>I have to be
someone else.</i>

12
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:44,900
<i>I have to be
something else.</i>

13
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,819
Who's that?
Where'd he come from?

14
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:54,610
What's going on here?

15
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:57,663
Get the chopper back now.

16
00:00:57,665 --> 00:00:59,231
Who's is guy?

17
00:01:01,668 --> 00:01:03,285
Whoa, whoa!
Easy, wait, wait!

18
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:12,744
No, please...
Marcus Redman,

19
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,263
you failed this city.

20
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,714
Please, don't!
Please! Don't!

21
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:18,267
Cell phone, inside pocket,
call your partner.

22
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,186
Tell him to give those pensioners
back their money.

23
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,255
Do it now.

24
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,690
Okay.

25
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,612
<i>Over the past 15 years,</i>

26
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:34,116
<i>Mr. Redman has withdrawn more than 
$30 million from the plan's account.</i>

27
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:36,869
<i>Mr. Redman claims refunding
the Halcyon pension plan</i>

28
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,604
<i>has always been his intent.</i>

29
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,957
<i>But sources say Redman
was coerced by the vigilante.</i>

30
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,177
This guy gets more air-time
than the Kardashians, right?

31
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:48,080
Five years on an island
and you still know who they are.

32
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,998
I've been catching up.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,167
It's nice to see how much our culture
has improved while I was away.

34
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:55,054
But the city used to be different.
People used to feel safe.

35
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:58,057
Aw, what's the matter, Mom?
Afraid we're gonna be next?

36
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,175
Do you have
any questions about today, Oliver?

37
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,561
It's a simple
proof-of-life declaration.

38
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,646
Just read out a brief,
prepared statement to the judge,

39
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:07,566
and then your death-in-absentia judgment
will be voided.

40
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,601
It's fine, Walter,
I've been in a courtroom before.

41
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:10,769
Four times
by my estimate.

42
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:12,020
You know,
there was the DUI,

43
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:13,739
the assault on that
paparazzi douchebag,

44
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,776
stealing that taxi,
which was just awesome, by the way,

45
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:20,446
and who could forget
peeing on the cop?

46
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:21,980
I wish everyone would.

47
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:23,866
I'd hang, but we're
headed to court.

48
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,200
I know, that's why
I'm here.

49
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:26,869
My best friend
is getting legally resurrected,

50
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,820
- I wouldn't miss this for the world.
- Right. Okay.

51
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:30,655
What about you?

52
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:33,292
Oh, I think the first four times of you
in court was enough for me.

53
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:35,461
Fair enough.

54
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:39,264
Mrs. Queen?
Car's ready.

55
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,670
Walter.

56
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:52,111
Are you going to testify as to
what happened when the yacht sank?

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Are you going
to talk about the boat crash?

58
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:01,019
Mr. Queen, did you
see Sarah Lance die?

59
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,288
Sarah!

60
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:05,908
<i>There was a storm.</i>

61
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:11,530
The boat went down.
I was the only survivor.

62
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:17,035
She's not there!
Sarah!

63
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:20,839
My father
didn't make it.

64
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:22,040
No!

65
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:25,544
I almost died, I...

66
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:31,733
I thought that I had,
because I spent so many days

67
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:34,052
on that life raft
before I saw land.

68
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,324
<i>When I reached it,
I knew...</i>

69
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:43,061
<i>I knew that I was
gonna have to live for both of us.</i>

70
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,283
And in those five years,

71
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:52,971
it was that one thought
that kept me going.

72
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:57,242
Your Honor, we move to vitiate
the death-in-absentia

73
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,528
filed after Oliver's
disappearance at sea

74
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,880
<i>aboard the Queen's Gamut
five years ago.</i>

75
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:03,899
Unfortunately we will
not be requesting

76
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,718
that the declaration of death filed
for the petitioner's father,

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,971
Robert Queen,
be rescinded.

78
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:12,474
The Queen family is only
entitled to one miracle, I'm afraid.

79
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:19,398
Now, onto the offices.
Everyone is waiting to meet you there.

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,099
Uh, Mom, that was...

81
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:25,053
...a little bit heavier than I was
expecting it to be.

82
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:27,573
Can we do that
tomorrow? Please?

83
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,544
Of course.
Thank you.

84
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,919
Last week, you couldn't
wait to get to the company.

85
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,055
Tommy, I'd just spent
five years away from civilization.

86
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,789
I wasn't exactly
thinking straight.

87
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,893
I... Hi.

88
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,928
What are you
doing here?

89
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,514
Oh, they were bringing me
back from the dead.

90
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:53,632
Legally speaking.

91
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:57,402
- What are you doing here?
- My job.

92
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:59,521
- Right.
- More like the D.A.'s.

93
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,661
- Hi, Oliver Queen.
- Emily Nocenti.

94
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,647
Oliver just got back from five years on
an uncharted island.

95
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,949
Before that,he was cheating on me
with my sister.

96
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:12,417
He was with her
when she died.

97
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,086
And last week, he told me
to stay away from him.

98
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:15,587
It was really good advice.

99
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,089
Excuse me.

100
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,710
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Let's go.

101
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:29,685
Come on, buddy,
shake it off. Let's go.

102
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,603
Mr. Somers!
Mr. Somers!

103
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,306
What do you have to say about the
accusations made by Laurel Lance?

104
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,441
I don't know what I've done
to earn this witch-hunt

105
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:39,645
from Miss Lance
and her bosses at the CNRI.

106
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,013
But I can tell you this.

107
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,805
I am an honest businessman,
and I will fight this slander

108
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,830
to my last dime and breath.

109
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,986
That's all I have
to say, thank you.

110
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,209
Oh, there's Mr. Queen...

111
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:56,995
- Mr. Queen, do you want to follow up?
- What happened in there, sir?

112
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:58,997
Tell us what happened
inside, Mr. Queen...

113
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,716
Step back
everybody, please.

114
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:02,467
Can you give us
a couple comments

115
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,419
about the island, Mr. Queen?
Before you go, sir, please.

116
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,705
- Couple of comments about the island, sir.
- What happened in there?

117
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:07,606
Everybody, step back.

118
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:09,631
Hey man, I'll make you
swallow that Nikon. Back!

119
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:15,880
This happens to you
a lot, doesn't it?

120
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,318
How much is a life worth?

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,020
A life of a man,
a good man,

122
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:24,889
a stevedore on the docks
of the city in which we live.

123
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,593
<i>A father.</i>

124
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:30,278
A man with a daughter.

125
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,031
The plaintiff will prove
by a preponderance of evidence

126
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,000
that Victor Nocenti
learned that his boss,

127
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:37,536
that man sitting right there,
Martin Somers,

128
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:39,705
was taking bribes from
the Chinese Triads

129
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,923
to smuggle drugs
into our city.

130
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,593
<i>And when Victor Nocenti
threatened to tell the police,</i>

131
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,745
<i>Martin Somers had him killed.</i>

132
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:50,349
Mr. Somers is
very well-connected,

133
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:53,051
and has friends in the
District Attorney's office.

134
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:54,569
Which is why,
if Emily Nocenti

135
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:56,938
is to get justice
for her father's death,

136
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,307
if Martin Somers
is to get justice for his crimes,

137
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,027
then someone is going
to have to do it for them.

138
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:16,458
<i>Martin Somers.</i>

139
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,610
<i>Laurel's targeted
the worst of Starling City,</i>

140
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:22,547
<i>so it's no surprise
his name is on my father's list.</i>

141
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,386
<i>The city's police and
the D.A. can't stop him...</i>

142
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,388
<i>or won't.</i>

143
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,775
<i>Laurel thinks she's the only one
willing to bring him to justice.</i>

144
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:36,178
<i>She's wrong.</i>

145
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:41,316
You, listen up.

146
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:43,985
The longer this goes on, the more
likely the media is gonna crucify me.

147
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:46,254
You shut this trial down,
do you understand me?

148
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:51,576
What the hell?

149
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,922
- Martin Somers...
- Who the hell are you?

150
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:05,173
...you've failed this city.

151
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,591
No!
No, no, no, no, no!

152
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,544
You're gonna testify
in that trial.

153
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:12,330
You're gonna confess
to having Victor Nocenti killed.

154
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,101
There won't be
a second warning.

157
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:39,633
I hired you to
protect my son.

158
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,519
Now, I'm not
a professional bodyguard,

159
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,238
but it seems to me that the first
requirement would be managing to stay

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,657
next to the man
you're hired to protect.

161
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,976
With all due respect, ma'am, I never had
a client who didn't want my protection.

162
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:52,196
I hired you. That
makes me the client.

163
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:59,120
Now where do you think my son is going
on these chaperone-less excursions?

164
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,456
Ma'am, I truly
do not know.

165
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,841
And he truly doesn't.

166
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,493
Then perhaps you'd
like to share with me

167
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,762
you know, where it is you run off to.

168
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,132
I've been alone
for five years.

169
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,101
- I know that, Oliver.
- Mom...

170
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:15,436
Alone.

171
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:18,573
I see.

172
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,609
I promise to introduce
her if it ever gets

173
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,028
to the exchanging
first names stage...

174
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,316
No, I'd rather you promise to take
Mr. Diggle with you on your next rendezvous.

175
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,285
It's not safe, you've
already been abducted once.

176
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,654
There is a maniac out there,
hunting the wealthy.

177
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,039
That maniac saved my life.

178
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,290
This isn't a game.

179
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:39,827
I lost you once.

180
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,363
And I am not going
through that again.

181
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,866
Okay.

182
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:49,420
Digg's my guy.

183
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,373
Thank you.

184
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,547
Sorry to give you
so much grief.

185
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,217
I served three tours
in Afghanistan, Mr. Queen.

186
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,987
You don't even come close
to my definition of grief.

187
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,556
But I tell you what...

188
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,192
You ditch me
one more time,

189
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,860
no one will
have to fire me.

190
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:21,202
Where you going?

191
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,538
Uh... Somewhere
loud and smoky.

192
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,341
And don't bother trying to
pickpocket my stash this time,

193
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,343
because I'm gonna go
get drunk instead.

194
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:31,579
Thea,

195
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:36,017
do you think this is what
Dad would want for you?

196
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,887
Dead people
don't want anything.

197
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,305
It's one of the
benefits of being dead.

198
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,756
I was dead.

199
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,560
And I wanted a lot.

200
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,428
Except for your family.

201
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,264
You've been home
a week and all you do

202
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:53,885
is avoid Mom, ignore
Walter, and judge me.

203
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,438
Don't wait up.

204
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,296
Well, I owe you
an apology, Mr. Somers.

205
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,298
We come all the way
down to your docks,

206
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,117
and it turns out, you don't
need the police after all.

207
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,802
Which is exactly
what I've been saying.

208
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,505
Yeah. So I guess that 9-1-1
call we got last night

209
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,591
from your stevedore, saying
that you were getting attacked

210
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,726
by a guy in a green hood
and a bow and arrow...

211
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:22,963
I guess... Well, was that
a practical joke?

212
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,401
These guys like
to fool around.

213
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,969
Yeah.

214
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,139
Well, you know, I'd be
very much inclined

215
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:35,259
to believe an honest, upstanding
businessman like yourself,

216
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,446
except, well,
one of my men

217
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,034
found this
at your docks.

218
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,204
You see, there's this
vigilante running around.

219
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,322
He thinks he's some
kind of Robin Hood.

220
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:50,424
He's robbing the rich, he's trying
to teach them a lesson I guess.

221
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,261
I don't know, I don't know.
But the point is,

222
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:55,263
the man's a killer.

223
00:11:55,265 --> 00:12:00,268
And nothing, and no one, is going
to stop me from bringing him down.

224
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,469
But like you said...

225
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,507
Hmm!

226
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:12,396
...clearly, nothing
happened here last night.

227
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,733
Isn't this a conflict
of interest, Detective?

228
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,319
After all, your
daughter is suing me.

229
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,154
I'm pretty good at keeping
my emotions in check.

230
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,356
I'm not.

231
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:25,359
You and your daughter don't want
to find out what I'm capable of

232
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,027
when I get emotional.

233
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,654
As you can see, Oliver, we've
modernized quite a bit.

234
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,277
Hi.

235
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,330
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Yes, I am.

236
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:05,333
I remember when your father used
to bring you here when you were a boy.

237
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:06,867
You always
were so excited.

238
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,836
Dad let me drink soda
in the office.

239
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,571
Ah! So that's why
you enjoyed coming.

240
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:15,793
The Queen Consolidated's
success of late

241
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,796
is a result of its
targeted diversification.

242
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,350
We have been making impressive
inroads in cutting-edge fields

243
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,885
like bio-tech
and clean energy.

244
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,387
That's neat.
Excuse me?

245
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,141
Can I get a sparkling water,
or something cold, please?

246
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,859
Sweetheart, Oliver,

247
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,594
Walter and I have something
to discuss with you.

248
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,279
Come, please sit.

249
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,648
Mom, it makes me nervous
when you ask me to sit down.

250
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,619
The company's about to
break ground on a new site

251
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,404
for the Applied
Sciences division,

252
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,656
and we would like
to honor your father

253
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,409
- by dedicating the building in his name.
- Nice.

254
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:52,380
And we'd like to make an
announcement at the dedication

255
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:55,466
that you will be taking a
leadership position in the company.

256
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,052
No.
No, your... Your company.

257
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,637
No, I don't want
to lead anything.

258
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,789
Besides, Walter is doing
a very good job here.

259
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,293
You said that you wanted
to be a different person.

260
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,797
And you are
Robert Queen's son.

261
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,931
I don't need to be
reminded of that.

262
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,516
Well, obviously you do.

263
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:21,475
Everyone here understands that this
transition is really difficult for you.

264
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:23,644
Thank you, Walter.

265
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,031
Which part, though?

266
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,451
Everyone fantasizing that I got
my MBA while I was on the island?

267
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,255
Or the fact that my father's CFO
now sleeps down the hall from me?

268
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:47,835
You know, five years ago, your
irresponsibility was somewhat charming.

269
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:51,806
It is a lot less so now.

270
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:07,154
There he is!

271
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,168
The driver will
be here in a minute.

272
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:25,473
Okay.

273
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:28,225
You know, I spent the first 27
years of my life in Starling City,

274
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,510
and the next five
in Afghanistan.

275
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,178
You want to know
what I learned?

276
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,181
There's no place
like home?

277
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:36,717
No, just the opposite.

278
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,820
Home is a battlefield.

279
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:43,023
Back home, they're all
trying to get you.

280
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,727
Get you to open up, be somebody
you're not sure you are anymore.

281
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,198
Or I could be wrong.

282
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Maybe after
five years alone,

283
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,203
you're not as messed up in the head
as you have every right to be.

284
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:05,346
Hey!

285
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,381
Hey, get away!

286
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:10,751
Hey!

287
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,058
Dad?

288
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,778
Hey! Hey, stay away
from him!

289
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,248
<i>Well, we anticipate
that Somers' attorney</i>

290
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,802
will try and paint you as blinded
by grief or looking to make a buck.

291
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:21,622
This isn't about
the money.

292
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,624
I just want justice
for my father.

293
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,428
Emily, there are a lot of people who
don't want this trial to proceed.

294
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,546
Dangerous people.

295
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,397
My mother died
when I was a baby,

296
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,766
and my father has been the
only family I've ever known

297
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,268
and they slit his throat.

298
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,138
They are going to
have to kill me

299
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,857
if they want me
to give this up.

300
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,809
Well let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

301
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,277
And it won't.

302
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,146
What's going on?

303
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,681
What's going on
is that the three of you

304
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:48,732
are getting around-the-clock
police protection. Okay?

305
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,701
Get used to their faces,

306
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,152
because they're going with you
everywhere you go, no arguments.

307
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,737
I'm a lawyer.
I live to argue.

308
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,856
I'm your father.
I live to keep you safe.

309
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,627
Um, Emily, let's go grab
a cup of coffee, okay?

310
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,696
Yes, why not do that? Thank you.
Please, go with them.

311
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:03,964
Stay there.

312
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,551
Protective custody?

313
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,554
I seem to recall you trying that
once I discovered boys also.

314
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,972
Didn't work then either.

315
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:13,924
This isn't
a joke, Laurel.

316
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,876
Martin Somers got
attacked last night.

317
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,545
- What?
- Yeah.

318
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,213
- By who?
- It doesn't matter.

319
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:22,816
Point is, you have whipped
up a storm with these guys,

320
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:25,385
and until the dust settles
you'll be protected, okay?

321
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:28,022
End of discussion.

322
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,357
That might have worked
when I was eight.

323
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,408
But it's not gonna
work anymore.

324
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,193
End of discussion,
Laurel!

325
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,578
You're insistent on doing
your job, that's great.

326
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,913
But this is me
doing mine, okay?

327
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,915
And not just as a
father, but as a cop.

328
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,567
These people, they are more dangerous
than you are willing to admit.

329
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,370
And you've made them angry.

330
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:54,298
- Thank you for coming.
- Anything for a friend.

331
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,716
We're not friends.

332
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,085
You smuggle drugs,
I let you use my port.

333
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,970
For which you're paid
a lot of money.

334
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,272
I don't get paid enough
to have arrows shot at me.

335
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,591
You need to take
this guy seriously.

336
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:07,394
He is a bigger threat to your
operation than Nocenti ever was.

337
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,697
Except now it's Nocenti's
daughter who's the problem.

338
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,533
Unlike your friend with the hood,
we know where to find her.

339
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,368
Don't be an idiot.

340
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,737
You take out Emily Nocenti, and
Laurel Lance will never let this go.

341
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,339
She won't stop until
she burns you,

342
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:20,924
me, and then the entire
Triad to the ground.

343
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,744
Then we kill Miss Lance.

344
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:32,581
<i>Attorney for shipping
magnate, Martin Somers,</i>

345
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,518
<i>has confirmed his client has
no intention of testifying,</i>

346
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,688
<i>maintaining his innocence in the
wrongful death of Victor Nocenti.</i>

347
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,023
<i>Nocenti's body was
found four weeks ago.</i>

348
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,892
<i>We'll keep you updated as more
information becomes available.</i>

349
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:44,527
Wait, how did
you get those?

350
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:46,145
Don't you knock?

351
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:48,564
No, wait... Mom said
that there were scars, but...

352
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:58,441
I'm... Oliver, what
happened to you out there?

353
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,448
I don't want
to talk about it.

354
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:10,720
Of course you don't.

355
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:13,222
You never want to talk
to me about anything.

356
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:14,891
- Except for my social life.
- Wait!

357
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,211
Where are you going?

358
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:19,695
Why should I tell you?

359
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,133
I'm sorry, Thea.

360
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:30,473
I need to get better at talking
about what happened to me there.

361
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:36,028
But I'm not ready yet.

362
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:37,480
Okay?

363
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,584
Do you have a second?

364
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:43,819
Yeah.

365
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:46,205
Good.

366
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:49,091
I wanna show you
something out back.

367
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:55,631
Sometimes, when I
felt... Whatever...

368
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,217
I'd come here.

369
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:05,508
About a month after the funerals,
Mom stopped going out.

370
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,512
Pretty soon, she stopped
talking altogether.

371
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:14,400
The house got so quiet,
so I'd come here.

372
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,737
To talk to you.

373
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,192
I mean, stupid stuff.

374
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:26,412
Like what I was doing that day,
what boy I had a crush on...

375
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:30,216
And then sometimes,
I'd ask you,

376
00:21:30,218 --> 00:21:33,536
beg you, to find
your way home to me.

377
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,556
Now, here you are.

378
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,476
And the truth is, I felt closer
to you when you were dead.

379
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:45,381
Look, I know it was
hell where you were.

380
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,350
But it was hell here too.

381
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,154
You gotta
let me in, Ollie.

382
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:56,359
You gotta let
someone in.

383
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:30,092
Hi.

384
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:31,427
Are you okay?

385
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:33,646
There are two
cop cars outside.

386
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:35,565
How am I supposed
to stay away from you

387
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,350
if you won't
stay away from me?

388
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,603
- I...
- What are you doing here, Ollie?

389
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:43,823
My sister took...

390
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:47,610
She pointed out to me that I have been
distant since I got back and that...

391
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:52,415
It would probably be a good
idea if I let somebody in.

392
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:55,418
So, you thought you'd start with
the first person you pushed away.

393
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,169
I did that
to protect you.

394
00:22:58,171 --> 00:22:59,422
And then I
saw you yesterday,

395
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:01,257
and I realized
that I hurt you.

396
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,434
Thank you.

397
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:17,473
Wow.

398
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:20,743
This place hasn't changed
in five years.

399
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:23,913
I haven't really had
time to redecorate.

400
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:26,415
I'm a jerk.

401
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:31,153
Before the island, I was a
jerk, and now I'm just a...

402
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,207
I'm a damaged jerk.

403
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,542
What's in the bag?

404
00:23:38,478 --> 00:23:41,130
I thought about many
things on the island,

405
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:42,932
but there was one thing that
I thought about every day.

406
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:44,433
I actually
dreamed about it,

407
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:47,603
and I promised myself that
if I ever got a chance

408
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:50,806
to do it again,
I'd do it with you.

409
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:56,479
Eat ice cream.

410
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:04,453
This is as good
as I remember.

411
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:11,060
My mother wants me
to join the company.

412
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:14,430
Yeah. Take my
rightful place.

413
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:18,801
I can't exactly picture you
as master of the universe.

414
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,707
You know,
after five years,

415
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:27,660
I have plans.

416
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:31,597
I have things
that I have to do.

417
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,382
I can't do that if I'm...

418
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:36,769
I don't know...

419
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,689
Attending board meetings
and stockholder briefings.

420
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:43,325
Oliver?
Hmm?

421
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,727
You're an adult.

422
00:24:45,545 --> 00:24:46,696
You can say no.

423
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:47,830
Oh, I tried.

424
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:50,833
Didn't take.

425
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:52,985
Well, then
don't tell her.

426
00:24:53,553 --> 00:24:55,488
Show her.

427
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,741
Be the person that you
want her to see you as.

428
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:01,577
Trust me.

429
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,549
I have plenty of experience
with disapproving parents.

430
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:09,385
I have been on the receiving end
of your father's disapproval.

431
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:13,522
He blames himself
more than he blames you.

432
00:25:13,524 --> 00:25:17,359
He thinks that, you know, maybe
if he and Sarah were closer,

433
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:20,529
she would have told him
about the boat trip.

434
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:23,265
And he could have stopped
her from going with you.

435
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,367
I am sorry.

436
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:26,919
You apologized already.

437
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:31,741
And it'll never be enough.

438
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:36,662
Did you hear that?

439
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:39,114
What?

440
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:45,888
There's someone
on the fire escape.

441
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:49,925
- Hey, come on..
- What are...

442
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:30,933
- Are you hurt?
- No.

443
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:33,168
- Are you hurt, Mr. Queen?
- No! No.

444
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,771
This is why it's a good
idea to have a bodyguard.

445
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:39,241
You okay?

446
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:54,115
- Daddy!
- Oh, thank God.

447
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:56,251
- Thank God. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

448
00:26:57,453 --> 00:26:58,870
Those cops that you
put on me...

449
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:02,490
They...

450
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:04,709
I went outside to ask for a light and
they were both dead in the squad car.

451
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:12,217
Mr. Diggle, thank you.

452
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,469
Feel free to run as many red
lights in the city as you want.

453
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:15,720
I was just
doing my job, sir.

454
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:17,722
No, your job
is protecting him.

455
00:27:19,692 --> 00:27:22,677
It seems like whenever you're with
one of my daughters, people die.

456
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,446
You stay away
from Laurel,

457
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:27,031
or I swear the next
time you disappear,

458
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,533
- it will be permanent.
- Dad!

459
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:29,684
- No, Laurel...
- It's okay.

460
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:31,486
I understand.

461
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:34,656
Yeah.

462
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:42,797
Here!

463
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,716
I'd say thank you, but I don't
think that would cover it.

464
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:47,418
Well, like I told your cop
friend, I was just doing my job.

465
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,704
Besides, I think it should
be you that I'm thanking.

466
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:55,760
- What for?
- The knife.

467
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,413
The knife.

468
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,448
- I got lucky.
- That was a kitchen knife.

469
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,933
It wasn't even
weighted properly,

470
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,768
yet you threw it with accuracy
across a 10-foot room.

471
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,187
Exactly.
I got lucky.

472
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm not the kind of man you want to take
for a fool, Mr. Queen, you understand me?

473
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:11,576
Yes.

474
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:14,562
And I think I'm just beginning to
understand the kind of man you are.

475
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:16,581
Shouldn't take
you very long.

476
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,032
I'm shallow.

477
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:20,118
And very tired, so...

478
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:24,339
Good night.

479
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,543
Good night, sir.

480
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:30,595
<i>It wasn't how
I wanted things to go.</i>

481
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:33,631
<i>I wanted to give Martin
Somers the chance to confess</i>

482
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:35,600
<i>and face a court's justice,</i>

483
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:39,771
<i>but he chose to go after
someone I care about instead.</i>

484
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:43,141
<i>He's still going
to face justice.</i>

485
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:46,728
<i>It'll just be
a different kind.</i>

486
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,531
<i>Everyone wants to know
what kind of man I am.</i>

487
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:53,534
<i>Martin Somers is
about to find out.</i>

488
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:58,706
Triad bitch screwed up
the hit on Lance.

489
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:01,459
Now, the Triad is gonna
erase every ounce

490
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:04,545
of evidence of their smuggling
operation, including me.

491
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:06,247
Except that's
not gonna happen.

492
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:08,666
Tell Wallace to get the boat ready.
I'm leaving tonight.

493
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:09,834
Wallace?

494
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:12,170
Wallace, you copy?

495
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:13,788
Wallace?

496
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,641
<i>Wallace isn't here.</i>

497
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:18,393
<i>But I am.</i>

498
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,812
We need to move, now.

499
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,680
- Move!
- Sir, we've got six men out there.

500
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:24,298
It's not enough.
Move it!

501
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,067
You're gonna go back into
that courtroom tomorrow

502
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,685
and you're gonna recuse yourself
from this case, all right?

503
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:29,637
Or drop it.
Either way, you're done.

504
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:31,773
If you think I'm gonna
abandon Emily Nocenti,

505
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,140
then you don't know me
all that well.

506
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:34,692
You don't know me well,
young lady.

507
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:36,661
I will lock you in a cell
if that's what it takes.

508
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:38,746
Well, I guess that's what
it's gonna take then.

509
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:43,034
Damn it, Laurel!

510
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:45,486
I thought after what
happened with Sarah,

511
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:46,821
you'd stop being
just so reckless.

512
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:48,489
It's not about
being reckless!

513
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:51,626
It's just the opposite.

514
00:29:51,628 --> 00:29:53,828
I'm trying to make this
city safer, just like you.

515
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:56,714
Sweetie.

516
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,051
You're my only
daughter, Laurel.

517
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,471
You're all I have
left to live for.

518
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:06,274
But what you want
from me isn't living.

519
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:09,009
Having cops around, not
being able to do my job.

520
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:12,230
Your job is not going after
people like the Triad or Somers.

521
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:14,899
My job is to use the law
to fight for what is right.

522
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,017
Just like you taught me.

523
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:19,404
Well, that's dirty.
Using me against me.

524
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:22,657
You can't do that.

525
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,461
Well...

526
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,580
Maybe I picked that up
along the way, too.

527
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:37,872
Lance.

528
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,143
I'll be right there.

529
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:44,762
I gotta go.

530
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:46,514
Something's going on
at the docks.

531
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:20,915
Somers!

532
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:36,274
Oh, God, no, no, no.

533
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:37,591
He can't help you.

534
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:41,779
I want the truth
about Victor Nocenti.

535
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:42,763
I can't.

536
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:44,232
The Triad will kill me.

537
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,933
The Triad's not
your concern right now.

538
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:50,738
All right, all right,
all right.

539
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,491
It wasn't me that killed him.
It was the Triad.

540
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:55,259
Acting on whose
instructions?

541
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:59,163
Whose?

542
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:02,166
All right, all right. It was mine.
It was mine, all right?

543
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:05,019
Nocenti said he was gonna
testify against me.

544
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:38,651
<i>Put down your weapons</i>

545
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:39,988
<i>or we will open fire.</i>

546
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:41,989
<i>I repeat,
lay down your weapons.</i>

547
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:55,636
Freeze!

548
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:01,642
You twitch and you're dead.

549
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,117
Bow down, hands up.

550
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,207
<i>All right, all right.
It was mine. It was mine, all right?</i>

551
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:36,143
<i>Nocenti said he was gonna
testify against me.</i>

552
00:33:36,878 --> 00:33:38,312
You son of a bitch.

553
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:49,240
<i>Laurel will be safe.</i>

554
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:51,859
<i>She was right.</i>

555
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,228
<i>I can't be the Oliver
my mother wants me to be</i>

556
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,999
<i>and still keep the promise
I made to my father.</i>

557
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:03,538
<i>I have to be the person
I need them to see me as.</i>

558
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:07,241
Oh!
Excuse me, ladies.

559
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:11,379
Okay, this is a surprise.

560
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,514
Did you show up
here by mistake?

561
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:16,300
By invitation.

562
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,752
Oliver invited me last night.
Last night?

563
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:22,390
Is that surprise
or jealousy I'm hearing?

564
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,976
Look, I just don't want him
to find out anything, okay?

565
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,029
Oliver has been
through a lot.

566
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:30,565
Tommy, we've all
been through a lot.

567
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,066
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

568
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,368
<i>And thank you
all for coming.</i>

569
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,606
<i>Welcome to the future site of the Robert
Queen Memorial Applied Sciences Center.</i>

570
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,378
<i>Now, this is a building that
will stand as a monument</i>

571
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,249
<i>to the man whose company and
vision are his greatest legacies.</i>

572
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:49,917
Whoa! Whoa!

573
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,978
What about me? Right?
I'm a legacy.

574
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,481
Hey! Thanks for
warming them up, Walt.

575
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:06,467
All right.
Ow! Fine, fine shovel. I got it.

576
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:08,986
- Whoa! Ow!
- He must be drunk.

577
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:11,822
I got it. I got it.

578
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:14,141
<i>Some of you may not know me.
My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

579
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,698
<i>Watch some television,
read a newspaper,</i>

580
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,484
<i>I'm kind of famous
right now.</i>

581
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:27,872
<i>Mostly, though, I'm famous
because I'm Robert Queen's son.</i>

582
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:31,659
<i>Uh, but as Walter,
who's my new dad...</i>

583
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:34,545
<i>Huh? Who is... Sorry.</i>

584
00:35:34,547 --> 00:35:36,881
<i>As Walter was saying,</i>

585
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:40,301
<i>I'm not much of
a legacy, per se.</i>

586
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:41,435
Oliver, you don't
have to do this.

587
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:42,937
<i>No, sit. Sit!</i>

588
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:45,172
<i>Gosh.</i>

589
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,060
<i>See, I was supposed
to come here today,</i>

590
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:52,980
<i>and I'm supposed to take my
rightful place at the company.</i>

591
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:57,351
<i>Prodigal son returns home
and becomes the heir apparent.</i>

592
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,189
<i>But I'm not my father.</i>

593
00:36:03,825 --> 00:36:05,076
<i>I'm not the man he was.</i>

594
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:06,744
<i>I'm not half
the man he was.</i>

595
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,714
<i>I never will be.</i>

596
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:13,584
<i>So, please,
stop asking me to be.</i>

597
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:45,051
<i>Martin Somers,
the CEO of Starling Port,</i>

598
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:48,204
<i>was arrested last night for
the murder of Victor Nocenti.</i>

599
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:53,258
<i>He is also being accused of accepting cash,
including over $10 million in bribes.</i>

600
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,695
Well, we can pursue the
civil suit if you want,

601
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,429
but the D.A.
now has no choice,

602
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:59,615
with Mr. Somers' confession,
to prosecute him.

603
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,117
He's going to jail, Emily.

604
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,735
For the rest
of his life.

605
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:04,987
Thank you so much
for fighting for us.

606
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,823
Well, thank you for being
brave enough to let me.

607
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:16,499
Hey.

608
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,085
I thought I didn't need
police protection anymore.

609
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:21,137
I thought I didn't need a
reason to see my own daughter.

610
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,287
You don't.

611
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:29,311
Hmm. You look tired.

612
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:32,064
Yeah, I was filling out reports on
the shootout at the port last night

613
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:36,068
and getting grilled about how
I let that archer get away.

614
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,921
I have to admit,
I'm kind of glad he did.

615
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,240
He brought down
Martin Somers.

616
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:42,658
He hurt a bunch
of people doing it, okay?

617
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,744
He is no hero.
He is an anarchist.

618
00:37:44,746 --> 00:37:47,329
Yeah, well, whoever he is,

619
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,981
it seems like
he's trying to help.

620
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:51,033
The city doesn't need
that kind of help, okay?

621
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,535
It's like I always told
you, you don't need to go

622
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,087
outside the law to find justice.
Now I believe that.

623
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:58,657
All right? And I promise
you, when I catch this guy,

624
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:00,325
<i>he's gonna
believe it, too.</i>

625
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,406
Well, you saw
for yourself.

626
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,960
My son knows nothing.

627
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,130
Robert didn't tell him
anything that could hurt us.

628
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,383
And he has no idea that
the yacht was sabotaged.

629
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,293
All that time on the island,
plotting my return,

630
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,663
I didn't realize
how hard it would be.

631
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:06,218
To reconnect
with Mom, Thea,

632
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,257
Laurel. Okay, I didn't...

633
00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:18,731
I didn't know how painful it
would be to keep my secrets.

634
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,402
You asked me
to save the city.

635
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:25,470
To right your wrongs.

636
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:27,306
I will.

637
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:29,942
I swear.

638
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:35,748
But to do that,

639
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,168
I can't be the Oliver that
everyone wants me to be,

640
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,136
which means
that sometimes...

641
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:44,924
To honor your wishes...

642
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:50,479
I need to dishonor
your memory.

643
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:53,465
I'm sorry.

644
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,773
Take it down.

645
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:11,450
Will you be
going out tonight, sir?

646
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:14,787
Definitely.

647
00:41:46,653 --> 00:41:48,487
No, no...

648
00:41:55,484 --> 00:41:59,484
