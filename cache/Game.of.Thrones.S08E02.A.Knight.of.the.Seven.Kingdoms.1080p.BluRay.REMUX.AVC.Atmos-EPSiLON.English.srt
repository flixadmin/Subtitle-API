DAENERYS: When I was a child,

2
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,789
my brother would tell me
a bedtime story...

3
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,043
about the man
who murdered our father.

4
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:11,048
Who stabbed him in the back
and cut his throat.

5
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:14,051
Who sat down on the Iron Throne
and watched

6
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,679
as his blood poured onto the floor.

7
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,932
He told me other stories as well.

8
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,228
About all the things
we would do to that man...

9
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,733
once we took back the Seven Kingdoms
and had him in our grasp.

10
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:34,196
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,323
She did.

12
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,700
I don't see an army.

13
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,329
I see one man, with one hand.

14
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,080
It appears your sister lied to me.

15
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,918
She lied to me as well.

16
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,590
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

17
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:57,470
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet
and 20,000 fresh troops.

18
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,974
The Golden Company from Essos,
bought and paid for.

19
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,976
Even if we defeat the dead,

20
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,978
she'll have more than enough
to destroy the survivors.

21
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,563
"We"?

22
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,026
I promised to fight for the living.
I intend to keep that promise.

23
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,698
- Your Grace, I know my brother...
- Like you knew your sister?

24
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,954
He came here alone, knowing full well
how he'd be received.

25
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,249
Why would he do that
if he weren't telling the truth?

26
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,378
Perhaps he trusts his little brother
to defend him,

27
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,755
right up to the moment
he slits my throat.

28
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,841
SANSA: You're right.
We can't trust him.

29
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,886
He attacked my father in the streets.

30
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,473
He tried to destroy my house and
my family, the same as he did yours.

31

JAIME: Do you want me to apologize?

32
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,684
I won't.

33
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,062
We were at war.

34
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,564
Everything I did,
I did for my house and my family.

35
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,732
I'd do it all again.

37
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,370
DAENERYS: So why have you abandoned
your house and family now?

38
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,125
JAIME: Because this goes
beyond loyalty.

39
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,213
This is about survival.

BRIENNE: You don't know me well,

41
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,726
But I know Ser Jaime.

42
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,437
He is a man of honor.

43
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,565
I was his captor once.

44
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,151
But when we were both taken prisoner
and the men holding us

45
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,654
tried to force themselves on me,
Ser Jaime defended me.

46
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,366
And lost his hand because of it.

47
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,623
Without him, my lady,
you would not be alive.

48
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,418
He armed me, armored me,

49
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,379
and sent me to find you
and bring you home

50
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:58,382
because he'd sworn an oath
to your mother.

51
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,890
You vouch for him?

52
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,935
BRIENNE: I do.

53
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,817
You would fight beside him?

54
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:21,822
I would.

55
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,120
I trust you with my life.

56
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:33,417
If you trust him with yours,
we should let him stay.

00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,482
we're going to die at Winterfell.

Not the death I would've chosen.

165
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,282
I always pictured myself
dying in my own bed,

166
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,076
the age of 80,

167
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,411
with a belly full of wine and

168
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,163
- a girl's mouth around my cock.

169
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,170
At least Cersei
won't get to murder me.

170
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,341
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction
denying her that pleasure

while I'm being ripped apart

I'll march down to King's Landing
and rip her apart.

When I named him Hand, I didn't
know if I'd ever see you again.

You made the right choice.

I wasn't under the impression
you liked him very much.

He was never anything but decent
towards me.

246
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,341
I didn't ask him to be my Hand
simply because he was good.

247
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:58,305
I asked him to be my Hand
because he was good, and intelligent

248
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,724
and ruthless when he had to be.

249
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,060
He never should have trusted Cersei.

250

You never should have either.

We have other things in common.

256

We've both known what it means
to lead people

257

who aren't inclined
to accept a woman's rule.

258

And we've both done a damn good job
of it, from what I can tell.

And yet, I can't help but feel

Taking it back from the people
who destroyed my family,

Until I met Jon.

Now I'm here, half a world away,

I take the Iron Throne.

647
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,644
a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

(ALL CLAPPING)

649

Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

JORAH: We have all we need
to win this war.

652
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,556
LADY MORMONT: I have trained my men,
women and children.

653
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,475
I have fought before.
I can fight again.

654
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,770
JORAH: Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.

655
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,230
LADY MORMONT: I don't need you
to remind me of that.

656
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:21,733
JORAH: You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting...

657
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,401
I will not hide underground.

658
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:26,821
I pledged to fight for the North,
and I will fight.

659
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,531
MAN 1: I'm meant to relieve you.
You got it?

660
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:30,450
MAN 2: Yeah, I got it.

661
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:34,913
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

662
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,081
It's all right.

663
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,708
We're done here.

664
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,591
I wish you good fortune, cousin.

665
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:49,886
Thank you, my lady.

666
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:52,972
- My lady.
- SOLDIER: My lady.

667
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,478
What have you got there?

668
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,523
It's called Heartsbane.

669
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,901
It's my family sword.

670
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,653
You still have a family.

671
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:10,573
Yes. And I'd love
to defend them with it.

672
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,452
But I can't really hold it upright.

673
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,458
Your father,
he taught me how to be a man.

674
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,211
How to do what's right.

675
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:26,923
This is right.

676
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,346
It's Valyrian steel.

677
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,641
I'd be honored if you'd take it.

678
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,823
I'll wield it in his memory...

679
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,037
to guard the realms of men.

680
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,917
I'll see you when it's through.

681
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:16,598
I hope we win.

682
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,693
- We'd better get some rest.
- No, let's stay a bit longer.

683
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,069
We're out of wine.

684
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,785
How about a song?

685
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,997
One of you must know one.

686
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,834
- Ser Davos?
- You'll pray for a quick death.

- Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm.

00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,268
Lyanna Stark.

706
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,111
My brother Rhaegar...

707
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:24,243
everyone told me
he was decent and kind.

708
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:25,578
He liked to sing.

709
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:28,873
Gave money to poor children.

710
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,044
And he raped her.

711
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,172
JON: He didn't.

712
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:41,219
He loved her.

713
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,061
They were married in secret.

714
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,357
After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,
she had a son.

715
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,070
Robert would have murdered the baby
if he ever found out,

716
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,238
and Lyanna knew it.

as she bled to death
on her birthing bed

719

was give the boy to her brother...

00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:11,916
Ned Stark...

721
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,837

Bran.

- He saw it.
- He saw it?

731
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,365
And Samwell confirmed it.

732
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,410
He read about their marriage
at the Citadel

733

without even knowing what it meant.

Doesn't seem strange to you?

It's true, Dany.

738
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,137
I know it is.

739
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:13,144
If it were true,

740
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:17,064
it would make you the last male heir
of House Targaryen.
