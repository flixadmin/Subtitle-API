1140
01:53:42,061 --> 01:53:44,769

1141
01:54:05,238 --> 01:54:06,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Go.</b></font>

1142
01:54:06,565 --> 01:54:09,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>- Ethan.
- Brandt and Luther are waiting. Go.</b></font>

1143
01:54:17,534 --> 01:54:20,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>- What do I do?
- Kill the woman.</b></font>

1144
01:54:21,786 --> 01:54:23,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>I need Hunt alive.</b></font>

1145
01:55:11,158 --> 01:55:12,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>- Go!

1146

1147
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:16,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Then get ready.</b></font>

1148
01:55:42,505 --> 01:55:44,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Which way?</b></font>

1149
02:00:03,931 --> 02:00:08,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Face to face.
Just as you wished, Ethan</b></font>

1150
02:00:30,857 --> 02:00:33,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>It hurts, I know.</b></font>

1151
02:00:34,705 --> 02:00:38,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.</b></font>

1152
02:00:38,652 --> 02:00:40,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Mr. Lane.</b></font>

1153
02:00:41,647 --> 02:00:44,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Meet the IMF.</b></font>

1154
02:02:03,077 --> 02:02:05,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>You're free now.</b></font>

1155
02:02:07,418 --> 02:02:09,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Where will you go?</b></font>

1156
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>I don't know.</b></font>

1157
02:02:14,379 --> 02:02:16,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>I've done my part.</b></font>

1158
02:02:16,823 --> 02:02:18,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

1159
02:02:23,457 --> 02:02:25,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Ethan, we got to go.</b></font>

1160

<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>You better hurry now.</b></font>

1161
02:02:38,612 --> 02:02:40,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Good luck.</b></font>

1162
02:02:54,982 --> 02:02:57,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>You know how to find me.</b></font>

1163
02:03:14,385 --> 02:03:16,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Director Huntley.</b></font>

1164
02:03:17,861 --> 02:03:20,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>- Director Huntley.
- Ah... Mr. Chairman.</b></font>

1165
02:03:20,969 --> 02:03:25,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>6 months ago, you stood before this panel
and demanded that the IMF be dissolved.</b></font>

1166
02:03:25,889 --> 02:03:27,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>That is correct, sir.</b></font>

1167
02:03:27,554 --> 02:03:29,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>And how do you explain
your testimony today?</b></font>

1168
02:03:29,598 --> 02:03:31,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>It's quite simple really.
We had reason to believe</b></font>

1169
02:03:31,854 --> 02:03:35,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>that the Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level.</b></font>

1170
02:03:35,407 --> 02:03:40,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>In order for our man to infiltrate that
organization, his cover had to be absolute.</b></font>

1171
02:03:40,977 --> 02:03:45,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>The whole operation was known only
to myself and a handful of IMF agents.</b></font>

1172
02:03:45,433 --> 02:03:50,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>So, the shuttering of the IMF was
all part of an elaborate scheme.</b></font>

1173
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:53,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>- To expose this so call Syndicate?
- That is correct, sir.</b></font>

1174
02:03:53,837 --> 02:03:59,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Which is why you're here today,
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.</b></font>

1175
02:03:59,403 --> 02:04:01,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>That is correct, sir.</b></font>

1176
02:04:03,598 --> 02:04:07,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Huntley.</b></font>

1177
02:04:07,192 --> 02:04:11,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.</b></font>

1178
02:04:12,498 --> 02:04:14,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>And you, Mr. Brandt.</b></font>

1179
02:04:14,359 --> 02:04:17,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>How can you justify
this deception?</b></font>

1180
02:04:18,671 --> 02:04:22,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation</b></font>

1181
02:04:22,091 --> 02:04:24,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>without the Secretary's approval.</b></font>

1182
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:34,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Welcome to the IMF.</b></font>

1183
02:04:34,609 --> 02:04:36,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ffff80"><b>Mr. Secretary.</b></font>
