00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,276
Have a mai tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

325
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,194
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.

326
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,697
<i>This weekend is about you.</i>

327
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,366
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

328
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,868
So whatever it is you're doing,

329
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,454
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

330
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:27,167
<i>Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended
by such accusations!</i>

331
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,960
<i>So, how's Rachel's fiancé?</i>

332
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,463
<i>Is he as good-looking in person
as he is in pictures?</i>

333
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,547
Hey, baby.

334
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,091
[sighs] Somehow better-looking.

335
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,176
[Sonic] <i>Wow!</i>

336
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,553
<i>You're about to be
the third best-looking dude in the family.</i>

337
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,347
<i>But, hey, still on the podium.</i>

338
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,848
Ha-ha-ha.

339
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,726
All right, I better go introduce myself.

340
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,144
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

341
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,896
Trouble? Don't worry.

342
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,690
Everything here is completely normal.

343
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,192
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

344
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,070
Hey! I was just coming over to say hi.

345
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,738
You've got a lot
of nerve coming up in here

346
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,531
after what you did to my fiancée.

347
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,493
- Wait. What?
- Totaling her car?

348
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,786
Leaving her tied to a chair?

349
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,329
Man, I should rip you limb from limb.

350
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,956

352
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,251
Oh, my God, look at your face!

353
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,253
Tommy, breathe, baby.
Breathe. I was kidding.

354
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,255
- Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
- Okay.

355
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,842
- You were kidding.
- Yeah.

356
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,302
I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.

357
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,221
It was totally her idea.

358
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,639
That rascal.

359
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,432
Listen, I don't know if you're aware.

360
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,851
Rachel does not care for you at all.

361
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,937
Oh, I'm aware. Yeah.

362
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,648
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.

363
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,233
- Hey!
- Hey.

364
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,610
Good to see you! Thanks for coming, Tom.

365
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,737
- Really glad you came.
- Really?

366
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,614
Uh... Look,

367
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,741
- great to see you, too. Congratulations.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,285
I mean, you guys seem
really happy together.

369
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,954
You know, you're all right,
Thomas Wachowski.

370
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,080
Ah.

371
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,790
Can we bury the hatchet?

372
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,250
I'd love that.

373
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,835
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

374
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,379
- All right, bring it in!
- All right! Great.

375
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,673
Oh. [whispering] And if
you screw up my wedding,

376
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,757
I will end you.

[people chattering on TV]

378
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,722
All right, Ozzy, it's movie night
at Casa de Sonic,

379
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,057
and it's your turn to pick.

380
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,685
But I am not watching <i>Snow Dogs</i> again.

381
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,438
That movie is the worst!

382

[electricity powering down]

Oh, sorry, buddy. Everything's okay.

00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,033
Whoa!

[static on TV]

00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:31,583
Uh, excuse me.
We did not order a poltergeist.

Um, if this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

393
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,616
Eggman?

[crackling]

395
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,039
Hello, hedgehog.

396
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,625
Did you miss me?

397
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,586
I don't know how you got back,

398
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,339
but you made a big mistake coming here.

399
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,759
<i>Au contraire, mon frère.</i>

400
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,303
The mistake was thinking you'd won.

401
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,847
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

402
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,099
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

403
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,476
I get it.

404
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,019
[laughs]

405
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,562
I don't think you do.

406
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,606
But you're about to.

407
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,234
And so will that idiot sheriff
and his wife.

408
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,363
And your little dog too!

Sonic, meet Knuckles.

My new BFFAE.

Bestest friend forever and ever!

Look, Robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

420
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,572
You're never going to get my power.

421
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,241
Do I look like I need your power?

Oh, you want it? Here it comes.

429
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,850
I was expecting more of you.

430
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,184
You're unskilled.

Untrained.

It is my destiny to do
what my ancestors could not...

to restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

Now you're speaking my language.

Don't play dumb with me,

You knew Longclaw?

Longclaw and her people

were the sworn enemy of my tribe,
the Echidna.

it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.

Is it okay if I call you Sonic?
Everyone calls me Tails.

You're probably wondering why.

475
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,275
- Let me guess. Because of the extra tail?
- That's right!

- I should've known you'd get that.
- Cool.

Also, what is going on? Robotnik's back?

And who is Clifford

[Tails] That's Knuckles,
the last of the Echidnas

and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

481
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,998
He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.

482
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,417
[Sonic] Are you serious?
The Master Emerald?

483
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,127
That's just a bedtime story.

484
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,628
Well, he believes it's real.

485
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,006
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

Good quality bonding.

May I?

This little ring bearer

She's been practicing all morning.

How very responsible of you.

Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

Mm-hmm.

No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.

704
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:19,256
Sonic doesn't have anything like that.
He's flying solo.

705
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,092
Baby, you got to relax.

706
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,386
You're at the Four Seasons.

707
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,389
Have a mai tai.
Spend some time with your wife.

708
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:30,559
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

709
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,728
- See? He's a smart kid.
- All right.

710
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,688
- Hmm.
- He'll find his way.

Should we go back?

No, no, no. There's a light up ahead.

718

Maybe we can take shelter in there.

719
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,588
Ah. Perfect.

720
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,841
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

721
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:06,178
Don't worry. On Earth,

That's kinda my thing.

Wait, so you've been

Even in the shower?

why are we working with this imbecile?

763
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:08,091
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

764
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,136
Something to help you
get revenge on the hedgehog.

Think bigger, Stone.

766

The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

767

My genius wouldn't
just be recognized on Earth.

768
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:21,855
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

all the negative forces of the universe

Wow. That sounds big.

01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:21,199
I don't know, but we gonna find out.

1297
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,702
Haven't you caused
enough trouble for one day?

1298
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,663
Oh, I haven't even begun causing trouble.

1299

Looks like it's real, huh? [laughs]

1301
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:43,180
Whoa! Uh! Ah! Huh?

1302
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:44,598
No. Right.

1303
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:49,102
Be honest. How bad is it?

1304
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:52,314
Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.

1305
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,444
I'm so cold.

1306
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,322
You landed on our ice sculpture.

1307
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:01,490
Get up.

1308
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,122
Just...

1309
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:12,084
Just tell me the truth, for once.

1310
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:17,422
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

1311
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:21,551
Rachel, look at me.

1312
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,887
Before I met you,

1313
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,515
I didn't think that I was even capable
of real happiness.

1314
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:30,852
But that all changed
when you walked into my life.

1315
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:34,314
And I ended up breaking
the first rule of undercover work.

1316
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,400
Which is?

1317

Never fall in love.

- We're busting out of here.
- How'd you get past the guards?

1321
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,587
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

- Come on.
- [laughing]

they could hide this.

- A big problem.

The compass led Robotnik to the Emerald.

1338
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:44,319
That's got to be hundreds of miles away.

1339
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:47,239
All right.

1340
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:49,199
Huddle up. Let's figure out a plan.

1341

Together.

1342
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,701
There's no time for that.

1343
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,745
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

1344
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,331
Sonic, this is way too big
for you to do by yourself.

1345
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,416
You see that little fox over there?

1346
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:02,003
He came all the way
across the universe to meet his hero.

1347
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:05,006
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

1348
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,301
You know what? You were right.

1349
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:10,595
My moment came and I blew it.

1350
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:11,972
I'm no hero.

1351
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:13,223
- Wait.
- [Sonic] No.

1352
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,809
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt
because of me.

1353
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,602
I'm gonna fix this while I still can.

Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.

1359
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:33,285
But we have to help him.
You don't know what he's up against.

No need to burn the fuel.

It's not your fault.

A more advanced intellect would have
seen this move coming a mile away.

Or 1.6 kilometers.

But I trusted you! You were my friend!

[grunts]

1526

Because you saved me first,

1527
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:36,132
which clearly gave you
a tactical advantage I do not understand.

It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

I've been trying to destroy you
since the moment we met.

Because being a hero
isn't about taking care of yourself.

1532
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:53,107
It's about taking responsibility

Hmm. Wise words. An ancient Earth proverb?

01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:00,974
The fearsome power of the Emerald.

1620
01:32:01,058 --> 01:32:03,268
If that thing really
turns thoughts into power,

1621
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:05,187
we are in big trouble.

1622
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,189
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.

1623
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,234
Hey, Sonic, are you sure
it was a good idea

1624
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:11,819
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1625
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:15,656
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1626
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:17,449
I am not mixed up!

1627
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:20,744
I have steely focus. And I'm complex.

1628
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,413
And that's a lot for some people.

1629
01:32:22,496 --> 01:32:25,874
[chuckles] Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.

1630
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:28,377
Pfft! I was completely uninjured.

1631
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,630
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1632
01:32:58,073 --> 01:32:59,324
Whoa.

1633
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:05,664
Sir, you're magnificent!

1634
01:33:05,748 --> 01:33:07,791
Thank you, sycophant.

1635
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:10,294
Your admiration is inevitable.

1636
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:21,805
I knew it!

1637
01:33:21,889 --> 01:33:24,391
Just like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1642

How are we supposed to beat this thing?

1643
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:51,502
We need a plan.

1644
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:53,420
Knuckles, use your strength to...

1645
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:56,548
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1646
01:33:56,632 --> 01:34:00,552
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.

1647
01:34:00,636 --> 01:34:02,387
Step 2: I have no idea.

1648

Sonic!

1649
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:11,814
[Sonic] Nice action figure, Eggman.

1650
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:14,817
Does it do anything
or just stand there looking ugly?

1651
01:34:18,487 --> 01:34:20,906
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!

1652
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,118
He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.

1653
01:34:25,202 --> 01:34:27,996
I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

1654
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,165
Did you even glance at a manual?

1655
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:32,417
- No!
- I'll do it.

Pardon my lightning.

It's the Stache Masher.

Oh, great.

1683
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:10,057
Next thing you know, there'll be a report
about a hostile work environment.

1684
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:16,313
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1685
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:18,732
We can't beat Robotnik
as long as he's got that Emerald.

1686
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:20,233
He's too powerful.

1687
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:23,403
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.

1688
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:24,738
But there's three of us.

1689
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,991
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.

1690
01:36:28,075 --> 01:36:29,743
Together. That's how we win.

1691
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:34,289
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

1692
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:35,749
As a team.

1693

This is it.

This is our moment.

Time to fight.

Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

Tails, any ideas?

1698
01:36:58,772 --> 01:37:00,440
We have to find his weak spot.

01:37:00,524 --> 01:37:02,150
I suggest the groin.

What? No. No!

1701
01:37:04,403 --> 01:37:06,989
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

1702
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,116
Stop saying "groin."

So if I go out there and rile him up...

1711
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:29,553
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1712
01:37:29,636 --> 01:37:31,888
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

1713

01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,858
Move, you hunk of junk!

1780
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:19,783
I have to... [groans] ...reach it.

1781
01:41:20,742 --> 01:41:22,369
[groaning]

1782
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:26,414
[grunts]

1783
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,015
Come on.

1784
01:41:46,184 --> 01:41:48,353
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1785
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,319
[Maddie yelling]

1786
01:41:57,279 --> 01:41:58,321
No!

1787
01:41:58,405 --> 01:41:59,698
We got you, Sonic.

1788
01:42:00,907 --> 01:42:02,325
Hold on!

1789
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:13,420
[all panting]

1790
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:17,799
- You guys okay?
- [Tom grunts] Yeah.

1791
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:20,468
Okay.

1792
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,934
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1793
01:42:28,018 --> 01:42:30,061
Come on, come on.
How does this thing work?

1794
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:31,187
What do I do?

1795
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:32,314
[cracking]

1796
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:34,149
What?

1797
01:42:34,232 --> 01:42:36,943
No. No, no, no!

1798
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:44,993
Look at the happy little family.

1799
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:53,376
You have to get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.

1800
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:54,878
Hey.

1801
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:56,588
We're not going anywhere.

1802
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,340
We're family.

1803
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:03,595
And families stick together...

1804
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:07,682
no matter what.

1805
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:11,936
I love you guys.

1806
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:14,397
We love you too, Sonic.

1807
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:16,649
[chaos emeralds chiming]

1808
01:43:22,906 --> 01:43:24,366
No!

1809
01:43:26,409 --> 01:43:28,578
I got him!

1810
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:34,501
I finally got him! [cackles]

1811
01:43:34,584 --> 01:43:36,252
[thudding]

1812
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,464
What was that?

1813
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,869
[gasps]

1814
01:44:12,414 --> 01:44:13,748
[yelps]

1815
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,257
[panting]

1816
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:27,554
It's over, Eggman.

1817
01:44:27,637 --> 01:44:31,307
[chuckles] I like the new look.
It works for you.

1818
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:35,228
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1819
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:37,188
I did some things, you did some things.

1820
01:44:37,272 --> 01:44:39,065
There are good people on both sides.

1821
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,862
Surely two intelligent beings...

1822
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:47,615
can work these things out!

1823
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:56,332
[grunts]

1824
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:00,670
Come on, buddy.

1825
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:02,088
- Get him, Sonic!
- Come on.

1826
01:45:02,172 --> 01:45:03,506
Yeah. Come on.

1827
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,012
[gasping]

1828
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:21,524
Oh, it's like that?

1829
01:45:23,026 --> 01:45:25,320
Okay, we're not friends.

1830
01:45:29,741 --> 01:45:32,035
Later, hater!

1831
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:45,381
- Sonic!
- Buddy! [laughs]

1832
01:45:45,465 --> 01:45:47,509
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1833
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:50,261
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.

1834
01:45:50,345 --> 01:45:54,557
I am sorry.
He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.

1835
01:45:55,141 --> 01:45:56,142
What?

1836
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:13,284
[sniffs]

1837
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:15,912
Mmm.

1838
01:46:15,995 --> 01:46:17,705
Oh, you got to try this.

1839
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:26,798
Okay. He is exactly
the Sonic you once knew.

1840
01:46:28,675 --> 01:46:30,051
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

1841
01:46:38,518 --> 01:46:40,144
- Sonic!
- Whoa!

1842
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:43,481
Bring it in, bud.

1843
01:46:44,941 --> 01:46:46,901
It's good to be back in blue.

1844
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:48,361
The golden god thing was fun,

1845
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:50,321
but blue has always been more my color.

1846
01:46:50,405 --> 01:46:51,489
Looks good on you.

1847
01:46:51,573 --> 01:46:54,325
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero

1848
01:46:54,409 --> 01:46:56,995
in the universe, and you let it go.

1849
01:46:57,078 --> 01:46:58,162
Why?

1850
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:03,042
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1851
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:07,589
And I kind of like being a kid.

1852
01:47:07,672 --> 01:47:09,549
And you're not just any kid.

1853
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:11,509
You're our kid.

1854
01:47:11,593 --> 01:47:13,011
That's right.

1855
01:47:13,094 --> 01:47:15,805
- Bring it in!
- [Tails] Yay. Hugs.

1856
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:17,348
It's a good thing
we didn't do this before.

1857
01:47:17,432 --> 01:47:18,725
You would've blown up.

1858
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:27,942
[Sonic] Whoa! You fixed it.

1859
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:31,362
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1860
01:47:31,446 --> 01:47:32,739
Now I have it.

1861
01:47:32,822 --> 01:47:34,616
Now we have it.

1862
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:37,285
What do we do with it? What next?

1863
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:39,495
There were once two orders of heroes

1864
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:43,708
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.

1865
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:47,670
But they have all passed on
to the great battleground in the sky.

1866
01:47:47,754 --> 01:47:51,215
So we start a new order. The three of us.

1867
01:47:51,299 --> 01:47:53,009
This is no light task.

1868
01:47:53,092 --> 01:47:57,722
We must make a vow to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,

1869
01:47:58,556 --> 01:48:00,391
to watch out for each other.

1870
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:02,185
Our new tribe.

1871
01:48:02,268 --> 01:48:03,394
Oh, I know!

1872
01:48:03,478 --> 01:48:04,854
A power bump!

1873
01:48:04,937 --> 01:48:06,856
Good idea.

1874
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:10,151
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1875
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:12,028
Very well.

1876
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,239
A power bump it is.

1877
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:18,076
Power bump!

1878
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:23,748
[Sonic over PA] It's truly a beautiful day

1879
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:26,125
for baseball here in Green Hills.

1880
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:27,919
An exciting lineup today

1881
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:31,297
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1882
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:35,551
On the mound, rookie sensation
from across the galaxy,

1883
01:48:35,635 --> 01:48:38,179
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1884
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:43,393
facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.

1885
01:48:43,476 --> 01:48:46,312
Um, I don't understand.

1886
01:48:46,396 --> 01:48:48,564
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?

1887
01:48:48,648 --> 01:48:49,816
You're not angry.

1888
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:51,734
You just want to hit it as hard as you can

1889
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:53,152
and then run around the bases.

1890
01:48:53,236 --> 01:48:56,322
But if my quest ends where I am standing,

1891
01:48:56,406 --> 01:48:57,990
why run at all?

1892
01:48:58,074 --> 01:49:01,077
Ugh. I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?

1893
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,830
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1894
01:49:03,913 --> 01:49:05,415
Just having some fun.

1895
01:49:05,498 --> 01:49:08,042
Fun. Huh.

1896
01:49:08,126 --> 01:49:10,503
All right! Give him the heat, Tails!

1897
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:12,505
Hope you're ready for my fastball.

1898
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:15,049
Your fastball will be dishonored.

1899
01:49:15,133 --> 01:49:17,385
And so will you, fox. [grunts]

1900
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:18,594
Easy, guys!

1901
01:49:18,678 --> 01:49:20,054
Don't think about it too much.

1902
01:49:20,138 --> 01:49:22,098
Just keep your elbow up, eye on the ball

1903
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:23,349
and give it a ride.

1904
01:49:23,433 --> 01:49:24,851
A ride? To where?

1905
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:26,728
[grunts]

1906
01:49:26,811 --> 01:49:28,104
[growls]

1907
01:49:29,105 --> 01:49:30,398
Power bump!

1908
01:49:32,692 --> 01:49:34,110
[screams]

1909
01:49:34,861 --> 01:49:37,155
Ha! Victory is mine!

1910
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:39,782
Hey, no fair! That shouldn't count.

1911
01:49:39,866 --> 01:49:42,118
First base is also mine!

1912
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:43,911
- I think that was our only ball.
- [laughs]

1913
01:49:43,995 --> 01:49:46,789
- I have conquered the second of the bases!
- All right.

1914
01:49:46,873 --> 01:49:48,416
Who wants ice cream?

1915
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:49,709
Knocked the cover off that.

1916
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:52,253
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream, yeah!

1917
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:56,424
[laughing] I am having the fun!
What is ice cream?

1918
01:49:56,507 --> 01:49:59,844
It's a dessert.
If you like fun, you're gonna love it.

1919
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:03,097
Oh, yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?

1920
01:50:03,181 --> 01:50:04,766
No, not usually.

1921
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:07,310
I'm proud of our little guy.

1922
01:50:07,393 --> 01:50:10,855
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

1923
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:13,566
- He cracks me up.
- Heck of a swing too.

1924
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:14,901
Come on, fox.

1925
01:50:14,984 --> 01:50:16,611
- Our dessert adventure awaits.
- Whoo!

1926
01:50:16,694 --> 01:50:17,820
- Good job, guys.
- Yeah.

1927
01:50:17,904 --> 01:50:19,071
You too, baby.

1928
01:50:19,155 --> 01:50:21,324
Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.

1929
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:24,535
I'm happy for you, pal.

1930
01:50:24,619 --> 01:50:26,204
Got your wingmen.

1931
01:50:26,287 --> 01:50:27,789
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1932
01:50:27,872 --> 01:50:31,167
- Come on, Knuckles.
- Ah! My victory chariot!

1933
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:36,172
I've got a lot more than that... Dad.

1934
01:50:41,636 --> 01:50:42,970
Race you to the truck.

1935
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:46,057
One, two, three, go!

1936
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,768
No, don't go easy on me. I want your best.

1937
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:51,813
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1938
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:55,566
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1939
01:50:55,650 --> 01:51:00,571
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

1940
