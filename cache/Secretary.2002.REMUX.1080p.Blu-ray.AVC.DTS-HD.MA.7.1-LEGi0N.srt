1
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:11,567
I got out of the institution
on the day of my sister's wedding.

2
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,570
I had started to get used to the place.

3
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,073
Breakfast at 8:00, classes at 2:00,

4
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,534
therapy at 4:00 and asleep by 10:00.

5
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,162
You can call me any time, Lee.

6
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,207
I will always try to be of help to you.

7
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,542
Inside, life was simple.

8
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,003
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.

9
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,048
For that reason, I was reluctant to go.

10
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,640
Hi, Peter.

11
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,727
Peter, yeah,
who you almost successfully forgot.

12
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,646
- No, I did not.
- Come on, everybody!

13
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,898
Are you happy to be home?

14
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,361
I mean, are you happy to be home?

15
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,656
I don't know.

16
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,118
I know what you mean.

17
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,011
Here's a little something
for the lovebirds.

18
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,638
Boy!

19
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,142
You look so beautiful.

20
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,686
Thanks, Dad.

21
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,024
I thought you stopped.

22
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,363
Do you know how much
we missed you, pumpkin?

23
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,824
Well, I missed you, too.

24
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,832
You know what?

25
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,043
I don't feel too good.

26
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,378
Let's go sit down.

27
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,254
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

28
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,343
- Have fun!
- Goodbye! Take care!

29
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,465
What are you talking about?

30
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,385
You want to treat me like I'm a child.
You want to talk to me like a child.

31
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,469
- Huh? You think I'm a child?
- You...

32
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,246
- You think I don't know what I'm doing?
- You act like a child!

33
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,331
Yeah, right.

34
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,167
You don't act like a man.
You've been fired!

35
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,587
Well, I'm glad I'm fired!

36
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,089
I'm glad I'm fired!
Boy, I hated that job!

37
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,759
I don't care that you hated it!
You're drunk!

38
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,595
I'm not drunk! Why do you...
Why do you... I'm not drunk!

39
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,848
- Why do you always say that?
- Get off my back!

40
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,199
Watch this. You watch this.

41
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,182
Avoid the temptation
of placing your fingers

42
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,268
on the home keys by sight.

43
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,231
Strike each key so that your fingers
bounce with each stroke.

44
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,608
Do not strike without thinking.

45
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,863
Do not even attempt
to steal a glance at your paper.

46
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,199
"My flowers had just
about given up in despair,

47
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,453
"so with the exception
of a few potted plants from the florist,

48
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,622
"we're flowerless
for the first spring in years."

49
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,291
And time!

50
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,421
I'm so proud of you, honey.

51
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,299
Getting out in the world like this.

52
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,053
When my accident happened,

53
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,767
we were in the kitchen
and my back was to her.

54
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,729
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving for work

55
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,981
at Havis department store.

56
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,319
Because there was a limited amount of time
that my mom's back was turned...

57
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,405
- Lee!
- 1 slipped and cut too deep.

58
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,326
I'm not sure how I could have misjudged.

59
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,162
I've been doing it since seventh grade.

60
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,348
Just a precaution.

61
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,355
"Be a leader."

62
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,367
I have never had a job before,

63
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:46,498
but I can assure you that I am very excited
about this opportunity.

64
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,959
Thank you.

65
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:54,339
Well, I don't have any references yet.

66
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,051
But I think that the municipal tax office

67
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:02,890
would be a wonderful place to begin

68
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,268
my career.

69
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,363
"Secretary."

70
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,649
Hello. I...

71
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,319
Wait! I...

72
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,380
Hello?

73
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,220
Hello?

74
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,474
In here.

75
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,276
Hi.

76
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,197
Hi.

77
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,326
Are you the lawyer?

78
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,207
Yes.

79
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,335
I'm sorry. I'll just come back later.

80
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,462
No.

81
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,590
No, stay.

82
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,277
It said "secretary."

83
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,698
That's right.

84
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,371
Are you pregnant?

85
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,292
No.

86
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,296
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

87
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,384
No.

88
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,889
- Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.

89
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,642
- Alone?
- With my parents.

90
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,435
Siblings?

91
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,231
Well, my sister is going to live
in the backyard

92
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,733
with her husband in the pool house.

93
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,985
Are you married?

94
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,446
No.

95
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,493
Have you ever won an award?

96
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,786
Yes.

97
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,746
What did you win the award in?

98
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,997
Typing.

99
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,839
Are those your scores?

100
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,718
Yes.

101
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,389
"Lee Holloway."

102
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,069
Could you get me
a cup of coffee with sugar?

103
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,050
Do you really want to be a secretary, Lee?

104
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,801
Yes, I do.

105
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,979
You scored higher
than anyone I've ever interviewed.

106
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,776
You're really over-qualified for the job.

107
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,655
- You'd be bored to death.
- L want to be bored.

108
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,499
I have a part-time paralegal.

109
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:08,380
All I need is a typist

110
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,468
who can get to work on time
and answer the phone.

111
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,262
I can do that.

112
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:19,307
We only use typewriters here,
not computers.

113
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,059
That's fine.

114
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,187
It's very dull work.

115
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,731
I like dull work.

116
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,116
There's something about you.

117
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,078
You're...

118
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,293
You're closed up tight.

119
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,796
A wall.

120
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,882
I know.

121
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,678
Do you ever loosen up?

122
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,142
I don't know.

123
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,605
I'm not here.

124
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,622
Less sugar in the coffee.

125
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,758
How'd it go?

126
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,054
I got it.

127
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,357
I knew you could do it!

128
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,706
Hello.

129
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,263
Hello.

130
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:28,645
You have reached the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

131
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,608
Please leave your message
and the time you called,

132
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,736
along with your phone number

133
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,406
and the best time to reach you,

134
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:49,541
and we will get back to you
as soon as possible.

135
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,503
We.

136
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,424
Secretary.

137
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,437
Type up this letter

138
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,314
and send four copies
to O'Malley and Barrett.

139
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,276
Right away, sir.

140
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,666
That's good. That's good.

141
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,381
So, you're the new secretary.

142
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,843
Yeah.

143
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,224
Excuse me.

144
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,602
What exactly is a paralegal?

145
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,278
See you.

146
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,595
Okay.

147
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:31,518
Up at the sides. Wide-eyed.

148
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,211
I brought you these.

149
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,682
I think I accidentally threw out my notes
on the Feldman case.

150
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,100
Maybe you could...

151
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,269
Go through the garbage?

152
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,151
Yes, Lee. Thank you.

153
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,353
Why are you here?

154
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,939
I'm just waiting for you, honey.

155
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,359
But I'm here for five more hours.

156
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,694
I know.

157
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,042
Excuse me, sir.

158
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,380
It's okay. I found another set.

159
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,551
This needs more sugar.

160
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,054
- Sugar?
- And six copies of these.

161
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,642
Freshen up that trap, Lee.

162
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,519
And put out one more.

163
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,091
Mice like to go behind
the chairs, too, Lee.

164
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,343
Just because it's hard to reach

165
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,263
does not mean that we don't
take care of every possibility.

166
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,438
Here. Give me that.

167
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,621
Thank you.

168
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,792
E. Edward Grey's office. May I help you?

169
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,004
We're very happy with AT&T.
Thanks, though.

170
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,422
Is he in?

171
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,746
Could you just wait one moment?

172
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,303
You're right.
That is a very good offer.

173
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,596
I'm going back now.

174
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,307
Could you just wait one minute, please?

175
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,894
Yes, I do understand that.

176
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,938
Submissive.

177
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:30,775
Excuse me?

178
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,026
Edward!

179
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,282
Listen, I have no idea if we make over $40

180
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,410
worth of long distance calls
to Chattanooga each month.

181
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,959
Tell him it's Tricia O'Connor.

182
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,087
Mr. Grey?

183
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,887
Hello?

184
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,978
Mr. Grey?

185
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,188
Ms. Holloway.

186
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,366
Mr. Grey?

187
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,911
I'm not here.

188
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,500
Okay.

189
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,800
I'm afraid he's gone.

190
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,219
Is that right?

191
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,936
E. Edward Grey's office.

192
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,355
Is that you, honey? It's me.

193
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,523
Daddy?

194
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,734
It's so good to hear your voice.

195
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,110
Dad.

196
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:57,945
Where are you?

197
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,073
I'm downtown, somewhere.

198
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,452
Could you please hold?

199
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,040
Do you have a message, Ms. O'Connor?

200
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,678
Tell him to sign the settlement.

201
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,644
Hello?

202
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,063
Hello?

203
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,482
Hello, Dad?

204
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,229
How's work?

205
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,814
Fine.

206
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,650
How's Mr. Grey?

207
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,486
He's fine.

208
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,697
Well, Peter called.

209
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,668
Some people, right, have to wash
something as soon as they've worn it,

210
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,587
- you know, for, like, half a day.
- Yes.

211
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,670
And then you got your more
laid-back folk who just,

212
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,008
you know, maybe they'll
wash their stuff when it's dirty.

213
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,801
Which kind are you?

214
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,721
I'm the type of guy

215
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:32,808
who wants to get married and have a kid.

216
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,190
I wash my clothes just when they're dirty.

217
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:43,444
Me, too, and...
And that is what counts in a relationship.

218
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,780
Compatibility.

219
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,575
In a relationship?

220
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,058
- In a relationship.
- Relationship.

221
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,674
May I interest you in a little more?

222
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,844
- Just a little more?
- Why not? Okay.

223
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:18,062
You're different
than you were in high school, Peter.

224
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:20,523
L... I changed.

225
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,191
What happened?

226
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,735
I had a nervous breakdown.

227
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,071
Me, too.

228
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,699
Sort of.

229
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,083
Two items. This and these.

230
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,043
- Peter?
- Yes, Lee?

231
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:45,381
I've read that if you
wear that kind of underwear,

232
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,843
that it squeezes

233
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:51,846
your things.

234
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,931
- Balls.
- Yes.

235
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,015
Balls?

236
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,768
My grapes.

237
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:58,936
Your grapes?

238
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,020
My...

239
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,189
Your testicles.

240
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,194
Your sperm gets squozen,
and then you can't have babies,

241
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,114
and I thought that
you said that you wanted to have babies.

242
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,950
There you go. I said it.

243
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,246
To babies!

244
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,082
To diapers.

245
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,959
To diaper rash.

246
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,920
To breast-feeding. And to crying.

247
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,385
Look at it!

248
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,930
Do you see that?

249
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,223
What?

250
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,433
This letter has three typing errors in it,

251
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,769
one of which is, I
believe, a spelling error.

252
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,813
I'm... I'm sorry.

253
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,249
This isn't the first time, either.

254
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,002
There've been others that I let go
because it was in the first few weeks.

255
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:30,861
This cannot go on.

256
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:34,090
Do you know what this makes me look like
to the people who receive these letters?

257
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,867
L... I'm sorry. I'm...

258
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,204
Type it again and get it right.

259
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,890
You're wasting my time.

260
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,058
Bye.

261
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,702
Go type up a bill for that woman for $500.

262
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,787
Aren't you going to proofread the letter?

263
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,389
Lee.

264
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,354
When people come into this office,

265
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:31,774
you are a visual representation
of my business.

266
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,360
And the way you dress is disgusting.

267
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,491
I'm sorry.

268
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:44,036
You're tapping your toe all the time
and playing with your hair.

269
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,080
You're either going to
have to wear a hairnet

270
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,873
or stop playing with your hair.

271
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,796
And another thing,

272
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,050
do you realize that
you are always sniffling?

273
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,969
I... I'm sniffling?

274
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,181
And what is with your tongue

275
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,767
when you're typing?

276
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,437
I'm sorry.
I didn't know I sniffled.

277
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,775
Well, you do.

278
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,617
Mr. Grey,

279
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:30,290
thank you so much for
your helpful suggestions.

280
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,795
Because I am trying to be

281
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,633
the very best secretary that I can be.

282
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,469
For you.

283
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,472
The sentence should read,

284
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:49,351
"Without proper guidance
from a knowledgeable source,

285
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,812
"my client would never have made

286
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:55,649
"these material decisions on her own."
Period!

287
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,651
I have repeated the sentence twice.

288
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:02,948
Why don't you listen, think
and then respond.

289
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:04,908
Okay?

290
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,461
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some wine?

291
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,755
We make it homemade, don't we, Stewart?

292
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,382
Try it. It's good.

293
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,009
Would you like some, Lee?

294
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,303
No, thank you.

295
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,054
Not right now, Sylvia.

296
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,599
You know,
Peter talks about you all the time.

297
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,185
He says he's found his soul mate.

298
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,771
Did you say that?

299
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,483
I did.

300
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,694
Peter's sister, Lindsey,

301
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:44,198
is getting married this
coming winter in Vegas.

302
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,535
Did you know Peter has
a very stable job at JCPenney?

303
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,370
They even gave him a cell phone.

304
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,289
Perhaps it'll be a double wedding?

305
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,836
Mom.

306
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,072
Ms. Holloway, come into the library.

307
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,950
Immediately.

308
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,843
"refer only to slanderous remarks
made in print.

309
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,262
"In summation of the events

310
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:52,140
"in regard to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely, etc."

311
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,771
Okay.

312
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,275
The phone is ringing.

313
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,823
Answer it.

314
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:11,994
I'm sorry...

315
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,381
Hello?

316
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,466
This is the office of...

317
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,634
Listen.

318
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:28,885
You're a big girl.

319
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:32,973
You can get a much bigger voice
out of that tiny throat of yours.

320
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,475
Tiny.

321
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:37,561
Ms. Holloway.

322
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,771
You told me when I hired you

323
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,357
that you were used to answering phones.

324
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,359
I am.

325
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,362
Did you get enough sleep last night?

326
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,781
- L...
- The phone is ringing!

327
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,411
Hello.

328
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:59,207
This is the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

329
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,461
You see? You see?
You see? You see?

330
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,421
That's showing a little spunk.

331
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,340
After all, I'm not running a mortuary.

332
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:07,799
No.

333
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,603
Lee.

334
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,356
Mr. Grey.

335
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:26,568
Come here.

336
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,597
Did you have a date recently?

337
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,811
Yes.

338
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,565
With whom did you have a date?

339
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,403
- Peter.
- Peter?

340
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,946
Did you have sex?

341
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:15,409
No?

342
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,913
I don't know.

343
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,876
Are you shy?

344
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,714
I'm shy.

345
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,550
You're not shy.

346
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,719
You're a lawyer.

347
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,098
I'm shy.

348
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,101
I overcome my shyness to...

349
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,106
In order to get things done.

350
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,485
I don't think you're shy.

351
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:58,201
Lee, I want to be frank with you.

352
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:02,622
Now, I know I'm your employer,
and we have

353
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,167
a prescribed relationship.

354
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:13,300
But you really should feel free

355
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,181
to discuss your problems with me.

356
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,695
What's going on
with the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

357
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,329
Lee?

358
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,043
I feel...

359
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,255
- Shy.
- Shy.

360
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,094
Do you want some hot chocolate?

361
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,096
Okay.

362
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:17,364
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?

363
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,204
I don't know.

364
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,124
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to
come to the surface,

365
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,418
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside,

366
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,463
you finally know you are really here?

367
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:35,715
Then, when you watch the wound heal,

368
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,218
it's comforting. Isn't it?

369
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,520
That's a way to put it.

370
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:52,649
I'm going to tell you something, Lee.
Are you ready to listen?

371
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:54,860
Yes.

372
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,862
Are you listening?

373
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,408
You will never,

374
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,996
ever cut yourself again.

375
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,248
Do you understand?

376
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,501
Have I made that perfectly clear?

377
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:14,671
You're over that now.

378
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,215
It's in the past.

379
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:24,598
Yes.

380
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,686
Never again.

381
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,190
Okay.

382
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:39,487
Now, you know what I want you to do?

383
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:44,284
I want you to leave work early.

384
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,246
You're a big girl, a grown woman.

385
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,290
Your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

386
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:56,379
I want you to take a nice walk home,
in the fresh air.

387
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:58,632
Because you require relief.

388
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:02,636
Because you won't be doing that anymore.

389
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:04,429
Will you?

390
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,765
No, sir.

391
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,101
Good.

392
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,826
Look who's early.

393
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:29,829
Mom,

394
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,417
I'm going to walk home from now on.

395
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,297
I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,

396
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:44,302
and it was as if I'd never
taken a walk by myself before.

397
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:50,016
And when I thought about it, I realized
I probably never had taken a walk alone.

398
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,770
But because he had given me
the permission to do this,

399
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,106
because he'd insisted I do it,

400
00:46:56,189 --> 00:47:00,902
I felt held by him as I walked along.

401
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:03,822
I felt he was with me.

402
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:10,954
At the same time, I was feeling
something growing in Mr. Grey,

403
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:16,543
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,

404
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,590
nursed on the feeling that he had
discovered something about me.

405
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:28,138
The next day, I didn't even bring
my cuticle scissors and my iodine.

406
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:31,016
But I did make another typing mistake.

407
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:34,436
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do.

408
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,272
Type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

409
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,649
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it certainly seems to be.

410
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,152
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me!

411
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:46,072
What goes on inside that head of yours?

412
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,374
Come into my office and bring that letter.

413
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,640
Put the letter on my desk.

414
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:08,780
Now, I want you to bend over the desk,
so you're looking directly at it.

415
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:15,036
Get your face very close to the letter,
and read the letter aloud.

416
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,748
I don't understand.

417
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,501
There's nothing to understand.

418
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:25,213
Put your elbows on the desk, bend over,

419
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:29,676
get your face close to the letter
and read it aloud.

420
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,939
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

421
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:46,401
"I'm grateful to you for referring..."

422
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,039
Continue.

423
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,546
Ms. Holloway, read.

424
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:21,853
"For referring me to your case.

425
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:28,693
"The subject of animal captivity has
been of interest to me for quite a while.

426
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:33,031
"And my secretary has prepared
research material

427
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,159
"that I think you'll find illuminating.

428
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,453
"If you would be so kind

429
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,626
"as to send me the June 5th letter
of which we spoke,

430
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:48,504
"my associates and I
will review it immediately."

431
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,927
"Please feel free to call me
at your earliest convenience.

432
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,264
"Yours sincerely, E. Edward Grey."

433
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,525
Read it again.

434
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,033
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

435
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,122
"I am grateful to you

436
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,543

438
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,431

00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,484
"that I think you'll find illuminating."

441
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,401
Now straighten yourself up
and go type it again.

442
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:24,178
Ms. Holloway. Good letter.

443
00:54:44,574 --> 00:54:45,658
Mom?

444
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:50,163
The lock can come off the cabinet now.

445
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,548
Honey.

446
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:10,201
Replace the light bulb
in the hallway to my office.

447
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:12,912
120 watts.

448
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,790
- Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.

449
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,251
You remember my secretary, Ms. Holloway.

450
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:19,752
I'm sorry about the typo.

451
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:35,601
It's porterhouse steak,
mashed, no, creamed potatoes,

452
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:39,855
green peas, iced tea and ice cream.

453
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:43,359
Okay. Just a scoop of creamed potatoes,

454
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:48,864
and a slice of butter, four peas

455
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:52,952
and as much ice cream
as you'd like to eat, doll.

456
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:38,831
Cosmo's advice for getting your man
to share his feelings more intimately

457
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,959
is to first try some breezy humor.

458
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:48,299
Whatever you do, don't jump
too quickly into relationship talk.

459
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:09,755
I'm your secretary.

460
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,550
I'm your secretary.

461
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:15,803
Just one scoop of creamed potatoes,

462
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:18,764
one slice of butter,

463
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:23,102
and four peas.

464
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:30,401
How many inches away...

465
00:59:32,153 --> 00:59:35,239
Had you turned off the furnace
before you went down to the basement?

466
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,541
Okay.

467
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,795
Maybe you didn't squeeze it hard enough.

468
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:53,507
Well, there's
always concern about it bursting.

469
00:59:57,178 --> 01:00:00,264
No! God, no.
I haven't had time to get to that.

470
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:03,976
I'm doing as much as I possibly can.

471
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,943
Where was she when
you crawled under the house?

472
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,117
And the lockbox?
Did you cover it with dirt before you left?

473
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:21,827
Mud upstairs?

474
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,290
No, I'm confused by that.

475
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,167
But...

476
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:33,255
All right. This was the overweight child,
or your nephew from Baltimore?

477
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,925
On the banister.

478
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,226
I have to work.

479
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,149
Okay. Give me a week
and I'll have something for you.

480
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,276
I'm sorry, the office has been

481
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,823
overwhelmed.

482
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,370
Mr. Grey, I'm going to go home now.

483
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:10,209
If you need any more typing done,
I could come back later.

484
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,551
Thank you, Ms. Holloway, good night.

485
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,269
That'll be all.

486
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,151
Here's just one example.

487
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:40,114
He asked me out to Red Lobster
the other night for a nightcap.

488
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,490
- Right.
- Yeah.

489
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:44,702
And yesterday,
he asked if my hose were control-top,

490
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:47,288
and if they were, I
certainly didn't need it.

491
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,582
- Your boss?
- Yeah.

492
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,751
You should sue him for sexual harassment.

493
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,045
- I like that idea.
- Hello.

494
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:59,258
My lawyer's representing a woman who's
suing her boss for sexual harassment.

495
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,093
Is he a good lawyer?

496
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,096
He's the best.

497
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,265
"He's the best."

498
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,601
How long will he be there?

499
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:16,775
Who was that?

500
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,570
He checked himself into the hospital.

501
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:47,014
Lee?

502
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:20,381
Yes? Lee?

503
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:23,801
Hi.

504
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,142
I just wanted...

505
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:37,314
I needed you...

506
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,193
I wanted you to...

507
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,657
You need me to what?

508
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:58,502
I just wanted you not to forget
to go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.

509
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:03,590
No. I haven't.

510
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:06,635
That's good.

511
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:11,515
Thank you, Lee.

512
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:05,235
After he turned me away from his house,
he put me back at my old desk,

513
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:08,113
and he just stopped doing it.

514
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,658
He threw out all his red pens.

515
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:18,791
I kept making typos, but he just
treated me like a regular old secretary.

516
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,751
Are you coming?

517
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:24,880
After a while,
I began to wonder if that was all I was.

518
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:30,594
Have we received
any checks from Mr. Garvey?

519
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,179
No, sir.

520
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,015
File these.

521
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:49,029
That's a pretty tie.
But I guess you won't be golfing today.

522
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:50,489
What?

523
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:52,199
Your tie.

524
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,368
It has golfers on it.

525
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,167
Right.

526
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:07,172
Damn it.

527
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,570
Don't be scared.

528
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:20,782
I'm not. I'm...

529
01:09:32,044 --> 01:09:33,712
That's not what I meant.

530
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:41,219
I'm sorry, I just... Look here.

531
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:44,473
I'm sorry.

532
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,728
Okay, but my clothes
get to stay completely on

533
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,688
and I want the lights out.

534
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,887
Lee, Lee, Lee.

535
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:31,478
I didn't hurt you, did 1?

536
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:35,107
No.

537
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,493
Ms. Holloway.

538
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:13,705
Yes, Mr. Grey?

539
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,707
Come into my office.

540
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:20,378
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.

541
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:26,051
Ms. Holloway, come into my office.

542
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:27,552
Yes, sir.

543
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,848
Finally.

544
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:10,595
Ignore it.

545
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:29,114
Now, pull up your skirt.

546
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,118
Why?

547
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:37,163
You're not worried
that I'm going to fuck you, are you?

548
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,668
I'm not interested in
that, not in the least.

549
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,254
Now, pull up your skirt.

550
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:47,465
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee

551
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:50,594
Lee?

552
01:13:51,303 --> 01:13:52,387
Lee?

553
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,976
I said, pull up your skirt.

554
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,272
Peter.

555
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:07,485
I'm not going to be able to
come to the diner today, okay?

556
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:12,532
Okay.

557
01:14:13,992 --> 01:14:17,704
That's okay.
Because... That's all right.

558
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:44,856
Pull down your panty hose and underwear.

559
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,530
I told you I'm not going to fuck you.

560
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,373
Get these forms filled out,

561
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,459
and then you can take your lunch break.

562
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:56,005
Bring me my sandwich, I'm eating in.

563
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,804
And you'll have the usual.

564
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,351
No mayonnaise this time.

565
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:13,857
And send in what's his name.

566
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:21,447
Okay?

567
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,787
Mr. Grey.

568
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:35,104
Cock. Place your prick in my mouth.

569
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,273
Screw me.

570
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:58,503
Shit. Fuck.

571
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:02,131
Mayonnaise. Orchid.

572
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,343
Mr. Grey.

573
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,201
Edward.

574
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:54,350
Most people think that the best way
to live is to run from pain.

575
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:58,896
But a much more joyful life
embraces the entire spectrum

576
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,606
of human feeling.

577
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:05,069
If we can fully
experience pain, as well as pleasure,

578
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:09,032
we can live a much deeper
and more meaningful life.

579
01:21:57,622 --> 01:21:58,748
Ms. Holloway.

580
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,377
Yes, sir?

581
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:05,963
- Bring your typing scores.
- Okay.

582
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:31,823
What happened?

583
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,910
Are you pregnant?

584
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:39,622
No.

585
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:43,668
- Do you plan on getting pregnant?
- Could I...

586
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:45,837
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

587
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:48,840
No.

588
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,676
Are you living in an apartment?

589
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,136
A house.

590
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,138
Alone?

591
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,557
With my parents.

592
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:00,810
Are you married?

593
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:03,688
No.

594
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,199
Are those your scores?

595
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:18,035
Yes.

596
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,545
Do you really want to be my secretary?

597
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:31,757
Yes, I do.

598
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:40,558
This isn't just about typos, tape,
staples and pencils, is it, Lee?

599
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:43,394
- No, sir.
- What?

600
01:23:44,854 --> 01:23:46,063
No, sir.

601
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,989
I like you, Lee, but I don't think
I'm going to offer you the job.

602
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:58,826
Why?

603
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:02,496
It's your behavior.

604
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:06,459
What about my behavior?

605
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:08,085
It's very bad.

606
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:16,135
I'm sorry.
You can collect your things.

607
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,597
- Time-out!
- Time-out?

608
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,682
- You're fired.
- You're fired!

609
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:24,435
You're fired. Now, Lee, get out!

610
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:35,738
Why did you get glue smear
all over the Ramsey papers?

611
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,574
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.

612
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:41,869
Are you aware
you kick your shoes off under your desk?

613
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:43,663
I can smell your feet.

614
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:45,373
Do you ever change your panty hose?

615
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:46,499
Every day.

616
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:50,711
Every time you erase, there are
little shavings all over your desk.

617
01:24:50,962 --> 01:24:54,423
I told you to take that Walkman home.

618
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,678
I don't want the possibility
of your listening to music

619
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,401
when you're supposed
to be working for me.

620
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:04,016
I saw it in your desk. I know it's there.

621
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,893
I'll move it.

622
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:48,352
You have to go, or I won't stop.

623
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:50,855
Don't.

624
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,569
I cannot do this anymore.

625
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,657
But I want to know you.

626
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:30,811
I'm so sorry for what happened between us.

627
01:26:32,063 --> 01:26:37,902
I've realized
what a terrible mistake I made with you.

628
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:43,115
And I can only hope that you understand.

629
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:48,412
Be assured you can count on me
for excellent references.

630
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,251
Get out.

631
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,089
Get out.

632
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:01,175
- What are you doing...
- Get out!

633
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:20,045
I opened the envelope
the second I got home.

634
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:25,342
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.

635
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:29,096
It occurred to me to tear up the check,
but I didn't.

636
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:32,349
I felt like I was doing the right thing.

637
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:35,227
And I didn't tell anybody about any of it.

638
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,898
I pretended to go to work as usual,

639
01:28:39,482 --> 01:28:42,485
and watched his office
from across the street.

640
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,989
He hired a new girl
and changed the locks on the doors.

641
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,161
There was just nothing
for me to do about it.

642
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:08,928
My doctor at the institution once said,
"Every journey begins with the first step.”

643
01:29:09,637 --> 01:29:13,349
So I decided it was time
to meet someone new.

644
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,395
There was one who tried
to grab and pinch my nipples

645
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:20,814
before we even made it to his car.

646
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:22,149
Hi.

647
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:25,361
Another guy kept ordering me
to pee on his patio,

648
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,404
and when I refused, he said...

649
01:29:27,488 --> 01:29:29,073
I thought you were a masochist.

650
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,243
Then there was the one
who liked being tied to a gas stove

651
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:36,330
while the burners were on full blast,
and I had to throw tomatoes at him.

652
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,665
Thank you.

653
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:41,085
For a while I just stopped trying
and stayed at home,

654
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:44,088
helping Dad adjust to his new sobriety.

655
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:46,382
Until one day,

656
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:50,344
out of the blue,
Peter proposed marriage to me

657
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:52,846
in the basement of JCPenney's.

658
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:57,601
I think I said yes
because I didn't know what else to do.

659
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:01,230
Well, I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.

660
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,065
Okay.

661
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:08,463
Now, if you hold your breath
through the wedding, you'll make it.

662
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,531
Don't move. I'm going to get Stewart.

663
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:13,450
You're beautiful.
You're just too beautiful.

664
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,101
Lee?

665
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:41,770
No! I'm not supposed
to see you before the wedding!

666
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,897
Where are you going?

667
01:30:59,163 --> 01:31:01,957
- I have something to say to you.
- Lee.

668
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:03,751
I love you.

669
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:06,879
Lee, you should not be here.

670
01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:08,339
I love you.

671
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:25,689
I'm sorry,
but I don't believe that to be true.

672
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,776
Well, it is true. It is.

673
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:33,614
This matter was resolved

674
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,742
when I received
your canceled severance check.

675
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:40,162
I love you.

676
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:46,210
We can't do this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

677
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:47,753
Why not?

678
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,562
Put both your hands on the desk.
Palms down.

679
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:16,115
I want to make love.

680
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:26,291
Keep both your feet on the floor
until I come back.

681
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,551
Hello?

682
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:20,804
In case you're wondering,
your fiancée is at my office.

683
01:33:54,797 --> 01:33:57,466
Lee, I'm very fond of you as well.

684
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,933
It's you.

685
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,985
What are you...
What are you doing?

686
01:34:17,069 --> 01:34:20,948
Lee, I don't...
I don't know what the deal is with...

687
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:23,951
I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

688
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,705
I'm your fiancée, Lee!

689
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:30,874
You are trespassing.

690
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:34,628
You are making an unwarranted incursion,

691
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:38,257
a gradual or stealthy
entrance into the sphere of another.

692
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,555
Okay, Lee, Lee,

693
01:34:45,848 --> 01:34:51,228
are you doing something sexual right now?

694
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:54,523
Does this look sexual to you?

695
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,777
I don't know, Lee!

696
01:35:00,654 --> 01:35:02,364
Why don't you move your hands?

697
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:08,412
Because I don't want to.

698
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:13,500
No!

699
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:49,703
Peter, I don't want you.

700
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,543
Now, get out.

701
01:35:58,462 --> 01:35:59,671
Get out.

702
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:03,800
Get out!

703
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:43,632
- Here you go.
- Great.

704
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:47,344
I brought you some peas.

705
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:56,979
There are no statutes capable of controlling
the relations between men and women.

706
01:36:57,062 --> 01:36:59,189
There are other ways to show
your feelings, Lee.

707
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,608
More conventional ways.

708
01:37:01,692 --> 01:37:05,696
I expect that dress back,
dry-cleaned, in perfect condition.

709
01:37:05,946 --> 01:37:09,116
I'm just going to leave you
with this literature.

710
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,495
Why don't you read about
women's struggle first?

711
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:33,598
You know, Lee, there's a long
history of this in Catholicism.

712
01:37:34,391 --> 01:37:37,686
The monks used to wear thorns
on their temples.

713
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:41,773
And the nuns, they wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

714
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:45,485
Two years ago, when it didn't work out
between us, that was it.

715
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,529
I let him slip through my fingers.

716
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:50,407
You are part of a great tradition.

717
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:51,992
I admire you, Ms. Holloway.

718
01:37:52,117 --> 01:37:55,954
Without question, he is the most
isolated man I have ever known.

719
01:37:56,163 --> 01:37:58,206
The worm. Amazing.

720
01:37:58,331 --> 01:38:01,543
Who's to say that love needs to be
soft and gentle?

721
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:06,089
"You are the child of
God's holy gift of life.

722
01:38:07,424 --> 01:38:10,761
"You come from me, but you are not me.

723
01:38:12,596 --> 01:38:18,393
"Your soul and your body are your own,
and yours to do with as you wish."

724
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:23,607
Thank you, Daddy.

725
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:42,250
Drinks.

726
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:44,586
Take what you ordered.

727
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:47,798
Now don't take anybody else's drink.
What you ordered.

728
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:53,595
Fifty-seven bottles of beer on the wall

729
01:38:55,138 --> 01:39:00,060
Fifty-seven bottles of beer

730
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,731
Take one down

731
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:22,290
We're here on day three
of what has come to be known

732
01:39:22,374 --> 01:39:25,043
as the Lee Holloway hunger strike.

733
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:28,213
Now, you may have heard
that there are those in the community

734
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:32,092
who wonder if Ms. Holloway is even willing
to starve herself to death.

735
01:39:36,346 --> 01:39:39,516
In one way or another,
I've always suffered.

736
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:41,852
I don't know why, exactly.

737
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:46,439
But I do know that I'm not so scared
of suffering now.

738
01:39:47,149 --> 01:39:49,776
I feel more than I've ever felt,

739
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:56,533
and I've found someone to feel with,
to play with, to love

740
01:39:57,784 --> 01:40:00,745
in a way that feels right for me.

741
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:04,958
I hope he knows that
I can see that he suffers, too.

742
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,752
And that I want to love him.

743
01:42:40,196 --> 01:42:46,703
Each cut, each scar, each burn,
a different mood or time.

744
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,040
I told him what the first one was.

745
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:53,209
I told him where the second one came from.

746
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,253
I remembered them all.

747
01:42:56,338 --> 01:42:58,715
And for the first time in my life,

748
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,801
I felt beautiful.

749
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:05,013
Finally part of the earth.

750
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:10,852
I touched the soil, and he loved me back.

751
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:34,751
Where did you go to high school?

752
01:43:37,796 --> 01:43:39,839
What was your mother like?

753
01:43:42,092 --> 01:43:43,760
What was her name?

754
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:52,894
What did it say under
your senior yearbook picture?

755
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,526
Who was your first love?

756
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:08,284
When did your heart first get broken?

757
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:16,751
Where were you born?

758
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,220
Des Moines, lowa.

759
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:52,871
All our activities melted
into an everyday sort of life

760
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:56,541
until we looked like
any other couple you'd see.

761
01:44:57,333 --> 01:45:01,796
Turn that over, yes. Just pull it tight.

762
01:45:03,173 --> 01:45:06,259
Now, these pillows like to be stacked.

763
01:45:08,595 --> 01:45:10,346
Largest to smallest.

764
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:14,225
We had a June wedding,

765
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:17,020
by ourselves at the justice of the peace.

766
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,065
Then, we honeymooned in the mountains.

767
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:25,612
We only had the weekend
because Edward had to get back to work.
