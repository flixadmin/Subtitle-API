1
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,625
{\an8}Surprised he doesn't make us do that.

2
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,588
{\an8}The pack totally has a pecking order.

3
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,509
{\an8}And the head hyena,
he's the man, you know.

4
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,178
{\an8}All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

5
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,514
I mean, literally. It's so gross.

6
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,851
{\an8}They have to lick his junk.

7
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,521
{\an8}I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

8
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,612
{\an8}Yo, if this is supposed to be all,
like, major-league and all

9
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:39,617
{\an8}we should have equipment maintainer guys.

10
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,165
And water boys, you know?

11
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,043
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

12
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,881
{\an8}Get us a couple flunkies in here.

13
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,008
Treat us right.

14
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,481
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

15
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,982
I'm gonna hit it,
if that's cool with you.

16
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,861
{\an8}- I don't understand.
- What?

17
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,155
{\an8}These numbers, they just don't add up.

18
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,574
{\an8}Told you. Dude's totally boning us.

19
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,410
{\an8}No, it's not that.

20
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:27,415
{\an8}It's our output. We're off.
We're .14 percent off.

21
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:31,878
Point one-four. That's, what, like...?

22
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,505
What does that mean?

23
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,383
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

24
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,180
{\an8}So how far off are we?

25
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,766
{\an8}It's not negligible.

26
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,397
{\an8}Ball-parking at it, I'd say
we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.

27
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,360
{\an8}That's weird.

28
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,445
{\an8}Well, what about spillage?

29
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,697
Spillage?

30
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,114
You know, when,
like, just stuff gets spilled.

31
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,118
Nothing gets spilled.

32
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,578
A little maybe.

33
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,372
Nothing gets spilled.

34
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,832
What about evaporation?

35
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,295
{\an8}It wouldn't account for this much.
The materials aren't out that long.

36
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,297
{\an8}What about the other one?

37
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,300
The drops, like on...

38
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,427
Like on, like, cold beer.

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,055
- Condensation?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,807
No.

41
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,061
{\an8}Well, what about the crap
that gets left behind?

42
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,147
{\an8}You know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats.

43
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,651
{\an8}Gotta add up to like a gallon each.

44
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,070
{\an8}Did you work that in?

45
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:44,158
{\an8}- Vestiges.
- Yeah. Vestiges.

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,913
Bet that's it.

47
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,457
Bet that's totally it.

48
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,505
Hey, Mr. White.

49
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,133
Mr. White.

50
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,636
Are you okay?

51
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,472
Yeah. Yeah, why?

52
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,685
{\an8}Nothing.

53
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,114
Are you coming?

54
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,950
Yeah, in a minute.

55
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,537
{\an8}All right, see you tomorrow.

56
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,975
All right.

57
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,608
Shit.

58
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,362
Bastard.

59
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,207
Son of a...

60
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,807
Come on, you...

61
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,809
Come on, come on.

62
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,399
Son of a...

63
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,504
Come on.

64
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,511
Son of a bitch.

65
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,362
That's great.

66
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,351
All right.

67
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,916
You little bastard.

68
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,395
Shut the door!

69
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,565
- My ears are popping.
- Shut the door. Move.

70
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,443
Feels like on an airplane.
What the hell's doing that?

71
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,862
Positive pressure.

72
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,739
Positive what?

73
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,256
God, it frigging kills, yo.

74
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,201
- Well, just move your jaw around.
- I am moving it around.

75
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,485
- It's not working.
- Just yawn or something.

76
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,331
Stop acting like such a baby.

77
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,583
Damn.

78
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,128
What positive? Positive what?

79
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:15,591
Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up
to keep the outside out.

80
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,970
There's been a contamination.

81
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,472
Wait. What?

82
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,599
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hold up.

83
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,726
Something got into the lab.

84
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,438
So, what do we do?

85
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,772
I mean, do we...?

86
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:32,567
Wait. Wait. I mean,
shouldn't we be wearing masks?

87
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,487
No, no, it's not that kind
of contaminant.

88
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,323
So it's, like, not dangerous?

89
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,452
Mr. White, talk to me here.

90
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,873
Not to us particularly, no.

91
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,584
What the hell is that?

92
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,336
This is...

93
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,255
I made it.

94
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,927
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

95
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,851
A fly.

96
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,271
What do you mean?

97
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,065
A fly, like... Like, what do you mean?

98
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,028
I mean, a fly. A housefly.

99
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,616
Like one fly?

100
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,409
Singular?

101
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,453
- What did it do?
- It got into the lab.

102
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,706
I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

103
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,254
No, man, not really. I can't say that
I'm really following you here.

104
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,925
Dude, you scared the shit out of me!

105
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,141
When you say it's contamination, I mean

106
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,610
I'm thinking like an Ebola leak
or something.

107
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,805
Ebola.

108
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,558
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel

109
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,875
where all your intestines sort of
just slip out of your butt.

110
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,481
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
Now, tell me.

111
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:58,486
What would a West African virus
be doing in our lab?

112
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:05,945
So you're chasing around a fly
and in your world, I'm the idiot.

113
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,622
Jesse, listen.

114
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,001
This fly...
No, any fly cannot be in our lab.

115
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,295
It's a problem. It's a contamination.

116
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,840
And that is in no way a misuse
of the word. Okay?

117
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:26,013
So in terms of keeping our cook clean
and our product unadulterated

118
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,599
we need to take this very seriously.

119
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,476
Now do you understand?

120
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,773
So is that your fly-saber?

121
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,652
This is a swatter.

122
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,530
And it happens to work quite well,
thank you.

123
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,033
Hey, what happened to your head?

124
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,702
Nothing. I'm fine.

125
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,871
You didn't hit it,
like really, really hard?

126
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:55,376
My head is not the problem, Jesse.
The fly is the problem.

127
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:03,175
You didn't happen to maybe try
our product, did you?

128
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,013
Jesse, I know this seems unusual
to you, a layman.

129
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,725
A fly. I get it.
It seems insignificant, right?

130
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,187
But trust me, in a highly controlled
environment such as this...

131
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,067
any pollutant

132
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,071
no matter how small...

133
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,994
could completely...

134
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,009
Hello?

135
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,888
What?

136
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,102
Were you here all night?

137
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,021
Have you even slept?

138
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,732
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?

139
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,193
Will you just please focus on...?

140
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,242
Okay, look, we're running late,
so let's just get started.

141
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,536
The sooner we do it,
the sooner we're done.

142
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,456
Fricking finally.

143
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,921
What are you doing?

144
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,131
It's time to alkaline.

145
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,468
Have you not heard a word I said?

146
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,930
No cooking until this fly is dealt with.

147
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,391
Have I been speaking to myself?

148
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,810
The timer went off, yo.

149
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,146
How long is this batch gonna be
good for? An hour? Two?

150
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:43,150
The batch will be good for nothing
if we don't clear the contaminant.

151
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,319
"Clear the contaminant."

152
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,178
We're making meth here, all right?
Not space shuttles.

153
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,951
We're making nothing until
we catch this fly.

154
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,285
What fly? All right?

155
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,164
Where the hell is this fly?
Not like I even seen the thing.

156
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,668
Maybe your positive pressure blew it
out the door or something.

157
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,629
No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?

158
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,591
He's around, and I am not going
to expose this batch

159
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,010
to the open air and contamination,
period.

160
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,681
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself or you can help me.

161
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,048
But you are right.
We're running out of time.

162
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,811
So I need your answer right now.

163
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,194
Okay.

164
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:41,208
Hey, tick-tock, yo.

165
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,510
Look, I like making cherry product,
but let's keep it real, all right?

166
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,848
We make poison for people who don't care.

167
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,865
We probably have the most un-picky
customers in the world.

168
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,562
No, no, no. No rationalizing.

169
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,857
We'll find it any minute.
Don't give up.

170
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:22,541
Did you know that there's
an acceptable level of rat turds

171
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,878
that can go into candy bars?

172
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,381
That's the government, Jack.

173
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:36,180
Even the government doesn't care
that much about quality.

174
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:43,395
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs, huh?

175
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,440
Pig lips and assholes.

176
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:52,947
But I say, hey, have at it, bitches,
because I love hotdogs.

177
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:57,117
- And, you know, see what I'm try...?
- What are you doing?

178
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,120
Oh, hey.

179
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,458
Look, let me just top it off,
all right, really quick.

180
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,253
You know, a little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid.

181
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,964
No harm done. Then we're golden.

182
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,304
It stays closed. That's an order.

183
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,811
You can't order shit, Adolf, all right?
We're 50-50 partners, remember?

184
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,194
God, what is your problem?

185
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,992
Freaking psycho.

186
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,494
- Jesse.
- Oh, God.

187
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,497
- It, like, hit bone.
- Jesse.

188
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,332
Jesse.

189
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,754
You see it, right?

190
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,299
You see it?

191
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,092
Yeah.

192
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,263
Get it.

193
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,850
You want me to get it?

194
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,810
Yes.

195
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,526
Slow. Move slowly.

196
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,779
I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah.

197
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,325
Absolutely. I'm just gonna need
your swatter thing.

198
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,039
Come on.

199
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,208
Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.

200
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,044
Yeah.

201
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,754
- Yeah, come on.
- Just make it count.

202
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,717
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make it count, all right.

203
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,721
Okay. Now, on three.

204
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,348
Okay.

205
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,682
One...

206
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,226
Motherfuck...!

207
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,814
Yeah. You like that, huh?
Hurts, huh?

208
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,570
- Did you get it?
- I think so, yeah.

209
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,239
- Where is it?
- I don't know. What does it matter?

210
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,325
Who cares? I got it.

211
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,870
- Oh, Jesus, seriously?
- Where is it?

212
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,916
It's right there. Look.

213
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,253
Look. See? I told you I got it.

214
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,390
This is a raisin.

215
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,602
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri...

216
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,523
Oh, man.

217
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,776
He's got some skills, yo.

218
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,528
I'll give him that.

219
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,697
Look.

220
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,786
I feel like I'm running out of ways
to explain this to you,

221
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,289
but once more, I shall try.

222
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,419
This fly is a major problem for us.

223
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,296
It will ruin our batch.

224
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:01,135
And we need to destroy it
and every trace of it so we can cook.

225
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,471
Failing that...

226
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,809
we're dead.

227
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,065
There is no more room for error.

228
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,111
Not with these people.

229
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,366
All right, how about we go get some air?

230
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,411
"Get some air"?

231
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,997
Your answer to, "We're sliding headfirst"

232
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,749
- "into a massive crap..."
- Hey, hey, hey, Mr. White.

233
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,086
All right, I understand that the fly
is a serious thing now.

234
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,463
All right? I'm on board.

235
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,799
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe if we went and got some air

236
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,678
it would help us come up with a plan
on how to catch it.

237
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,599
Then come back down here
and subtract his ass.

238
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,997
- Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
- Yeah.

239
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,042
You sure? Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

240
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,170
Yeah. Hey!

241
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,048
If you're not gonna help me,
stay out of my way!

242
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,716
Hey!

243
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,934
Yo, yo, does somebody have
an ax I can use?

244
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,262
There we go.

245
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,018
Say good night.

246
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,606
Son of a bitch!

247
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,279
Son of a...

248
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,491
Damn it.

249
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,996
Where in the hell is that...?

250
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,140
What the hell?

251
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,939
Need some juice maybe?

252
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,653
Knock yourself out.

253
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,070
It's a real one.

254
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,156
Yeah, like yours was working.

255
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,493
No, no, no.

256
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,662
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

257
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,498
You don't decontaminate by
contaminating further.

258
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,834
What the hell is all this?

259
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,005
Here, how about this?

260
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,507
"Non-toxic glue strips."

261
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,969
Yeah, baby. It's got pheromones,
all right? I got a butt-load.

262
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:33,598
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

263
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,522
I sure hope we have enough.

264
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,985
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yeah.

265
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,362
Do you see him?

266
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,950
How long do you think you've been awake?

267
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,869
Why do you keep asking me that?

268
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:59,665
Just figure, you know, you could use
some coffee, is all. I know I could.

269
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,709
How about it?

270
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,128
Yeah.

271
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,551
- You take cream and sugar?
- Black is fine.

272
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,900
Why don't you just leave him be?

273
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,361
Let the traps do the work.

274
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,740
These pheromones are supposed
to kick ass.

275
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,745
Bet we catch this mofo any second.

276
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,385
Thank you.

277
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:59,433
You ever have, like, a wild animal
trapped in your house?

278
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,107
Not that I can recall, no.

279
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:11,445
We did, this one time,
back when it was my aunt's house

280
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,740
back before she died of cancer.

281
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:20,079
It was a possum.
Big freaky-looking bitch.

282
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,249
Hey, since when did they change it
to "opossum"?

283
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:27,461
What's up with that? I mean, when
I was coming up, it was just "possum."

284
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,132
You know, "opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

285
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,885
I mean, why they gotta go
changing everything?

286
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,471
Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.

287
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:41,600
Giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces.

288
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:46,647
Totally freaky, like alien rats.

289
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,736
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped,

290
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:56,073
but he was living there,
you know, under the house.

291
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,410
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room

292
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,621
always scurrying around.

293
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:08,002
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night
and it would just, you know, freeze.

294
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,589
I mean, it's like you're not looking
right at it, right?

295
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,633
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

296
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,304
That's what they do.
I mean, they play dead or whatever.

297
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,140
It's just so lame.

298
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:25,644
Is there a discernible point
to this story?

299
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:31,776
A point that you'll be arriving at
sometime in the near future?

300
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:36,155
It was just a total bitch to get out.
You know, it took forever.

301
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:42,953
Guy came, set all these traps and all
and he finally got it.

302
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,792
But my aunt, you know,
she didn't believe it.

303
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:53,130
I mean, she kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

304
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,133
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

305
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,471
She started keeping an old umbrella,
you know, by her chair.

306
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,724
Man, she would just bang on the floor
and yell at it.

307
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,227
Even gave it a name.

308
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,189
It was Scrabble.

309
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,649
Yeah, that was it.

310
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:15,569
You know,
"Scrabble, just knock it off."

311
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:22,076
She got like that toward the end.

312
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:29,667
Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.

313
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,335
We didn't know what was up.

314
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,258
It wasn't like her to be that way.

315
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:45,850
But it turned out that the cancer
had spread to her brain,

316
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,352
and that was why.

317
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,107
It metastasized.

318
00:28:54,859 --> 00:29:00,906
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor

319
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,409
because then we knew what was up.

320
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,453
You know, got her some treatment.

321
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,457
Meds, so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

322
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,965
It was a lot better after that.

323
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,886
You know, she was a lot happier.

324
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,645
Where the hell is he?

325
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,657
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse

326
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,659
just last week.

327
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,414
I'm still in remission.

328
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,167
I'm healthy.

329
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:58,255
Okay, so good. Great.

330
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,383
Well

331
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,762
no end in sight.

332
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,015
That's great.

333
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,977
Well

334
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,605
I missed it.

335
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:26,902
There was some perfect moment
and it passed me right by.

336
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:33,540
I had to have enough to leave them.

337
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,043
That was the whole point.

338
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,546
I mean, none of this...

339
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:44,510
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have enough.

340
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:50,224
But it had to be
before she found out. Skyler.

341
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,893
It had to be before that.

342
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,731
Perfect moment for what?

343
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,068
To drop dead?

344
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,530
What, you saying you wanna die?

345
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:11,745
I'm saying I've lived too long.

346
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,915
I mean

347
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:19,420
you want them to actually miss you,
you know?

348
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,883
You want their memories of you to be...

349
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,596
But she just won't...

350
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,766
She just won't understand.

351
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:37,688
I mean, no matter how well I explain it

352
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,899
these days, she just has this...

353
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,609
This...

354
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,908
I mean, I truly believe there exists
some combination of words.

355
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:55,789
There must exist certain words
in a certain specific order

356
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:01,295
that would explain all of this,
but with her, I just...

357
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,381
I just can't ever seem to find them.

358
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,759
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

359
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,803
You know, I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state,

360
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,307
but before the fugue state,
I didn't have enough money.

361
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:16,977
So no, not then.

362
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:29,156
And plus, my daughter wasn't born yet.

363
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,618
It had to be after Holly was born.

364
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,453
Mr. White...

365
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,414
Definitely before the surgery.

366
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,335
Oh, Christ.

367
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,837
That damn second cell phone.

368
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,590
I mean, how could I possibly...?

369
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,520
I know the moment.

370
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,485
It was the night Jane died.

371
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,867
Yeah, I...

372
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:20,124
I was at home and we needed diapers,

373
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:25,045
and so I said I'd go,
but it was just an excuse.

374
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:29,675
Actually, that was the night
I brought you your money, remember?

375
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,886
Yeah, I remember.

376
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:37,141
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.

377
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:42,563
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

378
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,400
I just walked in, sat down.

379
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,990
I never told you.

380
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,909
That you went to a bar?

381
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,412
No, I...

382
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:05,586
I sit down and this man, this stranger

383
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,046
he engages me in conversation.

384
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,215
He's a complete stranger.

385
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:18,932
But he turns out to be Jane's father,
Donald Margolis.

386
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,934
What are you talking about?

387
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,770
Of course, I didn't know it at the time.

388
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,899
I mean, he was just some guy in a bar.

389
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,278
I didn't put it together until after the
crash when he was all over the news.

390
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,447
Jane's dad.

391
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:36,450
I mean, think of the odds.

392
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,288
Once I tried to calculate them,
but they're astronomical.

393
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:46,210
I mean, think of the odds of me
going in, sitting down

394
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:50,547
that night in that bar next to that man.

395
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,219
What did you talk about?

396
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,434
Water on Mars.

397
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,481
Family.

398
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,611
What about family?

399
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:20,619
I told him that I had a daughter
and he told me he had one too.

400
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,996
Then he said:

401
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,582
"Never give up on family."

402
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,337
And I didn't.

403
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,467
I took his advice.

404
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,818
The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.

405
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:56,029
It's simple chaos.

406
00:35:56,238 --> 00:36:00,993
It's subatomic particles
in endless aimless collision.

407
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,954
That's what science teaches us.

408
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,873
But what is this saying?

409
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:15,542
What is it telling us when, on the very
night that this man's daughter dies

410
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:20,679
it's me who's having a drink with him?

411
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,059
I mean, how can that be random?

412
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:29,062
Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.

413
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:32,524
No, no. No, it's...

414
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,530
No. No.

415
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:47,080
No, that was the moment.

416
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,417
That night.

417
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,256
I should never have left home.

418
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,511
Never gone to your house.

419
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,353
Maybe things would have...

420
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:17,444
Oh, thought I was...

421
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:23,408
I was at home watching TV.

422
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,119
It was some...

423
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:31,750
Some nature program about elephants.

424
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:37,130
And Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

425
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,969
I could hear them on the baby monitor.

426
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,975
She was singing a lullaby.

427
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:02,155
If I had just lived right up
to that moment,

428
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,492
and not one second more...

429
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,674
that would have been perfect.

430
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,315
He's not coming down.

431
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,694
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

432
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,029
That's why he likes it.

433
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,825
Thailand's hot, right?

434
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,536
Yeah.

435
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,414
Then that's why.

436
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:57,794
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hey, hey, wait. Here.

437
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,561
He's not coming down.

438
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,940
He's staying up there forever.

439
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,384
What are you...? What are you doing?

440
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:50,221
What do you think?
I'm gonna get that bitch.

441
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,103
No, you're gonna break your neck.

442
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,689
Yeah, yeah. Just...

443
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:05,111
No, seriously, you're...
This is a bad idea.

444
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,198
Damn it.

445
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,950
Jesse.

446
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,284
Just hold onto it.

447
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,703
Hold it still?

448
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,260
Jesse.

449
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,308
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:39,396
Sorry for what, being a lunatic?

451
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,318
I'm sorry about Jane.

452
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,326
Yeah.

453
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,162
Me too.

454
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,916
I mean...

455
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:07,007
I'm very sorry.

456
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,055
It's not your fault.

457
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,851
It's not mine either.

458
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,313
It's no one's fault, not even hers.

459
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:37,454
You know, we are who we are,
Mr. White.

460
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:43,126
You know, two junkies
with a duffel bag full of cash.

461
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:48,131
Like you said, we both would've
been dead within a week.

462
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,884
But I miss her, though.

463
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,098
God, I do.

464
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,232
Jesse.

465
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,693
Come down.

466
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,238
Wait. I'm so close.

467
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,868
Let it go.

468
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,245
We need to cook.

469
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,165
What about the contamination?

470
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,336
It's all contaminated.

471
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,927
All right, well

472
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,888
I definitely scared him.

473
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,725
Probably stay out of our way.

474
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,716
Yeah!

475
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,386
Somebody got got, yo!

476
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:18,721
Did you see that, Mr. Wh...?

477
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,854
Bins are packed?

478
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,523
Bins are packed.

479
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,692
How's the yield?

480
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,278
Two-oh-two and change.

481
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:17,864
You okay getting home?

482
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,534
Yeah. Better. Thanks.

483
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,620
Mañana, then.

484
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,221
Jesse, come here.

485
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,476
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

486
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:50,396
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

487
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:56,527
That half a pound I said we were off by.

488
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,281
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...

489
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:05,328
You understand?
And if they ever found out...

490
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,583
I didn't take shit.

491
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:19,175
I'm just saying that
I won't be able to protect you.

492
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,804
Who's asking you to?
