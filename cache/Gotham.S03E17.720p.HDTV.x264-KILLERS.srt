1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,379
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,019
You have five minutes, quiz kids.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,210
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,819
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,279
A weapon is en route to destroy the city.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,229
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,719
and the rest of them by myself.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,069
Said you wanted to build an army, right?

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,639
what about an army of freaks?

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,250
Who ordered the hit on my father?

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,530
Frank Gordon.

12
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,210
Your uncle.

13
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,170
You have the right to remain silent.

14
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,119
Dock 9C.

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,479
It's where the weapon will be arriving.

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,110
Jim, do I hear a favor coming on?

17
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,149
What is coming into dock 9C?

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,039
Now I know who I am...

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,860
I'm the Riddler.

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,629
It's good to see you, too.

21
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,100
How'd things go with Selina?

22
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,739
This... is what I was made for.

23
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,069
The clone is in place.

24
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,370
Good evening, Alfred.

25
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,259
And to you, Master Bruce.

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,939
You need to join the Court of Owls, Jim.

27
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,789
A woman named Kathryn is going to call.

28
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,499
He would have been so proud of you.

29
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
No!

30
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,949
Kathryn, I presume.

31
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,259
I killed my uncle.

32
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,789
I make no apologies for it.

33
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,999
Maybe it's time we meet.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,860
My thought exactly.

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,650
Hello?!

36
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,800
Anyone home?

37
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,590
When this guy gets home, we got
to ask him to kick on the heat.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,600
It's colder in here than it is out there.

39
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,260
Fascinating.

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,589
I know you're hell-bent on getting
revenge on Nygma and all,

41
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,690
and forming an army of freaks
is a great plan, I mean,

42
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,710
it was my idea, but...

43
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,070
Quiet.

44
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,060
I think I hear something.

45
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,550
Do you think it's him?

46
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,440
Mr. Fries.

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,200
Welcome home.

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,849
I see you still hold me responsible

49
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,899
for all of that awful monster rhetoric

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,190
I spewed during my campaign.

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,390
You ran people like me out of Gotham.

52
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,449
We both know I only said those things

53
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,620
because that's what the
voters wanted to hear.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,760
Your experiments, Mr. Fries.

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,830
You're trying to reverse
your condition, aren't you?

56
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,340
I can help you.

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,569
And why would you do that?

58
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,520
My enemies took everything from me.

59
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,550
Tried to murder me.

60
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,330
You help me get my revenge,

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,719
and when I take back my throne,

62
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,449
I will give you every resource you need

63
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,490
to free yourself from this icy prison.

64
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,949
Even if I wanted to say yes,

65
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,540
I can only survive a few hours
outside the cold without my suit.

66
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,619
And you don't have it because
it's been locked away

67
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,450
in a Wayne Enterprises black site
ever since you escaped Indian Hill.

68
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,550
Ivy?

69
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,970
My suit.

70
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,440
So, Mr. Fries, will you join us?

71
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,320
Where are we?

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,180
Where we are is not important, James.

73
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,510
What matters is why you're here.

74
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,759
You know why I killed my uncle.

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,890
Yes, I do.

76
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,690
Frank murdered your father.

77
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,430
What I need to know is if you hold
us accountable for his action.

78
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,450
Frank acted alone.

79
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,530
He admitted as much to me.

80
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,470
Good.

81
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,920
Then we can proceed.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,559
The city needs you now
more than ever, James.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,029
There's turmoil ahead,

84
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,189
and good men like you
are going to be needed

85
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,459
to hold it together.

86
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,399
But make no mistake,

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,820
the Court, and the Court
alone, can save Gotham.

88
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,030
So what do you want me to do?

89
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,510
Prove your loyalty to the Court.

90
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,229
Killing my uncle wasn't enough?

91
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,079
That was between you and Frank.

92
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,970
It had nothing to do with us.

93
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,889
When the time is right,

94
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,290
we will call upon you.

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,620
And Frank's body?

96
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,090
It's still in the brownstone.

97
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,160
We've already taken care of it.

98
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,730
Who's the stiff?

99
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,930
Jim's uncle, Frank Gordon.

100
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,410
Never met him.

101
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:05,519
They were estranged.

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,710
Have you seen Jim?

103
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,460
He's working a case.

104
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,429
Or he's walking in the door as we speak.

105
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,840
Hey, Jim. Come in, we, uh,
have some bad news for you.

106
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,870
What's going on?

107
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,090
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,690
We found your uncle's body this morning.

109
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,100
He was pulled out of the harbor.

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,189
I did my prelim.

111
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,050
The burns on his left temple suggest
he was shot at close range.

112
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,720
Lab is running ballistics.

113
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,639
You saw him at the cemetery yesterday.

114
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,520
He seemed on edge.

115
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:33,760
Did he say anything?

116
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,840
No. He, just stopped by
to pay his respects.

117
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,180
We didn't talk much.

118
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,870
Thanks, Lee. I'll take it from here.

119
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,110
That's it? That's your reaction?

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,050
What do you want me to say?

121
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,810
I know you.

122
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,459
You're hiding something.
You know something.

123
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,009
Lee, come on. The man just lost his uncle.

124
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,010
Yeah, Harvey, you just
keep covering for him.

125
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,560
My condolences.

126
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,260
She's right. You do know
something, don't you?

127
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,590
Uncle Frank shot himself.

128
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,490
Said it was the only way to
get me inside the Court.

129
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,490
Did it work?

130
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,340
I met with a woman named Kathryn.

131
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,210
She says I have to prove my
loyalty to the Court first.

132
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,290
Look, I see the need for playing it cool.

133
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,249
But right now, the Court's
readying a weapon

134
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,369
that could destroy the city.

135
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,229
We don't have time to sit on
our thumbs and do nothing.

136
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,029
I don't like it any more than
you do, but if I push too hard,

137
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,940
we might blow the only chance
we have at stopping this.

138
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,019
And Uncle Frank will have died in vain.

139
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,720
Okay, so what do we do now?

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,359
Kathryn said to get back to work.

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,619
Keep up appearances.

142
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,990
That shouldn't be too hard.

143
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,260
Look who resurfaced.

144
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,620
Hello?

145
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,450
Ed?

146
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,940
It's Barbara.

147
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,350
Your old friend you've been blowing off.

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,439
I'll allow you to call me Ed

149
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,050
'cause we have history.

150
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,880
But my name...

151
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,780
is the Riddler.

152
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,180
So the headlines say.

153
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,420
Now, why are you here?

154
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,780
When Penguin was mayor,

155
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,279
did he mention a mysterious group?

156
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,199
One that controlled the
levers of power in Gotham

157
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,210
from the shadows with total impunity?

158
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,140
No.

159
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,299
See, I didn't claw my way to the top

160
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,620
only to find out there
was someone above me.

161
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,769
I've been trying to find out who they are,

162
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,390
but no one in this town seems
to know anything about them.

163
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,170
And how is it that you know about them?

164
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,460
Jim Gordon put me onto them.

165
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,489
And what is his interest in all this?

166
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,539
He didn't say.

167
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,449
But he did ask me to
investigate a shipment

168
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,419
coming into Dock 9C yesterday.

169
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,249
The harbormaster was protecting
a crate from Indian Hill.

170
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,199
- What was inside?
- I don't know.

171
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,679
Before I got a chance to find out,

172
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,770
some masked assassin
slaughtered half my men.

173
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,310
What do you know?

174
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,450
When I was at Indian Hill,

175
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,529
Professor Strange hinted at
some powerful, secret group,

176
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,000
but he didn't tell me who they were.

177
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,420
This is the one riddle that got away.

178
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,660
I will get you the answer you seek.

179
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,640
But I will do it in my own way.

180
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,320
You're gonna make a big
production of this, aren't you?

181
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,960
Only someone with power and connections

182
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,510
would have information on this group.

183
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,470
I need to speak with Gotham's elite.

184
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,270
And nothing brings out the
bourgeoisie quite like

185
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,600
opening night at the theater.

186
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,340
Where wilt thou lead me?

187
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,690
Speak,

188
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,260
for I will go no further.

189
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,480
I say, Ghost,

190
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,270
speak your business

191
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,350
or I shall go no further!

192
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,140
My business

193
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,959
is not with you, Prince of Denmark.

194
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,140
But with your audience.

195
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,570
I've come to address you,

196
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,549
the ruling class of Gotham.

197
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,359
You've kept a secret for far too long.

198
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,700
But tonight

199
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,079
I will kidnap and torture one of you

200
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,879
to expose the truth.

201
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,149
So, spread the word to all your friends,

202
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,740
the Riddler is coming.

203
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,839
Also, I found your
performance to be wooden

204
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,430
and... unrealistic.

205
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,270
And scene.

206
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,480
And that, my old mucker,

207
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,680
is checkmate.

208
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,440
Good game, Alfred.

209
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,410
You let me win, didn't you, Master Bruce?

210
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,840
- No way, Alfred.
- No way, my foot.

211
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,710
That's very unlike you, isn't it?

212
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,040
And to be honest, I mean,

213
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,940
you haven't been yourself these
past few days, have you?

214
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,929
I don't know what you're talking about.

215
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,530
I think you do know what I'm
talking about, so come on.

216
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,900
Out with it.

217
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,490
The other day when I came home,

218
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,630
you asked how things were with Selina.

219
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,310
I made it sound like things were hopeful.

220
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,940
I lied.

221
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,540
She said she never wanted to see me again.

222
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,550
I was embarrassed.

223
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,379
I was afraid you'd ask
me about seeing Selina,

224
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,680
and I'd lie and...

225
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,400
I just didn't want to talk about it.

226
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, then... I understand, Master B.

227
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,540
And thank you very much
for being so candid.

228
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,679
And I really wouldn't
worry about Ms. Kyle.

229
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,999
You know, time has a way of
sorting these things out,

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
doesn't it?

231
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,890
Talking of which, I should
check on the dinner.

232
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Alfred.

233
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,170
Sir?

234
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Thank you.

235
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,000
You're a good friend.

236
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,820
Glad to hear it, sir.

237
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,430
It's me.

238
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,850
It's happening again.

239
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,940
So, the audience has been accounted for.

240
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,460
Is this Hamlet?

241
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,350
I guess he wasn't meant to be.

242
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,099
You crossed paths with Nygma recently.

243
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,479
Any idea what this secret
is he's talking about?

244
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,929
No, I have no clue.

245
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,569
My guess is he just made it up.

246
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,679
Captain, we got the all clear.

247
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
All right.

248
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,700
This is all that's in there.

249
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,080
It's a riddle.

250
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Shocker.

251
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,279
Written in iambic pentameter

252
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,220
like a Shakespearean sonnet.

253
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,220
"I am a man who holds a high position,

254
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,959
who shows two faces to all those he rules,

255
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,230
a fraud, criminal, and
sometime politician.

256
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,020
Gotham, my constituency of fools."

257
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,120
A two-faced politician whose
constituency is Gotham.

258
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,500
The mayor?

259
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:39,269
"Fraud, criminal" sounds like
he's describing Penguin,

260
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,040
but that doesn't make any sense.

261
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,630
Ed told Lucius he killed Penguin.

262
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,160
Aubrey James.

263
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,929
He was recently reinstated
and he's been mayor before.

264
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,830
"Sometime politician," but
why not just grab him?

265
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,969
Why tell us in advance?

266
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,669
Because Nygma wants to make a show of it

267
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,109
and make us look bad in the process.

268
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,250
Call the mayor's office.
Tell him we're on our way.

269
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,359
We don't need Nygma for anything.

270
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,670
He should be dead by now.

271
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,419
He's obsessed with finding the answer,

272
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,429
which is an easy solution for us.

273
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,790
Once he does, we'll get rid of him.

274
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,170
I promise.

275
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,860
And how's him causing a scene
at the theater help us?

276
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,430
It doesn't.

277
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,140
But it does help me more

278
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,500
fully announce myself on the Gotham stage.

279
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,520
If you'll forgive the pun.

280
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,690
Do you want to become famous?

281
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,930
Try dying.

282
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,170
I can help you with that.

283
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,200
Okay, that's enough.

284
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,570
What actually is your plan?

285
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,460
Kidnap Mayor James.

286
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,030
The man ran this place for ten years.

287
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,289
If anyone knows about this
mysterious group, he does.

288
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,720
You could've just said that.

289
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,120
I could've had him here, being tortured.

290
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,670
Okay. See, but first I
had to tell the GCPD

291
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,850
what I was going to do.

292
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,310
How else am I supposed to
properly embarrass them publicly?

293
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,600
My crimes must live up to my name,

294
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,889
and this is no exception.

295
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,670
And what if the mayor doesn't
know anything about this group?

296
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,890
What then?

297
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,629
I have a plan B to smoke them out,

298
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,300
but first...

299
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,800
I need something from you.

300
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,729
There's a biker bar on the
corner of Spaulding and Eighth.

301
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,620
It's full of brawlers, lowlifes.

302
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,010
I need a bomb

303
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,740
to detonate there.

304
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,720
Tonight.

305
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,640
I'll let you know when.

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,270
So tell us, genius,

307
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,999
how do you plan to get Aubrey James

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,450
now that you've told the
GCPD you're going after him?

309
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,630
Oh, that's simple.

310
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,210
They're gonna bring him to me.

311
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,920
You know how many crooked
politicians there are in this city?

312
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,779
This riddle could be for anyone.

313
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,270
Oh, my gosh, these are delicious.

314
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,499
All the same, Mr. Mayor,

315
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,170
we'd like to move you to a
safe house immediately.

316
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,430
Did you not see the
muscle twins over there?

317
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,450
I'm perfectly safe here.

318
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,629
Besides, what's the Riddler
want with me, anyway?

319
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,950
We're not really sure.

320
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,610
He did say something to the crowd
at the theater about a secret.

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,510
My life's an open book.

322
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,380
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mayor?
You look a little...

323
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,320
It's my blood sugar.

324
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:14,070
I've had too many of these Danishes.

325
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,490
Where are my pills?

326
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,990
Wait a minute, where'd you get these?

327
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,700
An appreciative citizen. Why?

328
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,840
Oh, boy.

329
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Nygma.

330
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
This is bad.

331
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,880
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

332
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,019
You cannot be serious.

333
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,960
I've seen mass graves more
inviting than this place.

334
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,410
Strange messed me up pretty good.

335
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,290
He convinced me I was
some sort of goddess,

336
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,599
and it took me a long time to get over it.

337
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,380
Now, this place might be
bad, but Gotham is worse.

338
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,030
Hey, freak! You're on company time.

339
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,600
Get back to work.

340
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,410
You don't have to take that.

341
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,700
You should totally kick his ass.

342
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,710
Yeah, but he's my boss.

343
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,600
Bridgit, there is nothing
wrong with being a freak.

344
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,040
I'm a freak.

345
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,590
So is Penguin.

346
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,550
You belong with us.

347
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,030
We've met before, haven't we?

348
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,260
Yeah. I'm Ivy Pepper.

349
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,390
Selina's friend.

350
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,329
Oh, I know. I ran into one
of Strange's puppies.

351
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,539
Kind of had a growth spurt.

352
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,340
Though, to be honest, I'm not complaining.

353
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,760
Ivy.

354
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,180
And you're part of this?

355
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,580
Yeah. It's almost like we're a family.

356
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,270
You don't have to be alone anymore.

357
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,050
I could kill your boss
just to sweeten the deal.

358
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,050
Nah.

359
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,830
Hey, you.

360
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
I quit.

361
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,850
Thank you for letting me come in.

362
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,679
The nosebleeds are getting worse.

363
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,630
You did the right thing coming here.

364
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,309
What did you tell Alfred?

365
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,310
Nothing.

366
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,200
I said I was tired, then
snuck out of my room.

367
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,450
I'm dying, aren't I?

368
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,910
Yes.

369
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,880
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,160
The process that brought you
into this world was flawed.

371
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,219
Will I die before Bruce returns?

372
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,400
No, Bruce Wayne will be back
in Gotham well before then.

373
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,580
I know we've asked a lot of you.

374
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,000
After Indian Hill I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

375
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,140
You gave me a purpose.

376
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,010
That's more than most people could say.

377
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm glad you see it that way.

378
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,620
When Bruce returns...

379
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,830
people are going to die, aren't they?

380
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,799
A lot of people.

381
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,690
You haven't gotten attached
to anyone, have you?

382
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,140
Alfred, perhaps?

383
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,630
- You've spoken fondly of him.
- No.

384
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,940
I just want to know.

385
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,680
The number is immaterial.

386
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,130
What matters is that gotham must fall.

387
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,680
And because of your sacrifice, it will.

388
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,540
Can we count on you?

389
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,270
Yes.

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,129
His BP's dropping.

391
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,199
We need to stabilize him!

392
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,399
I want this ER secured.

393
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,879
Badge access only.

394
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,879
No one gets in unless they're
sick or dying. - 10-4.

395
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,329
Nygma knows this is the closest
hospital to the mayor's office.

396
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,519
We brought him right to him.

397
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,559
Great, let him show his face.

398
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,139
I got unis all over the place.

399
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,040
But what are we missing, Harvey?

400
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,469
What could Aubrey James know
that's so important to Nygma?

401
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,020
Paging Detective James Gordon.

402
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,939
Paging Detective James Gordon.

403
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,760
Where's that coming from?

404
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,429
Communications room. Second floor.

405
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,160
It's a trap.

406
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:22,560
Please don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!

407
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Stay here.

408
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,290
So, Jimbo,

409
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,406
I know you must be wondering
what I want from that

410
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,580
ding-dong Aubrey James.

411
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,360
Well...

412
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:36,080
turns out, he has answers to a riddle,

413
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,509
one that you put into motion

414
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,149
when you sent Barbara down to Dock 9C.

415
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,760
The question being, who runs Gotham?

416
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,449
- I got to get out of here.
- No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

417
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,870
Mr. Mayor, you're in no
condition to go anywhere.

418
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,939
Jim. Tell me you got him.

419
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,970
He wasn't there.

420
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,120
But the secret he's after, it's the Court.

421
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,520
Lidocaine and an IV push.

422
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,180
- You better get back here quick.
- What is it?

423
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,489
There was some kind of explosion.

424
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,480
A lot of victims.

425
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,489
- I got a bad feeling.
- It's him.

426
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,980
Don't leave the mayor's side.

427
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,919
Authorized personnel only.

428
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,030
Hell with that. My friends got blown up!

429
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,560
Hello, Aubrey.

430
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,610
We got company.

431
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,770
Where is she?

432
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,910
Not here.

433
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,340
I know she and Nygma
kidnapped Mayor James.

434
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,290
Nygma mentioned Dock 9C and
she's the only one I told.

435
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,359
Nygma's got a big mouth.

436
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,080
Wait, wait, wait, let
me get this straight.

437
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,270
You mean this whole stupid
riddle thing with Nygma is real?

438
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,550
What? He clearly knows everything already.

439
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,240
I heard a rumor

440
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,809
he hurt you pretty bad a
while back, both of you.

441
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,380
Surprised you're defending him.

442
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,450
Listen, you tell me where they are,

443
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,230
I'll take Nygma down,

444
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,820
but I'll give Barbara a free pass.

445
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,850
It's true. I hate him.

446
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,410
But I don't know where they are.

447
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,690
Harvey?

448
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,200
Okay. I'll be right there.

449
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,590
Nygma sent another riddle.

450
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,699
Never should have brought
Barbara into this.

451
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,930
You better hope I get to her first.

452
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,020
You should have given that freak up.

453
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,610
No one wants Nygma dead more than me.

454
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,160
But I can't betray Barbara.

455
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,690
Yeah.

456
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,310
'Cause she's always got your
best interests at heart.

457
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
Listen.

458
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,730
You're in way over your head on this one.

459
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,010
You don't want to mess with these people.

460
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,710
You see, everything that you say

461
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,880
just makes me more intrigued.

462
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,000
And determined.

463
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,750
I will be the one who unmasks them.

464
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,890
You're insane.

465
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,440
Remember me, Aubrey?

466
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,730
I know that voice.

467
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,900
I'm so glad.

468
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,860
I thought maybe it got muffled.

469
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,510
We put that box on your head.

470
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,880
That was fun. We should do that
again for old times' sake.

471
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,290
You don't get it, do you?

472
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,829
These people, they're... they're like God.

473
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,269
They see and hear everything.

474
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,630
They'll know I talked.

475
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,939
Then it's the box.

476
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,040
No, no, no. Please, a-anything but that.

477
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,260
They call themselves the Court.

478
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
And?

479
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,340
That's all I know.

480
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,409
I-I've never met these people.

481
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,330
I just did what they asked me to, I swear.

482
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,160
Very good! Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

483
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,080
You've been very helpful.

484
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,800
Helpful?

485
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,110
All he gave us was "The Court."

486
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,850
He gave us tangible evidence
of their existence.

487
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,040
Now they'll know I'm not bluffing.

488
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,939
What are you talking about?

489
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,870
I'm going to force the Court
to reveal themselves.

490
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,470
What is the one thing that every
secret organization is afraid of?

491
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,510
Being exposed.

492
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,450
Bingo.

493
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,140
Finally. Did you bring what I asked for?

494
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,370
It's time to get the Court's attention.

495
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,050
Baby...

496
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,259
Gordon came to the club.

497
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,380
He knows everything.

498
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,760
You should have never
gotten Nygma involved.

499
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,760
I boosted the premium stuff, Otto.

500
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,550
You're welcome.

501
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,390
Hello, Selina.

502
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,350
What the hell are you doing here?

503
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,340
I wanted to see you.

504
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,750
I missed you.

505
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,579
Did you fall on your head?
I told you to stay away.

506
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,580
You did?

507
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,890
I forgot.

508
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,000
Why are you acting so weird?

509
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,770
I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't
sleep well last night.

510
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,220
Well, I just came to feed my cat.

511
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,039
So, if you're not gonna leave, I am.

512
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,830
I promised myself I'd stay away.

513
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,790
That it would be safer that way, but...

514
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,810
things have changed.

515
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,270
What are you talking about?

516
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,289
You know what? I don't care.

517
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,340
Just don't be here when I get back.

518
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,400
Selina, wait.

519
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,890
I am not Bruce.

520
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Jim?

521
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,139
Lee, now is not a good time.

522
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,740
Your uncle's autopsy.

523
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,410
Ballistics came back negative. No match.

524
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,639
But there were microscopic
tears along the entry wound,

525
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
made postmortem.

526
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,069
What are you saying?

527
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,529
Someone removed the bullet
that killed your uncle

528
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,329
and replaced it with another one.

529
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,249
It's an old mob trick
to cover up a murder.

530
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,960
You're reaching, Lee.

531
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,290
I don't think so.

532
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,220
And I think you know what happened.

533
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,490
Listen to me.

534
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,609
You need to drop this. You
could get yourself hurt.

535
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,550
You think I care what happens to me?

536
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,269
I am sick of watching you

537
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,519
destroy people's lives
and get away with it.

538
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,300
When I find out what you did,

539
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,020
I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.

540
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,429
And I'm gonna enjoy it.

541
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,430
Jim, hey.

542
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,100
Where's the riddle?

543
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:05,569
Me and Lucius took a crack at it,

544
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,080
but maybe you'll have better luck.

545
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,670
"You can see me, but you cannot touch me.

546
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,000
"The flick of a switch, I enter your home.

547
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,770
"With another, I leave you alone.

548
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,400
Where am I?"

549
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,649
He's taunting us. If he kills James,

550
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,110
the press is gonna hand us
our asses on the 6:00 news.

551
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,850
Harvey, you're a genius.

552
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,570
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

553
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,950
I have a question.

554
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,110
What is this mysterious "Court"

555
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,469
that controls the levers
of power here in Gotham?

556
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,159
Alvarez, go to channel seven!

557
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,109
Find out where Nygma's broadcasting from.

558
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,540
And will they let our dear
mayor's head be blown to bits

559
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,380
in order to keep their anonymity?

560
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,009
Are you watching the television?

561
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,980
I am.

562
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:58,930
The Court cannot be exposed.

563
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,559
We would clean this up on our own,

564
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,980
but there are too many eyes watching.

565
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,189
However, this does afford
us an opportunity, James.

566
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,620
To prove my loyalty.

567
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,430
You want me to find Nygma
and bring him to you?

568
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,570
I understand this puts you
in a difficult position.

569
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,399
He's a cop killer. He belongs in prison.

570
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,219
If you decline, this
conversation will be our last.

571
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,610
The choice is yours.

572
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,440
That was the Court.

573
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,749
If I hand him over, I'm in.

574
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,710
They'll probably kill him.

575
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,850
And if I don't, we'll never stop
them from destroying the city.

576
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,790
I know what you're thinking, Aubrey.

577
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,540
That the police are
gonna somehow find you,

578
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,630
rescue you.

579
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,450
But I gave the GCPD every
chance to save you.

580
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,470
But they're no match for me!

581
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,800
We're both dead men.

582
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,270
You don't get it, do you?

583
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,090
The Court isn't gonna bargain with you.

584
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,370
You underestimate me, Mr. James.

585
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,370
- Hello.
- Nygma.

586
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,580
Jim, I'm so sorry.

587
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,859
We can't be clogging up the lines.

588
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,679
I'm actually expecting an important call.

589
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,540
You want to know who runs Gotham?

590
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,139
I have the answer.

591
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,930
Come by the GCPD.

592
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,590
I'll tell it to you.

593
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,759
Yeah, I think I'll pass on that.

594
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,230
Then you'll never know the truth.

595
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,670
You think I told Barbara
everything I know?

596
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,610
You always were clever, Jim.

597
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,200
I respect that.

598
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,210
Empty out the GCPD.

599
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,770
I want it to just be you and me.

600
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,180
Alone.

601
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,350
Well, and this idiot with
the bomb around his neck.

602
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,770
You think he'll show?

603
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,869
The thing that drives Nygma is
also his weakness. He'll be here.

604
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,129
It's not like every man,
woman and child in Gotham

605
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,159
isn't depending on you to succeed.

606
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,570
Yeah. No pressure.

607
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,590
Good luck, pal.

608
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,590
Thanks.

609
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,280
Where's Ed?

610
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,609
That lunatic dropped me off.
Sent me in alone.

611
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,210
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Sit down and shut up.

612
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,910
Ed?

613
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,770
It's just the two of us in here.

614
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,750
Just wanted to make sure I
wasn't walking into a trap.

615
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,960
Sit down, Aubrey.

616
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,670
You said you have the answer
I was looking for, Jim.

617
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,560
It would be incredibly disappointing
if this was all a ruse.

618
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,469
More so for Mayor James.

619
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,740
Just tell him what he wants.

620
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,530
He talks too much.

621
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,016
You should probably just
go ahead and blow him up.

622
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,800
I'll have your badge, Gordon.

623
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,810
I'm not bluffing, Jim.

624
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,290
Neither am I.

625
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,659
What's the blast radius on that thing?

626
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,310
Am I good here? Or should I...

627
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,899
duck behind a desk?

628
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,250
I want the answer, Jim!

629
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,310
I kill him,

630
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,730
I still walk out of here
with you as my hostage.

631
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,130
No!

632
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,350
No!

633
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,410
No!

634
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,690
Oh, come on.

635
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,339
There's a radio frequency
jamming the signal

636
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,089
between the detonator and the bomb.

637
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,120
- How?
- Tabitha.

638
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,370
She holds quite the grudge against you.

639
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,439
She called me.

640
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,590
Told me how to disarm the bomb.

641
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,570
I'll admit, I didn't see this coming.

642
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,240
But that doesn't change anything.

643
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,450
I want...

644
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,920
to know...

645
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,150
who the Court is.

646
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,190
Or Aubrey dies.

647
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,490
Don't!

648
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,740
You want to know who runs Gotham?

649
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,210
Then let Mayor James go.

650
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,250
Take a ride with me.

651
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,109
But if you pull that trigger,

652
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,990
you'll never get the
answer you're looking for.

653
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,940
You fool me once, Jim,

654
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,160
shame on you.

655
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,940
You fool me twice...

656
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,869
...well, that's just not gonna happen.

657
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,800
Then the riddle will go unsolved.

658
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,480
Fine!

659
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,820
Let's go.

660
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,220
Let me get this straight.

661
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,149
So, this limo pulls up
literally out of nowhere,

662
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,849
and this creepy lady tells you to get in

663
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,250
because "You could be so much more"?

664
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,330
And you did?

665
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,239
I had nowhere else to go.

666
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,150
So where have you been
the last few months?

667
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,330
It's not important.

668
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,089
What matters is you need to leave Gotham.
Right away.

669
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,190
Why?

670
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,529
Because the city has been judged.

671
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,080
And something bad is going to happen.

672
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,500
Judged by who?

673
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,430
The people who took you?

674
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,140
Wait a minute, your clothes, your hair,

675
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,010
the way you talk.

676
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,670
Where is Bruce?

677
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,079
- Selina...
- What did you do to him?

678
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,990
He's fine. He's not in Gotham.

679
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,579
But nothing bad is going to happen to him.

680
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,689
Then where is he?

681
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,769
It doesn't matter.

682
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,390
You just have to trust me. You
need to leave Gotham today.

683
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,910
Trust you?

684
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,200
I don't even know you.

685
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:43,210
Where you going?

686
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,529
To tell Alfred.

687
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,569
- Selina...
- Now let me go!

688
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,769
Selina, you can't tell anyone.

689
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,310
Then why the hell did you tell me?

690
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,900
Because I care about you.

691
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,309
And if there's one person I want to save,

692
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,790
I want it to be you.

693
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,170
That's the difference between
you and Bruce Wayne.

694
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,270
He would try and save everyone.

695
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,739
You can pretend all you want,

696
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,660
but you will never be him.

697
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,459
You're nothing.

698
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,020
You're not even a real person.

699
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,980
You don't matter.

700
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,770
You're wrong about me.

701
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,400
I do matter.

702
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,169
And I won't let you tell Alfred.

703
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,190
Oh, yeah?

704
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,620
How you gonna stop...

705
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,310
You remember the night

706
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,210
you came over to Lee's for dinner?

707
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,940
It was like a lifetime ago.

708
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,390
Leslie made fondue.

709
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,940
The wine was a Bordeaux.

710
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,640
Well-aged. Smooth tannins.

711
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,330
Ms. Kringle wore

712
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,330
a black dress with pink trim.

713
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,610
I tried like hell to get out of it.

714
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,060
But Lee insisted.

715
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,670
The truth is, I had a good time.

716
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,180
I considered you a friend.

717
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,479
I can sneak up on you

718
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,729
or be right in front of you
without you even knowing.

719
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,580
But when I reveal myself,

720
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,269
you will never be the same. What am I?

721
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,250
- I don't care, I...
- Betrayal.

722
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,340
That's how every friendship ends.

723
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,760
So...

724
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,340
so what good are friends anyway?

725
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,879
Who are they?

726
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,260
The answer to your question.

727
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,560
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

728
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,709
I hear you've been asking about us.

729
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,390
How do I know you're real?

730
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,310
Isn't that the point of a good mystery?

731
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,270
You're never quite sure what
to believe until the end.

732
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,939
Gordon could've put you up to this.

733
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
I assure you,

734
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:05,510
Detective Gordon had to be
convinced to bring you here.

735
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,640
But let me put it like this:

736
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,739
that question Professor
Strange had you ask

737
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,360
Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox
last year at Indian Hill,

738
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,340
the one that has tortured you,

739
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,000
the one you'll never be able to answer.

740
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,830
That answer is with me.

741
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,220
What now?

742
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,490
Get in.

743
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,630
And all your questions will be answered.

744
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,260
You won't be needing the gun.

745
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,570
You've made us proud, Detective Gordon.

746
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,720
What are you going to do with him?

747
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,779
A man with Nygma's intellect

748
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,680
could be quite useful to us.

749
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm sure we'll find
something for him to do.

750
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,340
We'll be in touch.

751
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,630
Good evening, Ms. Kean.

752
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:38,810
May I offer you a drink?

753
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,229
Something went wrong.

754
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,339
Gordon took down Nygma

755
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,900
before he could find out
the truth about the Court.

756
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,730
Probably 'cause I told Gordon
how to disarm the bomb.

757
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,410
What?

758
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,360
Why?

759
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:55,059
You promised that when Nygma
handed over the underworld,

760
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,430
I would get to kill him.

761
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,900
Sealed it with a kiss, remember?

762
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,050
Don't you get it?

763
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,930
As long as the Court is out there,

764
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,869
I'll never

765
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,660
be in control!

766
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,110
Don't you mean we'll never be in control?

767
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,690
Seen it a thousand times.

768
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,430
Ambition, power.

769
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,150
People can't help themselves.

770
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,970
She's changed, baby.

771
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,209
When are you gonna see that?

772
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,510
Shut up, Butch!

773
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Move!

774
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,200
This is trouble.

775
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,920
It's good to be home.

776
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,129
FYI, I've been to Wayne Manor.

777
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,710
It's way cleaner.

778
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,380
You never said anything about
Fries being a part of this.

779
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,180
You're a little hot.

780
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,330
Maybe you need to cool off.

781
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,880
Oh, come on, you guys.

782
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,770
We're on the same team now, remember?

783
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,850
A family?

784
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,230
Keep him away from me.

785
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,390
There's a question mark on your face.

786
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,609
You can sleep in the freezer.

787
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,079
The study speculates that
widespread chemical dumping

788
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,980
is to blame.

789
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:30,579
And this just in: we now
go to breaking news...

790
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,469
Hey, Pengy. Check it out.

791
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,959
Do not call me "Pengy"!

792
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,209
The Riddler, aka Edward Nygma,

793
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,859
was apprehended by the GCPD this afternoon

794
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,199
after kidnapping Interim
Mayor Aubrey James.

795
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,199
However, while en route to Arkham Asylum,

796
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,699
- he managed to escape police custody...
- Riddler.

797
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,120
...and is now at large.

798
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,600
How long did he have to
think about that one?

799
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,720
Rest up, everyone.

800
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,950
Tomorrow is going to be a busy day.

801
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,030
I'd like to introduce our newest member,

802
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,090
James Gordon.

803
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,700
Welcome to the Court of Owls.
