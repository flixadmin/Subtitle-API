1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,640
You've heard of Votura.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,962
Makes any subject extremely susceptible
to suggestion...

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,088
...while retaining no
memory of their actions.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,563
- I will tell Ra's.
- He will still kill her. She fired the arrows.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,768
The bioweapon is comprised
of two components.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,764
The Omega she has is harmless
without its counterpart, Alpha.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,922
I trust my father.
And he explained to me...

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,527
...that every name
on that list has a reason to be there.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,128
A few years ago, I found a message
he left me explaining the list.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,327
How is that possible?

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,484
- You were on a deserted island.
- I didn't say that I found it on the island.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,211
Chien Na Wei has left Hong Kong.
I've tracked her here.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,527
- Where are we?
- Welcome home, Mr. Queen.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,687
- Did you learn all this in nine months?
- Malcolm's a good teacher.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,686
Did he teach you to cheat?

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,527
He said there's no such thing.
There's only survival and death.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,841
He's not wrong.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,489
This is good. What is it?

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,644
If I told you what it was,
you probably wouldn't eat it.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,564
Is it weird?
You know, being back here with me?

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,922
I've been back here before.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,564
You know, in a lot of ways,
this place reminds me of who I am.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,411
Or I guess who I've become.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,840
It's probably why Malcolm suggested
we train here.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,644
It's kind of cool that we're here.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,004
It's like there's really no more secrets
between us anymore.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,125
Yeah.

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,371
When you were here, did you ever think
you were gonna see us again?

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,450
Get home again?

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,922
Chien Na Wei touched ground
in Starling 24 hours ago.

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,205
We're trying to determine
how she made it into the country.

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,764
But we believe she's here to auction off
the Omega bioweapon to the highest bidder.

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,406
The Omega's inert without its counterpart.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,404
- Who's gonna pay for a useless super virus?
- Rogue nations.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,650
Terrorist groups who believe they can
replicate the Alpha component on their own.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,202
- Why does she have to sell it here?
- There's a corporate executive in town.

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,164
A man on the Triad's payroll.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,688
He's committed several acts
of industrial espionage over the years.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,966
His name is Peter Kang.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,571
Yeah, I know him.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,484
He works at my family's company.
That guy came to my house for Christmas.

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,406
And that, Mr. Queen, is exactly
why you and Mr. Yamashiro are still alive.

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,642
Chien Na Wei chose the one place
on earth...

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,162
...where your continued breathing is
still of use to me and my superior.

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,010
But have no illusions.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,285
If you threaten to compromise the mission
by contacting anyone in Starling City...

47
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,131
...I will remove you and Mr. Yamashiro
from the equation.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,484
Along with anyone
who discovers Oliver Queen is still alive.

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,041
Tracker's in place.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,641
Now what? Follow Kang to Chien Na Wei?

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,201
No, she's too smart
to keep the Omega on her person.

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,562
She'll keep it secure till the auction.

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,206
We need to figure out
where that auction's gonna be.

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,645
Kang's on the move.

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,282
Laurel, hey.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,721
What you having, sweetheart?
Next round's on me.

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,642
Your desk sergeant called
wondering why you weren't on duty.

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,925
Yeah. Well, this is Laurel.
You know, the daughter that lived.

59
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,851
Is there a bartender in the city
that doesn't know that?

60
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,884
Well, excuse me
for seeking a sympathetic ear.

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,011
Takes more than some fancy
corporate law-firm job...

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,210
...for some of us to get over Sara's death.

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,562
I love you, so I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that and drive you home.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,651
Not now, sweetie. Not now, please.
Hit me again, Frank.

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,523
Later, Frank.

66
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,964
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,210
Kang's headed inside.

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,210
A.R.G.U.S. detected data emanating
from Kang's computer.

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,402
But it's protected by SHACAL-4 encryption.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,927
- Okay, pretend like I don't know what that is.
- It means we can't hack into Kang's computer.

71
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,606
You'll need to get
onto the Queen Consolidated network.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,009
Waller was clear what would happen to
people if they found out I'm still alive.

73
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,091
So taking a stroll through my family's
company is probably not the best plan.

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,604
You'll go in at night. I don't have time to
familiarize myself with the office floor plans.

75
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,566
Oh, my God.

76
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,361
Who is that?

77
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,923
That's my sister.

78
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,529
Sara. Sara.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,082
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

80
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,362
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, why?

81
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,130
You kept saying Sara's name.

82
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,089
Oh. Um...

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,011
Yeah, well, I was... I was dreaming.

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,531
Why didn't you tell me?

85
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,003
- What?
- That Sara died.

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,328
Laurel told me.

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,130
Kind of by accident, but...

88
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,888
Well, I didn't want to upset you.

89
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,048
And Laurel didn't want...

90
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,965
...anyone to know.
Why?

91
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,886
After everything that
happened with Slade...

92
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,248
...Sara went back
to the League of Assassins.

93
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,806
She had her own secrets, Thea.

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,487
And, uh...

95
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,881
...those weren't my secrets to share.

96
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,401
Was it the League that killed her?

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,845
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna...

98
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,569
...take a walk and clear my head.

99
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,530
Slade.

100
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,407
Told myself I wasn't gonna
come down here.

101
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,649
That I never needed to see you again.

102
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,163
You'll be happy to know I was wrong.

103
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,524
You think I won't get out?

104
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,965
You think I wouldn't
kill those you care for?

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,403
I keep my promises, kid.

106
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,924
I keep my promises.

107
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,963
Thea.

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,327
Hey, the fire went out.

109
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,841
- Ollie, what is it?
- We need to get off the island.

110
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,162
- We're in danger.
- What are you talking about?

111
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,283
- Slade Wilson's here.
- That is ridiculous.

112
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,448
It's not. Just listen to me.

113
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,041
- Slade was...
- I was keeping him prisoner here.

114
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,930
What do you mean "was"?

115
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,488
- Hello, Oliver.
- You let him out.

116
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,882
You told me you lost your deal with Ra's...

117
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,811
...despite your willingness to kill him
because you hesitated.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,050
For you and Thea and even myself to have
any hope of surviving the next encounter...

119
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,251
...you need to regain that killer instinct
born of a primal need to survive.

120
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,010
You're sick.

121
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,128
Your sat phone is going to stop working
after this call.

122
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,806
Ollie.

123
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,001
Merlyn set Slade loose as an object lesson.

124
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,091
- That's insane.
- He thinks it'll help me regain my killer instinct.

125
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,163
- If he doesn't kill us first.
- Come on.

126
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,122
- Last time I saw her, she was in pigtails.
- Wait here, okay?

127
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,722
Where is she going?

128
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,810
Hi, Ollie, Dad.

129
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,886
I stopped by the office today.

130
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,765
I saw Morn talking to Walter.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,890
Starting to think
that something's happening there.

132
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,050
- But I don't know.
- Queenie.

133
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,929
Sister's boyfriend?

134
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,248
- I don't know.
- You have my delivery?

135
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,169
You have some of that inheritance?

136
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,801
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,890
- I was about to ask Jordan the same.
- Just paying my respects.

138
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,445
And so you did.

139
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,325
Now you're gonna stay away
from her permanently.

140
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,681
Whatever.

141
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,963
You should be bringing flowers here.
Not looking to score drugs.

142
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,850
What are you even doing here, Tommy?

143
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,526
I came to thank you for my birthday card.

144
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,290
And to tell you
that my party tonight's 21 and over.

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,687
Well, I think we both know that
that's not true.

146
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,922
Oh, it is, as far as you're concerned.

147
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,526
- You shouldn't grow up too fast.
- Yeah, well, you're not my brother.

148
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,250
You're right, no, I'm not,
but I think about him every single day.

149
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,364
For the first time, I'm glad he's gone.

150
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,921
Because seeing you like this
would break his heart.

151
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,211
It's funny how Ollie seems to care more about
me now that he's dead than when he was alive.

152
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,886
Every time I spoke to his grave,
it always felt so empty.

153
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,287
That's because he was here
watching over you.

154
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,970
Why did you bring me here?

155
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,171
He has something we need.

156
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,082
- I thought you were better with a bow.
- I am. It's for you. Just in case.

157
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,564
What is it?

158
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,483
He's been here.

159
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,685
Nice to see you again...

160
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,126
...Miss Queen.

161
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,087
- You okay?
- Yeah.

162
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,207
She's unhurt.

163
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,324
I have no desire to kill either of you.

164
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,286
This time tomorrow, two bodies
will be found in Starling City...

165
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,164
...burned beyond any recognition...

166
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,845
...but ample evidence...

167
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,523
...that Oliver and Thea Queen
have been killed in some horrible accident.

168
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,883
I'm gonna leave you, kid,
the same way you left me.

169
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,366
Alone in purgatory.

170
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,722
You leave me and you let my sister go.

171
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,251
You're lucky I didn't
bury her next to Shado.

172
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,327
Did he tell you about her?

173
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,081
Shado...

174
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,768
...is the reason why this is all happening.

175
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,371
Why I killed your mother.

176
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,647
He doesn't need to.

177
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,969
I figured out you're a sick son of a bitch
all on my own.

178
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,328
Well, of course he didn't tell you.

179
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,049
Your brother likes his secrets.

180
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,161
You always have.

181
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,406
That's who you are.

182
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,410
You know, if you'd told me
what really happened with Shado...

183
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,324
...your mother would still be alive.

184
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,488
- That's enough!
- I agree!

185
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,362
Welcome home, kid.

186
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,684
Slade.

187
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,927
Slade.

188
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,520
Slade!

189
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,042
Are you in position?

190
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,365
- Yeah.
- The company computers...

191
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,642
...are protected by biometric encryption.

192
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,365
Look for a fingerprint reader.

193
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,604
Okay, but why wouldn't they take me out
of the directory?

194
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,643
Why would they? You're dead.

195
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,370
Yeah, I'm in.

196
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,643
The crawler's programmed
to seek out all of Kang's network traffic.

197
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,524
And it's running.

198
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,530
The program should take 90 seconds.

199
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,410
What's that?

200
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,641
- Oliver, you have to go.
- I'm not done.

201
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,203
You have to go. Someone's coming.

202
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,608
You're cute.

203
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,968
It's too bad you're, you know, dead.

204
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,970
Which is obviously a lot worse for you
than it is for me.

205
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,048
I really need to learn...

206
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,846
...to stop talking to myself.

207
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,004
According to the information we took off
Kang's computer, the auction is tonight.

208
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,770
- In four hours.
- Where?

209
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,046
Still working on that.

210
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,483
The crawler program
retrieved 2.7 gigabytes of data.

211
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,247
- It's taking some time to cull through.
- You have less than four hours.

212
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,807
Where's Queen?

213
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,166
Probably went to check on our weapons.

214
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,642
You spin my head right round, right round

215
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,529
Oh.

216
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,411
- Pig.
- A little early.

217
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,767
H00. Uch.

218
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,524
Thanks, bud.

219
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,048
Yeah, no problem...

220
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,050
...bud.

221
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,725
Whoo.

222
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,730
Nothing like a rich kid's party
to remind me what I missed...

223
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,609
...about being shot at in Afghanistan.

224
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,485
When I hooked up my brother
with his first stateside job...

225
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,371
...I somehow expected more gratitude
and less complaining.

226
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,002
- Less complaining. You sound like Lyla.
- You should've never divorced her.

227
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,770
You big dummy.

228
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,170
Thank you, Andy. I appreciate that.

229
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,647
You spin my head right round, right round

230
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,646
When you go down, when you go down, down

231
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,327
You spin my head right round, right round

232
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,486
Do you like sushi?

233
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,251
Have you ever had anyone
eat some off of you?

234
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,125
I promise not to use chopsticks.

235
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,970
Are you still using that line?

236
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,808
- Well, it looks like I scared her off.
- Oh, it's all right. She's vegan anyway. Ha, ha.

237
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,681
What are you doing here? I heard you decided
to go corporate in San Francisco...

238
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,531
...instead of saving the
world in Starling City.

239
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,041
I realized that maybe the world
can't be saved.

240
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,766
- What is it?
- I just don't believe who's here.

241
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,490
Queen.

242
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,843
She's amazin', she's blazin'
Hotter than Cajun

243
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,849
Girl, won't you move a little closer?

244
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,091
I thought I told you this
party is 21 and over.

245
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,204
No worries, I came prepared. Fake ID.

246
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,651
Laurel, how are you?

247
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,291
I'm handling.

248
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,290
- How's school?
- Straight-A student.

249
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,083
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

250
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,726
Nonalcoholic, I swear.

251
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,166
Queenie.

252
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,041
- Isn't this past your bedtime?
- Maybe I need something to keep me awake.

253
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,366
You holding?

254
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,410
- Stay away from Thea Queen.
- Who the hell do you think...?

255
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,364
Holy crap.

256
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,007
You're Oliver Queen.
You're supposed to be dead.

257
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,370
People are gonna lose their minds.

258
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,686
Stay away from my sister.

259
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,210
How'd you like to be dead again?

260
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,448
How many people are in this prison?

261
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,610
You know, maybe there's somebody
we could call for help?

262
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,770
Well, Slade killed the guard.
There's one other inmate.

263
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,206
He's not gonna be helpful.

264
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,721
Then how are we supposed
to get out of here?

265
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,089
This is a Chinese prison retrofitted
by eight A.R.G.U.S. technicians.

266
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,964
There is no getting out of here.

267
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,767
So we're just supposed to sit here
and starve to death? That's your plan?

268
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,285
I am working on a plan.

269
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,409
- What did he mean?
- What?

270
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,683
Wilson, when he said that you were still
hiding something.

271
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,690
- He's insane.
- Yeah, I picked up on that.

272
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,645
I also picked up on how you reacted
when he said...

273
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,083
...that you were keeping secrets from me.

274
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,811
Was he telling the truth?

275
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,522
I don't think that this is the right time.

276
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,802
Actually, I think time is something
that we have a lot of right now.

277
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,847
- Why didn't you tell me about Sara?
- Come on, Thea.

278
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,045
Now that I know about your secret,
everything has become a whole lot clearer.

279
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,331
And I can tell when you're hiding
something from me.

280
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,369
Like you are doing right now.

281
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,084
So, what is it gonna take for you to stop
treating me like this tiny fragile little object?

282
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,886
Tiny?

283
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,201
What?

284
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,880
This prison. These...

285
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,242
...cells, they were made for men.

286
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,844
Fully grown men. Come here.

287
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,724
I can't... Never thought I would wish
for longer arms.

288
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,400
There's a way that we can do it.

289
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,961
But it's gonna hurt.

290
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,127
Just do it.

291
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,726
Okay.

292
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,406
On three. One.

293
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,410
Two. Three.

294
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,087
- You okay?
- I, uh...

295
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,764
All right.

296
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,201
That's good.

297
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,681
Come on.

298
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,526
Malcolm would've told Slade
about the plane we used.

299
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,370
That's how he plans to get back.

300
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,930
No, I didn't...

301
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,130
- Queen?
- What?

302
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,651
Anybody see who Peter Panned him?

303
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,486
Witnesses saw someone head upstairs
before it happened.

304
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,166
Male. White or Hispanic. Twenty to 30s.

305
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,081
That narrows it down.

306
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,927
Maybe it's a vigilante doing some
public service.

307
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,809
Heh. Sure.

308
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,606
- Thea, right?
- Yeah?

309
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,929
- Aren't you young to be at a party like this?
- I invited her.

310
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,567
Oh. Well, you spoiled billionaires sure
know how to throw yourselves a party.

311
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,169
You got underage girls, drug dealers.
You got dead drug dealers.

312
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,284
If I'd known, he never would
have made it past the front gate.

313
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,927
- We had a lot of crashers here tonight.
- Yeah, right. I can see that.

314
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,326
What are you doing here?

315
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,088
They asked us to stay and give statements.

316
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,489
- No. I mean at this douche bag's party.
- Tommy, I'm sorry.

317
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,848
Wow. You really have a thing
for rich bad boys.

318
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,405
You'd think one of them getting your sister
killed would have gotten you cured of that.

319
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,290
Dad.

320
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,051
What about you, sweetheart?

321
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,370
Funny, can't figure out if you're following
in your brother's footsteps or my daughter's.

322
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,046
- That is enough.
- Just observing how one boat trip...

323
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,284
- ...can turn everyone's life to crap.
- No, that is enough.

324
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,240
- We're not doing this.
- We're leaving. Right now.

325
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,846
Well, thank you for that.

326
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,526
- I'm sorry, was I embarrassing you?
- No.

327
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,564
- Yourself.
- At least I know who I am.

328
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,285
I'm not becoming someone I'm not.

329
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,966
Hanging around with billionaire playboys
like some gold digger.

330
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,481
Taking on a sellout job in San Francisco.

331
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,206
Is that what this is about?

332
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,681
When Sara died,
you wanted to go to law school...

333
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,690
...because you wanted
to make the world a better place.

334
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,402
Wethersby Posner is one of the most
prestigious firms in the country.

335
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,886
You wanted to help people.

336
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,888
All you'd be doing is helping fat cats.

337
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,721
This sermon would have a bit more credibility
if you weren't so lit right now.

338
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,005
Well, I don't need to be sober
to see what you're doing with your life.

339
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,527
I just wish you could too.

340
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,446
What were you thinking?

341
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,484
- Anyone at that party could have seen you.
- Yeah, I pulled...

342
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,489
...the hoodie down to cover my face.

343
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,206
That wouldn't work even if you
smeared greasepaint on your face.

344
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,761
So, what, you came to chastise me
at gunpoint?

345
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,088
We got the auction location
from the scraper program.

346
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,363
Kang is using a defunct factory
owned by your family's company.

347
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,771
I don't care. I'm done with the mission.

348
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,604
- Oliver.
- Coming back here, Maseo...

349
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,411
...has shown me all the wreckage
that I have left behind.

350
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,608
If I go with you tonight
and I get killed...

351
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,930
...then I lose any chance I've ever had
of fixing all of the things that I broke.

352
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,691
You don't have that chance.
Waller will kill your...

353
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,611
My family is resourceful.
We have connections in the media.

354
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,202
There has to be a way to shelter us
from whatever Waller does.

355
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,601
Look, Oliver, if you want redemption...

356
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,690
...start with the lives Chien Na Wei's
bio weapon could end.

357
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,331
These people are strangers to me.

358
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,449
These people...

359
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,564
...they're my friends and my family.

360
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,724
And they would be ashamed
of the selfish choice you're making.

361
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,843
They're already ashamed of me.

362
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,650
Good bye, Maseo.

363
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,248
Hey, wait. I think I found a path.

364
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,807
Thea. Stop!

365
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,607
Oh, my God.

366
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,286
- What the hell was that?
- It was a booby trap.

367
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,642
What kind of psycho
would put that thing there?

368
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,202
- Me.
- Oh, God.

369
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,602
Slade's gonna be at the plane.
We need to move.

370
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,882
No, we need to rest.
Just a few minutes, okay?

371
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,130
- Slade gets to...
- He will kill us if you end up passing out.

372
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,204
Okay, okay. Okay, a couple of minutes.

373
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,530
Why didn't you tell me about Sara?

374
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,287
Oh, come on.

375
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,881
Every time I bring her up,
you end up evading it.

376
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,761
Because this isn't the time.
We just need to focus.

377
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,331
Well, I'm not, okay?

378
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,171
Knowing that you're keeping something
from me again...

379
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,567
...it's keeping me everything
but focused right now.

380
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,521
- So tell me.
- Malcolm killed Sara.

381
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,328
No, no. He was in Corto Maltese
with me, okay?

382
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,085
He didn't kill her directly.

383
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,805
He used someone.

384
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,370
He put them under the influence of a drug.

385
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,128
So she wouldn't know what she was doing.

386
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,521
She?

387
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,810
She who?

388
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,090
You killed Sara.

389
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,970
Oh, God. Oh, God.

390
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,883
No, Sara... No, she...

391
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,127
She was my friend.

392
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,283
- How could you not tell me?
- Because you weren't you.

393
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,241
Oh, God.

394
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,201
You had no control over your actions.
You cannot blame yourself.

395
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,522
You were right about Malcolm, okay?

396
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,246
He doesn't love me.

397
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,930
- I'm an idiot.
- No, you're not.

398
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,766
This whole thing with Lian Yu.

399
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,329
This is ridiculous,
and what the hell are we even doing here?

400
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,647
I ask myself the very same question.

401
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,003
Over and over.

402
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,043
Slade.

403
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,931
Don't.

404
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,530
Oh, yeah.

405
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,006
You've come a long way.

406
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,523
I'm here to make good with my promise, kid.

407
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,650
Hello, Oliver.

408
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,164
Well, I told myself I was recording
this message in case I died suddenly but...

409
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,531
I wonder if it isn't just easier to say
what I have to say with a video camera.

410
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,643
I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.

411
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,167
I didn't save our city. I failed it.

412
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,445
I did something terrible,
and in my efforts to make it right...

413
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,163
...I ignored my conscience
and made alliances with terrible people.

414
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,408
There's a book.

415
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,490
Book with a list of all their names.
And with these people...

416
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,490
I always told myself
that everything I did...

417
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,922
...I did for my family.

418
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,731
That's a lie.

419
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,526
Because what good is a family...

420
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,051
...without a soul?

421
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,561
You can right my wrongs.

422
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,925
You...

423
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,441
...can be better than I was.

424
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,483
You can save this city.

425
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,925
I love you.

426
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,769
Thank you all for coming.
I promise that for one of you...

427
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,530
...it'll be well worth your time.

428
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,931
You've read the briefing.

429
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,283
With the proper resources...

430
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,967
...you can own...

431
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,083
...Armageddon.

432
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,685
The bidding will begin at $50 million.

433
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,601
Fifty-five?

434
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,722
Do I hear 60?

435
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,843
I have $60 million.

436
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,809
Going once.

437
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,929
Going twice.

438
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,246
Ninety million.

439
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,807
Anyone care to make it an even hundred?

440
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,684
Just a moment.

441
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,965
I don't like uninvited guests.

442
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,729
I'm sorry I'm late.

443
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,366
Actually, you arrived right on time.

444
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,926
Let's go.

445
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,841
Make the call.

446
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,445
Find me the Yamashiros.

447
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,971
They die tonight.

448
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,965
You have a choice to make.

449
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,642
- What choice?
- Whether or not you wanna keep your hand.

450
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,687
- Come on, then. You've earned it.
- Thea, don't.

451
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,447
- He killed Morn.
- And he will continue to pay for his crimes.

452
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,802
But not like this.

453
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,200
You're not a killer.

454
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,927
- You tell that to Sara.
- What happened to Sara is not on you.

455
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,009
What happens to him is.

456
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,769
All this is what Malcolm wanted.

457
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,291
He freed Slade...

458
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,000
...to prove that we're killers
because he wants you...

459
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,725
...to be just like him.

460
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,803
You gotta prove to him that you're not.

461
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,927
A flesh wound.

462
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,446
You're clearly not the killer
that your brother is, Thea.

463
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,731
Yeah, I wish that were true.

464
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,045
- She's lost, your sister.
- No, she's not.

465
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,121
You can see it in her eyes.

466
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,243
She's been touched by darkness.

467
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,530
Was it Merlyn?

468
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,451
He's an interesting man to do that
to his own daughter.

469
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,405
So now you've lost your father...

470
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,446
...your mother and now your little sister.

471
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,085
How's the girl with the glasses?

472
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,529
What's her name? Felicity.

473
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,967
How many people can Oliver Queen lose...

474
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,209
...before there is no more Oliver Queen?

475
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,849
Thanks for the trip home.
Have a nice flight back to Hong Kong.

476
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,566
I'm afraid it's not that simple, Mr. Queen.

477
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,683
The hell it's not. You have the Omega.

478
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,565
You have Chien Na Wei. It's over.

479
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,731
I'm sorry to say
that's not up to either one of us.

480
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,130
This him?

481
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,768
General Matthew Shrieve.

482
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,648
You've done your country
quite a service today, Mr. Queen.

483
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,164
That said, I've got some news
you're not gonna wanna hear.

484
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,687
Well, general, I'm used to that by now.

485
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,809
We're gonna need to debrief you.

486
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,491
Back in China.

487
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,407
But once that's accomplished...

488
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,080
...and the Omega secured...

489
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,204
...I'll make sure you go any place
in the world you wanna go.

490
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,326
Sound fair?

491
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,407
Yeah.

492
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,409
Tommy Merlyn.

493
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,051
Are you stalking me?

494
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,924
Just checking on you.

495
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,602
Things with your father seemed, uh...
They seemed tense.

496
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,446
Your roommate told me you were taking
a job here. I said that couldn't be true.

497
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,927
That you were going to work
for a white-shoe firm.

498
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,324
Ah. I Was.

499
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,524
Then someone reminded me
why I became a lawyer in the first place.

500
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,363
You wanna tell me about it over dinner?

501
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,090
Hey-eY'eY-.

502
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,322
It is just dinner.

503
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,844
How many girls have you used
those three little words with?

504
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,089
Those are the only three
little words I say.

505
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,520
Fine. Just dinner.

506
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,644
- Let's go.
- Maybe drinks?

507
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,807
- Maybe.
- Okay.

508
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,441
Dad.

509
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,126
- I didn't know that you were gonna be here.
- Where else would I be?

510
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,808
Gotta figure out a way
to tell your mom about this.

511
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,891
Um...

512
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,450
She already knows.

513
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,202
You weren't worried
about her heart giving out.

514
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,771
If you were gonna drink that,
you would have done it by now.

515
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,962
Really?

516
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,569
What, you gonna go get your mask and your
billy club and take it away from me, huh?

517
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,285
- Black Canary.
- Dad.

518
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,847
When does your shift start?
Shouldn't you be running around?

519
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,127
H9)'-

520
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,403
Do you remember when I was gonna take
that corporate job?

521
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,931
You remember what you said?

522
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,561
You were mad because I wasn't choosing a
life where I was going to help people.

523
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,970
It's like you knew...

524
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,401
...already, even then.

525
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,689
You knew that my life was always headed
towards that mask.

526
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,531
You think that's what
I'm all torn up about?

527
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,326
The reason why I wanna
open up this bottle...

528
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,364
...I wanna crawl inside,
is because of what you did to us.

529
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,609
I love your sister, I love your mom.

530
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,929
So much like each other, you know,
these wild spirits.

531
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,642
But you and I, we had something.
Because we were the ones who were alike.

532
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,845
And we had a trust, we had a bond,
and you broke it.

533
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,128
And, I don't know...

534
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,129
...how you could do that to us.

535
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,800
But I'm gonna survive this.

536
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,650
And what I got is my baby girl.

537
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,729
What you've done...

538
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,328
I don't know how I'm gonna live
through this.

539
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,246
- Daddy, I think we should go to a meeting.
- Yeah.

540
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,731
I'll go to the one on Broxton.

541
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,251
You go to the one on Fourth.

542
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,166
I need a shower.

543
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,761
I need 1O showers.

544
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,842
- Thea.
- I'm fine.

545
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,203
I would be really, really worried
if that were true.

546
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,568
What do you wanna hear?

547
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,930
Nothing.

548
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,850
And I don't want you to tell anyone
about this, especially Laurel.

549
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,407
And why is that?

550
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,730
Because she loves you like a sister,
and it would hurt the both of you too much.

551
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,845
Does she know about Malcolm?

552
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,565
No.

553
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,525
No, that would complicate things...

554
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,891
...and despite everything
that he has done...

555
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,966
...we still need him.

556
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,611
I agree.

557
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,203
I guess A.R.G.U.S. is looking for a few
guards to volunteer for island duty.

558
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,405
You almost got us killed.

559
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,650
I had more faith in you and my daughter
than you obviously have for yourselves.

560
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,561
- How could you do that?
- To challenge you, see if you both could work...

561
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,603
How could you make me kill a friend?

562
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,203
He should not have told you that.

563
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,731
I trusted you.

564
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,207
I let you into my life.

565
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,049
How could you have done this to me?

566
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,686
Because you are my daughter
and I care about you.

567
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,961
God, that's sick.

568
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,924
And not even remotely true.

569
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,602
You do not understand the danger we face
from Ra's al Ghul.

570
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,327
Just stop. Stop using him as an excuse.

571
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,850
The only person that I'm afraid of
right now is you.

572
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,963
- Please do not do this.
- Just stop.

573
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,970
I will work with you to stop Ra's.

574
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,771
Because that's what my brother says
we need to do.

575
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,964
So I will be your student.

576
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,282
I'll be your partner.

577
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,329
Even if I have to, I will be your soldier.

578
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,963
But never again will I be your daughter.
