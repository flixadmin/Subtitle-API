00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:55,056
So, there is no room for error.
Got it?

43
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:56,808
Si, boss.

00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,979

49
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:11,907
Looka! Looka! Oh!

50
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:14,451
Yummos!

51
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:15,952
Come here, come here.

52
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:19,456
Ah.

53
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,124
Pusha. Pusha.

54
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,168
Ah...

55
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:26,087
-Helpa. Ah, helpa.
-Ah.

Ah. Oh, helpa.

57
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:31,676
Kids can be so cruel,

58
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:34,095
but Maxime can be even crueler!

59
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,018
Oh!

60
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,353
Well, well, well.

61
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:42,729
Look who it is.

62
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:45,690
If it isn't Gru-ser the Loser.

63
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:48,318
Well, if it isn't Maxime Le Mal.

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,486
You look...

65
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,112
Magnificent?

66
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:52,322
Yes, I know.

67
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:54,366
What did you think, huh?
I was going to look

68
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,494
like a bald loser
with a dad bod?

69
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,579
Oops, looks like
you beat me to it, no?

70
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:01,915
Well, that's not...

71
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:05,126
Ooh!

72
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:06,461
Oh.

73
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,129
It's good to laugh, no?

74
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:12,842
Anyway, you remember
my girlfriend, Valentina?

75
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:15,971
She was captain of
the Femme Fatales cheer squad

76
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:19,558
and the most popular girl
in school, huh?

77
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,351
I remember.

78
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,395
Good to see you, Valentina.

79
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:28,066
What happened, Gru?

80
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:31,194
All your dreams of becoming
a famous villain,

81
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:32,654
they go poof-poof, huh?

82
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,782
Well, I don't know if you know,

83
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:38,201
but I did manage
to steal the moon.

84
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,327
Really?

85
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:41,413
You mean that moon?

86
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:45,667
Is this on?

87
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,086
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

88
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:52,924
Good evening, and welcome,
Lycee Pas Bon alumni.

89
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:56,136
Now, we're going to kick off
the festivities

90
00:04:56,177 --> 00:05:00,223
by announcing the winner
of our most coveted award,

91
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:02,350
the Golden Alumni.

92
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:07,147
And so, without further ado,

93
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:13,028
the winner of this year's
Golden Alumni is, uh...

94
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,532
oh, my favorite student,
Maxime Le Mal!

95
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,200
-What? What?
-Oh, thank you.

96
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:20,535
Are you kidding me?

97
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,412
Thank you. Merci.
Merci beaucoup.

98
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:23,747
Mais non, you don't have to.

99
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:31,630
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.
-♪ You're unbelievable. ♪

100
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,922
Thank you.

101
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,758
I'm sure you all know
that I have

102
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,802
something very big in the works.

103
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:39,679
Now, some of you laughed

104
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,599
at my childhood obsession
with cockroaches.

105
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,601
But I quickly learned

106
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,270
that they are a miracle
of evolution.

107
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,109
And I have found a way
to harness the strength

108
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,987
and the speed and the--
what is the word?--

109
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:59,574
unsquishability of
the most powerful creature

110
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:01,117
on the planet.

111
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:06,373
Which makes me indestructible
and unstoppable!

112
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:07,457
Maxime!

113
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,751
Maxime! Maxime!

114
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:14,089
Behold, the power
of the cockroach!

115
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,726
Oh!

116
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:29,145
Ah.

117
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:34,567
Ah.

118
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,322
Aah, aah! Stop! Oh, oh, stoppa!

119
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,616
Aah! Stoppa!

120
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:43,618
So, my sad little friend,

121
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,745
what do you say about that, huh?

122
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:49,833
Well, I'd say
you're under arrest,

123
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,919
courtesy of
the Anti-Villain League.

124
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,755
Oh, I don't think so, mon ami.

125
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:57,507
Oh, yeah? Goop Grenade!

126
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:10,812
Move in.

127
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:12,480
-AVL!
-Stay where you are!

128
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,565
Move, move, move!

129
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:25,535
Stay there!

130
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,912
Freeze!

131
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,670
Gotcha.

132
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:37,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!

133
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,590
This is not happening.

134
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:40,550
C'est impossible.

135
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,218
Get your hands off of me!

136
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,721
I...
I am commanding you to let...

137
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,599
So long, Maxime.

138
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,601
Who's the loser now?

139
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:50,727
Loser!

140
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,604
Loser! Loser!

141
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,532
This is not over!

142
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,744
You won't always have the AVL

143
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:09,329
to fight your battles,
you coward.

144
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,749
Mark my words,
I will exterminate you!

145
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,835
What?

146
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,758
Not, uh... not scary at all.

147
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:40,068
Hello, everybody.

148
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:41,903
-Gru, what's up?
-Hey, Gru!

149
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:43,863
-Hey, Gru.
-I'm so happy you're here!

150
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:45,949
What's shaking in the Gru house?

151
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,117
Look what I taught Lucky.

152
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,829
Lucky, sit.

153
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,667
Aw, Lucky. I said "sit."

154
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:02,131
Well, it is only
his first lesson.

155
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,676
Uh, maybe we practice outside
from now on.

156
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:07,053
There's my favorite husband.

157
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,097
Did you remember
to get the milk?

158
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:11,057
Well, yes. They had a few kinds.

159
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,434
They got the almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk,

160
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:16,646
oat milk, goat milk,
chocolate milk, half-and-half,

161
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:18,982
powdered and of magnesia.

162
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:21,192
What about regular milk?

163
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,570
Uh, they don't make that
anymore.

164
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:24,779
Oh.

165
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:26,364
Wait a minute.

166
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:29,158
One, two, three girls.

167
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,368
One wife.

168
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,996
Something is missing.

169
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:36,165
No, I think that's
all of us, yeah.

170
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,877
You know what,
I keep forgetting-- this guy!

171
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:42,755
Oh!

172
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:43,882
There's my boy!

173
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:45,967
There he is.

174
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,802
A-coochie-coochie-
coochie-coochie.

175
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:50,805
Where is Daddy's hug?

176
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,016
Oh, looks like somebody's
a little cranky.

177
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:56,561
Behind that sourpuss,

178
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,063
I know you love your dada!

179
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,524
Go on, say it. "Dada."

180
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,151
"Dada."

181
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:04,611
Yes, of course he loves you.

182
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:07,864
He just... he just doesn't
show it on his face.

183
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,324
Or with his body language.

184
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:11,910
Right, Gru Jr.? Come on.

185
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,037
Show Daddy
how much you love him.

186
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,665
Oh, I know what
will make you happy.

187
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:20,001
Mmm. Bahama Medley.

188
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,088
No?

189
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,674
It's from the Bahamas--
all of them.

190
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:29,969
Look. Oh, so yummy.

191
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:31,304
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

192
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:36,893
Oh, that really tastes
like the Bahamas.

193
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,895
See? He loves his daddy.

194
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,980
He's sharing.

195
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,984
Phil, Ralph, Ron.

196
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,430
Thanks, guys.

197
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,101
Ramsbottom?

198
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,812
"Bottom."

199
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:22,772
I need a word with you both.

200
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,232
-Sure, but what...
-I'm sorry,

201
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:25,650
there's no time for chitchat.

202
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:29,028
Maxime Le Mal has sent you
a message from prison.

203
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,323
Bonjour, Gru.

204
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:34,784
I know you can hear me,
so hear this.

205
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:39,038
You think you can humiliate me
and get away with it, yes?

206
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,290
But no!
When I break out of prison,

207
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,376
I'm coming for my revenge, Gru,

208
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:46,754
but this time,
I won't go so easy on you.

209
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,133
And I know where you live,

210
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,176
so you'd better sleep
with one eye open,

211
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:54,929
'cause you can't hide from me.

212
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,681
Sweet dreams, Gru-ser!

213
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:01,602
Don't worry,
he can't get out of there.

214
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:04,272
It's a maximum security prison.

215
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:06,190
Ah, yes, well, um...

216
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:08,359
he escaped yesterday.

217
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:09,527
What?!

218
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:11,070
Leave our home?

219
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:12,739
Oh, no, you're gonna love it.

220
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,323
It's-it's called the safe house,

221
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,242
and it's fun, and it's safe,

222
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:18,369
and it's fantastic,
and we're going.

223
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:20,955
Yeah, you'll get a new room,
go to a new school.

224
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:22,498
That'll be fun, right?

225
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,125
Everything's gonna be new.
We love new.

226
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,169
What about all my friends?

227
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,755
You'll make new friends,
probably better ones.

228
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:33,009
-I can't believe this.
-Yes, yes.

229
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,761
Lot of emotions,
big life change.

230
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:36,179
Less talking, more walking.

231
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,972
Come on. Here we go.

232
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:50,693
I'm sorry you can't go with us,
Lucky.

233
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,698
Take good care of him.

234
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:58,242
Be good, Lucky.

235
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:01,871
Don't forget to practice
your tricks.

236
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,753
We'll arrive at the AVL
safe house in a few hours.

237
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,880
Mayflower is a lovely town.

238
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,382
A lovely, safe, boring town.

239
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,259
Trust me,
it is for the best, Gru.

240
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:16,969
And what about Grandma?

241
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:18,471
And Uncle Dru?

242
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:21,557
I'm sorry, no one can know
of your whereabouts.

243
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,600
Not even family.

244
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:24,685
Bingo,
there's your silver lining.

245
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,480
And you promise to take care
of the other Minions?

246
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:30,775
They'll be safe and sound
at AVL headquarters.

247
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,902
I have big plans for them.

248
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,780
Good luck with that.

249
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,327

250

00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:56,259
That is it!

253
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,477
Quiet!

254
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:11,107
You are now on Carl's bus.

255
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,485
And Carl is
a longtime AVL employee

256
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,321
whose retirement benefits
are almost vested,

257
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:20,449
so while on Carl's bus,

258
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,618
you follow Carl's rules.

259
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,039
No shenanigans, no antics
and no tomfoolery.

260
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,624
Tom?

261
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,460
So this ends now,
or you're gonna see

262
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:35,131
a side of Carl
you do not want to see.

263
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,217
Do I make myself clear?!

264
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:39,594

00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,272
Watch your hands.
What are you doing?

268
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,357

271
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:02,283
Here we are,
the town of Mayflower.

272
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:03,492
The safe house has been used

273
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:06,329
to protect our agents
for decades now.

274
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,247
Oh, look at that place.

275
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:10,708
Wow, look at these lawns,
the flowers.

276
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,085
Whoa, that is cool!

277
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:14,378
Are we really gonna live here?

278
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,255
-Look at that fountain!
-Whoa.

279
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:18,299
Awesome.

280
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:19,800
Oh, is that one ours?

281
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:21,969
-Uh, uh, looka.
-Whoa! -Look at that!

282
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,471
Oh, that's pretty!

283
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,556
I could get used to this.

284
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,354
Ooh, it looks like
a princess lives there!

285
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:33,814
And here it is.

286
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:37,318
Your new home.

287
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,824
Oh.

288
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,534
Hmm. No fountain.

289
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,870
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

290
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,580
Come on.

291
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:04,470
Wow, it's so...
cold and uninviting.

292
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,013
But in a homey kind of way.

293
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:07,306
What?

294
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:10,434
Yes, everything here
is AVL standard.

295
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:11,811
What it lacks in comfort,

296
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,938
it more than makes up for
in functionality.

297
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,775
Th-There's even a fully
automated lockdown mode.

298
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:19,235
Isn't that fun?

299
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,320
Ooh, full lockdown mode.

300
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:22,655
Yay.

301
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:24,907
It has a vending machine!

302
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:28,411
I love this place!

303
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:34,667
Uh, uh, looka.

304
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,463
This will be great.

305
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:41,257
All right, now down to business.

306
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,261
For your own safety, you'll all
be assuming new identities.

307
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,722
New identities?
Is that really necessary?

308
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:49,765
It's not up for debate, Gru.

309
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,601
Now, you are
a solar panel salesman.

310
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:55,980
Lucy, you're a hair stylist
at an upscale salon.

311
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:58,149
A hair stylist?

312
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,775
Yes! Jackpot!

313
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,736
Silas, did you choose that
because you knew

314
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:04,780
I cut my own hair and that
I would totally rock at this?

315
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,907
No.

316
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,451
"Chet Cunningham."

317
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:11,287
Da, that's got
a nice ring to it.

318
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,496
Girls.

319
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,998
Cool.

320
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,791
I'm Blair.

321
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,126
Britney?

322
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:18,669
My name is Bree?

323
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,088
Oh, come on. There are
worse names than Bree.

324
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,090
Yeah, like Blanche.

325
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:24,633
Yes, Margo.

326
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:27,053
Blanche?
Oh, that is a terrible name.

327
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:30,681
Imagine being named Blanche.

328
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,309
Truly, I cannot think
of a worse...

329
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,144
My name's Blanche, isn't it?

330
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:36,437
Yup.

331
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,064
Well, I'll get used to it.

332
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:41,484
Well, why don't you girls go
and pick out your rooms

333
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,861
while I have a word
with your parents?

334
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:48,240
Yes, I-I didn't want
to frighten the girls,

335
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:49,825
but it is absolutely crucial

336
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:52,161
you keep your true identities
under wraps.

337
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:56,457
Gru, you're going to have
to try to not be so Gru-ish.

338
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,042
What is that supposed to mean?

339
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:01,629
Well, I'm just saying you tend
to stand out in a crowd.

340
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,631
That's all. You know, you, uh...

341
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,966
Like the way you're always
cranky and irritable

342
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:08,427
and, uh, how you make things
a bit awkward

343
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:10,012
for everyone around you.

344
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,639
You do do that.

345
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,641
-I mean, you, you know, you...
-Okay, enough.

346
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,519
I don't make people awkward
or uncomfortable.

347
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,562
I'm very comforting.

348
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:20,564
Like a nice meat loaf.

349
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm pretty delicious.

350
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:27,863
This is not awkward.

351
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,657
You're the ones
who are making it awkward.

352
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:31,784
Gru, you have to blend in.

353
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:33,911
Your family's lives
are at stake.

354
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:35,287
You understand?

355
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,997
Of course. Yes.
Fully understand.

356
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,834
We would do anything to keep
our family safe. Yeah.

357
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,421
Right, well, I'll be in contact
when this is all over.

358
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:46,298
Until then,
capturing Maxime Le Mal

359
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,759
is our top priority.

360
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,429
Stay safe.

361
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,850
You know what, Gru?
Maybe this isn't so bad.

362
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:58,227
We need a break
from chasing down villains

363
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,521
and dangerous missions, right?

364
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:02,857
We can actually be
a normal family for once.

365
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:05,484
And I can finally spend

366
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:08,362
some little bonding time
with the baby.

367
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,865
It's gonna be great, right, pal?

368
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,867
Who's got your nose?
Who's got...

369
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:15,828
Aah! He's got my nose!

370
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:18,414
Quite the grip there.

371
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:19,790
The kid is strong.

372
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:30,968

to everyone who helped me
break out of AVL prison.

385
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,319
Todd and Linda, where are you?
Where are you?

386
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,779
Yes. For distracting the guards.

387
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,323
Oh, très magnifique.

388
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:36,992
Now, silence!

389
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:40,412
We must make Gru suffer
for arresting me.

390
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:45,125
And what better way
than to take away from him

391
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,002
his precious little baby?

392
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,505
Oh, I want to take that baby!

393
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,385
-Oh, Maxime.
-No, no, wait, wait.

394
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,678
Not Maxime.

395
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:58,847
What if I start going
by Cockroach Man?

396
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:01,850
Huh? Little on the nose,
but it is very clear, huh?

397
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:03,519
It's good, no?

398
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,771
I'm not calling you
that stupid name,

399
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:08,357
but I love this evil plan.

400
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:09,942
Well, Gru has it coming.

401
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:12,861
He humiliated me
in front of the whole school.

402
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:16,073
I had my trophy and everything.

403
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:19,451
But now the game begins!

404
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:21,537
He runs and hides
like the mouse,

405
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,915
and we find him like the cat!

406
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,917
Game on.

407
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,464
Stoppa. Stoppa.

408
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:35,384

409
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,805

Britney.

415
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,735
Wait.

416
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:55,446
I can't say my name is Britney.

417
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:57,323
That would be a lie.

418
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:58,741
Yes.

419
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:01,410
But we aren't "stupposed"
to lie.

420
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:03,078
Don't think of it as lying.

421
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,623
Think of it as
high-stakes pretending.

422
00:22:05,664 --> 00:22:07,791
Well, I'm not going to.

423
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,836
-Ah, just a little white lie.
-Nope.

424
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:14,089
Agnes, as your father,
I command you to lie.

425
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:14,840
No.

426
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:16,884
-Yes, lie.
-Mm-mm.

427
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:19,970
You are walking on thin ice,
little lady.

428
00:22:20,012 --> 00:22:20,846
Hmph.

429
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:24,767
Why can't you be more like
your sister Edith?

430
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:26,644
She lies all the time.

431
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:28,771
-No, I don't.
-See? See?

432
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:30,481
She's lying right now.

433
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:31,732
Beautifully, I might add.

434
00:22:31,774 --> 00:22:33,067
Okay, you guys.

435
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,943
This is our first big day
in Mayflower,

436
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:37,446
and I say we make it
a great one.

437
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:39,073
Right, Chet Jr.?

438
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:40,699
Woo-hoo! Mayflower!

439
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:42,493
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

440
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:44,036
We're gonna be late for karate.

441
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,788
-And you have to get Margo
to school. -Ah.

442
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:47,581
It's gonna be awesome.

443
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:49,083
-Yay.
-Hey.

444
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:52,544
You just have to put yourself
out there, and I promise,

445
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,838
Mayflower will love
Chet Cunningham.

446
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,216
Well, they're gonna love him
just as much as I do.

447
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:58,592
Mm.

448
00:22:58,634 --> 00:22:59,968
And you, little man,
are gonna have

449
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,720
so much fun
with your daddy today.

450
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,600
Yep, just you and Dada.

451
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:08,602
Come on, say it. "Dada."

452
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:10,938
"Dada."

453
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:16,402
Gonna be a fun day.

454
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,672
Okay.

455
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,470
Thanks a lot, guys.

456
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,810
All right.

457
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:51,770
-Thanks, hon. Bye.
-Bye.

458
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:54,440
Look, Margo. Neighbors.

459
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:56,191
Hello!

460
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,484
Hmm?

461
00:23:57,526 --> 00:23:58,610
Come on.

462
00:23:58,652 --> 00:24:00,446
You got this, Chet.

463
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:05,451
I'm your new neighbor,
Chet Cunningham.

464
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:07,035
Uh-huh. Perry Prescott.

465
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:11,498
So, what, uh, brings you
to the neighborhood, Chet?

466
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,917
Well, uh...

467
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,794
Solar panels.

468
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:18,839
That's it. I sell solar panels.

469
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:21,550
Have you joined
the solar revolution?

470
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,385
Yeah, no.

471
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:25,387
Uh, I think I'm good.

472
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:26,555
Good to know.

473
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,390
So, uh, what do you do, Perry?

474
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:30,100
I own Prescott Motors,

475
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:33,812
the largest auto dealer
in the state.

476
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:36,440
Wow. That's impressive.

477
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:38,484
This is my daughter Margo.

478
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:39,693
Bree, Dad.

479
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:41,570
Ah, yes.

480
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,238
Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

481
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,657
It's funny because
I was thinking...

482
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,075
I was thinking about a fish

483
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:49,244
I once had as a pet named Margo,

484
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:53,707
who lived in the pond
and, uh, then died.

485
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,212
Anyway, I, uh...

486
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:02,049
I am about to take Bree
to school for her first day.

487
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,427
Yeah, I was about to take Poppy
to school, so...

488
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,513
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

489
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,556
That's a fun name to say.

490
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:11,391
You want to carpool with us?

491
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:12,851
No.

492
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:14,812
You can be friends with Bree.

493
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:16,104
Right, Bree?

494
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:18,649
You don't have any friends.

495
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:24,238
Well, love the chitchat, Chet,
but she's got school,

496
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:27,157
and I'm meeting some pals
over at the country club, so...

497
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,159
Ooh, country club.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

498
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,495
If I were ever invited
to a country club,

499
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:35,874
I am sure
that I would love it.

500
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,961
Yeah, well, we really
have to get going,

501
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:40,462
so nice meeting you, Chet.

502
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:42,297
♪ I'm too sexy... ♪

503
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,841
Okay, cool.

504
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:47,928
Anytime you want to hang out,
just hit me up with a text.

505
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,888
He's gonna text me.

506
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,015
That was painful.

507
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:59,231
You'll see, by lunchtime,
you will have forgotten

508
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:01,984
all about your old,
lousy friends.

509
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:04,862
Mm, not so sure about that.

510
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,665
Hey, honey, you got this.

511
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,834
You are smart. You are funny.

512
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:20,878
What's there to worry about,
right?

513
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:23,463
They're gonna love you.

514
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:26,258
Thanks, Gru.

515
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:29,469
Buh-bye.

516
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:33,515
Oh, please let them love you.

517
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:40,397
Hey, Poppy.

518
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,320
Uh...

519
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,032
Move it!

520
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:51,700
Sorry. My bad.

521
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:55,162
I'm going. All right, I'm going.

522
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:58,290
Ooh. Glassos.

523
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:29,196
All right, gentlemen, fall in.

524
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,075
Some of you may be wondering
why you're here.

525
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:34,910
-Uh...
-Si.

526
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:36,912
As you may or may not know,

527
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,455
I was recently called out
of retirement

528
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:41,625
to head up the AVL's
new top secret initiative

529
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,002
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

530
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:45,921
And that's where you come in.

531
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:47,589
We need volunteers.

532
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:51,802
We are looking for the strong,
the mighty...

533
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:53,053
-Oh.
-Uh...

534
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:54,388
-...the fearless.
-Uh, nope.

535
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:57,099
-We need the best of the best.
-Uh...

536
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,102
So, who's it going to be?

537
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:04,231
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

538
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:06,441
Uh, blumach.

539
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:09,319
The AVL is known

540
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,613
for cutting-edge weapons
and vehicles,

541
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:14,658
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents,

542
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,954
and I can think of no better
guinea pigs than you.

543
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,580
Guinea pig! Yeah!

544
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:25,043
You will be the first
to test our Super-serum,

545
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,546
designed to transform you
into elite agents

546
00:28:27,587 --> 00:28:32,342
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal man.

547
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:35,929
Or you might just explode.

548
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:37,723
We don't really know.

549
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:39,057
Uh, uh, huh?

550
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,479
Ah...

551
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:23,435
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Mega Minions.

552
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,153
Cool!

553
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:35,363
Aw, you guys look adorable.

554
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:37,491
And-and really tough
and-and scary.

555
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,868
I'll look even better
when I have a black belt.

556
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,369
Hi-yah!

557
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:44,206
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break
a brick with my head.

558
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:46,416
That's the spirit. Oh!

559
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,878
Oh, okay, now, go have fun
while I'm at work.

560
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,881
Blair and Britney, right?

561
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:54,591
-Mm...
-We will!

562
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,384
Okay. Bye, Mom.

563
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:57,844
Bye!

564
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:58,970
Gotcha.

565
00:29:59,012 --> 00:30:00,722
Hi-yah!

566
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:02,474
Circle up, people.

567
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:07,354
Show respect for your sensei.

568
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:10,565
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan!

569
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,359
Hai!

570
00:30:15,862 --> 00:30:19,157
You, Moscovitch, didn't I
tell you to cut that hair?

571
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,909
You look like a sheepdog.

572
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,327
Sorry, Sensei.

573
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:25,872
Now, we have
two new students today

574
00:30:25,914 --> 00:30:30,919
ready to begin their journey--
hi-yah!-- to awesomeness.

575
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:33,255
You, tiny girl.

576
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:35,632
Step forward
and tell us your name.

577
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:37,175
Um...

578
00:30:37,217 --> 00:30:39,469
It's Britney.

579
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:40,971
Uh...

580
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:43,265
m-my name?

581
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,268
I can't...

582
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:48,937
There's no "can't" in karate.

583
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,314
Ten push-ups after class!

584
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:53,275
Hey, that's not fair.

585
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:58,113
You better not be talking back
to your sensei.

586
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:03,618
Now, are you ready to tell us
your name and participate?

587
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,620
Mm...

588
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:07,289
I guess not.

589
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,291
Then why don't you go sit

590
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:11,710
in the corner
of disgrace and reflection

591
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,754
and think about what kind
of person you want to be?

592
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:23,638
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

593
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,348
Yeah, probably.

594
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,683
Excuse me?

595
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:29,352
If you think I'm above
fighting children,

596
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:32,272
you picked the wrong dojo.

597
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:50,874
That was for my sister.

598
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:56,796
You broke my pinkie toe.

599
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:01,176
That's gonna be
a lot of push-ups.

600
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,512
Okay, put this over here.

601
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:05,639
Hair gel.

602
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,140
-Hairspray.
-Oh, uh, Mrs. Cunningham.

603
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:09,184
Oh, yeah, uh, yeah? Uh, um, hi.

604
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:12,187
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

605
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,105
Well, what can I say?

606
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:15,523
I'm good at what I do.

607
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:18,526
Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

608
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:21,029
Lot of vain, demanding divas
in this town.

609
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:26,243
I have a hair emergency, people.

610
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:30,038
Where's what's-her-name?
Remy? Rhonda?

611
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,915
Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

612
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:33,291
Rachel's on maternity leave.

613
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,877
What?! Oh, that is unacceptable.

614
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,049
But you are in luck, because
Blanche here is fantastic.

615
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:43,426
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

616
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:46,304
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

617
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,223
♪ Let's go! ♪

618
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:53,895
So, Melora,
what are we thinking?

619
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,940
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

620
00:32:56,982 --> 00:32:59,526
Let nature do
its "thang," you know?

621
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:02,237
No, no, no, no,
that style is dead to me.

622
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,031
It's-it's time for
a whole new Melora.

623
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:07,200
I want this.

624
00:33:07,242 --> 00:33:09,077
Wow.

625
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,454
Wow. Um...

626
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:15,417
Okay. Let's start with color.

627
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,295
Yes, color, 'cause that's
what you start with.

628
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:22,132
A little of this.

629
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:23,925
Some of that.

630
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,343
And, ooh, that's pretty.

631
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:27,012
This isn't so hard.

632
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:30,849
Uh...

633
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:36,646
What?

634
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:39,774
Should it be smoking?

635
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:41,067
Yes, uh-huh.

636
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:42,902
Smoking means it's working.

637
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:52,495
What's going on?

638
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:54,581
Perfect. No one panic.

639
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:56,875
Call 911!

640
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:04,007
Quickly, quickly.

641
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:06,092
Oh.

642
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:07,844
Wonder where they're going.

643
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:13,016
Voilà.

644
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:14,684
My latest creation.

645
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:18,271
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

646
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:19,773
Ay, I love it.

647
00:34:19,814 --> 00:34:21,858
Oh, and look at
the little antenna.

648
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,859
That's so cute.

649
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:24,861
It's not supposed
to be cute, no!

650
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:27,906
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying, even.

651
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:32,327
Now, all I have to do is find
that walking bald potato,

652
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,662
and his baby is mine.

653
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:36,831
Check this out.

654
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,264
No, I kid you not. I'm being...

655
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,724
Whoa!

656
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,519
Whoa!

657
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:14,452
Oh, this is going to be so good!

658
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:29,050
Okay, Daddy is
officially exhausted.

659
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:30,427
I changed your diaper.

660
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:32,303
I've got your bottle,
your Binky.

661
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:34,514
And here are your balloons.

662
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:35,890
There you go.

663
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,809
You like those, right?

664
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:40,228
All right,
a little bit of me time.

665
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,708
Mmm, mmm.

666
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:16,264
Someone put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

667
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:18,933
Ugh, teenagers are the worst.

668
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:23,271
Yeah, babies are no picnic,
either.

669
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,614
Junior!

670
00:36:45,585 --> 00:36:47,295
Ah, okay, okay.

671
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,299
Dua Lipa. Prosciutto.

672
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:01,100
Fire in de bowl!

673
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:04,729

Hello, Gru.

677
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,576
Hello. Wha... Hey.

678
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:20,745
What. What the...

679
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:24,249
Oh. Hello, Poppy.

680
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,583
Did you say something?

681
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:28,378
Wha... My name's Chet,
by the way.

682
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:30,004
Chet Cunningham.

683
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:31,256
Gru?

684
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:33,925
Wha...
What does that even mean?

685
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,471
It means you're bad at lying.

686
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:40,014
Hey, that's not nice.

687
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:42,517
Ever hear of respecting
your elders?

688
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,519
I don't respect boomers.

689
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,062
I just mock them.

690
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:50,316
Is that, like, a joke
you read on the Web?

691
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:52,527
Wow. "The Web"?

692
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:54,195
How old are you?

693
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:57,073
Well, old enough to know
that you are a rotten little...

694
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,452
You better watch yourself.

695
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:02,870
Ooh.

696
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:05,540
You used to be a master villain.

697
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:07,750
That's not me.

698
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,711
I don't even see a resemblance.

699
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:12,505
Clearly, you have the wrong guy,

700
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:15,717
as I sell... mm, solar panels.

701
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:18,136
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna expose you.

702
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:20,471
Because you're gonna help me
pull a heist.

703
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:22,390
We start planning tomorrow.

704
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,058
You want to pull a heist?

705
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,728
Listen, kid, I'm not going to...

706
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:29,314
-No, you listen, old man.
-Ow.

707
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:31,149
I own you.

708
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,612
And I promise,
you do not want to cross me.

709
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:37,280
Okay.

710
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:41,117
All right, but tomorrow
is-is not really good timing.

711
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,452
Bummer for you.

712
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:44,454
Because this is happening,

713
00:38:44,495 --> 00:38:50,627
unless you want the whole world
to know exactly who you are...

714
00:38:53,212 --> 00:38:54,797
...Gru.

715
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:59,177
She's terrifying.

716
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,140
Ah.

717
00:39:04,182 --> 00:39:06,351
Oh, looka!

718
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,439
Bello. Bello. Thank you.

719
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:14,776
-Ow!
-Ooh!

720
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:24,661
Oh, thank you.

721
00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:29,248
Yay!

722
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,458
Oh, blumach.

723
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,169
Hey, Jiminy! Tu cafe le colda?
No problemo.

724
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,402
Thank you.

725
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:01,864
All right, all right,
s-settle down.

726
00:40:01,906 --> 00:40:03,658
Settle down!

727
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,284
Thank you.

728
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:07,537
It's time to get you out
for some real-world training.

729
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:12,083
And if you do well out there,

730
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:15,545
you'll be the AVL's
new secret weapon.

731
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:16,838
Pomodoro!

732
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:31,227
I'm quite sure
I won't regret this.

733
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:34,647
No, the painters canceled.

734
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:36,065
-Uh-huh.
-True story.

735
00:40:36,107 --> 00:40:37,775
-Wow. -I don't know what is
the deal with these...

736
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:39,235
-Morning, neighbors!
-Uh...

737
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:40,737
Hey there!

738
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:43,406
Still waiting on that invite,
Perry.

739
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:44,741
-Uh...
-Oh!

740
00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:46,826
-No. No. No, no.
-Yoo-hoo!

741
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:48,536
-Patsy.
-Oh, neighbors.

742
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,538
-Oh, Patsy.
-Hi there.

743
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,582
I'm Perry's wife Patsy.

744
00:40:52,623 --> 00:40:53,791
Oh. I'm Blanche.

745
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,418
And this is Chet.

746
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,921
Hi. So I look over here,
and I see you, and...

747
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:01,090
I have one of
my brilliant ideas.

748
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:04,218
Perry needs a fourth
for tennis tomorrow.

749
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,595
Oh, honey.

750
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:07,180
I... I don't know.

751
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:09,766
He doesn't seem like
much of a tennis guy.

752
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:11,058
Much of a tennis guy?

753
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,810
I am too much of a tennis guy.

754
00:41:12,852 --> 00:41:14,771
I'm Mr. Tennis.

755
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:17,982
It's my favorite
of all the sports games.

756
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:20,985
With the racket and, uh,
with the balls.

757
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:23,112
So yellow and fuzzy.

758
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:25,156
Oh, then we're all set.

759
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:26,908
See you two at the club
tomorrow.

760
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:28,951
Toodle-oo.

761
00:41:28,993 --> 00:41:31,370
Okay. Toodle-oo to you two, too.

762
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,791
So, you-you play tennis?

763
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:37,710
Yes, yes, I play tennis.

764
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:40,046
I'm pretty fantastic, actually.

765
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:42,423
Well, at least I was
at summer camp.

766
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:43,591
Wow, that's great.

767
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:44,884
Here you go.

768
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:46,677
Mwah. Okay, bye.

769
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,305
Have fun.

770
00:41:50,348 --> 00:41:51,974
There you go.

771
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:54,602
Okay.

772
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:56,938
Huh?

773
00:42:03,736 --> 00:42:06,030
What the...

774
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:22,588
Gru.

775
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,465
You can't hide from me, Gru.

776
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:27,134
Ay, my back is killing me.

777
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:29,095
How long is this gonna take?

778
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:31,764
It will take
as long as it takes.

779
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:34,475
Mark my words, Gru will not win.

780
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:37,603
This won't be like
the ninth grade talent show.

781
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:39,897
Ay, again with this.

782
00:42:39,939 --> 00:42:42,567
Yes, again.
It was a pivotal moment.

783
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:44,443
Why can't you indulge me?

784
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:48,531
It was the night
of the big show.

785
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:52,326
I had practiced for weeks,

786
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:55,955
perfecting a number that would
blow my classmates away.

787
00:42:55,997 --> 00:42:58,666
♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon... ♪

788
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,793
I was about to go on when...

789
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:02,253
-What?
-I heard it.

790
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:04,380
Wait. Oh.

791
00:43:05,756 --> 00:43:09,927
♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon... ♪

792
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:12,763
There was that little jerk

793
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:14,348
doing my big number.

794
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,101
♪ You come and go... ♪

795
00:43:17,852 --> 00:43:19,729
He ruined everything.

796
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,938
I couldn't go on after him.

797
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,773
I would've looked like a fool.

798
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:24,734
Like I was copying him.

799
00:43:24,775 --> 00:43:26,986
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

800
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:28,946
That was a very popular song.

801
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:30,865
Oh, no, no, no, no. He knew.

802
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:32,742
He did it on purpose.

803
00:43:32,783 --> 00:43:34,660
He reveled in humiliating me.

804
00:43:34,702 --> 00:43:36,245
Huh?

805
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:38,915
-What now?
-Ugh, we're low on fuel.

806
00:43:38,956 --> 00:43:40,625
It's always something.

807
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:43,669
Look, I can never focus
on just being evil.

808
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:45,504
Okay.

809
00:43:45,546 --> 00:43:47,381
Pull over.

810
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,578
Okay, let's see.

811
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,497
Regular unleaded.

812
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:20,665
Ooh. Wow.

813
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:22,208
It is expensive, no?

814
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:26,003
Okay. Insert card
and remove rapidly.

815
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:28,172
"Card not read."

816
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:32,593
-Oh, come on.
-Did you pull it out rapidly?

817
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:35,012
Yes, yes, very rapidly.

818
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:45,564
Ay, get me a slushy.
It's my cheat day.

819
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:50,695
Hey, you, your stupid machine
won't read my card.

820
00:44:50,736 --> 00:44:52,613
Did you remove it rapidly?

821
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:53,781
Yes.

822
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:56,033
Well, sometimes it's too rapid.

823
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:58,160
You should probably try again.

824
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:01,455
I don't have time for this!

825
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:03,082
Whoa!

826
00:45:03,124 --> 00:45:07,211
I'm trying to destroy
my archnemesis.

827
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:10,339
Now, give me 900 gallons
on pump four, you idiot.

828
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:13,050
Please don't hurt me.

829
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:15,177
Oh, I'm not going to hurt you.

830
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,681
Wha...

831
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:21,392
Ow!

832
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:27,273
Oh, look at you.

833
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:29,859
Much better.

834
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,777
Now, get me a purple slushy!

835
00:45:33,404 --> 00:45:35,698
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know.

836
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,033
So there.

837
00:45:37,074 --> 00:45:38,284
I know I'm so bad.

838
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:48,002
Hmm. Okay, why don't you guys
pick out a healthy cereal?

839
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:51,672
This was Lucky's
favorite cereal.

840
00:45:52,256 --> 00:45:55,634
You don't think
he'll forget me, do you?

841
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:58,596
Oh, sweetheart,
that's impossible.

842
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:01,348
You play with Lucky
and-and dress him up.

843
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,434
And you guys have your podcast.

844
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:07,188
There is no way in this world
he could ever forget

845
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:09,482
his best friend.

846
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:11,484
Thanks, Mom.

847
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:12,902
Oh, look it!

848
00:46:12,943 --> 00:46:15,863
This one has extra marshmallows!

849
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:17,406
Double Frosted Choco Clusters.

850
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:20,076
-Yeah.
-Yeah, let's go with those.

851
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:21,869
All right, what else do we need?

852
00:46:24,038 --> 00:46:25,539
Oh, no.

853
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:28,250
Nobody see. Nobody notice.
Nobody notice.

854
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,838
-Whew.
-What's wrong?

855
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,131
Huh?

856
00:46:34,173 --> 00:46:36,092
Oh, nothing. Just, uh...

857
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:38,928
ooh, stretching
before we hit the aisles.

858
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:42,306
Shopping is the number one
cause of pulled hamstrings.

859
00:46:42,348 --> 00:46:44,350
Probably didn't know that.

860
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:49,438
Okay, all stretched.
Let's go. Quickly.

861
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,148
Quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

862
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,650
Okay. Coast is clear.

863
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:57,113
Uh... oh.

864
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:00,074
You!

865
00:47:01,992 --> 00:47:03,661
You did this to me!

866
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:04,787
You fraud.

867
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:06,622
Come on, girls.
Clean up on aisle nine!

868
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:08,749
I've always wanted to say that.

869
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:10,835
Just hide over here.

870
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:13,212
What does that lady want?

871
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:15,172
Lady? I didn't see a lady.

872
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:19,426
Lady!

873
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:21,011
Come on, let's go.

874
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:22,930
-Faster.
-Aah! -Whoa!

875
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:24,557
You're no hairdresser!

876
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:27,434
I'm onto you!

877
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:29,854
-Get back here!
-Got to get out of here.

878
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,581
Okay.

879
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:56,172
Come back here!

880
00:47:57,464 --> 00:47:59,300
Whoa!

881
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:04,805
Hey! No, no, no, no, no!

882
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:06,974
-You can't just...
-Open! Open!

883
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:08,642
Open!

884
00:48:15,107 --> 00:48:16,734
Whoa!

885
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:18,068
Let's go.

886
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,783
Stop! Come here, you!

887
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:29,079
No!

888
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:30,331
Whew.

889
00:48:30,372 --> 00:48:31,832
That was a close one.

890
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:34,376
Always a fun time
when you go shopping with Mom.

891
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,212
-Yeah!
-Best shopping trip ever!

892
00:48:36,253 --> 00:48:38,672
I feel so alive!

893
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:11,497
Perfecto.

894
00:49:11,538 --> 00:49:13,415
Poppy?

895
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:16,085
Poppy!

896
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:21,090
I don't see her, Junior.

897
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:22,549
Look up, genius.

898
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:24,176
-Huh?
-You're late.

899
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:27,513
How do I get up there?

900
00:49:27,554 --> 00:49:29,098
Use the trampoline.

901
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:30,641
Huh?

902
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:37,356
Here we go.

903
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:46,949
Whoa! Aah!

904
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,496
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

905
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:06,093
It is I,

906
00:50:06,176 --> 00:50:08,429
Poppy Prescott,

907
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,848
villainess.

908
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:12,308
Have a seat, Gru.

909
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:14,351
All right, I'll sit...

910
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:17,730
Okay. Why am I here?

911
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:22,401
Because, like you,
I was born to be bad.

912
00:50:22,443 --> 00:50:23,819
And now...

913
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:27,489
it's time to discuss
our big heist.

914
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:29,116
"Heist."

915
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:30,909
Please, you're just a child.

916
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:35,039
All great villains start young.

917
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,167
Didn't you steal the
Crown Jewels when you were 12?

918
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:40,794
I was a lot younger than that.

919
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:42,713
And no offense,
but you're not me.

920
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:46,842
Oh, I plan on being
a lot better than you.

921
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:49,303
Check this out.

922
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:51,764
Hey, is that my old school?

923
00:50:51,805 --> 00:50:53,349
Bingo.

924
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,394
Which I have expertly modeled
with glue and Popsicle sticks.

925
00:50:57,436 --> 00:51:00,397
And it's where
we are going to steal...

926
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:03,025
the school mascot.

927
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:05,069
You want to steal Lenny?

928
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,403
Exactly.

929
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:09,239
Lycee Pas Bon has always been
my dream school,

930
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:10,657
and this heist
will look so great

931
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:12,576
on my villain transcripts.

932
00:51:12,618 --> 00:51:14,536
That is a terrible idea.

933
00:51:14,578 --> 00:51:17,581
Have you ever even seen
a honey badger?

934
00:51:17,623 --> 00:51:19,917
They are vicious
little monsters.

935
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:24,004
They literally eat bees
and cobras for breakfast.

936
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:26,298
Honey badger don't care.

937
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,550
No way. No way am I helping you.

938
00:51:28,592 --> 00:51:31,011
Well, that's the thing
with blackmail.

939
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:33,889
You kind of have no choice.

940
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,364
Come here. Come here!

941
00:52:07,673 --> 00:52:09,591
Ah, uh...
Tim.

942
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:11,218
Tim, uh, tu le do it.

943
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,470
-Go, go, go.
-P-P-Porque meo?

944
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:16,849
Chihuahua.

945
00:52:22,396 --> 00:52:24,398
Bas enough!

946
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:26,400
No! Tu le stronga.

947
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:27,985
Tu le forta.

948
00:52:28,026 --> 00:52:29,194
Tu le besta!

949
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,572
Les salami!

950
00:52:31,613 --> 00:52:33,407
Les salami!

951
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:36,034
Aah! Suppository!

952
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:43,417
Hey! Police!

953
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:45,085
No problemo.

954
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:54,470
Ooh. Uh...

955
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:56,930
Piña colada.

956
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:04,563
Help!

957
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:08,775
Please, can you help me?

958
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:10,944
Oh, si, si.

959
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:19,244
Hey. All is goot.

960
00:53:19,286 --> 00:53:20,412
Ciao!

961
00:53:23,373 --> 00:53:25,125
Smudge, Smudge, come down.

962
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,627
Hey!

963
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:32,883
Les gato.

964
00:53:32,925 --> 00:53:35,093
Thank you. Thank you.

965
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:38,096
Ooh, smoocha.

966
00:53:39,306 --> 00:53:40,974
Oh!

967
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:51,527
Help!

968
00:53:51,568 --> 00:53:54,238
Bazooka!

969
00:54:10,754 --> 00:54:13,090
Ah. Uh...

970
00:54:18,804 --> 00:54:20,472
Hey, hey. Stoppa. Stoppa.

971
00:54:20,514 --> 00:54:22,140
Muy risky. Lemme do it.

972
00:54:31,525 --> 00:54:34,069
Ciao, bellos!

973
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,951
There they are.
Those guys crushed my car.

974
00:54:40,993 --> 00:54:42,744
They destroyed the coffee shop!

975
00:54:42,786 --> 00:54:43,996
Yeah, get out of here!

976
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:45,539
They're ruining everything.

977
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:47,124
I'm sick of superheroes.

978
00:54:47,165 --> 00:54:48,709
-Yeah.
-Let's get 'em.

979
00:54:52,504 --> 00:54:54,298
Get in.

980
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,345
Gentlemen...

981
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:02,723
our experiment has failed.

982
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:05,642
You are officially
going to be retired.

983
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:07,603
Yeah! Retirement!

984
00:55:07,644 --> 00:55:09,938
Uh, uh, no?

985
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:27,080
Whoa. There it is.

986
00:55:34,129 --> 00:55:35,422
The castle.

987
00:55:35,464 --> 00:55:36,840
The gargoyles.

988
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:39,217
I can't believe I'm
really here.

989
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:47,476
Okay.

990
00:55:49,686 --> 00:55:50,979
Voilà.

991
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:53,106
Okay, let's get this over with.

992
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:55,776
-Ron, hand me my gear.
-Voilà.

993
00:55:55,817 --> 00:55:57,819
-Keep a close eye on him.
-Okay.

994
00:55:57,861 --> 00:55:59,321
If you need anything,
I brought formula...

995
00:55:59,363 --> 00:56:01,698
-Uh-huh. Formula. Diapers.
-...extra diapers,

996
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,866
-his favorite Binky.
-Come on.

997
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:04,826
Let's go, let's go.

998
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:16,046
And now we cut
through the glass with my...

999
00:56:16,088 --> 00:56:17,631
Diapers?

1000
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:18,799
What?

1001
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,217
You've got to be kidding
with me.

1002
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:25,514
Hey, guys. Guys.

1003
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:27,015
Guys? Guys.

1004
00:56:27,057 --> 00:56:29,768
Guys, where is the other bag,
with my gear?

1005
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,561
Ah, in le balloon.

1006
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:33,313
Ah, uh...

1007
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:34,773
Oops.

1008
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:38,318
What? How...

1009
00:56:40,404 --> 00:56:43,323
All right, all right.
Let's see what I got in here.

1010
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:44,866
Uh... come on.

1011
00:56:44,908 --> 00:56:46,535
Come on, come on, come on.

1012
00:56:46,576 --> 00:56:48,203
Aha.

1013
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:55,919
Thank you.

1014
00:56:57,713 --> 00:57:00,382
Easy peasy.

1015
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,186
Huh?

1016
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:20,736
That's Mr. Friendly.

1017
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:26,366
No, no, no, no, no!

1018
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,333
Whew.

1019
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:45,385
Ha, ha, ha.

1020
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:52,309
That's Dr. Destructo.

1021
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,935
He was just a kid.

1022
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:56,438
And there's Killer Driller's
original helmet.

1023
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,982
Come on. Stay focused.

1024
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:09,493
Diaper.

1025
00:58:24,424 --> 00:58:26,009
I need something like...

1026
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:28,553
-something that I can...
-How about this?

1027
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:30,305
Nice.

1028
00:58:33,433 --> 00:58:35,143
Yes!

1029
00:58:38,355 --> 00:58:39,606
We're in.

1030
00:58:39,648 --> 00:58:40,774
Wait.

1031
00:58:40,816 --> 00:58:42,442
No, no, no, no, no.

1032
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:43,777
Baby powder.

1033
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:45,862
Ah, si, si. Yeah.

1034
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:51,993
Whoa.

1035
00:58:52,035 --> 00:58:54,412
You know, the most important
part of a heist

1036
00:58:54,454 --> 00:58:57,082
is being constantly aware
of potential danger.

1037
00:58:57,123 --> 00:58:58,583
Le baby!

1038
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,627
La la! Tiramisu!

1039
00:59:00,669 --> 00:59:02,295
No, no! Le baby! Komay le!

1040
00:59:02,337 --> 00:59:03,964
No. Junior.

1041
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,632
Junior, come back here.

1042
00:59:08,134 --> 00:59:10,637
So, what's your plan now?

1043
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:12,764
I am dealing with it.

1044
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:17,644
Don't touch anything.

1045
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:21,356
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no!

1046
00:59:22,566 --> 00:59:24,401
Good job, Junior.

1047
00:59:24,442 --> 00:59:26,611
Way to go.

1048
00:59:29,573 --> 00:59:30,991
Aw, he's having fun.

1049
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:32,742
Eh, too much fun.

1050
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,037
-Ah, stoppa.
-Blah, blah, blah.

1051
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,208
Please, Junior, Daddy needs
to steal a honey badger.

1052
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:45,422
Whew. Okay.

1053
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:48,758
I know they keep Lenny here
at night.

1054
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,969
And if memory serves,

1055
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:54,598
there is a hidden switch
around here somewhere.

1056
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,141
Ah. Aha.

1057
00:59:56,182 --> 00:59:57,976
Yes.

1058
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:02,063
Ooh.

1059
01:00:10,906 --> 01:00:12,490
I'll hit him with this.

1060
01:00:12,532 --> 01:00:15,201
Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

1061
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:17,495
That fuzzy demon will sleep
like a baby the whole...

1062
01:00:23,793 --> 01:00:25,795
Okay, he's still asleep.

1063
01:00:36,973 --> 01:00:39,601
I tranked myself.

1064
01:00:39,643 --> 01:00:40,810
Ow!

1065
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:47,525
Hey! Hey!

1066
01:00:49,945 --> 01:00:51,988
Gru, what do we do?

1067
01:00:52,864 --> 01:00:54,324
No!

1068
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,536
Oh, no!

1069
01:00:58,578 --> 01:01:00,413
I ruined our heist.

1070
01:01:01,998 --> 01:01:05,210
What? Who dares?

1071
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:12,801
Intruders!

1072
01:01:14,386 --> 01:01:17,138
Intruders!

1073
01:01:27,983 --> 01:01:30,402
Wake up!

1074
01:01:31,528 --> 01:01:33,488
No!

1075
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:40,495
What?

1076
01:01:42,414 --> 01:01:43,498
Hmm.

1077
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:47,919
Aw.

1078
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:49,295
Aw.

1079
01:01:50,672 --> 01:01:52,048
No. Nope.

1080
01:01:54,092 --> 01:01:57,053
Come on. We have to go.

1081
01:02:03,143 --> 01:02:06,521
Intruders, you messed
with the wrong principal.

1082
01:02:06,563 --> 01:02:09,357
Here we go.
Come on. Come on.

1083
01:02:15,238 --> 01:02:17,115
Go, go, go!

1084
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:22,037
Come on! Come on!

1085
01:02:22,078 --> 01:02:24,539
Ooh, you won't get away
with this.

1086
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:49,689
Prepare to feel the wrath
of Ubelschlecht.

1087
01:02:53,693 --> 01:02:55,195
Diaper rash cream.

1088
01:02:55,236 --> 01:02:58,531
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

1089
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:01,785
Oh, dear.

1090
01:03:04,287 --> 01:03:05,914
Get back here, you!

1091
01:03:05,955 --> 01:03:08,458
I want my Lenny!

1092
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:14,005
How are we getting out of here?

1093
01:03:14,047 --> 01:03:15,882
Follow me.

1094
01:03:15,924 --> 01:03:17,467
Get in.

1095
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:21,888
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1096
01:03:24,808 --> 01:03:26,476
Mr. Friendly!

1097
01:03:27,602 --> 01:03:29,020
Whoa!

1098
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,625
I have to say,

1099
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:54,879
that was, without a doubt,
the coolest night of my life.

1100
01:03:54,921 --> 01:03:57,757
I can't believe
we actually pulled that off.

1101
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:01,427
Not gonna lie,
that was pretty fun.

1102
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:04,806
Scusa. Scusa.

1103
01:04:04,848 --> 01:04:06,015
Thanks, Ron.

1104
01:04:06,057 --> 01:04:07,350
Whew.

1105
01:04:07,392 --> 01:04:12,147
And thank you for everything.

1106
01:04:12,188 --> 01:04:14,315
Oh, and hey, don't worry.

1107
01:04:14,357 --> 01:04:17,861
Your secret is safe with me,
partner.

1108
01:04:17,902 --> 01:04:19,154
Thanks.

1109
01:04:19,195 --> 01:04:21,197
Good night.

1110
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:26,077
Your dada did pretty good,
huh, Junior?

1111
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:37,213
Hello, Maxime.

1112
01:04:37,255 --> 01:04:39,465
How's my favorite student?

1113
01:04:39,507 --> 01:04:41,217
You know, I think you and I

1114
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:43,511
might be looking
for the same person,

1115
01:04:43,553 --> 01:04:47,223
and I know exactly where he is.

1116
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:57,066
Thank you,
Principal Ubelschlecht.

1117
01:04:57,108 --> 01:04:58,860
We got him!

1118
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:01,362
Valentina, to Mayflower!

1119
01:05:01,404 --> 01:05:03,156
With pleasure.

1120
01:05:08,745 --> 01:05:10,914
Ah. Here we go.

1121
01:05:12,081 --> 01:05:13,625
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1122
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:16,002
It's all coming back to me.

1123
01:05:18,046 --> 01:05:19,672
Oops. Oh.

1124
01:05:19,714 --> 01:05:21,132
Okay.

1125
01:05:21,174 --> 01:05:23,092
See you later.

1126
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:24,260
Say, "Bye, Mommy and Daddy."

1127
01:05:24,302 --> 01:05:25,678
Have fun at the club.

1128
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,931
Make good choices.

1129
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:29,974
-Bye, guys.
-Goodbye.

1130
01:05:30,016 --> 01:05:31,184
Bye!

1131
01:05:31,226 --> 01:05:32,852
Hey, Cunninghams.

1132
01:05:32,894 --> 01:05:34,729
Um, hey, Poppy.

1133
01:05:34,771 --> 01:05:36,522
I heard our parents
are having a playdate--

1134
01:05:36,564 --> 01:05:38,358
which is adorable, by the way--

1135
01:05:38,399 --> 01:05:41,194
and I thought you might
want to hang out.

1136
01:05:41,236 --> 01:05:43,321
Oh. Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1137
01:05:43,363 --> 01:05:46,115
Let's get this party started,
people!

1138
01:05:46,157 --> 01:05:48,243
I like her.

1139
01:05:48,284 --> 01:05:50,370
Yeah, most people do.

1140
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:52,538
Sweet.

1141
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,291
So, have you guys ever seen
a honey badger?

1142
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:05,635
Whoa, okay. These guys
aren't messing around.

1143
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:08,388
There are my favorite
new neighbors.

1144
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:11,432
-Hi.
-I'm loving this whole vibe.

1145
01:06:11,474 --> 01:06:13,518
You two look like
a couple of pros.

1146
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:17,855
Yeah, but we're not.

1147
01:06:17,897 --> 01:06:20,566
Perry and the boys are waiting
for y'all on the court,

1148
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:23,152
and we are hitting
the clubhouse.

1149
01:06:23,194 --> 01:06:26,114
And you're telling me where
you got that to-die-for outfit.

1150
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:34,080
Over here, Chet.

1151
01:06:34,122 --> 01:06:35,915
Hello.

1152
01:06:35,957 --> 01:06:38,042
Okay.

1153
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:40,336
Skip, Chip, Chet.
Chet, Skip, Chip.

1154
01:06:40,378 --> 01:06:41,546
Hey there, fellas.

1155
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:43,214
-Hello.
-How are you doing, Chet?

1156
01:06:43,256 --> 01:06:44,299
Okay.

1157
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,178
Chet here is gonna show
us fellas how it's done.

1158
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,930
Right?

1159
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:53,474
Uh, hmm.

1160
01:06:53,558 --> 01:06:57,061
Oh, I'm gonna smoke this guy.

1161
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:58,688
Okay.

1162
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:08,114
Huh?

1163
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:10,825
What the...

1164
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:19,375
Okay. Let's do this.

1165
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:25,882
Huh? You've got to be kidding.

1166
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:29,802
Okay, okay.

1167
01:07:29,886 --> 01:07:31,346
Better?

1168
01:07:36,225 --> 01:07:38,311
-What?
-Hmm?

1169
01:07:39,479 --> 01:07:40,855
That doesn't count.

1170
01:07:40,897 --> 01:07:42,648
And... oh! What?

1171
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:45,234
You can't just...

1172
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:46,736
This is ridiculous!

1173
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:49,614
Huh?

1174
01:07:52,575 --> 01:07:55,161
Ah.

1175
01:08:02,251 --> 01:08:03,878
Thanks, Ron.

1176
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,046
Hey, no! Oh, no!

1177
01:08:07,507 --> 01:08:09,384
Come and get it.

1178
01:08:09,425 --> 01:08:11,511
-Oh, it's so cute.
-Whoa.

1179
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:13,888
This is the weirdest dog ever.

1180
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:17,183
I'll get it.

1181
01:08:25,566 --> 01:08:28,152
Well, hello, little one.

1182
01:08:28,194 --> 01:08:29,904
Is your daddy home?

1183
01:08:29,946 --> 01:08:33,699
Sorry. I'm not "stupposed"
to talk to strangers.

1184
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:36,577
Oh. I'm not a stranger.

1185
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:39,789
Well, you look strange to me.

1186
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:42,166
Who is it?

1187
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,709
I don't know.

1188
01:08:43,751 --> 01:08:48,005
But she's old
and smells like pickles.

1189
01:08:51,551 --> 01:08:53,803
Okay, I'm coming.

1190
01:08:57,223 --> 01:08:58,474
Oh, no. Um...

1191
01:08:58,516 --> 01:09:00,935
I'll be right back.

1192
01:09:02,395 --> 01:09:04,313
Can I help you?

1193
01:09:04,355 --> 01:09:06,190
Well, I hope so.

1194
01:09:06,232 --> 01:09:08,609
I'm an old friend of Gru's.

1195
01:09:09,444 --> 01:09:11,612
Well, he's not here, so...

1196
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:14,157
Oh, that's all right.

1197
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:16,701
I'll wait.

1198
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:21,330
Huh? What? No!

1199
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,251
Whenever you're ready, Perry.

1200
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:27,211
Um...

1201
01:09:27,253 --> 01:09:28,796
Hmm?

1202
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:38,514
Needless to say, Perry and I
are no longer welcome

1203
01:09:38,556 --> 01:09:40,391
on the island of O'ahu.

1204
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:42,560
True story.

1205
01:09:42,602 --> 01:09:44,479
Honey.

1206
01:09:44,604 --> 01:09:45,938
-Oh, thank goodness.
-It's the children.

1207
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,566
We have to go now.

1208
01:09:49,275 --> 01:09:50,359
Oh.

1209
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:51,944
Thanks. Bye.

1210
01:09:51,986 --> 01:09:53,738
-Our cover's blown.
-What?

1211
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:55,698
-Call Silas.
-Oh, no.

1212
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:23,809
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

1213
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:30,608
Ah.

1214
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:33,653
Gru's been compromised.

1215
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:35,571
This is an emergency, people.

1216
01:10:35,613 --> 01:10:37,782
Retirement is officially over.

1217
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:40,701
Assemble the Mega Minions.

1218
01:10:49,252 --> 01:10:50,836
Pomodoro!

1219
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,429
Pomodoro!

1220
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:08,896
Shooshta, shooshta,
shooshta, shooshta,

1221
01:11:08,938 --> 01:11:11,315
shooshta, shooshta, shooshta!

1222
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:15,069
Hey.

1223
01:11:15,111 --> 01:11:17,154
Bello, busy bee.

1224
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:18,948
Aw.

1225
01:11:21,117 --> 01:11:22,451
Pomodoro!

1226
01:11:25,871 --> 01:11:28,291
Yee-haw!

1227
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,043
Pomodoro!

1228
01:11:33,462 --> 01:11:34,547
Pomodoro!

1229
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:36,257
Yee-haw!

1230
01:11:36,299 --> 01:11:38,092
Yippa, yippa!

1231
01:11:40,219 --> 01:11:41,470
Huh?

1232
01:11:41,512 --> 01:11:43,222
Whoa.

1233
01:11:43,264 --> 01:11:44,473
Yeah!

1234
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,226
Huh?

1235
01:11:54,025 --> 01:11:58,279
So, your father
has been naughty.

1236
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:00,823
Very naughty.

1237
01:12:01,407 --> 01:12:04,660
He took something of mine
that I desperately want back.

1238
01:12:09,415 --> 01:12:11,626
Principal Ubelschlecht?

1239
01:12:12,376 --> 01:12:15,463
Ooh. I know you took my Lenny.

1240
01:12:15,504 --> 01:12:17,256
-Now, hand him over!
-Ow!

1241
01:12:17,298 --> 01:12:18,591
Ow. That...

1242
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:20,885
-Actually very funny story.
-Zip it!

1243
01:12:20,926 --> 01:12:22,470
I don't want to hear
your excuses.

1244
01:12:22,511 --> 01:12:23,721
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

1245
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:25,264
Let's go, tough guy.

1246
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:26,599
Okay.

1247
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:28,559
I'm not going to fight
an old lady.

1248
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:29,894
Oh, yeah?

1249
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:31,437
Well, I'm gonna give you
a whupping

1250
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:33,105
for the history books.

1251
01:12:33,147 --> 01:12:34,607
Whoa, whoa!

1252
01:12:37,234 --> 01:12:38,694
Take that!

1253
01:12:42,615 --> 01:12:44,742
Yeah, go!

1254
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:46,911
Girls, look out! Over here!

1255
01:12:46,952 --> 01:12:48,579
-Everyone, get down!
-Gru!

1256
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:52,500
Hey, back off, lady.

1257
01:13:03,594 --> 01:13:05,096
Stop it!

1258
01:13:05,137 --> 01:13:06,138
Let him go!

1259
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,224
Take that!

1260
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:17,692
Now we have to get in there

1261
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:19,026
and find that baby.

1262
01:13:19,068 --> 01:13:20,736
What?

1263
01:13:24,407 --> 01:13:25,658
Oh! Jackpot, huh?

1264
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,076
Ay, Maxime.

1265
01:13:27,118 --> 01:13:28,786
This is too easy.

1266
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:31,622
Come here, little baby.

1267
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:32,873
Come to Maxime.

1268
01:13:32,915 --> 01:13:35,000
Yes. Coochie-coochie...

1269
01:13:35,126 --> 01:13:36,919
-Oh!
-Ay, Maxime.

1270
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:38,671
You little...

1271
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:41,215
You are in big trouble.

1272
01:13:42,466 --> 01:13:43,968
Gotcha!

1273
01:13:53,561 --> 01:13:54,895
Whew.

1274
01:13:54,937 --> 01:13:56,689
Wait. Where's the baby?

1275
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:59,108
Where's the baby?!

1276
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:00,359
Junior?

1277
01:14:04,405 --> 01:14:05,531
Lucy!

1278
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:06,699
Go after the baby.

1279
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,661
Maxime.

1280
01:14:10,703 --> 01:14:12,621
Say au revoir, Gru.

1281
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:14,039
Oh, and don't worry.

1282
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:16,751
He will be very happy
with his new daddy.

1283
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:18,169
Right? Look at him.

1284
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,629
Oh, he loves his new daddy.

1285
01:14:20,671 --> 01:14:22,381
Junior!

1286
01:14:24,258 --> 01:14:26,093
No!

1287
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,638
Whoa!

1288
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,140
Get in.

1289
01:14:31,974 --> 01:14:34,185
We've got a baby to save.

1290
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:43,444
We got him!

1291
01:14:43,486 --> 01:14:46,947
Oh, who is ready to become
a little roach?

1292
01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:48,949
Ow! Let go!

1293
01:14:48,991 --> 01:14:50,743
Ow! Those are very sensitive.

1294
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:52,870
Aah! You squirmy little...

1295
01:14:52,953 --> 01:14:54,121
Oh!

1296
01:14:54,163 --> 01:14:56,957
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

1297
01:14:56,999 --> 01:14:59,627
You got pee-pee
all over my ship.

1298
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,840
Valentina, bring me
the Roachification Ray.

1299
01:15:08,302 --> 01:15:09,887
There they are.

1300
01:15:11,722 --> 01:15:13,724
I'm on it.

1301
01:15:13,766 --> 01:15:16,185
Here we go!

1302
01:15:21,982 --> 01:15:24,527
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1303
01:15:30,074 --> 01:15:32,493
What's that?

1304
01:15:32,535 --> 01:15:34,662
Hello.

1305
01:15:34,703 --> 01:15:36,580
Gru!

1306
01:15:36,622 --> 01:15:38,916
Get me closer.

1307
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:42,461
Almost there.

1308
01:15:43,963 --> 01:15:46,006
Take them out!

1309
01:15:57,017 --> 01:15:59,228
You're doing great!

1310
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,902
Go get 'em, partner.

1311
01:16:22,877 --> 01:16:25,337
Ay! I can't see!

1312
01:16:40,686 --> 01:16:42,646
Junior.

1313
01:16:43,188 --> 01:16:45,357
Don't worry, Gru.

1314
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:46,984
The baby is fine.

1315
01:16:47,026 --> 01:16:48,694
See for yourself.

1316
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:53,908
Oh, Junior.

1317
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:55,743
And now he belongs to me.

1318
01:16:55,784 --> 01:16:57,828
Isn't that right, Maxime Jr.?

1319
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:02,207
Together, we will wreak havoc,
cause mayhem

1320
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:04,543
and have so much fun
doing it, huh?

1321
01:17:06,295 --> 01:17:08,923
And best of all, he hates you!

1322
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:10,507
He really does.

1323
01:17:10,549 --> 01:17:12,635
Let my son go.

1324
01:17:12,676 --> 01:17:14,136
No, I don't think so.

1325
01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:17,556
The fun is just about
to start, huh?

1326
01:17:26,273 --> 01:17:29,902
Oh, look at what a coward
your old daddy is, huh?

1327
01:17:56,261 --> 01:17:59,056
You crossed the line, Maxime.

1328
01:17:59,098 --> 01:18:00,891
Now, give me my son.

1329
01:18:00,933 --> 01:18:04,436
I told you, he is my son now.

1330
01:18:15,114 --> 01:18:16,991
Watch your step, Gru.

1331
01:18:17,032 --> 01:18:18,534
It's a doozy!

1332
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,495
Too bad you can't fly, huh?

1333
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:29,837
-Let go!
-Ow!

1334
01:18:41,682 --> 01:18:43,267
This ends now!

1335
01:18:43,308 --> 01:18:45,144
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1336
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,861
It's okay, Junior.

1337
01:18:53,902 --> 01:18:56,405
Dada loves you.

1338
01:19:20,095 --> 01:19:21,597
Get back here.

1339
01:19:21,638 --> 01:19:22,848
Bad baby.

1340
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,099
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1341
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:25,601
Get off me, you demon!

1342
01:19:25,642 --> 01:19:27,936
You are going to feel
the wrath of...

1343
01:19:39,823 --> 01:19:40,991
Whoa.

1344
01:19:51,835 --> 01:19:54,004
See? Not a scratch.

1345
01:19:54,046 --> 01:19:56,006
Huh? Wha...?

1346
01:19:56,048 --> 01:19:58,801
Salami!

1347
01:20:00,636 --> 01:20:02,221
Pastrami!

1348
01:20:04,306 --> 01:20:06,225
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1349
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:08,435
Prosciutto!

1350
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:11,063
-What?
-Prosciutto!

1351
01:20:11,105 --> 01:20:12,898
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

1352
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:13,941
Gross.

1353
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:20,239
Nice try. When I...

1354
01:20:23,242 --> 01:20:25,911
Antipasti.

1355
01:20:28,038 --> 01:20:30,332
Oh!

1356
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:34,169
-Gru! -Oh, Gru!
-You're here!

1357
01:20:34,211 --> 01:20:36,713
Junior!

1358
01:20:39,508 --> 01:20:41,051
Yes!

1359
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:42,427
-Yay!
-Holy cow!

1360
01:20:42,469 --> 01:20:44,096
-Are you guys okay?
-That was insane!

1361
01:20:48,892 --> 01:20:50,769
Dada.

1362
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,650
Aw.

1363
01:20:56,692 --> 01:20:58,694
Aw. My boys.

1364
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:00,279
Dada.

1365
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,406
You know something,
today has been

1366
01:21:02,447 --> 01:21:05,534
a real roller coaster
of emotion.

1367
01:21:09,538 --> 01:21:10,956
Uh, Gru?

1368
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:13,208
Can we go back home now?

1369
01:21:18,005 --> 01:21:19,631
All right. There you go.

1370
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:21,967
Yay!

1371
01:21:22,009 --> 01:21:23,302
Thanks, Dr. Nefario.

1372
01:21:23,343 --> 01:21:25,304
Good as new.

1373
01:21:25,345 --> 01:21:28,223
No job too small or too mad.

1374
01:21:28,265 --> 01:21:30,893
Bye, then.

1375
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:32,686
Bye.

1376
01:21:40,152 --> 01:21:42,237
Hey. You okay, sweetie?

1377
01:21:43,947 --> 01:21:45,199
Agnes!

1378
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,618
Someone's here to see you!

1379
01:21:54,374 --> 01:21:56,668
Lucky?

1380
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:02,090
Lucky!

1381
01:22:05,302 --> 01:22:07,012
Did you practice your tricks?

1382
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:09,973
Okay, play dead.

1383
01:22:14,394 --> 01:22:16,188
Yay!

1384
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,690
Ah, that was... disturbing.

1385
01:22:18,732 --> 01:22:20,359
-Yeah, little bit.
-Lucky!

1386
01:22:23,612 --> 01:22:25,948
Hey, I'll, uh...
I'll be back soon.

1387
01:22:25,989 --> 01:22:27,366
-Oh. Okay.
-Mwah.

1388
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:29,618
There's something
I need to take care of.

1389
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:30,911
Mwah.

1390
01:22:30,953 --> 01:22:32,079
See you later, buddy.

1391
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,330
Love you, honey.

1392
01:22:33,372 --> 01:22:35,791
Da-da-da.

1393
01:22:40,837 --> 01:22:43,632
How you doing, Maxime?

1394
01:22:43,674 --> 01:22:46,343
What are you doing here, Gru?

1395
01:22:46,385 --> 01:22:48,011
You came to gloat, no?

1396
01:22:48,053 --> 01:22:49,513
Gloat? No, no, no, no. I just...

1397
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:51,974
I wanted to get something
off my chest.

1398
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:53,558
And it concerns

1399
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,311
the ninth grade talent show.

1400
01:22:56,353 --> 01:23:00,232
Well, actually...

1401
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:03,735
-I did steal your song.
-What?

1402
01:23:03,777 --> 01:23:04,987
I knew it!

1403
01:23:05,028 --> 01:23:06,363
I knew there was no coincidence.

1404
01:23:06,405 --> 01:23:07,948
You little liar!

1405
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,867
Well?

1406
01:23:10,909 --> 01:23:12,244
Well, what?

1407
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:13,578
-Well, where's my apology?
-Apol...

1408
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,247
What are you talking about?

1409
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:17,082
I just apologized.

1410
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:18,417
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1411
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,210
No, that was no apology.

1412
01:23:20,252 --> 01:23:22,379
You just wanted to rub it in.

1413
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:25,257
I can't believe
you stole my song.

1414
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:27,259
Hey, I only did that
to get back at you

1415
01:23:27,301 --> 01:23:29,219
for pantsing me
at the homecoming dance.

1416
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:31,221
Besides,

1417
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:32,848
you could've gone on after me.

1418
01:23:32,889 --> 01:23:36,143
It is not my fault
that you were afraid.

1419
01:23:36,184 --> 01:23:39,062
Afraid because I killed it!

1420
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:40,564
Afraid? Ha!

1421
01:23:40,605 --> 01:23:43,025
I could outsing you
any day of the week

1422
01:23:43,066 --> 01:23:44,609
and all day Sunday.

1423
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:47,279
I'd like to see that.

Anytime, anyplace.
