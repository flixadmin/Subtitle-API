00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,257
The Lannisters will trade your daughters
for the Kingslayer.

Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

Oh, my name is quite long

450
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,105
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

451
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,192
l am simply a trader of spices.

452

My friend,

459
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,600

460
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,894
We have no food, no water.

461
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,647
Once l see my people fed,
l would be honored...

462
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,108
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

463
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,945
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

468

469
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,752
Oh, l don't think you are.

470
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,337
But as l've never met you before,

471
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,006
my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

472
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,969
Where l come from,

473
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:20,975
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

474
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,353
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

475

We wish you well.

476
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,736
What are you doing?

477
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,155
You promised to receive me.

478

We have received you.

Which we shall deeply regret.

482
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,587
But Qarth did not become
the greatest city that ever was or will be

483
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,923
by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

484
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,433
Khaleesi, please be careful.

485
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,353
Thirteen!

486
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:13,527
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me

487
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,821
and destroy those who have wronged me.

488
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,493
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

489
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,914
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

490
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,792
Ah.

491
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,211
You are a true Targaryen.

492
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,255
Only, as you said a moment ago,

493
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,758
if we don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

494
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,551
And so...

495
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:42,431
Retreating in fear from a little girl
is unbecoming of the greatest city

496
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,974
that ever was or will be.

497
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,645
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

498
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,480
The Thirteen have spoken.

499
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,732
l am one of the Thirteen,

500
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,901
and l am still speaking.

501
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,238
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

502
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,241
and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

503
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,576
She is the Mother of Dragons.

504
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:07,915
Do you expect her to watch her people starve
without breathing fire?

505
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,709
l believe we can allow a few Dothraki

506
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,337
through our gates without dooming our city.

507
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,464
After all, here l am,

508
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,427
a savage from the Summer lsles,
and Qarth still stands.

509
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,013
Our decision is final.

510
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,266
Very well.

l will vouch for her, her people,
and her dragons, in accordance with the law.

00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,650
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

-Here's your warrant.
-So it is.

Will you take a cup with me?

l am here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, lmp.

553

lf my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

l would have thought she'd come herself.

When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
l carry it out without delay.

before or after she took you into her bed?

You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

to what King Joffrey will have to say

you've been bedding his mother?

Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

and it's all for the good of the realm.

609
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,632
Go back and tell her
that l beg her forgiveness,

-You will?
-Yes, l'll release him in the morning.

615

Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but l will not have him on the Council.

l could swear that l had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

l've lived within the law for 1 7...

639
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,451
l want you to be a smuggler this time.

640
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,037
Any shore, any night.

641
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,997
What am l bringing ashore?

642
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,582
The red woman.

643
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,296
No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.

644
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,466
l am true to Your Grace and always will be,

645
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,677
but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

646
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,472
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

647
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,504
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

648
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,094
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

649
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,557
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

650
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,564
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

651
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,025
l'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.

652
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,821
lf half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

653
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,199
A man is good or he is evil.

654
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,160
-And which are you?
-Oh, good.

655
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,374
l'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.

656
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,170
Well, that must be very nice for you.

657
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,439
-Do you love your wife?
-l do.

658
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,358
Yet you have known other women.

659
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,194
Don't talk about my wife.

660
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,946
l'm not. l'm talking about other women.

661
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,366
Like me, Ser Davos.

662
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,498
You want me.

663
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,501
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

664
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,713
And you will.

665
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:31,056
Strange that this Lord of Light
asks you to work in the shadows.

666
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,435
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

667
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,606
They are servants of light, the children of fire.

668
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,944
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

669
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,571
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

670
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,408
They can't bar our passage.

671
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,165
Gods protect us.

672
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,876
There's only one god, Ser Davos,

673
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,547
and he only protects those who serve him.
