1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:09,636
- Eddie?
- Iris, I've missed you so much.

2
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,513
This is not possible.

3
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:13,890
You were...

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,602
Are you okay, babe?
You look a little flushed.

5
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,605
Yep, that's a fever.

6
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,440
Can I get you something?
Some water?

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,650
No, I'm fine.

8
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:24,817
No, I know what you need.

9
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,779
Your favorite, chamomile tea.

10
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:31,783
Oh, and don't worry.
I know I've been gone a long time.

11
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:36,246
But I'm not leaving
until you're all better.

12
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:38,413
Okay?

13
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:44,170
Iris? Why is there an attractive
blond man in your kitchen?

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,172
Oh, hey, I'm Eddie.

15
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:47,589
Eddie Thawne.

16
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:49,968
Iris's fiancé.

[news anchor on TV]
<i>C. C.P.D. has ordered a city-wide curfew</i>

19
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,669
<i>after the shocking massacre
that happened earlier tonight.</i>

20
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,922
<i>The mysterious assailant
remains currently...</i>

21
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,465
No sign of Deathstorm anywhere.

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,843
- How's it going here?
- Good.

23
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,679
The Mental Augmentation Chamber's
just like I remember.

24
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,473
Not that I could forget six weeks
of living inside this thing.

25
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:41,185
So, we're seriously going to turn
Frost into an anti-Deathstorm?

26
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,023
We know Deathstorm is made up
of pure thermodynamic energy.

27
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:49,444
So we use the MAC to harness particles
from its home dimension

28
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,905
and then beam them
into your consciousness.

29
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:57,076
The reaction should transform Frost's
body into a being like Deathstorm.

30
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:00,038
You'll be able to create fire,
defy gravity...

31
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,914
And consume Deathstorm's fuel source.

32
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,710
Once you absorb all that grief energy
out of Deathstorm...

33
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,629
I'll be able to snuff him out, for good.

34
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,589
Well, it's official.

35
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,133
This is the craziest plan
we've ever had.

36
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,426
[Frost] Then, let's get crazy,

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,971
'cause I'm not letting that Skeletor
put another bony finger on my sister.

38
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,983
I just got to finish
the MAC's cryo-circuits

39
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:20,600
and it should be good to go.

40
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,010
[Cecile] <i>Guys, I need you
in the med lab. It's Caitlin.</i>

41
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,771
Is she okay?

42
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:27,689
I don't know.

43
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,192
Her biometrics are stable,

44
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:33,071
but I just felt another
huge wave of grief from her.

45
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:35,073
I just keep picturing Dad die.

46
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:38,242
It's all I can see over and over again.

47
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:41,412
- Him on the floor.
- What is wrong with her?

48
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,873
Remember when Deathstorm took Caitlin?

49
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,709
It was trying to change her
into something else, its bride.

50
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,711
But it still needs her
to experience more grief

51
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,338
before the transformation is complete.

52
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,423
Must've dialed up
one of her worst memories.

53
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,230
You're going to be okay.
We've got a plan.

54
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:55,676
What if it doesn't work?

55
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,637
What if I'm stuck like this forever?

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,805
Don't even think like that.

57
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,011
Just get some rest
and I'll be here when you wake up.

58
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,146
How much longer till Chester
has the cryo-circuit ready?

59
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,940
I'm not sure. Maybe an hour.

60
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,179
We don't have that kind of time.

61
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,609
I'm gonna call backup.

62
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,158
- We still need to find Deathstorm.
- I know.

63
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,035
Can you feel anything?

64
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:24,038
No. It's like he's disappeared.

Okay. Keep trying, Gideon.

74
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,123
In the meantime, could you run a search

75
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:11,169
for any extra-dimensional energies
or cold fusion anomalies in the area?

76
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,296
Of course, Barry Allen. Search...

77
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:17,591

[distorted] Actually, I'm everywhere.

81
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,150
And nowhere.

82
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,447
I was born a long time ago.

83
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,658
Before Maltus, before the stars.

84
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,579
During that lonely blackest of nights.

85
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,336
I was there when the first gas cloud
sank and collapsed.

86
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:59,717
I was there when the first beings
drew their final hissing breaths.

87
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,388
I am decline. I am entropy.

88
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,726
I am the master of death
and all of its inhabitants.

89
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,070
My beautiful boy.

That's better.

00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:40,216
Where I'm from,
there's not so much noise.

94
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,010
If you take one step toward Caity,

95
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,054
I will send you back
to the hell you came from.

96
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,723
My home is much further than hell.

97
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,268
It's a lonely place.

98
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:54,438
At least it was,
until Ronnie died in a Singularity.

99
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,190
His mind found me.

100
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:01,654
His grief became my hunger
and his love became my guiding light.

101
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,700
So you're trying to take my sister
'cause you're lonely?

102
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,073
Ronnie's feelings
showed me how to end my suffering.

103
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:09,996
I'll show you suffering.

104

You can't hurt me.

00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,042
You're still fighting back,

106
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,884
just like your father intended.

107
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,848
So what? You got my dad
hiding in some other room

108
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,933
so you can sic his grief ghost on me?

109
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,186
My phantoms only appear to those
who can grieve them.

110
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,231
Which is why you won't be
having any visitors.

111
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,734
- What the hell does that mean?
- It's simple.

112
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,736
You don't have anyone to grieve,

113
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,821
because your grief isn't real.

114
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,239
I wish
I knew that all those nights

115
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,118
I was drinking away my pain
at O'Shaughnessy's.

116
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,038
The sadness you've experienced
in your existence

117
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:56,292
is just a copy, an echo of real emotion.

118
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,671
Like all of your feelings. Like you.

119
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,257
You are so full of it.

120
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:06,385
Then why can't I sense
any loss inside your mind?

121
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:11,724
Why can't I smell those hormones
dancing along your neural receptors?

122
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,519
It's because when Thomas
built you in his lab,

123
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,522
he gave you everything
you need to protect Caitlin.

124
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:22,193
Cryo-kineticism, healing, rage.

125
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,198
But as for the rest of you,
he just copied what was inside her.

126
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,619
He cloned a few scraps of her feelings,
tinkered with her personality traits.

127
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,581
But he never gave you
any authentic emotions.

128
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,377
He never built you
your own consciousness, your own soul.

129
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,964
- That's not true.
- Grief and pain,

130
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:48,094
those are the things that make people
truly alive, and you don't have them.

131
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,093
Shut up.

132
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:53,391
Because you are not a real person.
You're a faulty experiment,

133
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:56,394
a broken mirror who can't
aid me in my cause like the others.

134
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:58,145
I said shut the hell up!

135
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,698
Come on, come on! In here.

136
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,162
[gasps]

137
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,249
Let me guess,
your ghost dad's back, too?

138
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,542
Yeah, I lost him in the hall.

139
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,168
I don't get it.

140
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,437
These things can walk through walls.

141
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,061
Why the hell aren't they coming in here?

142
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,716
I don't know. But is it getting
kind of toasty in here?

143
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,841
Yeah.

144
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,846
Oh, crap! The doors.

145
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,973
There's no way out.

146
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,601
They chased us in here on purpose.

147
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,733
No, this isn't real.

148
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,569
You're not my mom.

149
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,781
Argh! [panting]

150
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,284
Please, sweetie, stop.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

151
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,955
This is just another manipulation.

152
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,751
Just some part of Deathstorm
trying to screw with my head.

153
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,021
Why would you say this about me?
I'm your mom.

154
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,045
No, you're not.

155
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,549
I came here to help you
because I love you so much.

156
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:11,926
You have to believe me.

157
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,140
I've been watching you, your life,

158
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,601
what's happening to Iris.

159
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,326
There's no cure
for her temporal sickness.

160
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,023
No secret answer.

161
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,151
You're going to lose her forever.

162
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:29,819
That's not true.

163
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,573
Her condition's stabilizing.
I can still save her.

164
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,656
Like you saved me?

165
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm trying to warn you, Barry.

166
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,370
You can't have a family.

167
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,663
Your father died.

168
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,499
I died.

169
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,252
And now your poor, sick wife
is going to die, too.

170
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,561
And there's nothing you can do
to stop it.

171
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,934
Sure I can't get you a cup?

172
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,103
Oh, no, thank you.

173
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,687
Eddie.

174
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,529
You know what sounds great right now?

175
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:13,238
Some soup.

176
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,573
Soup? Really?

177
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,535
Why don't I whip up some of
Uncle Robern's famous chicken noodle?

178
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,745
Oh, yeah. Yummy, babe.

179
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,580
Okay, I'm gonna need some chicken stock.

180
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,250
Um, uh...

181
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,379
You know what would be great
with that, too?

182
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,631
Some chipotle chilies.

183
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:31,966
Yummy.

184
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,049
Do we have any?

185
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,554
Yeah, I'm sure they're in there.
Just keep looking.

186
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,640
Nope, not seeing any chilies.

187
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,394
But I do see you, Sue Dearbon.

188
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,604
- Argh!
- Come on. Let's go.

189
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,609
[groans]

190
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,486
Come on, guys.

191
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,867
You know nobody's leaving
till Iris is all better.

192
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:04,789
[Frost] <i>The team's trapped.</i>

193
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,790
<i>How's Caity doing?</i>

194
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,545
It feels like she's getting worse,
and I have no idea why.

195
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,088
Oh, God!

196
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,674
There's something coming.

197
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:16,968
It's more grief.

198
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:19,971
Caity, no.

199
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,933
[Frost] Her vitals are spiking
and she's burning up.

200
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,315
She keeps changing,
and Deathstorm is nowhere near.

201
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
No...

202
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,192
It's not Deathstorm.

203
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,403
I have felt this grief before.

204
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,697
It's the team's. It's Barry's

205
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,409
- and Allegra's and Chester's and Iris.
- [voices chattering indistinctly]

206
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,955
I can feel all of their pain
and their sadness

207
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:49,084
flooding out of them
and pouring into Caitlin.

208
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,838
That's why he sent the ghosts
after them.

209
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,633
The more grief they feel,
the more goes into Caity.

210
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,010
And the sooner she becomes his bride.

211
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,845
- [deep voice] Burn.
- [gasps]

212
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,554
Burn.

213
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,725
War. Home.

214
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,214
Please tell me you can do something
to stop this grief.

215
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,281
Or you can use your powers
to help her somehow.

216
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,116
Frost, I am sure as hell gonna try.

217
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:23,368
[Mark] Everybody decent?

218
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,038
Finally. What took you so long?

219
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,957
The cryogenics department
at Fast Track Labs

220
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,643
has really improved
the security recently.

221
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,043
Just not as much as they thought.

222
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,544
<i>Et voilà,</i> madame.

223
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,880
Your very own cryo-circuit.

224
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,258
Well, you must be the infamous Mark.

225
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,095
This baby here
should modify the MAC no problem.

226
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,305
And then we can temporarily
transform you into...

227
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,825
I'm sorry.
What are we transforming you into again?

228
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,184
The anti-Deathstorm.

229
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,480
Right. Man, you kids on Team Flash
do some crazy stuff.

230
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,563
[wheezing]

231
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,152
- Is Caitlin gonna be okay?
- Yes.

232
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,363
As soon as we get the MAC working.
Let's go.

233
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,074
I got her.

234
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
[groans]

235
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,253
Okay.

236
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,590
Trying to blast a hole in the door
is out.

237
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,967
What the frak
is this thing made of? Titanium?

238
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,635
Actually, yes.

239
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,721
And all my tech just bricked

240
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,555
from the heat.

241
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,559
And then the thermostat died at...

242
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,021
137?

243
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,607
Great. So not only
are we trapped in here,

244
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,401
but we don't know how hot it is?

245
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,905
Humans don't go hyperthermic till
200 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take,

246
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,117
- which means that...
- You've got about 20 minutes.

247
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,372
When your internal temperature
reaches 105 degrees,

248
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:51,999
blood flow starts to decrease.

249
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,127
At 107, organs fail
and brain function slows.

250
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,712
By about 109...

251
00:13:58,297 --> 00:13:59,465
you'll believe in quitting.

252
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,675
[Allegra] Don't listen to him, Chuck.

253
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,594
Nothing he says means anything.

254
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,179
"Chuck"?

255
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,012
You let her call you that?

256
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,476
No, no, she's right.

257
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,563
You're not real.
I'm getting that door open.

258
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,069
Why do we love science, Chester?

259
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,363
Because regardless of who's

260
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,866
conducting the experiment,
the results are right and wrong.

261
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,242
Black and white.

262
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,080
Just like this situation.

263
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,501
Whether I'm real or not,
you care about each other.

264
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,672
And here you are, trapped in a room.

265
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,886
Forced to watch each other die.

266
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,225
And when you do...

267
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,185
[speaking Spanish]

268
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,366
I'm done with your games.

269
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,910
You could burn me alive right now.

270
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,204
But you won't.
So tell me, what do you want?

271
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,580
I want to prepare you, Barry.

272
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,792
Iris' impending death
won't just mean that she's gone,

273
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,712
it will mean that Nora and Bart
will never exist.

274
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,216
I'm not trying to be cruel.

275
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:29,054
But the truth is,
your legacy isn't heroism.

276
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,267
It's heartbreak.

277
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,018
You know what people like you
will never understand?

278
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,819
Love is a strength, not a liability.

279
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,028
The heartbreak

280
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,866
that I've suffered,
the people I've lost,

281
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,494
they don't hold me back.

282
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,205
They make me fight that much harder.

283
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,101
And I'm going to fight for Iris.

284
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,445
Then why didn't you fight for me?

285
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,963
Why did you stand by
while Thawne stabbed me in the gut?

286
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,298
Thawne didn't kill you!

287
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,593
He killed my mom.

288
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,600
And as much as it hurt,
I have accepted her death.

289
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,062
And what about the rest of them?

290
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,485
Thank you for everything.

291
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,486
[grunts]

292
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,824
- Have you accepted all their deaths too?
- [screams]

293
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:36,079
Barry told us about Deathstorm and
the ghost that he sent after Chester.

294
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,883
You're one of those apparitions,
aren't you?

295
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,293
And where's your precious Barry now?

296
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:44,087
Nowhere to be found, as usual,

297
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,467
while you're laid up in here,
waiting to die.

298
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,470
Iris is not going to die.

299
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,179
[Eddie] Trust me.

300
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,392
As a dead man myself, she's toast.

301
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,604
And she knows it.

302
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:03,981
Just like I knew.

303
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,778
<i>I thought my sacrifice
would mean something.</i>

304
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,448
<i>That I could erase
the Reverse Flash from existence.</i>

305
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:16,286
<i>That finally... I could be a hero.</i>

306
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
[Iris West gasps]

307
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,749
But then Eobard Thawne came back.

308
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:26,213
Again and again, and again and again.

309
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,549
What I did...

310
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,677
it didn't matter at all.

311
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,597
I died for nothing.

312
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,601
And now you've made the same mistake.

313
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,771
You sacrificed yourself for nothing.

314
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,356
I saved Barry...

315
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,693
and I helped stop Armageddon.

316
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:48,985
Then what happened?

317
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:53,073
The timeline got reset, but you're
still suffering the consequences.

318
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:58,704
Can't you see? Your death
is gonna be just as pointless as mine.

319
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,625
Something's wrong.

320
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,215
Why are you... happy?

321
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,091
Who? Me?

322
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,094
Oh, well, that's easy.

323
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,555
I'm young, I'm rich.

324
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,930
I'm a total dime.

325
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,684
And before you so rudely destroyed

326
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,229
another one of my brand-new phones,
I hit the panic button.

327
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,189
Hey, Detective Pretty Boy.

328
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,111
Come on, before it wears off. Come on.

329
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,657
Nana?

330
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:39,703
No, please don't go.

331
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:41,912
Chyre...

332
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,626
Chyre, hold on, man, please. Chyre.

333
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,710
What did you do to them?

334
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,839
I showed them the deaths
of the people they love.

335
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,344
And now, with the help of their grief,

336
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,556
the bride's transformation
will be complete.

337
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,105
All right. Cryo-circuit's functional.

338
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,149
Ready to merge your cold fusion cells

339
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,151
with Douchestorm's
dimensional particles.

340
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:16,614
This has to work.

341
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,451
Hey, master cryogeneticist over here.

342
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,619
Not just a pretty face.

343
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:21,702
Trust me.

344
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,454
Okay.

345
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,873
Cryo-circuit is alive.

346
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,084
Activating augmentation receptors.

347
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,002
[machine whirring]

348
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,507
Deploying dimensional particles.

349
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,886
[groaning]

350
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,311
[exhales]

351
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:49,940
Hey, are you okay?

352
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,357
Did it work?

353
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,320
- Are you anti-Deathstorm?
- Only one way to find out.

354
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,497
What's wrong?

355
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,333
I'm just me.

356
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,460
No fire powers, no nothing.

357
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,337
This stupid machine didn't work.

358
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,464
I mean, that doesn't make sense.

359
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,386
It should work on anyone, any organism
or sentient being with a consciousness.

360
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,931
Or anyone who's truly alive.

361
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,445
I guess we know
what the issue here is then.

362
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,812
It's me.

363
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,740
[Mark] How can you be the problem?

364
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,701
- It doesn't make sense.
- You said it yourself.

365
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,745
The reaction depends on the MAC

366
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,122
being able to put particles
in someone's consciousness.

367
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,916
What if that person doesn't have one?

368
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,043
What are you talking about?

369
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,807
I mean, of course
you have a consciousness.

370
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,505
Not according to Deathstorm.

371
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,885
He and I had a little chat
about why everyone on Team Flash

372
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,762
got visited by a ghost except me.

373
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,225
He said that I couldn't experience grief

374
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,977
because when Thomas created me,

375
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,646
he just gave me a copy
of all of Caity's emotions.

376
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,524
He's obviously just messing with you.

377
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,360
Don't let that fire freak
get in your head.

378
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,113
What if he's not?

379
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,825
Do you know what my earliest memory is?

380
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,954
It's not of Carla singing me a lullaby

381
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,873
or Thomas throwing me on his shoulders.

382
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,168
It's of Caity being hit by a car.

383
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,755
[screams]

384
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,383
'Cause that's the first time I woke up.

385
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,009
To take the hit.

386
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,849
And then I just drifted back
into her subconsciousness,

387
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,560
locked away there for years.

388
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,983
Watching Caity live her life
and have friends.

389
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,988
You know, so when I finally
started coming out more,

390
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,325
I wanted to make up
for lost time, you know?

391
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,495
Finally live a life.

392
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,918
Boy, was I stupid
for ever thinking that was possible.

393
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,337
'Cause it doesn't matter.

394
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,591
Doesn't matter how many
life coaches I get,

395
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,177
or if I get my own body

396
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,263
or do a bunch of art,
or get my own boyfriend.

397
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,099
Because I'll always

398
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,852
just be a copy of the original.

399
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:33,978
An echo.

400
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,357
'Cause I've never been really alive.

401
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,485
And now that's gonna get Caity killed.

402
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:44,989
Frost...

403
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:51,496
If you are not really alive,
where does that leave me?

404
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,500
You're the only person I've ever
cared about more than myself.

405
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,588
Or at least equal to myself.

406
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,340
I guess we're both screwed up, then.

407
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,593
Yeah, that's definitely true.

408
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:12,100
But the way I see it, you and I
have been through a lot, right?

409
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,520
And through all of those ups and downs,

410
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,190
I, for one, have seen you have
loads of emotions, all kinds.

411
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,319
Especially when it comes to Caitlin.

412
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,322
You love your sister like crazy.

413
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,782
And wherever that love came from,

414
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,201
whether you were born with it,

415
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,037
or your dad gave it to you,

416
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:36,791
or you put it together yourself
over time,

417
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,668
built it with pain and heartache...

418
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:44,007
That love is as real as it gets.

419
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,761
Believe me.

420
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,893
Then why didn't Deathstorm
use any of my grief?

421
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,271
He said he couldn't even find it in me.

422
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,583
Maybe he couldn't find it
because you've got it

423
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,567
buried so deep
in that foxy head of yours.

424
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,071
Maybe because you love so damn hard,

425
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,531
and you know the flip side
would totally suck.

426
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,953
Yeah, I mean,
I have been a little closed off lately.

427
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:16,748
I'm sorry, Snowflake.

428
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:22,629
Grief is a necessary part of life
and you are very much alive.

429
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,549
That's it.

430
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:28,842
Yes!

431
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,597
Frost, the MAC's been
working fine all along.

432
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,351
But the chemical reaction
was missing a necessary ingredient.

433
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,188
Frost, I think I know how to finish
your transformation.

434
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,110
Sue, Dad, it's not real.

435
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,696
You guys, you're stronger
than this bastard.

436
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,740
That's no way to talk about your fiancé.

437
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,326
I know you want our grief.

438
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,675
But you're not gonna get an ounce
from me.

439
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,497
I know you are not the real Eddie.

440
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,250
No, I'm not.

441
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:02,876
Because he died.

442
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,758
Just like you're gonna die, too.

443
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,472
No, it's not real.

444
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,683
[Eddie] Yes, it is.

445
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,228
Now you're gonna lose everything, Iris.

446
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,772
Your family, your future.

447
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,275
Everything you worked so hard for.

448
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,446
It hurts, doesn't it?

449
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,037
[speaking Spanish]

450
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,132
[in English] You and I, we had history.

451
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,760
But you and him had a future.

452
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,305
And that's so much worse, isn't it?

453
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,391
Because you're not just
watching him die.

454
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,854
You're watching everything
you could have shared die, too.

455
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,068
You can try all you want,

456
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,671
but you'll never get out of here, son.

457
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,073
And neither will she.

458
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:16,785
She's gonna die...

459
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,913
because you're not smart enough
to find a way out.

460
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,168
All that time tinkering with machines,

461
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,712
building countless gadgets,

462
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,757
and the one time you need
to come up with a big idea,

463
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,634
the one time it really matters...

464
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,762
you can't do a damn thing.

465
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,684
Chuck... I got you.

466
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,727
It's okay.

467
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,107
It's... It's not okay.

468
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,472
It's not okay. I'm so sorry
I couldn't fix this, Allegra.

469
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,278
No, don't feel bad.

470
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,447
That's how they want us to feel.

471
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,869
But Chuck, the truth is...

472
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:04,833
right now, with you,

473
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,879
I feel happy. Happy I met you.

474
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,844
Me, too. Me, too.

475
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,646
[screams]

Stop! Stop it!

478
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,777
No! You stop fighting, Barry.
Give in to the pain.

479
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,612
The pain you still feel.

480
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,157
Let your sorrow wash over you.

481
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,286
So the bride may be reborn.

482
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,831
[deep voice] I can see them.

483
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:49,836
Stars, endless stars.

484
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,423
Hey, Caity.

485
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,178
I'm not even sure if you can hear me,

486
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,619
but there's something I need to say.

487
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:07,896
You know, I used to be afraid
that because we shared a body,

488
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,859
I was only gonna get to live
half a life.

489
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,320
That I was only gonna be half a person.

490
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,533
<i>I realize now that isn't true.</i>

491
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,456
<i>You didn't take anything from me.</i>

492
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,129
<i>In fact, it's just the opposite.</i>

493
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,636
You make my life complete.

494
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,950
And I got to be honest,
I'm a little worried

495
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,534
we're not going to make it out of this.

496
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,771
And that I might lose you forever.

497
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,026
And I can't handle that.

498
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:56,986
I would die.

499
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,826
I love you more than anything.

500
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:07,955
[groans]

501
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,568
Is that what's supposed to happen?

502
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:12,626
Argh!

503
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,153
The MAC's been working fine all along.

504
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,506
But the chemical reaction
was missing one ingredient,

505
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,597
the spark that gave Deathstorm life.

506
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,473
Grief.

507
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,935
Frost just had to let herself feel it.

508
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,189
[groans]

509
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:42,323
Damn! I've never felt this warm before.

510
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,783
It's all that power.

511
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:47,578
Frost, I can feel it
radiating off of you.

512
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:52,417
That's 'cause I'm not just Frost...
I'm Hellfrost.

513
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:03,635
[gasps]

514
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,069
[panting]

515
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,489
Sue, Dad, are you guys okay?

516
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,033
Yeah, I'm okay. We're okay.

517
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,075
The team...

518
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,870
They're all okay.

519
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:31,747
So, hot stuff...

520
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:33,958
what do we do now?

521
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:35,960
We kick some ass

522
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,212
and save my sister.

523
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,596
You look totally badass.

524
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,389
Thanks. I feel badass.

525
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,267
But Caity's not okay.
In fact, Cecile says she's worse.

526
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,393
Then this isn't over.

527
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,562
Deathstorm is back
in his home dimension,

528
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,749
which means he can still
put guilt inside of Caitlin.

529
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,358
Or send more ghosts after you guys.

530
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:02,070
Yeah, I talked to Iris.
Deathstorm sent one to the loft.

531
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:04,197
You saved the whole team.

532
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,782
And now I'm gonna save Caity

533
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,117
by extinguishing this son of a bitch.

534
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,471
Hey, when that thing comes back,
you're gonna need some backup.

535
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,497
No, I'm the only one who can do this.

536
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,391
Even Barry's lightning can't stop him.

537
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,176
- And if anything goes wrong?
- You'll get me out of there in a flash.

538
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,423
Okay, wait. Flash, lightning...
Are you saying that he...

539
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:25,926
Whoa.

540
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,470
[chuckles]

541
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,723
But if he can't help you,

542
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,868
you've got to let me try
adjusting my gauntlets.

543
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,252
- I can pump up the cryo-kinetic outputs.
- There's no time.

544
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,772
Then maybe we need to make some time.

545
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,566
Look, I told you. I was born for this.

546
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,778
But I'll give you something
to remember me by.

547
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,122
- Damn.
- There's more where that came from.

548
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:56,498
I...

549
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,875
Did I break you?

550
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,504
No, I...

551
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,216
Go save your sister.

552
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,082
I'll be here when you get back.

553
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,017
[Mark] <i>Okay.
You guys do this all the time?</i>

554
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,061
Yep. That's the gig.

555
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:18,771
How do you stay so calm, man?

556
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,065
It's nerve-racking as hell.

557
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,609
Welcome to Superheroing 101.

558
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,323
This is it.

559
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,006
I can sense all that precious grief
inside you, Cait.

560
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,592
You're almost ready.

561
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,138
I've waited so long to end my solitude.

562
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,724
It's time to start our honeymoon,
my bride,

563
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,186
because I want forever
to start right now.

564
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,023
Surprise!

565
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:06,359
What have you done?

566
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,570
Now let's party.

567
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,819
Are you sure she can do this?

568
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:16,203
We have to trust her.

569
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,669
I will burn you to ash.

570
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,215
You first!

571
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:33,179
Come on, Frost. Give him hell.

572
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,001
You can't keep me from my bride.

573
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,586
Who do you think you are?

574
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:07,838
More than you can handle.

575
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,507
Go to hell!

576
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,133
[groans]

577
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,388
Now it's time for me to feed.

578
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,516
[grunts]

579
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,660
That's it, party people.

580
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,831
All traces of supplemental cold fusion
and barometric anomalies are gone.

581
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:45,917
What happened?

582
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:47,753
Frost saved you.

583
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,426
Hellfrost, you did it.

584
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:54,718
Hell yeah, I did.

585
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:55,969
That's my gal.

586
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:57,596
[Frost] <i>How's Caity?</i>

587
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,267
She's doing fine.

588
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,435
Thank God.

589
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,647
Hey, I have a bourbon straight up
waiting for you when you get back.

590
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:07,856
<i>Sounds great.</i>

591
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,193
Guys, I'm not feeling so hot.

592
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,658
- Her vitals are crashing.
- What?

593
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Frost.

594
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,654
You just woke up from a coma.
Are you sure you're up for this?

595
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:38,721
I have to be.

596
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:40,907
- What the hell happened?
- Mark, hey, hey...

597
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,284
- Why isn't she moving?
- We don't know.

598
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,603
We don't know. But Caitlin is working
on her, and she is going to save her.

599
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,938
- Okay, I can help.
- No, you can't.

600
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,333
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.

601
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:51,317
- I can't...
- Mark, hey, it's going to be okay.

602
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Caitlin has to focus.

603
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,154
Hey, let's just give them
some space, yeah?

604
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,380
Okay, her pupils are dilated.
Her heart rate's spiking. Talk to me.

605
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,553
Tell me what happened out there.

606
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,621
We manipulated her cryo powers
in the MAC

607
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,307
so that she could absorb
Deathstorm's energy.

608
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,331
It's what saved you.

609
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,726
But Deathstorm's been doing this
for a millennia.

610
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,169
So I'm guessing he can
handle a lot more power than she can.

611
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,255
- [machine beeping]
- She's going into cardiac arrest.

612
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,694
Okay, I'm gonna inject her
with cold fusion.

613
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,596
That'll bring Frost back
and that'll kick in her ice healing.

614
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,315
Come on, Frost, come back to me.

615
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,167
You did it.

616
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,683
[machine flatlining]

617
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,102
No. No, no, no, that's impossible.

618
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,705
Her ice healing, it's not kicking in.

619
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,313
She's flatlining. Get me the paddles.

620
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,481
Here, here.

621
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,025
[paddles powering up]

622
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:16,609
Clear.

623
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:20,697
Clear.

624
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,327
[imperceptible]

625
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:55,982
Caitlin.

626
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,987
Caitlin, Caitlin.

627
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,103
<i>C. C.P.D. has lifted the citywide curfew</i>

628
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,397

<i>Citizens are cleared to fully resume
their normal...</i>

631
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,489
Well, Deathstorm's finally gone.

632
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,908
Frost is a real hero.

633
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,370
Caitlin and Barry have been
in there forever.

634
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,539
Frost is gonna pull through.

635
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,626
You doing okay, Mark?

636
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,128
Yeah, thanks.

637
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,267
I've been doing a lot of thinking,
you know.

638
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,595
Frost and I had a lot of plans.

639
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,015
Like I scored this trip
to the Himalayas,

640
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,559
where you jump out of a chopper

641
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:15,020
and snowboard down,
and at the bottom, at base camp,

642
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:19,066
they have this cute little restaurant
where every dessert is made of ice.

643
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,695
I know she's probably gonna say
it's stupid,

644
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:26,073
but then secretly not hate it at all.

645
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,492
Kind of like how she feels about me.

646
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:33,706
I just wanna make her smile.

647
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,420
There's nothing better than that.

648
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,423
Well, she's lucky
to have you in her life.

649
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,259
We all know I'm lucky
to have her in mine.

650
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:50,972
Barry.

651
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,651
Something happened.

652
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,032
Where is she?

653
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:13,996
Come on, where is she?

654
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:17,875
Frost died.

655
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,217
That's not possible.

656
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,723
I'm sorry. She didn't make it.

657
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,308
She's gone.

658
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:40,939
