1
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,161
Sir, this is her.

2
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,441
The girl who tells fortunes?

3
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:06,561
They're doing a magic spell.
To make it win a race.

4
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,801
The horse's name is Monaghan Boy.

5
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,241
Kempton. 3:00. Monday.

6
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,681
You ladies have a bet yourselves,
but don't tell anyone else.

7
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,521
And Abraham
made his home in a cave.

8
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:54,561
But it was good. Because
God resided there with him.

9
00:02:55,281 --> 00:03:01,121
You see, children, God does not care
if you live in a slum, or in a mansion.

10
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:05,761
God does not care if you are rich,
or you are poor...

11
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,041
Morning, sir.

12
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,721
Morning, Mr Shelby.

13
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,041
- Come on, lad.
- Good day, sir.

14
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,801
- Morning, Mr Shelby.
- Sir.

15
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,801
Good day, Mr Shelby.

16
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,601
Finn?

17
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:36,841
Arthur's mad as hell.

18
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:43,201
What does a 10-year-old
know about hell? Eh?

19
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:44,801
I'm 11 Sunday.

20
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,721
I'm looking for Tommy.

21
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:00,721
Get your bets in now
for the 2:30 at Kempton.

22
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,641
Right, what we got on Percy Piper?

23
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:06,281
Piper going well in the soft, lads.
Down to fours.

24
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:07,641
Fours.

25
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,201
- Okay, Monaghan Boy?
- Wanna push that down, mate.

26
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:11,281
Two to one, still.

27
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,481
Two to one. Get your bets in now.

28
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:23,041
What do you say? We got Topper in,
he's an old favourite.

29
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:24,481
Four to one.

30
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,601
Tommy! Tommy!

31
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:31,121
Tommy, look at the book.
Just look.

32
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,121
- Tommy!
- All on Monaghan Boy.

33
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:34,881
- Good work, john.
- Tommy!

34
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,161
Get in here. Now.

35
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,841
That'll be six pennies, nipper.

36
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,881
That's ten bob you'll see for that.

37
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:55,241
Now, you were seen doing the
powder trick down at Garrison Courts.

38
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,201
Times are hard.

39
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:59,641
People need a reason to lay a bet.

40
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,441
There was a Chinese.

41
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,201
The washerwomen say she's a witch.

42
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,001
- It helps them believe.
- We don't mess with Chinese.

43
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,681
- Look at the book.
- Chinese have cutters of their own.

44
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,601
We agreed, Arthur.

45
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:17,761
I'm taking charge
of drumming up their money.

46
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,441
What if Monaghan Boy wins, Tommy?

47
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,801
You fixing races now?

48
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,881
Do you have permission from Billy Kimber
to be fixing races? Hmm?

49
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,361
And what's got into you?

50
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:38,121
You think we can take on
the Chinese and Billy Kimber?

51
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:42,241
- Billy's got a bloody army!
- I think, Arthur.

52
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,761
That's what I do.

53
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,761
I think.

54
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,161
So that you don't have to.

55
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,601
There's news from Belfast.

56
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,521
I'm calling a family council tonight
at 8:00.

57
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:08,961
I want all of us there.

58
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,121
You hear me?

59
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:12,921
There's trouble coming.

60
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:14,721
All right, shut up now. Shut up.

61
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:20,881
Comrades, we're here today
to take a vote on strike action.

62
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,041
Yes!

63
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,161
But before we have a
show of hands for that,

64
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,241
let's have a show of hands from
all those who fought in France.

65
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,521
All those who stood side by side
with your comrades,

66
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,721
and watched your comrades fall.

67
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:37,121
Raise your hands.

68
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:44,401
The blood shed on Flanders Fields.

69
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:46,841
The sweat of your brows.

70
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,481
Who reaps the rewards?

71
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,121
Is it you?

72
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,561
- No, no.
- No!

73
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:53,681
Is it your wives?

74
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:55,121
- No, no.
- No, no.

75
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,961
Well, who then?
Do they stand among us?

76
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,041
<i>'NU. 'NM!</i>

77
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,801
Or do they sit at home,
comfortable, with a full belly?

78
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:07,121
While you scrape to find enough
to put shoes on your children's feet!

79
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,521
And what is the reward they offer you
for your sacrifices made?

80
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,761
A fucking cut in your wages!

81
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,201
That is your reward!

82
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,681
Raise a hand,
all those who want to strike!

83
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:21,481
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

84
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:15,321
On the house, Mr Shelby.

85
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,641
- I'll take a mild.
- Right.

86
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,961
Cheers, Thomas.

87
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,041
Good health to you.

88
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:08,561
Crown of a prince.

89
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,921
- Soon to be king, I'd bet.
- You don't bet.

90
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:18,521
No, but these past few days
I've been speculating.

91
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:23,841
About what?

92
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:26,841
One of my union comrades has a sister.

93
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,761
Works in the telegraph office
at the BSA factory.

94
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,121
She says, over the past week,

95
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,521
they've had messages coming up
from London to the brass.

96
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,841
From Winston Churchill himself.

97
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:43,641
Something about a robbery.

98
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:47,521
A robbery of national significance,
it's said.

99
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,001
She found a list of names

100
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,001
left in the telegraph machine.

101
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,721
And on that list was your name
and my name together.

102
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,417
What kind of a list would
have the name of a communist

103
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:05,401
and the name of a bookmaker
side by side?

104
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:13,801
Perhaps it's a list of men
who give false hope to the poor.

105
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,561
The only difference between
you and me, Freddie,

106
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:19,841
is that, sometimes

107
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,481
my horses stand a chance of winning.

108
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,721
You know, there are days

109
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,561
when I hear about
the cuttings and beatings

110
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:35,521
that I really wish I'd let you
take that bullet in France.

111
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:40,441
Believe me,
there are nights I wish you had.

112
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:44,681
Hey!

113
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,361
They're gonna kill me!

114
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,801
On three! One, two, three, go!

115
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:56,321
Breathe, Danny. Breathe!

116
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,721
They're gonna kill me!
They're gonna kill me!

117
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:02,121
- They're gonna kill me!
- Danny! Danny, Danny, you're home.

118
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,721
We're all home in England.

119
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:05,121
You're not in France.

120
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:08,481
You're not an artillery shell, Danny,
you're a man.

121
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:09,721
Eh?

122
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,681
You're not a whizz-bang,
you're a human being, Danny.

123
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:15,681
You're all right.
You're all right.

124
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:17,321
You're all right.

125
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:19,361
Up, UP!

126
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,441
It's all right.

127
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,521
It's all right.

128
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:30,721
Oh, hell.

129
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,481
Did I do it again?

130
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,521
You did it again, Danny.

131
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,761
You gotta stop doing this, man.

132
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,281
- He's all right.
- Oh God, Mr Shelby, I'm sorry.

133
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,361
It's all right.

134
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:47,801
- You go home to your wife now, Danny.
- Yeah.

135
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,361
And get all that smoke and mud
out of your head, eh?

136
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:53,001
Yes, Mr Shelby. I'm sorry.

137
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,201
Go on.

138
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:02,201
Mr Shelby, you have to do
something about him.

139
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,681
Damn right, Harry.

140
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,281
You pay the Peaky Blinders
a lot of money for protection.

141
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:10,001
You're the law around here now, Tommy,
aren't you?

142
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:13,137
Maybe you should put a bullet
in Danny Whizz-Bang's head

143
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,161
like they do with mad horses.

144
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,121
Maybe you'll have to put a bullet
in my head someday, too.

145
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:32,241
Bring the bill to the Peaky Blinders.

146
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:33,721
We'll take care of it.

147
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,361
Look at the gun.

148
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:58,921
- Recognise it?
- Mmm.

149
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,601
- Fuck!
- Get up off your arse, you mumping pig.

150
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:06,281
Aunt Poll, what the fuck
did you do that for?

151
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,321
Finn was playing with this
this afternoon by the cut.

152
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,761
It was loaded.
Nearly blew Ada's tits off.

153
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:13,937
It must have fell out of me pocket.

154
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:16,137
He said he found it on the
sideboard of the betting shop.

155
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:17,281
With bullets in it.

156
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:19,121
I

157
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:20,801
I must have been drunk.

158
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:23,721
When are you not drunk?

159
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,961
Look, Aunt Polly, I'm sorry.

160
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:28,521
I'm... I'm sorry.

161
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,841
We'll keep this between ourselves

162
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:34,481
if you swear not to leave guns
lying around.

163
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,201
Look, I know having four kids
without a woman is hard,

164
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:43,081
but my boot's harder.
Now come on, were late.

165
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,241
Right!

166
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,801
I've called this family meeting because
I've got some very important news.

167
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,721
Scudboat and Lovelock
got back from Belfast last night.

168
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:57,241
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

169
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,521
They were in a pub on the
Shankhill Road yesterday,

170
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,601
and in that pub there was a copper.

171
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:06,241
Handing out these.

172
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,801
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

173
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:17,641
They're recruiting Protestant Irishmen
to come over here as Special.

174
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,281
- To do what?
- To clean up the city, Ada.

175
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:22,201
He's the Chief Inspector.

176
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:26,921
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

177
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:28,841
How do you know so bloody much?

178
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,321
'Cause I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

179
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:33,041
And why didn't you tell me?

180
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,361
I'm telling you.

181
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,481
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

182
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:43,161
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA.

183
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:44,921
And the Austin works, lately.

184
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:47,721
Now the papers
are talking about sedition.

185
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:49,521
And revolution.

186
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,001
I reckon it's communists he's after.

187
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,521
So this copper's gonna
leave us alone, right?

188
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:58,561
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away from him.

189
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,041
They say Catholic men who crossed him
used to disappear in the night.

190
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,401
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.

191
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:05,761
We bloody fought for the King.

192
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,121
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.

193
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,801
We're not scared of coppers.

194
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:11,681
- He's right.
- If they come for us,

195
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,361
we'll cut them a smile each.

196
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:15,641
So, Arthur. Is that it?

197
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,321
What do you think, Aunt Poll?

198
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,641
This family does everything open.

199
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,321
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

200
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,161
No.

201
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,361
Nothing that's women's business.

202
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,641
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business

203
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,361
while you boys were away at war.

204
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:34,361
What's changed?

205
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,641
We came back.

206
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:40,081
And the Lord will smite the unholy

207
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,841
when the great judgement comes.

208
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:44,401
And judgment is coming, my friends.

209
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,921
Judgment is coming to this wicked city.

210
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:52,521
And your wickedness
and your fornication will be revealed.

211
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,561
You cannot hide from the Creator.

212
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:59,561
You cannot hide
from the Almighty himself.

213
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,721
The Creator sees all.

214
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,441
You cannot hide
from the true and living God.

215
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,401
Get off with ya!

216
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:12,721
Ahh!

217
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:18,201
Fuck off.

218
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,761
That's it. I don't go any further.

219
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,641
I have ten minutes.
What do you want?

220
00:18:58,321 --> 00:18:59,841
An explanation.

221
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:07,001
Always been able to tell
when you're hiding something.

222
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,481
People round here talk.

223
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,041
Some of them work at the BSA.

224
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:16,321
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

225
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:19,521
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

226
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:24,681
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

227
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:26,361
Speak.

228
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,561
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

229
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,561
It was meant to be routine.

230
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:47,161
I had a buyer in London
for some motorcycles.

231
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:51,721
I asked my men to steal me four bikes
with petrol engines.

232
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:56,081
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

233
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:59,881
<i>There's a still inside the factory
makes tram line gin.</i>

234
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,921
<i>They picked up the wrong fucking crate.</i>

235
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,321
<i>The boys dropped it
at Charlie Strong's yard, as agreed.</i>

236
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:15,361
<i>Must have taken it from the
proofing bay, instead of the export bay.</i>

237
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,201
Holy sweet baby of Mary.

238
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:26,241
Inside we found 25 Lewis machine guns,

239
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,881
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

240
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,081
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

241
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,321
Jesus, Tommy.

242
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:37,881
All bound for Libya.

243
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:42,641
Sitting right there
in Charlie Strong's yard.

244
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:46,921
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

245
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,201
We put them in the stables
out of the rain.

246
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,401
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

247
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:59,521
So that's why they sent a cop
from Belfast?

248
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,281
Maybe, maybe not.

249
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:08,281
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man.

250
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:09,921
You're not a fool.

251
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,841
You sell those guns to anyone who has
use to them, you will hang.

252
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:21,041
Dump them somewhere
the police can find them.

253
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:24,057
Maybe if they know they haven't fallen
into the wrong hands,

254
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,801
this might blow over.

255
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,321
- Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.
- No.

256
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,441
He won't move contraband
under a full moon.

257
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:34,721
Three days until it wanes.

258
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:36,841
Then you'll do the right thing?

259
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:41,681
You have your mother's common sense.

260
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:43,761
But your father's devilment.

261
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,801
I see them fighting.

262
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,401
Let your mother win.

263
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,001
I got tickets for the penny crush.

264
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:42,841
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

265
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,321
I'm not in the mood
for the pictures tonight, Ada.

266
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:49,281
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

267
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:50,681
Let's just walk a bit.

268
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:53,481
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

269
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:56,441
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

270
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,177
They have friends everywhere,
we'd have to walk to London.

271
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:02,201
I'm with you 'cause you're the
only man round here not scared of them.

272
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,361
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

273
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:07,201
But you love me
more than you fear them, right?

274
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:11,001
I don't want to be
always sneaking about.

275
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,721
- Soon, we'll tell them.
- When?

276
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:20,681
How did the family meeting go?

277
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,121
Usual.

278
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,601
- There's a new copper coming.
- I heard.

279
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:28,921
Mmm.

280
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,041
And Tommy says
he's after the likes of you.

281
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:35,641
So maybe you should burn your books
and stop making speeches.

282
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,521
Oh, my Ada.

283
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:42,001
The only princess of the Royal Family
of the kingdom of Small Heath.

284
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:45,521
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

285
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,521
Give me a kiss, Princess Ada.

286
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,921
I'm here about the job as a barmaid.

287
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,161
- Are you mad?
- Am I what?

288
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,761
- Do you know about this place?
- I saw it in an advertisement.

289
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,681
- Job's been filled.
- It was in yesterday's paper.

290
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,161
Believe me, love,
I'm doing you a favour.

291
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,801
I'm not asking for favours,
I'm asking for employment.

292
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:01,481
You're too... nice.

293
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,441
- How would you know?
- And too pretty.

294
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:06,721
They'd have you up against a wall.

295
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,721
I have experience. And references.

296
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:18,641
- What part of Ireland are you from?
- Galway.

297
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:19,881
Oh.

298
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:21,481
I worked in Dublin.

299
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:24,281
Me mother was from Galway.

300
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:28,961
You're too pretty.

301
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:30,761
Watch.

302
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,401
And listen.

303
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,761

my singing made them cry
and stopped them fighting.

317
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,441
Well, I hope you know a lot of songs.

318
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:18,761
Babies discarded

319
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:21,081
with the fish bones and egg shells.

320
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,161
Girls,

321
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,401
11 years old,

322
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:31,761
pierced and punctured by old men

323
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:33,281
for thrupence a time.

324
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:36,081
Rutted upon like animals.

325
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:38,961
Degradation.

326
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:42,521
Fathers with their daughters,

327
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:45,361
brothers and sisters sharing beds.

328
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,681
Beggars and thieves
left to run in the streets.

329
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:55,521
And astride the whole stinking pile
of wounds and rotting flesh

330
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:58,281
your masters!

331
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,321
The men who you touch your cap to.

332
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:06,441
The Peaky Blinders!

333
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:12,881
The vicious, merciless gangs

334
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,521
who blind those that see

335
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:18,001
and cut out the tongues
of those who talk.

336
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:22,081
You are worse than them!

337
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:29,161
Those of you who have taken their
bribes these years since the war.

338
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:32,721
Those of you who look the other way.

339
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:36,001
You are worse than them!

340
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,601
God damn you for soiling your uniforms!

341
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:49,281
And then...
there are the IRA Fenians.

342
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,001
And the communists.

343
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:54,721
Blacker hearts still.

344
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:58,921
They feed on the pus
of all this corruption.

345
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,761
Like maggots in a corpse.

346
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:08,321
And, like maggots, if left to swell
they will eventually swarm like flies

347
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:13,881
and spread their rotten philosophy
across the country and across the world!

348
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,241
Those then

349
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:19,201
are our enemies.

350
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:22,801
A three-headed beast.

351
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:24,921
It is my job

352
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:27,921
to decapitate each one,
and by God I will do it!

353
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:34,241
I don't trust any of youse

354
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:37,521
until you earn my trust.

355
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:41,481
And that takes some earning.

356
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:50,001
These are the new men
who will bolster your ranks.

357
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:53,601
Good men,

358
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,681
from God-fearing families.

359
00:29:58,281 --> 00:29:59,721
By the time the sun sets

360
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,121
they will be sworn in
and in uniform.

361
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,881
And by sunrise tomorrow
they will be on the streets.

362
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:13,601
God help those who stand in our way!

363
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:20,201
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

364
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,161
Right.

365
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:23,961
Move out of the way for Mr Shelby.

366
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,561
- This way.
- Mr Shelby.

367
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:31,241
You see, ladies,
when you're out with a Blinder

368
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:32,521
you don't have to queue.

369
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,761
Right.

370
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:42,441
I want a blow job off both of you
before they let the ordinary people in.

371
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:44,841
Away you go. Take your hat off.

372
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:46,361
What the fuck!

373
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:49,001
Who the fuck are you?

374
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,201
I'm Arthur fucking Shelby!

375
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,321
Arthur Shelby.

376
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:19,441
Lead pack dog

377
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:21,201
of the Peaky Blinders.

378
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,321
Look at me.

379
00:31:57,121 --> 00:31:58,281
Bastard!

380
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:03,801
Your uniform?

381
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,201
Terrifying, I'm sure.

382
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:09,401
- Did he have a gun?
- No gun.

383
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:13,121
Knife in his sock.
Cosh in his belt.

384
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:18,241
Now, Mr Shelby,

385
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:24,321
I want you to see this
as me introducing myself to you,

386
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,401
you understand.

387
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:30,921
In all the world,
the only thing that interests me

388
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,321
is the truth.

389
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,681
What do you know about the robbery?

390
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,081
What robbery?

391
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:53,241
I will ask you again.

392
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:57,681
What do you know about the robbery?

393
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:01,281
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

394
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,761
What fucking robbery?!

395
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:18,641
After 35 years of dealing
with animals like you,

396
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:22,721
I can tell just by sniffing the air

397
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,641
whether or not you're lying.

398
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,721
I'm not fucking lying, all right?

399
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,681
I'm not fucking lying!

400
00:33:39,521 --> 00:33:40,521
I know.

401
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,561
I see nothing of interest
behind the blood in your eyes.

402
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:53,001
And no blood in your veins
that could carry

403
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:56,601
even a trace of cunning or guile.

404
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,641
But understand this.

405
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:04,881
It is well within my power

406
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:08,441
to have you
and the rest of your scum family

407
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:12,881
face down in the canal
before the year is out.

408
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,921
On the other hand

409
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:23,521
we can help each other.

410
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,681
Is it always this busy in the day time?

411
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,281
Nah, these boys
are on their way to St Andrews.

412
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:44,681
- To pray?
- That'll be the day!

413
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:47,521
St Andrews is a football ground.
The Blues are playing.

414
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:49,001
That's the forward line there,

415
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:50,921
and that's the goalie,
believe it or not.

416
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:52,761
Hello!

417
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,281
I need a bottle of rum.

418
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:01,561
Grace, whatever it is,
it's on the house.

419
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:03,321
- A whole bottle?
- Yeah.

420
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,161
- White or dark rum?
- Don't care.

421
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:07,281
Right, lads, what'll it be? Two?

422
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,481
Thank you.

423
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:14,801
Harry said it's on the house.

424
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,361
Are you a whore?

425
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:23,601
'Cause if you're not,
you're in the wrong place.

426
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,681
He's one of them you warned me about.

427
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,881
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl,
but be careful.

428
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:37,737
If I say something's on the house,

429
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,441
then say nothing
to whoever you're serving.

430
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:41,761
If they decide that they want you,

431
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:44,321
then there's nothing
anybody could do about it.

432
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:46,961
Lucky for you,
since he got back from France

433
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:48,841
Tommy doesn't want anybody at all.

434
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,201
Yes, lads?

435
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,281
John, wipe the blood out of his eye.

436
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:57,761
- Since when did you give orders?
- I'm a trained nurse.

437
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:59,841
Don't make me laugh.

438
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:01,801
- It hurts me face.
- I bloody am.

439
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,681
You went to one first aid class
in the church hall

440
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:06,081
and got thrown out for giggling.

441
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:08,561
Not before I learned
how to stop somebody from choking.

442
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:10,241
I'm not bloody choking, am I?

443
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:12,801
You will be when I wrap this cloth
round your neck.

444
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:15,401
Let me see him.

445
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,401
All right, have this.

446
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:21,721
Give me that.

447
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:28,601
You're all right.

448
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:32,441
He said Mr Churchill sent him
to Birmingham.

449
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:35,881
National interest, he said.

450
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,441
Something about a robbery.

451
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:44,041
He said he wants us to help him.

452
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,121
We don't help coppers.

453
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:47,961
He knew all about our war records.

454
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:50,161
He said we're patriots.

455
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:52,081
Like him.

456
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:56,081
Wants us to be his eyes and ears.

457
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,561
I said.

458
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:05,801
I said we'd have a family meeting,
take a vote.

459
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,081
Well, why not? Hmm?

460
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,881
We've no truck with Fenians
or communists.

461
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:25,801
What's wrong with you?

462
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,481
What the fuck is wrong with him lately?

463
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:32,521
If I knew, I'd buy the cure
from Compton's chemists.

00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,681
Why do you think that is, Harry?

480
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:13,561
So, did Arthur say, er

481
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:17,881
what kind of a deal
this new copper offered him?

482
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:22,521
God! The second your balls are empty,
it's back onto politics.

00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:32,041
What did Tommy say?

484
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:34,481
He didn't say anything.
You know what he's like.

485
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,121
Yeah, I know what he's like.

486
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:38,361
Likes to take his fights onto the mud.

487
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,281
Doesn't like to stand and wait.

488
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:43,161
You know what he'd do
if he found out about us?

489
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:44,361
He could try.

490
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:48,041
Sometimes it's like you're with me
just to show you can.

491
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:54,561
One day me and Tommy
will be on the same side again.

492
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:17,321
Tommy!

493
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:23,081
No!

494
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,281
Hey, what you do?

495
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:20,681
We're closed.

496
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,281
Go home.

497
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,161
- Go home, crazy man.
- They're gonna kill me!

498
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:27,921
I say go home, crazy man.

499
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,841
- They're gonna kill me!
- I said, go home.

500
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:34,801
Big spiders!

501
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:11,881
Secretary of State,
this is Chief Inspector Campbell.

502
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:18,881
Mr Churchill, sir.

503
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:22,081
May I say what a great honour it is
to meet you.

504
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:24,601
Bit of a whistle-stop tour.

505
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:27,521
- Love the hat, by the way.
- Thank you.

506
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,481
It's beaver.

507
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:34,641
So, how are you settling in?

508
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,641
I've set up a command network.

509
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:40,121
I've agents in place across the city,

510
00:43:40,481 --> 00:43:42,041
who will act as my eyes and ears.

511
00:43:43,481 --> 00:43:47,441
And I've begun to interrogate suspects
vigorously.

512
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:50,321
You were in Belfast.

513
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:53,801
Understand you broke
a few Fenian hearts.

514
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,241
A rat's nest, sir.

515
00:43:56,521 --> 00:43:58,761
So, who do you think stole the guns?

516
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,641
The Fenians or the communists?

517
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:02,801
If it is the IRA Fenians,

518
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:05,841
I will find them and find the guns.

519
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:09,241
If it is the communists,
I will find them and find the guns.

520
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:12,961
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

521
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:17,001
To me, there is no distinction
between any of the above.

522
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:21,281
Now, I chose you
because you're effective.

523
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:23,561
But remember this, Mr Campbell

524
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,721
this is England, not Belfast.

525
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:29,001
Bodies thrown in the rivers
wash up in the papers here.

526
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:33,321
You must keep the existence of these
stolen guns out of the news,

527
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:36,161
otherwise we are simply
advertising them for sale.

528
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,521
If there are bodies to be buried

529
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:41,841
dig holes.

530
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,521
And dig them deep.

531
00:44:46,361 --> 00:44:48,161
I want everything accounted for.

532
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:49,921
Down to the last bullet.

533
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:05,441
Uncle Charlie.

534
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:07,041
A word.

535
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,121
Get a boa rd.

536
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:09,921
There's no moon.

537
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:13,681
We can take them out to the
turning point beyond Gas Street

538
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:15,121
and leave them on the bank.

539
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:18,441
They'll be found by railwaymen,
first thing.

540
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:25,921
Is that agreement?

541
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:30,641
I changed my mind.

542
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:33,081
You what?

543
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:37,121
I've an alternative strategy.

544
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:41,721
Tell Curly to take her out
to the old tobacco wharf.

545
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:44,881
There's a lock-up mooring
we used to keep cigarettes.

546
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:46,161
He knows it.

547
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,601
When the boat leaves your yard,
it's no longer your concern.

548
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:55,201
Have you lost your fucking mind?

549
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:57,481
Have you not seen the streets?

550
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:00,121
They've sent a fucking army
to find these things.

551
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:01,521
That's right.

552
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,041
They've shown their hand.

553
00:46:03,641 --> 00:46:04,681
Their hand?

554
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,321
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

555
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:09,161
That's the way of the world.

556
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:12,041
Fortune drops something
valuable into your lap,

557
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:14,121
you don't just dump it
on the bank of the cut.

558
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:18,881
You're blood, Tommy.

559
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:22,201
I've always looked out for you
like a dad.

560
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,761
You're going to bring
only hell down on your head.

561
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:31,561
This copper takes no prisoners.

562
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:34,401
I'm told he didn't serve.

563
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:37,561
Reserved occupation.

564
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:43,281
Is it another war
you're looking for, Tommy?

565
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,081
The tobacco wharf.

566
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:49,841
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

567
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:22,841
Are you in position?

568
00:47:26,081 --> 00:47:27,201
I am, sir.

569
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,241
First impressions?

570
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:33,961
I'm quite shocked
at how these people live.

571
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:39,441
Have you found anything out
that might help me?

572
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:41,841
I interrogated the head
of the Peaky Blinders.

573
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:43,921
He didn't know anything.

574
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:45,521
A brute.

575
00:47:45,921 --> 00:47:49,281
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur
who heads the Shelby family.

576
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:51,401
It's the younger one.

577
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:52,761
Thomas.

578
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:57,481
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

579
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:00,241
You sound fascinated.

580
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,841
However, my opinion has not changed.

581
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,801
The bookmaker gangs have other business

582
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:11,321
and the communists
are too weak to have planned this.

583
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,841
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

584
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:22,841
You must not let your personal history
cloud your judgement.

585
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:28,641
What history?

586
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:35,001
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgement.

587
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:40,961
If you see any guns,

588
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:43,841
check the serial numbers
against that list.

589
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:49,761
Your father

590
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,961
was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

591
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:56,241
I know he'd be very, very proud of you.

592
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:29,401
Danny, as you know,
the man you killed was Italian.

593
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:34,041
Those two men over there
are his brothers.

594
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:38,801
If I let the Italians do this, Danny,

595
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:42,321
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

596
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:45,521
That's how those bastards do things.

597
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,561
So, to stop a war breaking out
between us and the Italians,

598
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:55,001
to save you from their barbarity,

599
00:49:58,441 --> 00:49:59,961
I said I would dispatch you myself.

600
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:04,361
They're here to witness.

601
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:14,281
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

602
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,561
I left my fucking brains in the mud.

603
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:23,681
Do you have any last requests, comrade?

604
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:33,241
You look out for my Rosie and my boys.

605
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:36,761
See they get apprenticeships.

606
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:39,961
At the BSA factory or the Austin.

607
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:45,361
And they'll make foremen,
I know they will.

608
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:49,481
Just... ordinary.

609
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,161
Just ordinary men.

610
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:55,001
And they won't get told to do this shit.

611
00:50:56,081 --> 00:50:59,481
This shit...
This shit that we got told to do!

612
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:13,841
I suppose I ought to pray now.

613
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:19,281
Those fucking guns,

614
00:51:20,561 --> 00:51:22,641
they blew God right outta me head.

615
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:30,761
Is that boat for me?

616
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,001
We have to get your body
out of the city, Danny.

617
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:38,721
This new copper, you know.

618
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:41,001
Don't bury me anywhere there's mud.

619
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:42,481
Okay?

620
00:51:43,441 --> 00:51:44,441
Promise me.

621
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:49,081
Bury me on a hill,

622
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:51,241
and tell Rosie where.

623
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:56,401
You're a good man,

624
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,121
and a good soldier.

625
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:04,441
Yes, Sergeant Major.

626
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:27,801
In the bleak mid-winter...

627
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,601
Where are ya?

628
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:24,361
It bloody won.

629
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:27,121
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

630
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:31,041
Yeah. It won.

631
00:53:32,561 --> 00:53:34,001
And word will spread.

632
00:53:34,721 --> 00:53:36,481
So the next time we do the powder trick,

633
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:39,681
it won't be just a garrison
that'll bet on the horse.

634
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:41,561
It'll be the whole of Small Heath.

635
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:43,161
And you know what?

636
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,801
The horse will win again.

637
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:49,401
And the third time we do it we'll have
the whole of Birmingham betting on it.

638
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:52,961
A thousand-quid bet on the magic horse.

639
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,681
And that time

640
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,201
when we are ready

641
00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:58,641
the horse will lose.

642
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,281
Think about it.

643
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,401
You okay, Danny?

644
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,641
I'm still in shock.

645
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:49,321
Are you sure this isn't heaven?

646
00:54:50,241 --> 00:54:52,121
If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

647
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,681
Tommy wanted you to think it was real.

648
00:54:58,281 --> 00:55:00,041
Try and knock some sense into you.

649
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:03,281
A shell full of sheep brains
hurts pretty bad.

650
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:04,641
Aye, it was meant to.

651
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:08,761
So, where are you taking me?

652
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:10,121
London.

653
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:11,921
Tommy has a little job for you.

654
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:14,481
Give you a chance to say thanks.

655
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,201
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

656
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:34,921
Bad week?

657
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:38,841
Heard there was no moon last night.

658
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:43,761
- I checked. Did you do the right thing?
- Yes, I did the right thing.

659
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:49,921
