do we go, Sheriff?

1510
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,203

1511

everywhere.

1512

1513

1514

1515
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,000

1516

1524
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,598
I remember

1525
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,598
when it used to flow

1526
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,598
every Wednesday.

1527
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,767
Those were

1528
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,767

1529
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,228

she quit on us.

1531
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:08,148
Whatever the reason,

1532
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:08,148
something is controlling

1533
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:08,148
this here water.

1534
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,358
What do you say, Sheriff?

1535
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:14,030
Clearly, the robbers came

1536
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:14,030
from this direction.

1537
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,156
I say we track

1538
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,156
this pipe back

1539
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,156
to its hydraulic origin

1540
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,491
and apprehend

1541
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,491
the culprits

1542
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,868

1544
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,076
What'd he say?

1545
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,245
I think he said

1546
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,245
follow the pipe.

1547
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,371
He said follow the pipe.

1548
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,831
He said follow the pipe.

1549
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,846
Whatever you do,

1550
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,846
do not look down.

1551
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:40,806
Whoa!

1552
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,559
What is this place?

1553
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,061
It's an aquifer.

1554
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:45,895
Oh.

1555
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,397
What's an aquifer?

1556
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,857
Well, it's for aqua.

1557
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,985
Well, it's empty now.

1558
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,798
That's a big one.

1559
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,929
It's the end of the line.

1560
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,929
Don't go no further.

1561
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:23,641
Someone or something

1562
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:23,641
is messing with our hydration

1563
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,601
has got something

1564
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,601
to do with it.

1565
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,601
and that pipe

1566
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,269
I thought

1567
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,269
we was following

I saw that first!

Hey, that's mine!

1606

Give me that!

1607
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,458
It's empty anyway.

1608

I knew that.

Sheriff! You're going

1611
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,297
to want to see this!

1612
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,803
It's Mr. Merrimack

All right, let me see.

1621

No, this man wasn't shot.

1622
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:52,396
He was drowned!

1623

What a way to go.

1627
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,031
Well, now, whose

1628

boot prints are those?

1629
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:10,581
That's interesting.

1630
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:10,581
The ground's still wet.

1631
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,499
I suppose

1632
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,499
we should bury him.

No, I'm molting.

1641
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,350
Means I'm ready to mate.

Somebody done

2098
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,438
robbed that bank

2099
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,438
before we robbed it.

2100
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,232
Then where'd you

2101
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,232
get this here jug?

2102
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,317
That's what I been trying

2103
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,317
to tell you, Pappy.

2104
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,777
I found it in the desert.

2105
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,321
Then why in tarnation

2106
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,321
did you bring it here?

2107
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:46,701
this here jug was empty

2108
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:46,701
when you found it?

2109
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:46,701
Hold on! You're saying

2110
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,244
Uh-huh. That's right.

2111
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:49,704
I don't believe

2112
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:49,704
a word of it.

I do apologize for

2150

the shoes, Mr. Rango,

2151
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,972
but there's a certain

01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,972
protocol to this game,

2153
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,972
you understand.

2154
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,808
I'm a bit of a stickler

2155
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,808
for protocol.

2156
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,519
Well, that's good,

2157
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,519
'cause you got a few

2158

questions to answer

2159
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,603

But why would anyone dump

2162
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:45,862
water in the blooming desert?

2163
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:49,907
It does seem a bit naive,

2164
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:49,907
taking the word of

2165
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:49,907

2166

But what if somebody

2171
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,166
did rob the bank

2172
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,166
before they got there?

2173
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,793
And who would do

2174
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,793
that, Mr. Rango?

2175
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,171

01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:31,074
could I possibly

2194

control the water?

Well, I've been

2198
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,167
playing it for

01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,167
many years, sir.

2200
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:44,128

march of progress,

2205
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,926
and I learned

2206
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,926
a thing or two.

2207
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:53,179
Perhaps it's time

2208
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:53,179
you started to take

the long view,

2210
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:56,266
begin to appreciate

2270
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,962
Without water,

2271
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,962
that land is useless.

2272
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,882
Unless he controls

2273
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,882
the water.

2275
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,303
Then he could bring it

back once he's

2277
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,303
bought up all the land.

2278
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:59,138
But how does

2279
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:59,138
he control the water?

2280
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,974
Sheriff,

2281
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,974
we got a problem.

Hold on, Beans.

2284
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:12,026
That won't be necessary.

2285
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,823
Hang him till

2286
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,823
his head turns blue!

2287
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:19,158
Give us them robbers!

2288
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,452
Hold on!

2289
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,452
Calm down, everyone!

2290
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,452
Let me talk!

2291

RANGO: Now, calm down.

2293
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:26,374
Get them out here

2294
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:26,374
so we can cut off

2295
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:26,374
their giblets!

01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,293
You, too, Spoons?

2297
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,588
They done taken that water.

2298
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,588
They taken everything we got!

2299
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:35,466
No one's stringing anyone up.

2300
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:35,466
Not while I'm sheriff.

2301
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:36,926
But this is all his fault!

2302
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,512
You said you's gonna

2303
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,512
bring the water back.

2304
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:42,139
It's just, we got no hope

2305
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:42,139
without that water.

2306
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,807
We got nothing

2307
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,807
left to believe in.

2308
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,061
You see that sign up there?

2309
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,480
As long as that sign

2310
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,480
says "Sheriff,"

2311
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,774
you can believe that there's

2312
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,774
law and order in this town.

2313
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:56,112
But without law and order,

2314
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:56,112
ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.

2315

2317
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,784
Somebody says a cross word.

2318

2322
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,163
And then dogs and cats

01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,163
are getting together

to believe in, Spoons?

Believe in me.

Believe in that there sign.
