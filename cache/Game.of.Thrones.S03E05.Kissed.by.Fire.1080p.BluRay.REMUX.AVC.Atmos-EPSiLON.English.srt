Where's your chain?

169
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,477
The Citadel stripped me of it.

170
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,648
They found some of my experiments too bold.

171
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,194
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

172
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,654
I don't need my right hand to kill you.

173
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,743
I can take away the rotting flesh

174
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,038
and try and burn
out the corruption with boiling wine.

175
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,581
Mmm. (CLEARS THROAT)

176

With any luck, that will suffice.

177
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,336
You'll need milk of the poppy.

178
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,588
No milk of the poppy.

179
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:22,839
There will be pain.

180
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,549
I'll scream.

181
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,884
Quite a bit of pain.

182
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,969
I'll scream loudly.

183

CERSEI: Lord Baelish.

00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,049
Your Grace.

190
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,676
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

191
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,302
Of course, Your Grace.

192
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,973
I believe that House Tyrell don't hold the
crown's best interests at heart.

193
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:17,686
I see. And have you
shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?

194
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,355
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

195
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,983
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

196
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,236
And he appreciates
those who aid his family, as you well know.

197
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,572
He's almost as generous to those who help us

198
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,991
as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.

199
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,493
You have a good
working relationship with the Tyrells.

200
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:36,580
I thought you might
look into it before you leave the capital.

201
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,582
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

202
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,417
And your best will prove better than

203
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,294
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

204
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,920
I assure you that it will.

205
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,763
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

206
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,056
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

207
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,267
Are there any figs? Fetch some.

208
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,937
I always take figs
midafternoon. They help move the bowels.

209
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,064
To what do I owe this summons?

210
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,150
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

211
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,360
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

212
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:11,114
I climbed all those steps
to discuss financial matters?

213
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,825
It's the royal wedding.
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

214
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,535
Naturally.

215
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,662
It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.

216
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,623
The word "extravagant" has been used.

217
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,458
What good is the word "extravagant"

218
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,960
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

219
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,879
- I understand that.
- Good.

220
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,964
But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me

221
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,050
to calculate the cost for the crown.

222
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,677
As of now, it's a huge expense.

223
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,845
And?

224
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,641
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

225
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,976
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

226
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,519
And maintaining supply lines...

227
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,146
I can't think how it slipped my mind.

228
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,567
What is it, 12,000
infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?

229
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:52,072
1,800 mounted lances. 2,000 in support.

230
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,158
Provisions, so this city
might survive the winter.

231
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,660
A million bushels of wheat.

232
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,330
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

233
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,708
20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep.

234
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,253
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

235
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,213
I'm quite familiar with them.

236
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,923
And we are grateful for your contributions,

237
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,592
which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.

238
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,761
As is a royal wedding.

239
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,264
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

240
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,640
They crave distractions.

241
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,060
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

242
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,521
And their distractions are likely to

243
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,982
end with us being torn to pieces.

244
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,568
A royal wedding is much
safer. Wouldn't you say?

245
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,362
I would.

246
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,533
And traditionally paid for by the royal family.

247
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:42,372
I was told you were drunk,
impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.

248
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,541
Imagine my disappointment at finding

249
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,793
nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,883
- My lady...
- Oh, very well.

253

that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.

and the celebrations will go on as planned.

- Quite. Thank you.

Just mending Lord Beric's armor.

260
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,662
Why?

261
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,082
I'm going to stay and smith
for the Brotherhood.

262
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,084
Have you lost your mind?

263
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,086
When the Lannisters find this place,

264
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,629
you think they'll spare the smiths?

265
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,173
They'll cave your head in.

266
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,967
They wanted to kill me
long before I joined the Brotherhood.

267
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,427
You don't have to.

268
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,306
I want to. They need good men.

269

What? Serve him?

272
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,607
I've served men my entire life.

273
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:55,111
I served Master Mott at King's Landing,
and he sold me to the Watch.

274
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,988
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,

if I'd get tortured or killed.

- I'm done serving.
- You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

He may be their leader, but they chose him.

278

These men are brothers. They're a family.

279

I've never had a family.

280
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,096
I can be your family.

281
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:28,603
You wouldn't be my family.
You'd be "my lady."

00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,732
The Lannisters pay their debts.

328
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,276
They never stop talking about it.

329
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,819
Would you make me a liar as well?

330
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,821
It wouldn't be lying.

331
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,241
We will bury them
and remain silent until the war is done.

332
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,659
I'm not fighting for justice

333
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,662
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

334
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,706
no matter how highborn.

335
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,167
He has to die.

336
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:43,172
The Karstarks are Northmen.
They won't forgive the killing of their lord.

337
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:48,011
Your mother's right. If you do this,
the Karstarks will abandon you.

338
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,013
You tended to their wounds.

339
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,016
You brought them supper. Now they're dead.

340
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,352
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

341
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,187
You need Karstark men to end it.

342
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,524
Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.

343
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,734
A hostage.

344
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:08,781
Tell the Karstarks that as long as they're
loyal, he will not be harmed.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

346
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,559
The blood of the First Men flows through

347
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:39,103
my veins as much as yours, boy.

348
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,024
I fought the Mad King for your father.

349
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,818
I fought Joffrey for you.

350
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,615
We are kin, Stark and Karstark.

351
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,661
That didn't stop you
from betraying me, and it won't save you now.

352
00:24:54,911 --> 00:25:00,917
I don't want it to save me.
I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.

353
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,170
Kneel, my lord.

354
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:17,141
Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold,

355
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:20,478
here, in sight of gods and
men, I sentence you to die.

356
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,147
Would you speak a final word?

357
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:28,778
Kill me and be cursed.
You are no king of mine.

The Hound.

364
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,691
What are you going to do with me?

365
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:11,237
At first light we'll ride for
Riverrun. Your brother's there now.

366
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:15,450
He'll make a contribution to our
cause, and you can go home.

367
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,327
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

368
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,829
Don't think of it that way.

369
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,164
But it is that way.

370
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,498
It is.

371
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:23,875
And it isn't.

372
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,126
More is than isn't.

373
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,631
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

374
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,633
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.

375
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,260
So, why don't you?

376
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,970
We need the gold.

Do I frighten you, child?

No.

380
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,116
You're angry with me, and I don't blame you,

381
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,535
but letting him go was the right thing.

382
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,121
I have more reason to want him hanged.

383
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,331
I thought he killed you.

384
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,624
He did.

385
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,375
But how...

386
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:10,630
Thoros, how many times
have you brought me back?

387
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,883
It's the Lord of Light who brings you back.

388
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,719
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.

389
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:17,929
How many times?

390
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,222
Five, I think.

391
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,765
No, this makes six.

392
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,642
Six.

393
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,894
There was the first time. The Mountain.

394
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,146
Show her.

395
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,774
Lance right through the chest.

396
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,528
BERIC: Then I was stabbed in the belly.

397
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,279
Then it was an arrow in the back.

398
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,698
And that ax in the side.

399
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:41,077
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

400
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,747
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?

401
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,959
Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

402
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,253
And the Hound makes six.

403
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,839
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

404
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,757
THOROS: You'd think you'd learn.

405
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,095
It's not getting any easier, you know.

406
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,055
BERIC: I know.

407
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,182
Every time I come back,

408
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,142
I'm a bit less.

409
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,146
Pieces of you get chipped away.

410
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,942
Could you bring back a man without a head?

411
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,781
Not six times. Just once.

412
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,617
I don't think it works that way, child.

413
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:33,629
He was a good man, Ned Stark.
He's at rest now, somewhere.

414
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,632
I would never wish my life upon him.

415
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,509
I would.

416
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,139

I know of your troubles, my King.

I believed that once.

You are the One God's

No.

439
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,691
I've wronged you.

440
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,234
I have shamed you.

I know, Stannis.

446
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,088
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

447
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:44,301
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.

She gave you a son.

I gave you

455
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,349
- nothing.
- That's not true.

456

There is no need.

He did. He fought bravely.

He hasn't come to visit me.

477

He said he'd bring
me back a present from the capital.

He won't be visiting, child.

00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,165
I need a bath.

492
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,626
Help me out of these rags.

493
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:11,759
Now get out.

494
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,848
(DOOR CLOSES)

495
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,316
There's another tub.

496
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,319
JAIME: This one suits me fine.

497
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:42,790
(EXHALES)

498
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,876
Don't worry. I'm not interested.

499
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,294
(SIGHS)

500
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,714
If I faint, pull me out.

501
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,301
I don't intend to be
the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.

502
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,095
Why should I care how you die?

503
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,889
You swore a solemn vow, remember?

504
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,935
You're supposed to
get me to King's Landing in one piece.

505
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,145
Not going so well, is it?

506
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,816
No wonder Renly died,
with you guarding him.

507
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,370
That was unworthy. Forgive me.

508
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,914
- You protected me better than most...
- Don't you mock me.

509
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,833
I'm apologizing.

510
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,005
I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.

511
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,881
You need trust to have a truce.

512
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,802
I trust you.

513
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,645
There it is. There's the look.

514
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,733
I've seen it for 17 years, on face after face.

515
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,819
You all despise me.

516
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:57,781
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.

517
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,576
A man without honor.

518
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,083
You've heard of wildfire?

519
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,543
Of course.

520
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,338
The Mad King was obsessed with it.

521
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,507
He loved to watch people burn,

522
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:20,220
the way their skin blackened and
blistered and melted off their bones.

523
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,348
He burned lords he didn't like.

524
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:24,516
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.

525
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,686
He burned anyone who was against him.

526
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,691
Before long, half the country was against him.

527
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,155
Aerys saw traitors everywhere,

528
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:45,329
so he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire all over the city,

529
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,292
beneath the Sept of Baelor
and the slums of Flea Bottom.

530
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:53,629
Under houses, stables, taverns.

531
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,298
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.

532
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:04,139
Finally, the day of reckoning came.

533
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,725
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital

534
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,061
after his victory at the Trident.

535
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:14,274
But my father arrived first,
with the whole Lannister army at his back,

536
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:18,153
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

537
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,825
I knew my father better than that.

538
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,160
He's never been one to pick the losing side.

539
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,330
I told the Mad King as much.

540
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,334
I urged him to surrender peacefully.

541
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,837
But the King didn't listen to me.

542
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,215
He didn't listen to Varys,
who tried to warn him.

543
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:42,302
But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle,

544
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,097
that gray, sunken cunt.

545
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:49,351
"You can trust the Lannisters," he said.

546
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,691
"The Lannisters
have always been true friends of the crown."

547
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:02,906
So, we opened the gates,
and my father sacked the city.

548
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:09,580
Once again,
I came to the King, begging him to surrender.

549
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:18,297
He told me to bring him my father's head.

550
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:23,552
Then he turned to his pyromancer.

551
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,639
"Burn them all," he said.

552
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,520
"Burn them in their homes.
Burn them in their beds."

553
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:39,818
Tell me, if your precious Renly

554
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,779
commanded you to kill your own father

555
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:45,282
and stand by while thousands of men,

556
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,826
women, and children burned alive,

557
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,578
would you have done it?

558
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,456
Would you have kept your oath then?

559
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,796
First, I killed the pyromancer.

560
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:04,259
And then, when the King turned to flee,

561
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,763
I drove my sword into his back.

562
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,434
"Burn them all,"
he kept saying. "Burn them all."

563
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,354
I don't think he expected to die.

564
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:22,694
He meant to burn with the rest of us

565
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,197
and rise again,

566
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,825
reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.

567
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:36,333
I slit his throat to
make sure that didn't happen.

568
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,465
That's where Ned Stark found me.

569
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,343
If this is true...

570
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,844
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

571
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,805
Why didn't you tell anyone?

572
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,767
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

573
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,935
Stark?

574
00:39:55,352 --> 00:40:02,067
You think the honorable Ned Stark

575
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,319
wanted to hear my side?

576
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:10,450
He judged me guilty
the moment he set eyes on me.

577
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,328
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,337
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

583
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,439
Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?

584
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:41,690
Shh! You'll wake Bert.

585
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:42,983
Bert?

586
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,652
He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.

587
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,155
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

588
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,866
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

589
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,784
- If your father knew...
- He said you were a traitor.

590
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:54,828
Are you?

591
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:56,705
I am, child.

592
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,460
I disobeyed my king,
your father, and now I'm paying the price.

593
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,087
I don't care. You're my friend.

594
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,966
You must get bored
down here. I brought you something to read.

595
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,719
It's about Aegon and his dragons.

596
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,013
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?

597
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,973
- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

598
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,224
So they did.

599
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,517
You can hide the book under your cloak.

600
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,895
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

601
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,814
Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book,

602
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,816
- but it's wasted on me.
- Take it.

603
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,568
I have more.

604
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,571
My lady, I can't read the words.

605
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,240
You can't?

606
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,035
I'll teach you.
I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.

607
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,120
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

608
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,664
Go. We can't.

609
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:42,000
Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?

611

- I wouldn't know where to start.
- At the beginning.

612
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,762
This word is "Aegon."

613
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:58,183
When you see "A," "E,"
and "G" together like that,

614
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,102
it sounds like "egg."

615
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,770
And the title of the whole book

616

The second.

Thoros of Myr went in
alone, waving that flaming sword of his.

(CHUCKLES) Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.

623

Robert knighted you after the battle?

624
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,679
Proudest moment of my life.

625
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,682
One knee in the dust,
the King's sword on my shoulder,

626
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:39,725
listening to the words,

627
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:43,395
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

628
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,732
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

632
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,531
I was very nearly the first man

633
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,408
knighted to piss on the King's boots.

He was a good man, a great warrior.

637
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,293
And a terrible king.

638
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,755
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

You did not choose this life.

651
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,711
But you are free men now.
And free men make their own choices.

652
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:54,132
Have you selected your own leader
from amongst your ranks?

653
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,472
Remove your helmet.

654
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,063
(IN VALYRIAN)

655
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,981
This one has the honor.

656
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,900
What is your name?

657
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,401
Grey Worm.

658
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:15,737
Grey Worm.

659
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:20,116
All Unsullied boys
are given new names when they are cut.

660
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,453
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

661
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:26,289
Names that remind them what they are...

662
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,667
Vermin.

663
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:31,962
(BOTH IN VALYRIAN)

664
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,923
From this day forward,
you will choose your own names.

665
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:38,385
You will tell your fellow soldiers
to do the same.

666
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:40,929
Throw away your slave name.

667
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:43,723
Choose the name your parents gave you,
or any other.

668
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:48,353
A name that gives you pride.

669
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:53,483
"Grey Worm" gives me pride.
It is a lucky name.

670
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:57,279
The name this one was born
with was cursed.

671
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,616
That was the name he had when he
was taken as a slave.

672
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:07,080
But Grey Worm is the name this one had

673
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:11,418
the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.

674
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,841
JORAH: King Robert wanted her dead.

675
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:21,261
Of course he wanted her
dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

676
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,432
I suppose no one on the Small
Council could speak sense to him.

677
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:26,766
I didn't sit on the Small Council.

678
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,143
No?

679
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,520
Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard traditionally...

680
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:31,813
Traditionally, yes,

681
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:34,691
but I killed a dozen
of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

682
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,737
He didn't want advice on how to govern

683
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:40,655
from a man who had fought for the Mad King.

684
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,824
Can't say I minded much.

685
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:45,911
I always hated the politics.

686
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,913
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

687
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:51,291
Hours spent jabbering about
backstabbings and betrayals the world over.

688
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,459
Mmm-hmm.

689
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,715
Still, she'll have to wade through that muck

690
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,675
if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

691
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,510
She'll have good men around her

692
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,429
to advise her, men with experience.

693
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,681
Which men do you have in mind?

694
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,934
Forgive me for what I'm about to say,

695
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,436
but your reputation
in Westeros has suffered over the years.

696
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,899
It suffered for a reason.
I sold men into slavery.

697
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,026
I don't know if your presence by her side

698
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,903
will help our cause when we go home.

699
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,947
Our cause?

700
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,616
Forgive me, Ser Barristan,
but I was busy defending the Khaleesi

701
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,159
against King Robert's assassins

702
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,786
while you were still bowing to the man.

703
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:30,956
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

704
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,583
You only joined us a few days ago.

705
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,460
I can't speak to your intentions.

706
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,004
If we're truly her loyal servants,

707
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:40,590
we will do whatever needs to be done,

708
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,218
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

709
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:48,098
You're not Lord Commander
here. You're just another exile.

710
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,517
And I take my orders from the Queen.

711
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:54,479
(NEIGHS)

712
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,068
TALISA: Come to bed.

713
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,861
You were right.

714
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,406
The Karstarks are gone.

715
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,907
(CLATTERING)

716
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,242
Almost half our forces.

717
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:11,246
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to
do to make us unravel.

718
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:13,665
Nothing.

719
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,167
Only wait.

720
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:17,752
Don't let him.

721
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,549
What can I do? Attack King's Landing?

722
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:26,511
There's nothing
he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.

723
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:29,097
We could ride north.

724
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:32,308
Take your land back
from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.

725
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:34,853
Winter could last five years.

726
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,438
Once my bannermen are home again,

727
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,149
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

728
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:42,277
warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.

729
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:46,239
When I gathered my lords
together, we had a purpose, a mission.

730
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,117
Now we're like a band of bickering children.

731
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,455
Give them a new purpose.

732
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,956
What?

733
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:01,296
I don't know.
I don't even know where Winterfell is.

734
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,051
Here.

735
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,056
And we're here.

736
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,640
King's Landing...

737
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,107
What is it?

738
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,864
I can't force them to meet us in the field

739
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,158
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

740
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,160
but I can attack them where they're not.

741
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,039
And Casterly Rock can't run away.

742
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,503
I'm going to take their home away from them.

743
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:44,422
Can you do it?

744
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,884
I need men to
replace the Karstarks who marched home.

745
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,345
There is only one person in this kingdom

746
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,640
with that kind of army
who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.

747
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,016
(LAUGHS)

748
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,685
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry.

749
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,605
Walder Frey.

750
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:06,820
(GRUNTING)

751
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,950
He's such a splendid fighter.

752
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:15,203
Do you have any idea when we might...

753
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,832
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

754
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,416
It should grow quickly.

755
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:24,921
Joffrey won't let me leave.
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

756
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:27,590
And only one to let you go.

757
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,468
Because it will please me.

758
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,887
LORAS: Squire.

759
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:37,767
Well fought, ser.

760
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:39,519
That was no fight.

761
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:40,770
I don't know you.

762
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:43,189
Olyver, if it please you.

763
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,486
I should like to
see you spar with a proper partner, ser.

764
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,157
(MOANS)

765
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,327
(PANTING)

766
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,579
How did you know?

767
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,414
Know what?

768
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,709
That I wanted to.

769
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,586
My lord...

770
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,341
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon,

771
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,011
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

772
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,514
They rarely do, in my experience.

773
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:19,184
You have a good deal of experience, do you?

774
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,728
With the husbands.

775
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,989
That didn't take long.

776
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,575
Well, it took long enough.

777
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,205
It seems
our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.

778
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,789
Is he?

779
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,416
And...

780
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:46,044
Who's the lucky girl?

781
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,464
LITTLEFINGER: She may
not be the grandest ship in the world

782
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,424
or the fastest,

783
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,010
but she's mine.

784
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,559
I've always wanted a ship.
Now I want a dozen.

785
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,269
Strange, isn't it?

786
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,562
What is?

787
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,731
It doesn't matter what we want,

788
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,817
once we get it, then we want something else.

789
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,949
Your hair is different.

790
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,450
Is it?

791
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,244
Lady Margaery wears it that way.

792
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,329
Many ladies wear it this way.

793
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:25,667
I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.

794
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,043
You still want me to come with you?

795
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:30,338
It's not
a question of what I want. It's what you want.

796
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,799
You want to go home, don't you?

797
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,134
Of course. More than anything.

798
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,682
But maybe it would be better to wait.

799
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:45,979
I've been thinking how dangerous it would
be. Not just for me, but for you.

800
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:50,733
You've been so kind.
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.

801
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,861
I can't tell you how touched I am

802
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,947
by your concern for my welfare.

803
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:00,368
I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.

804
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,954
Your true friend.

805
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,205
I do, Lord Baelish.

806
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:05,623
Petyr.

807
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:06,874
Petyr.

808
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,963
If you wish to stay,
then of course you will stay.

809
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,470
We'll speak again when I return.

810
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,893
(EXHALES)

811
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,068
TYWIN: You're late.

812
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,904
What's she doing here?

813
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,407
Our business concerns her, too.

814
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,117
Sit.

815
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:45,580
You'll be pleased to learn that

816
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:47,999
after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,

817
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:52,837
I've saved the crown
hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

818
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,548
Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.

819
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,884
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

820
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,263
Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.

821
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,350
Your sister has learned
that your new friends the Tyrells

822
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:08,311
are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

823
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,773
Very well. She's a lovely girl.

824
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:16,027
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.

825
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,362
Your jokes are not appreciated.

826
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:18,738
It wasn't my best, but...

827
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,866
I bring them into
the royal fold, and this is how they repay me,

828
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,619
by trying to steal
the key to the North out from under me.

829
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:29,374
Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to
remember she has an older brother.

830
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,292
The Karstarks have marched home.

831
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,504
The Young Wolf has
lost half his army. His days are numbered.

832
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,423
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

833
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:40,885
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell,

834
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:44,722
and I am not about
to hand her over to the Tyrells.

835
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:47,141
TYRION: The Tyrell army is
helping us to win this war.

836
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,811
Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

837
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:51,813
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.

838
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,565
Plots are not public knowledge.

839
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:58,569
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out
until after Joffrey's wedding.

840
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:02,323
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

841
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:03,783
And how do we do that?

842
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,035
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

843
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,286
Wonderful.

844
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,621
Yes, it is.

845
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:17,922
You can't mean it.

846
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,257
I can and I do.

847
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,093
Joffrey's made this poor girl's life miserable

848
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,929
since the day he took her father's head.

849
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,598
Now she's finally
free of him, and you give her to me?

850
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,058
That's cruel, even for you.

851
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,560
Do you intend on mistreating her?

852
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:34,230
The girl's happiness
is not my concern, nor yours.

853
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,606
She's a child!

854
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,359
She's flowered, I assure
you. She and I have discussed it at length.

855
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,027
There, you see? You will wed her,

856
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,696
bed her, and put a child in her.

857
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,573
Surely you're capable of that.

858
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:44,949
And if I refuse?

859
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,368
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

860
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:52,039
Sansa Stark is a finer
reward than you could ever dare hope for.

861
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,250
And it is past time you were wed.

862
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,835
I was wed.

863
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:58,880
Or don't you remember?

864
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,009
Only too well.

865
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:08,347
You should be thanking the Gods for this.
This is more than you deserve.

866
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:12,768
Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.

867
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:14,645
(TYWIN CLEARS THROAT)

868
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:16,397
What do you mean?

869
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:18,274
You'll marry Ser Loras.

870
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:21,903
I will not.

871
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,070
The boy is heir to Highgarden.

872
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,615
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

873
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,116
No, I won't do it.

874
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,701
Yes, you will.

875
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,078
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

876
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,164
I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.

877
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,749
You're my daughter!

878
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,962
You will do as I command,
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

879
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:44,258
and put an end to the disgusting
rumors about you once and for all.

880
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,761
Father, don't make me do it again, please.

881
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,429
Not another word.

882
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,098
My children.

883
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:56,646
You've disgraced
the Lannister name for far too long.

884
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,279
