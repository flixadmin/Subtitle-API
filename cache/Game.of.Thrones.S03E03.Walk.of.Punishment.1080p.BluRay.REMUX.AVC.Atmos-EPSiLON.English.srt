EDMURE: If I may, nephew,

7
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,669
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

8
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,921
at the Stone Mill which
may have some bearing...

9
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,383
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

10
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,136
And don't call him "nephew." He is your king.

11
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,637
Robb knows I meant him no...

12
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,266
You're lucky I'm not your king.

13
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,853
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory flag.

14
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,647
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

15
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,567
back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.

16
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,944
I think King Robb understands
we won't win this war

17
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,237
if he's the only one winning any battles.

18
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,030
No, there's glory enough to go around.

19
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,949
It's not about glory.

20
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,454
Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.

21
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,788
I seized an opportunity.

22
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,206
What value was the mill?

23
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,042
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

24
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,544
ROBB: Is he there now?

25
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,047
Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.

26
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,342
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west,

27
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:04,430
into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.

28
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,724
I wanted him to chase us,

29
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,060
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

30
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,229
without a strategic thought in his head.

31
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,357
I could have that head on a spike by now.

32
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,237
Instead, I have a mill.

33
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:28,329
We took hostages.
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.

34
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,873
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.

35
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,375
Martyn is 15, I believe.

36
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,215
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

37
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,801
Have I sued for peace?

38
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,261
No.

39
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:48,849
Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's

40
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,769
brother's great-grandsons?

41
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,983
No.

42
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,944
How many men did you lose?

43
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,157

But for every man we lost, the Lannisters...

44
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,035
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

45
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,335
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,419
I didn't know.

47
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,546
You would have.

48
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,007
Right here today
at this gathering, if you had been patient.

49
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,177
We seem to be running short of patience here.

50
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,638

Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

We are trying, my lord.

Try harder.

What do we have, then?

68
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,500
Robb Stark and
most of his bannermen are in Riverrun

69
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,337
for the funeral
of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.

70
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:10,384
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

71
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,929
which would seem
to make him Lord of Harrenhal,

72
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,013
in practice, not in name.

73
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,181
TYWIN: Let him have it.

74
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,978
The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

75
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,521
The Lord of Harrenhal will make

76
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,106
a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

77
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,276
For which I am
extremely grateful to you, my lord.

78
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,737
Lady Arryn and I have known each
other since we were children.

79
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,825
She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.

80
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,453
A successful courtship would make

81
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,080
Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

82
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,958
Titles do seem to breed titles.

83
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,918
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible

84
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,920
and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.

85
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,089
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt

86

to the list of people who have
taken up arms against him.

Far be it from me to hinder true love,

but Lord Baelish's
absence would present certain problems.

Not a good time

TYWIN: Fully agreed.

94
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,408
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

- (SCOFFS)
- Master of Coin?

96
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,163
It would appear to best suits your talents.

97
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,956
I'm quite good at spending money,

98
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,875
but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

99
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,877
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

100
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,464
I have no doubt
you will prove equal to this challenge.

101
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,341
Hear, hear.

MAN: He lifted her high in the air

103
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,763
He sniffed and roared and smelled her there

104
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,015
She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair

105
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,559
But he licked the honey from her hair

106
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,646
ALL: From there to here, from here to there

107
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,856
All black and brown and covered with hair

108
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,025
He smelled that girl on the summer air

109
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,611
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

110
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:58,158
I hope you're pleased.
If I were armed, they'd never have taken us.

111
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,244
BRIENNE: You were armed
when we were taken.

112
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,204
I was in chains, if you recall.

113
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:06,083
Our little match would have ended quite
quick if my hands weren't bound.

114
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,378
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

115
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,171
"what a brilliant swordsman."

116
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,176
You were slower
than I expected. And more predictable.

117
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,928
I've been sitting in a muddy pen,

118
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,680
wrapped in chains, for the past year.

119
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,682
I'm a woman. I was beating you.

120
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,017
You were not beating me.

121
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,270
Maybe you were as good as people said...

122
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,272
Once.

123
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,441
Or maybe people just
love to over-praise a famous name.

124
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,700
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.

125
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,661
None of these fellows
have ever been with a noblewoman.

126
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,207
- You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I?

127
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,625
They'll knock your teeth out.

128
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,127
You think I care?

129
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,546
No, I don't think you care about your teeth.

130
00:11:56,425 --> 00:12:00,220
If you fight them,
they will kill you. Do you understand?

131
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,890
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

132
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,392
Let them have
what they want. What does it matter?

133
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,518
What does it matter?

134
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,603
Close your eyes.

135
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,271
Pretend they're Renly.

136
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,525
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

137
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,903
You'd let them do what they wanted?

138
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:21,241
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill
me. But I'm not, thank the Gods.

139
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,998
If I had a proper forge,
I'd make it good as new.

140
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,419
Doesn't have to look pretty.
It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.

141
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,421
Why are you helping him?

142
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,590
He takes us prisoner, now he's our friend?

143
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,258
THOROS: You're not our prisoner.

144
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,468
What am I?

145
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,594
Our guest.

146
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,638
No one's put any chains on you.

147
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,181
So I can walk away, then?

148
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,059
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

149
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,394
You're lucky we found you.

150

you're good with that bow, you little twat?

ANGUY: Better than anyone you've met.

152
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:02,616
HOUND: A coward's weapon.
I like to fight up close.

153
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,119
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

154
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,747
Why? So you can kiss him?

155
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,666
You remember the last time you were here?

156
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,294
Looks like every other shit inn on the road.

but you're one ugly fucker

188

Your father was a stubborn old ox.

195

I was surprised when
he died. Didn't think death had the patience.

I'm glad you were
with him. I wish to the Gods I had been.

Did you make peace in the end?

198
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:19,396
After 30 years of fighting,
I don't think he remembered what started it.

199
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,108
He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.

200
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:27,654
He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.

201
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,325
I told him people
had been calling me Blackfish for so long,

202
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,578
they don't remember my real name.

203
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,586
Every time he would
leave for the capital or fight in a campaign,

204
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,839
I'd see him off.

205
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,009
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.

206
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:54,806
"Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."

207
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:01,062
And I would sit at this window every day
when the sun came up, waiting.

208

how many times did Bran or Rickon

210
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,032
stare across the moors of Winterfell,

And he must go on believing.

217

I don't know. What do they say about him?

224

That he can turn into a wolf at night.

225
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,090
True.

We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?

378

380

not the blood of innocents.

JORAH: How many wars
have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

383
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,810
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

where innocents didn't die by the thousands?

385

I was in King's Landing

You know what I saw? Butchery.

Babies, children, old men.

388
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,162
More women raped than you can count.

389
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:52,833
There's a beast in every man,
and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

390
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:56,879
But the Unsullied are
not men. They do not rape.

391
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,966
They do not put
cities to the sword unless they're ordered.

392
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,595
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

You disagree, Ser Barristan?

394

When your brother
led his army into battle at the Trident,

395
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,894
men died for him
because they believed in him,

396
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,396
because they loved him,

397
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,023
not because they'd been
bought at an auction.

Many of those on the Walk of
Punishment were taken there for less.

481
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,949
I offered water to
a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.

482
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:38,202
Do you know
what he said to me? "Let me die."

483
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,955
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

484
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,375
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me

485
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,752
about the Unsullied? About their obedience?

486
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:51,423
All questions have
been taken from them. They obey, that is all.

487
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,176
Once they are yours, they are yours.

488
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,345
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

489
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,890
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

490
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:03,269
You may go hungry. You may fall sick.

491
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,063
You may be killed.

492
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,898

493
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:11,402
Yes, all men must die.

494
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,571
But we are not men.

to keep the royal ledgers.

497

Yes, my lord.

504
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,578
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

505
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,332
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

506
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,375
You should have him knighted.

507
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:11,670
If only the Master of Coin had such power.

508
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,590
If only.

509

I owe you a significant debt.

510
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,388
Our redheaded friend.

511
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:24,183
You secured her release
when the Queen detained her.

512
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,060
Oh, that.

513
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:29,229
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

514
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,106
Apparently, Her Grace believed

515
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,194
that you two had
some sort of special relationship.

516
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,155
We don't. I did fuck her once.

517
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,282
- I know.
- But we don't.

518
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,867
I know.

519
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,577
How'd the Queen get that idea?

520
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,413
Why don't you ask her?

521
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,919
Any advice for me on my new position?

522
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,922
Keep a low profile.

523
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,050
If I had a gold dragon

524
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,387
for every time
I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

525
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,305
Well, you are richer than I am.

526
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,391
Good point.

527

They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.

Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

529

Trivial even.
You want a real challenge? Try whores.

530

I've tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.

531

Come on, I'm here later. Come on.

532

533
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,756

TYRION: You think all reading is dull reading.

It's an opinion I share
with some of the finest men I know.

536
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,556
The secret history
of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.

537
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,350
BRONN: Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

538
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,018
to hide what he's really up to.

539

00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,398
Yes, my lord.

Podrick.

543

Yes, my lord?

After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

545
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,781
I finally found
a suitable reward for the services

546
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:06,076
you've provided over and
above what might be considered reasonable.

547
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,373
Tell me, Pod,
have you ever been with a woman?

548
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,541
No, my lord.

549
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,667
Wonderful.

550
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:19,298
Genna specializes in first-timers.

551
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,967
She's not bad with second-timers, either.

552
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,844
Uh, my lord...

553
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,513
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

554
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:29,975
through my
would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?

555
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,562
Now, as it happens,

556
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,064
Marei

557
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:39,234
is quite the spear-handler herself.

558

She's here to thank you for staying by my side

MAREI: He's handsome.

561
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,288
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis in certain circles.

563
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,635
One of four women in the world who can
perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

564
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,721
My lord, I don't even...

TYRION: She's here to thank
you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow,

who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

TYRION: For years
I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.

570
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,499
Whenever the crown needs
money, he rubs his hands together

571

and, poof, mountains of gold.

Let me guess. He's not a magician.

00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,713
No.

574
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,300
He's stealing it?

575
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,843
Worse, he's borrowing it.

576
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,596
What's wrong with that?

577
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,100
We can't afford
to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.

578
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,435
The crown owes millions to my father.

579
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,980
Seeing as it's
his grandson's ass on the throne,

580
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,023
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

581
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,276
Forgive a debt, my father?

582
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,903
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

If we fail to repay these loans,

Every sapphire in Westeros
