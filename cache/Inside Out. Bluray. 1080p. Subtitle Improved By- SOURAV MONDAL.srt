00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:53,268
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

3
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,963
"What is going on inside their head?"

4
00:00:55,964 --> 00:01:00,203
Well, I know.
Well, I know Riley's head.

5
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,398
And there she was...

6
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,944
Hello.

7
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:52,452
Riley.

8
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:57,509
Oh. Look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

9
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:10,055
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

10
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:12,803
Whoa.

11
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:35,066
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

12
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,914
Er, for 33 seconds?

13
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,215
I'm Sadness.

14
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,053
Hello.
I... I'm Joy. So...

15
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:55,134
Can I just... if you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

16
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,017
And that was just the beginning.

17
00:02:57,018 --> 00:03:00,598
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

18
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:04,900
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

19
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,818
Sharp turn! No! 
Look out! No!

20
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,197
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

21
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:14,318
Easy, easy. 
We're good. We're good.

22
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,411
- Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

23
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,202
And we're back!

24
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:23,919
Here we go.
All right, open.

25
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,504
- This looks new.
- You think it's safe?

26
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,047
What is it?

27
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,914
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

28
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:30,968
Hold on. What is that?

29
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,094
This is Disgust.

30
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,680
She basically keeps
Riley from being poisoned.

31
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,098
Physically and socially.

32
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,183
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

33
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,267
Hold on, guys.

34
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:40,899
It's broccoli!

35
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,770
Yucky!

36
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,358
Well, I just saved our lives.
Yeah. You're welcome.

37
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,319
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,738
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

39
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:52,948
That's Anger.

40
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,118
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

41
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,954
So that's how you want to play it,
old man? No dessert?

42
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:04,125
Oh. Sure, we'll eat our dinner!
Right after you eat this!

43
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:10,305
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

44
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,968
Oh. Airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

45
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,879
Airplane.

46
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:27,176
And you've met Sadness.
She... well, she...

47
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:32,946
I'm not actually sure what she does.

48
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:35,449
And I've checked,
there's no place for her to go, so...

49
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,577
She's good, we're good.
It's all great!

50
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,620
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

51
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,451
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

52
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:50,922
But the really important ones
are over here.

53
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,843
I don't want to get too technical,
but these are called core memories.

54
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:58,013
Each one came from a super
important time in Riley's life.

55
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,433
Like when she first scored a goal.
That was so amazing!

56
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,102
Hey! Would you look at that?
Very nice!

57
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,601
- We got a future center here!
- Nice job.

58
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:08,194
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,660
And each core memory

60
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,579
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

61
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,570
Like Hockey island.

62
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,898
Goofball island is my personal favorite.

63
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,714
Come back here, you little monkey!

64
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,675
Oh, you're silly.

65
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:37,052
Yep, Goofball is the best.

66
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,893
Friendship island is pretty good too.

67
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,667
I love Honesty island.
And that's the truth!

68
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:48,747
And of course,
Family island is amazing.

69
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:54,569
The point is, the islands of personality
are what make Riley...Riley!

70
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,377
Look out, mermaid!

71
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,107
Lava!

72
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:10,449
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong!

73
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,913
- Hey! Very nice!
- Where'd you learn that?

74
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:17,467
Ah!

75
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:19,088
Brain freeze!

76
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,968
Yeah!

77
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,140
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, dad.

78
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:40,768
And...We're out!

79
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,952
That's what I'm talking about!
Another perfect day!

80
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:45,245
Nice job, everybody!

81
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:47,981
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

82
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,670
All right, we did not die today!
I call that an unqualified success.

83
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,274
And that's it. We love our girl.

84
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,526
She's got great friends
and a great house.

85
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,487
Things couldn't be better.

86
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:22,896
After all, Riley's 11 now.
What could happen?

87
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:23,937
Sold

88
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,695
what...

89
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,581
Okay, not what I had in mind.

90
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,566
Inside
out

91
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:59,695
hey, look! The golden gate bridge!
Isn't that great?

92
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,155
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

93
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:04,241
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

94
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,201
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

95
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:09,413
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

96
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:10,706
Yeah...

97
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,083
- Are you kidding? Get out of the street!
- For Pete's sake! Move it!

98
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,335
These are my kind of people.

99
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:18,171
All right, just a few more blocks.
We're almost to our new house!

100
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:19,297
Step on it, daddy!

101
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,966
Why don't we just
live in this smelly car?

102
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,551
We've already been in it forever.

103
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,386
Which, actually, was really lucky,

104
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,054
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

105
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:28,390
what our new house
is going to look like!

106
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,892
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

107
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:32,686
- That looks safe!
- That one's nice.

108
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:35,230
This will be great for Riley!
No, no, no, no, this one!

109
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,566
Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

110
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,557
That's the one!
It comes with a dragon.

111
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,652
Now we're getting close,
I can feel it.

112
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:48,435
Here it is, here's our new house.
And...

113
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,953
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

114
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,842
- We're supposed to live here?
- Do we have to?

115
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,761
I'm telling you, it smells like
something died in here.

116
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:06,970
Can you die from moving?

117
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:09,389
Guys, you're overreacting.
Nobody is dying...

118
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,090
A dead mouse!

119
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,267
- Great. This is just great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

120
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,311
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

121
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:15,896
Get off of me!

122
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:17,272
Hey. All through the drive,

123
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:19,358
dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

124
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,442
Let's go check it out!

125
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:21,568
- Let's go!
- It's gonna be great!

126
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:22,653
Yes, yes, yes.

127
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:23,862
No, no, no, no, no.

128
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,322
I'm starting to envy
the dead mouse.

129
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,449
Get out the rubber ball,
we're in solitary confinement.

130
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,784
Riley can't live here.

131
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:29,951
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

132
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,286
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

133
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,997
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

134
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:36,667
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

135
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:39,002
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

136
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,087
Where did you read that?

137
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:41,463
It doesn't matter.
I read it and it's great.

138
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,924
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

139
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,343
- The hockey lamp goes there.
- Put the chair there.

140
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:49,721
- The trophy collection goes there.
- Stars! I like that!

141
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,808
Now we're talking! Let's go
get our stuff from the moving Van!

142
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,142
All right. Goodbye.

143
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:57,145
Well, guess what? The moving Van
won't be here until Thursday.

144
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,647
You're kidding.

145
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,149
The Van is lost?
It is the worst day ever!

146
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,985
That figures.
The Van is lost.

147
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,486
You said it would be here yesterday!

148
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,154
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

149
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,447
Mom and dad are stressed out!

150
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:09,700
- They're stressed out?
- What are we going to do?

151
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:12,148
I've got a great idea!

152
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,121
Did you even read the contract?

153
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,665
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

154
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,833
Hey!

155
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,001
No, you're not!

156
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:20,043
She's lining up for the shot!

157
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:21,211
Coming behind you.

158
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:23,634
- Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores! Yeah!

159
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:25,509
- Woo hoo.
- Whoa ho.

160
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,296
Come on, grandma!

161
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,011
Ha. "Grandma"?

162
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:31,752
Oh oh. She put her hair up,
we're in for it!

163
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:35,501
Hey, put me down!

164
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,275
Sorry.
Hold on. Hold on.

165
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:42,316
Hello?

166
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,400
Wait.
Wh...

167
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,231
You're kidding.

168
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:48,530
All right. Stall for me.
I'll be right there.

169
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:51,700
The investor's supposed to show up
on Thursday, not today!

170
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,453
- I got to go.
- It's okay. We get it.

171
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,296
You're the best.
Thanks, hon.

172
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:58,582
See you, sweetie.

173
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,389
Dad just left us.

174
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,047
He doesn't love us anymore. That's sad.
I should drive, right?

175
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:08,216
Joy?
What are you doing?

176
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,627
Just give me one second.

177
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:15,132
You know what I've realized?
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

178
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,394
Hey, I saw a pizza place
down the street.

179
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,562
Maybe we could try that?

180
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:22,022
Pizza sounds delicious.

181
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:24,353
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

182
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,445
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

183
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,113
That's it. I'm done.

184
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:33,241
Congratulations, San Francisco,
you've ruined pizza!

185
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:36,282
First the Hawaiians and now you!

186
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:39,915
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

187
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,209
Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?

188
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,587
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.
At that diner in Nebraska.

189
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,632
Yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself!

190
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,841
That was disgusting.

191
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,385
Good. Family is running.

192
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,636
Dad's got a steel stomach.

193
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:55,764
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

194
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,557
Spitting out the car window!

195
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:59,017
Definitely not when dad was singing.

196
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,102
Wearing a seat belt!

197
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,396
What about the time with the dinosaur?

198
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:04,147
- That's the one.
- Definitely!

199
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,232
Say cheese!

200
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,775
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

201
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:08,443
- Now hold still.
- The car!

202
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:12,314
Stop!
No, no, no!

203
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,907
Nice one, Joy.

204
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:17,278
I liked that time at the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

205
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,663
Wait.
What? What happened?

206
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:29,868
She did something to the memory.

207
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,258
What did you do?

208
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,467
I just touched it.

209
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,428
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

210
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,846
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

211
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,931
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

212
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:41,351
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

213
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:46,602
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know...
I thought maybe if you...

214
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:49,978
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

215
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:54,281
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figure out what's going on.

216
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:56,491
- Okay.
- All right. Get ready.

217
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:00,862
This is a monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down!

218
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,505
Wait, what?
What happened?

219
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,173
- A core memory!
- No!

220
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:16,845
Sadness, what are you doing?

221
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:20,916
It looked like one was crooked
so I opened it and then it fell out. I...

222
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,733
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

223
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:31,894
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa.

224
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,364
Sadness, you nearly
touched a core memory.

225
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,866
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

226
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,994
I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

227
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,871
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

228
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:45,165
You're not having a breakdown.
It's stress.

229
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,876
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

230
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:50,170
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

231
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:54,091
You know what?
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

232
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,761
There's always a way to
turn things around, to find the fun.

233
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:01,056
Yeah. Find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

234
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:04,757
Okay. Well, try to think
of something funny.

235
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:08,397
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

236
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:10,399
Yeah, that's not...

237
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,109
What about that time with Meg

238
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,980
when Riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose?

239
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:21,404
Yeah. That hurt.
It felt like fire.

240
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,078
It was awful.

241
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,830
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

242
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,456
What are your favorite things to do?

243
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,375
My favorite?

244
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,419
Well, I like it when we're outside.

245
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,255
That's good.
Like there's the beach and sunshine.

246
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:36,341
Like that time we buried dad
in the sand up to his neck.

247
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,542
I was thinking more like rain.

248
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:43,265
Rain?
Rain is my favorite, too!

249
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:45,225
We can stomp around in puddles.

250
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:48,603
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

251
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:52,441
More like when the rain runs down
our back and makes our shoes soggy.

252
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:55,569
And we get all cold, shivery,

253
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,530
and everything just
starts feeling droopy.

254
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,699
Hey, hey.
Hey, easy.

255
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,909
Why are you crying?

256
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,496
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

257
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:11,447
Crying helps me slow down and obsess
over the weight of life's problems.

258
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,546
You know what?
Let's, think about something else.

259
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,592
How about we read some
mind manuals, huh? Sounds fun.

260
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:20,135
I've read most of them.

261
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,928
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

262
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,098
"Long term memory retrieval,
volume 47"?

263
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:27,476
- No.
- A real page- Turner!

264
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:31,355
"Long term memory data selection
via channel subgrouping"?

265
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:34,066
See? Fun already!
You lucky dog.

266
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:38,397
You're reading these cool things.
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

267
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:50,499
What can we do? We've only got capital
to last a month, maybe two.

268
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,169
If we can't find investors by then,
we're going to have to lay people off.

269
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,506
Mom! Dad!
Come kiss me good night!

270
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:58,882
- I know. I know.
- Be right there!

271
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,793
We've got to land this, okay?

272
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,169
Did you hear dad?
He sounded really upset.

273
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,811
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

274
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,354
There are no bears in San Francisco.

275
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:14,564
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

276
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,900
I'm so jumpy.
My nerves are shot.

277
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,276
I don't want to hear
about your nerves.

278
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,361
I'll tell you what it is.

279
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,321
This move has been a bust.

280
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:22,531
That's what I've been
telling you guys!

281
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:25,242
There are at least 37 things
for Riley to be scared of right now.

282
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:27,077
The smell alone
is enough to make her gag.

283
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:29,079
I can't believe
mom and dad moved us here!

284
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,373
Look, I get it.
You guys have concerns.

285
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:32,833
But we've been through worse!

286
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,710
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

287
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,503
Riley should be happy about.

288
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,381
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

289
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,550
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

290
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,260
And all of our stuff
is in the missing Van!

291
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:45,095
Come on.
It could be worse.

292
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:48,666
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on the dirty floor. In a bag.

293
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:52,185
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.
But think of all the good things that...

294
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:55,939
No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

295
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,232
Let us handle this.

296
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,735
I say we skip school tomorrow
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

297
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,570
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

298
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:03,363
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

299
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,949
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

300
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,909
- It's a good one!
- Now hold on!

301
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,954
Look, we all have our off days.
You know...

302
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,080
Hi, honey.

303
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:16,251
The mom bad news train is pulling in.
Toot- toot!

304
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:18,253
Still no moving Van.

305
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,797
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

306
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:21,923
Toot- toot- toot!

307
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:23,050
Where's dad?

308
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:26,261
On the phone. This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

309
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,804
I rest my case!

310
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,598
Your dad's a little stressed,

311
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,516
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

312
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,847
Now for a few
well- placed withering scowls.

313
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,691
I guess all I really want to say is,
thank you.

314
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:44,154
You know, through all this confusion
you've stayed...

315
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,605
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

316
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:48,825
Your dad's under a lot of pressure,

317
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:53,372
but if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

318
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,743
We can do that for him. Right?

319
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,658
Well.

320
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,465
Yeah, sure.

321
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,826
What did we do to deserve you?

322
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,632
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

323
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,685
Well, you can't argue with mom.
Happy it is.

324
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,061
Team happy! Sounds great!

325
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,852
Totally behind you, Joy.

326
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,565
Looks like we're going into rem.

327
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,527
I got dream duty, so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

328
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:28,148
Great day today, guys!
Sleep well, team happy!

329
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:31,825
All right, what's on tonight,
dream production?

330
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,526
Well, this is it.
The new place.

331
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:45,121
Come live with me, Riley.

332
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:47,301
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

333
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:49,542
- Eat me!
- I'm organic!

334
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:53,807
No! Who is in charge
of programing down there?

335
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,468
I know I'm not supposed
to do this, but...

336
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:03,772
We are not going to
end the day like this.

337
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:48,528
don't you worry.

338
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:52,574
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

339
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,105
I promise.

340
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:08,590
Hello!
Did I wake you?

341
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:09,716
Do you have to play that?

342
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,009
Well, I have to practice.

343
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,300
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

344
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,391
Okay, first day of school!
Very, very exciting.

345
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,768
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

346
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:20,894
Here it is!
Fear.

347
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:23,480
I need a list of all the possible
negative outcomes

348
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:24,773
on the first day at a new school.

349
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:27,109
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

350
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,570
Disgust. Make sure Riley stands out
today. But also blends in.

351
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:32,447
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

352
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,616
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

353
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,784
"Joy."
"Yes, Joy?"

354
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:38,745
"You'll be in charge of the console,
keeping Riley happy all day long.

355
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:40,455
"And may I add I love your dress?
It's adorable."

356
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:43,486
"This old thing? Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls."

357
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,875
Train of thought!
Right on schedule.

358
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:50,215
Anger.
Unload the daydreams.

359
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,426
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

360
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:53,468
It might come in handy.

361
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,804
If this new school is
full of boring, useless classes.

362
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,472
Which it probably will be.

363
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:01,184
Sadness. I have a
super important job just for you.

364
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:04,005
- Really?
- Follow me.

365
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,941
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect!

366
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:10,068
This is the circle of Sadness.

367
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:14,489
Your job is to make sure that
all the sadness stays inside of it.

368
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,451
So you want me
to just stand here?

369
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:20,746
Hey, it's not my place
to tell you how to do your job.

370
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:25,292
Just make sure that
all the sadness stays in the circle!

371
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:28,628
See? You're a pro at this!
Isn't this fun?

372
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:29,838
- No.
- Atta girl.

373
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,131
All right, everyone, fresh start.

374
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:33,258
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

375
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,510
which will turn into a good year,
which turns into a good life!

376
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,930
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

377
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,516
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

378
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:42,934
How do I look?
Do you like my shirt?

379
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,645
Very cute!

380
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:46,313
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

381
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:48,231
Mom and dad?
With us in public?

382
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:49,843
- No thank you.
- I'm on it!

383
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:52,277
Nope! I'm fine.
Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

384
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,228
Have a good day at school, monkey.

385
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,203
Have a great day, sweetheart!

386
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:04,574
- That's crazy. It really is.
- That was so funny.

387
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,685
Do you know what
basketball game is coming up?

388
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,877
Are you sure we want to do this?

389
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:12,501
- In we go!
- Okay! Going in! Yes!

390
00:22:15,677 --> 00:22:16,802
Did you see her?
Hello?

391
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,614
Okay, we've got a group
of cool girls at two o'clock.

392
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,057
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.

393
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:23,725
Is she wearing eye shadow?

394
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:25,769
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
- Let's go talk to them!

395
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,396
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

396
00:22:27,397 --> 00:22:28,814
We want them to like us.

397
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,232
Oh, yeah.
Wait, what?

398
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,234
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

399
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:35,737
Worst scenario is either quicksand,
spontaneous combustion,

400
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:39,199
or getting called on by the teacher.
So as long as none of those happen...

401
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,660
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

402
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:45,077
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?
This is not happening!

403
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:47,916
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

404
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,252
No!
Pretend we can't speak English.

405
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,083
Don't worry. 
I got this.

406
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,589
Okay.

407
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,216
My name is Riley Andersen.

408
00:22:56,217 --> 00:23:00,087
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

409
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:04,099
And how about Minnesota?

410
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,559
Can you tell us something about it?

411
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,300
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

412
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:12,433
She's hilarious!

413
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:14,943
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

414
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,446
The lake freezes over,
and that's when we play hockey.

415
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:19,781
I'm on a great team.
We're called the prairie dogs.

416
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:22,784
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

417
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:25,412
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

418
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,289
It's kind of a family tradition.

419
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,928
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

420
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,796
Or we did, till I moved away.

421
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:35,964
- Hey, what gives?
- Wait, what?

422
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:40,260
Hey, Sadness! You touched a memory?
We talked about this.

423
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:41,970
Yeah, I know. 
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:43,639
Get back in your circle.

425
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,760
- What's going on? Why won't it eject?
- Get it out of there, Joy.

426
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,394
We used to play tag and stuff.

427
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,979
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

428
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,564
- Did you see that look?
- No.

429
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,265
They're judging us!

430
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:57,235
Somebody help me!
Grab that... everybody put...

431
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:01,936
But everything's different now.
Since we moved.

432
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,847
Oh no! We're crying!
At school!

433
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:11,032
What? Sadness!
What are you doing?

434
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,872
Oh, no!
I'm sorry!

435
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:16,505
It's a core memory!

436
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:18,866
But it's blue.

437
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:24,212
No! Wait!
Stop it! No! No!

438
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:31,687
Joy, no.

439
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,188
- That's a core memory!
- Hey!

440
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:35,023
- Joy, wait!
- Stop it! Let go!

441
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:37,484
The core memories!

442
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:53,742
No, no, no, no!

443
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:07,556
Thank you, Riley.

444
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:10,142
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

445
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:12,686
but we're happy to have you here.

446
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,855
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

447
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:17,596
and turn to chapter seven.

448
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:21,693
Can I say that curse word now?

449
00:25:41,883 --> 00:25:45,843
No! One, two, three.
Okay.

450
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:49,802
I got them.
Where are we?

451
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,803
Long term memory? Wait...

452
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,693
Goofball island?

453
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,650
Riley's islands of personality.
They're all down!

454
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:08,784
This is bad.

455
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:11,286
We... we can fix this!

456
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:13,205
We just have to get back
to headquarters,

457
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:17,526
plug the core memories in,
and Riley will be back to normal.

458
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:23,004
Riley has no core memories.
No personality islands and no...

459
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:24,424
What?
What is it?

460
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:25,467
You.

461
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:27,636
You're not in headquarters.

462
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,707
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

463
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,183
We got to get you
back up there.

464
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:35,264
I'm coming, Riley.

465
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,078
So, as it turns out, the green trash can
is not recycling, it's for Greens.

466
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,705
Like compost.
And eggshells.

467
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,541
And the blue one is recycling.
And the black one is trash.

468
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,626
Riley is acting so weird.
Why is she acting so weird?

469
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:02,045
What do you expect?
All the islands are down.

470
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:03,255
Joy would know what to do.

471
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,381
That's it.

472
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:07,301
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

473
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:11,722
Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust,
how are we supposed to be happy?

474
00:27:11,723 --> 00:27:14,308
Hey, Riley.
 I've got good news!

475
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:17,144
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

476
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:21,189
And get this: Try- outs are tomorrow
after school. What luck, right?

477
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,691
- Hockey?
- What do we do?

478
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:24,234
Guys, this is...

479
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:25,610
You pretend to be Joy.

480
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:28,151
Won't it be great
to be back out on the ice?

481
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:32,404
Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

482
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:34,661
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

483
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:37,572
- Because I'm not Joy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,375
Did you guys pick up on that?

485
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,377
- Something's wrong.
- Totally.

486
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:43,670
Should we ask her?

487
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:46,548
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,
so she doesn't notice.

488
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:48,884
So, how was the first day of school?

489
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:50,093
She's probing us.

490
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:51,637
I'm done.
You pretend to be Joy.

491
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:54,008
What? Okay.

492
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:57,392
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

493
00:27:57,393 --> 00:28:00,228
Very smooth.
That was just like Joy.

494
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,397
Something is definitely going on.

495
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:04,858
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

496
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:06,568
We're going to find out
what's happening.

497
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:07,903
But we'll need support.

498
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:09,604
Signal the husband.

499
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:16,784
With a nice pass over to Reeves,
comes across...And nice!

500
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,531
She's looking at us.

501
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,086
- What did she say?
- What?

502
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:25,587
Sorry, sir.
No one was listening.

503
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:28,048
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

504
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:29,925
What?
What is it, woman? What?

505
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:32,177
He's making that stupid face again.

506
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,096
I could strangle him right now.

507
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:35,957
Signal him again.

508
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,769
So, Riley, how was school?

509
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,729
- You got to be kidding me!
- Seriously?

510
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,774
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

511
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:47,943
Move!
I'll be Joy.

512
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:49,861
School was great, all right?

513
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:52,652
Riley.
Is everything okay?

514
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,117
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

515
00:28:55,118 --> 00:28:56,785
What is her deal?

516
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,537
All right, make a show of force.

517
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:00,122
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

518
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:02,124
No, not the foot!

519
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,459
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

520
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,086
I'll show you attitude, old man.

521
00:29:06,087 --> 00:29:08,077
No. No, no, no!
Stay happy!

522
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,590
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

523
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:12,384
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

524
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:14,303
Take it to defcon two.

525
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:16,964
You heard that, gentlemen.
Defcon two.

526
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:21,310
Listen, young lady, I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from...

527
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:24,229
You want a piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

528
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,814
Yeah, well... well...

529
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:28,805
Here it comes.
Prepare the foot!

530
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:31,772
Keys to safety position.

531
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:35,189
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

532
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,493
Just shut up!

533
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:41,496
Fire!

534
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:45,987
That's it!
Go to your room! Now!

535
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:52,124
The foot is down!
The foot is down!

536
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:56,928
Good job, gentlemen.
That could have been a disaster.

537
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,209
Well, that was a disaster.

538
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:05,098
Come fly with me, gatinha.

539
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:19,618
We're going to walk out there?
On that?

540
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,453
It's the quickest way back.

541
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:23,580
But it's right over the memory dump.

542
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,957
If we fall,
we'll be forgotten forever.

543
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:30,045
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

544
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:35,126
- Okay.
- It's not that high. It's totally fine...

545
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,430
Hey.

546
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:55,404
So, things got
a little out of hand downstairs.

547
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:58,268
Do you want to talk about it?

548
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,610
Come on, where's my happy girl?

549
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:04,152
Monkey.

550
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:07,117
He's trying to start up Goofball.

551
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,775
Come on!

552
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,756
Go back!
Run, run, run!

553
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,908
What...

554
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,010
I get it.
You need some alone time.

555
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:15,266
We'll talk later.

556
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:20,530
We have a Major problem.

557
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:22,651
Joy, where are you?

558
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,786
We lost Goofball island.

559
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:30,582
That means she can lose Friendship
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

560
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:33,210
You can fix this, right, Joy?

561
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:34,911
I...

562
00:32:35,505 --> 00:32:36,880
I don't know.

563
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,671
But we have to try.
Okay, come on.

564
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:42,427
Riley's gone to sleep.

565
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:46,515
Which is a good thing.
When you think about it because

566
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,767
nothing else bad can happen
while she's asleep.

567
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:50,936
We'll be back to headquarters
before she wakes up.

568
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:54,177
We'll just go across
Friendship island.

569
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:57,359
We'll never make it.

570
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,694
- No!
- No, no, no!

571
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:00,153
don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

572
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:02,030
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

573
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:04,616
Sadness, we don't have time for this.

574
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:08,203
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

575
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:10,664
Wait, Joy, you could
get lost in there!

576
00:33:10,665 --> 00:33:12,290
Think positive!

577
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:16,461
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

578
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,213
That's long term memory.

579
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:20,841
An endless Warren
of corridors and shelves.

580
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:23,385
I read about it in the manuals.

581
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:26,430
The manuals?
The manuals!

582
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:28,348
- You read the manuals!
- Yeah.

583
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:30,559
So you know the way
back to headquarters!

584
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,260
I guess.

585
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:36,231
You are my map!

586
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:39,526
Let's go! Lead on, my map!
Show me where we're going!

587
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:43,322
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

588
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:47,033
Just give me a few...Hours.

589
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:49,077
Which way?
Left?

590
00:33:49,078 --> 00:33:50,787
Right.

591
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:54,291
No. I mean, go left.
I said left was right. Like "correct."

592
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,542
Okay.

593
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:57,753
This actually feels kind of nice.

594
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:01,173
Okay, here we go! We'll be back
to headquarters before morning.

595
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:05,464
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

596
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:11,099
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

597
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,268
Yeah, just another right.

598
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:18,273
And...A left and then another...
Left and...

599
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:20,734
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

600
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:24,195
Because we seem to be
walking away from headquarters.

601
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,864
Riley's awake.

602
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:34,456
don't touch. Remember?
If you touch them, they stay sad.

603
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:38,001
Sorry, I won't.
Starting now.

604
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:40,379
I can't take much more of this.

605
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,963
Forget them!

606
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:45,174
- Mind workers!
- But, Joy, we're almost...

607
00:34:45,677 --> 00:34:48,553
Phone numbers. We don't need
all these. They're in her phone.

608
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:51,304
- Excuse me, hi.
- Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

609
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:53,809
- I need to find Friendship island.
- Look at this.

610
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,310
Four years of piano lessons.

611
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,645
Yeah, it looks pretty faded.

612
00:34:56,646 --> 00:35:00,107
You know what? Save chopsticks
and heart and soul, get rid of the rest.

613
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:01,817
- Are you...
- U.S. presidents. What do you think?

614
00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:04,069
Yeah, just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

615
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,321
- Forget 'em!
- Hey! You can't throw those away!

616
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:07,739
Those are perfectly good memories.

617
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,075
The names of
every "cutie pie Princess" doll?

618
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:13,245
Yes! That is critical information!
Glitterstorm, honeypants...

619
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,196
Forget 'em!

620
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:20,544
Hey! Bring those back!

621
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:22,838
They're in the dump.
Nothing comes back from the dump.

622
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,506
Yeah.
Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

623
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:26,967
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

624
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:28,385
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

625
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:32,472
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

626
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:34,433
- Tripledent gum
- will make you smile

627
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:35,809
the song from the gum commercial?

628
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,312
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to headquarters for no reason.

629
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:40,772
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

630
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:42,607
Like a million times!

631
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,734
Let's watch it again!

632
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:45,360
Tripledent gum

633
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:48,405
yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

634
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:49,656
Hey, what do you think?
Should we do it?

635
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:50,699
Yeah!

636
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,900
Okay, here we go!

637
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:56,538
Tripledent gum

638
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,909
what the... this again?

639
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:02,210
Wait! Do you know
how to get to Friendship island?

640
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:03,295
Tripledent gum

641
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:06,548
do you like it there? Did you feel
any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?

642
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:09,384
Yeah, it's good.
What happened with the playoffs?

643
00:36:09,385 --> 00:36:10,469
We won the first game.

644
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,763
Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.

645
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:15,724
And we've got this new girl
on the team. She's so cool.

646
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:17,309
She did not just say that.

647
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,562
A new girl?
Meg has a new friend already?

648
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:21,855
Hey, hey!
Stay happy!

649
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:24,191
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

650
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,360
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

651
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:27,819
It's like mind reading!

652
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,196
You like to read minds, Meg?

653
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:31,114
I got something for you to read,
right here!

654
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:33,145
Let's just be calm
for one second!

655
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:34,993
- I heard they have parrots...
- I've got to go.

656
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:37,074
- What?
- I got to go!

657
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:42,657
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is... oh, no!

658
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:48,143
Friendship island!
What?

659
00:36:58,976 --> 00:37:01,006
Not Friendship.

660
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:10,654
Riley loved that one.
And now it's gone.

661
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:14,985
Goodbye, Friendship.
Hello, loneliness.

662
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:21,325
We'll just have to go
the long way.

663
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:26,537
Yeah.
The long, long, long, long way.

664
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:28,826
I'm ready.

665
00:37:29,424 --> 00:37:32,384
There's got to be a better way.

666
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,510
Look at you!

667
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:39,308
I will take you, but not you.

668
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:41,768
Who am I kidding?
I can't leave you.

669
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:43,645
Hello!

670
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:45,556
Wait!
Hey! Wait!

671
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,523
Wait! 
Stop!

672
00:37:57,577 --> 00:37:59,317
Excuse me.

673
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,247
I was looking for... diversion!

674
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:04,818
- What?
- So long, sucker!

675
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:06,918
I hurt all over.

676
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:08,795
Wait. I know you.

677
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:12,424
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

678
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,884
No, no, no. I do.

679
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:16,678
Bing bong!
Riley's imaginary friend!

680
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,222
- You really do know me?
- Well, of course!

681
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:21,850
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

682
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:24,394
You would know. We're trying
to get back to headquarters.

683
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:26,647
Headquarters?
You guys are from headquarters?

684
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:29,816
Well, yeah. I'm Joy.
This is Sadness.

685
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,568
You're Joy?
The Joy?

686
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:33,236
What the heck are you doing out here?

687
00:38:33,237 --> 00:38:35,405
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

688
00:38:35,406 --> 00:38:38,450
Without you,
Riley won't ever be happy.

689
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:40,911
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

690
00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:42,996
I'll tell you what.
Follow me!

691
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:44,081
Thank you!

692
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:45,791
It is so great to see you again.

693
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,085
I gotta tell you,
I am such a huge fan of your work.

694
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:51,171
Do you remember
when you and Riley were in a band?

695
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,090
I went to all of your concerts.

696
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:54,591
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

697
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:56,218
Watching you play tag
was such a treat.

698
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,594
Two- time world champ.

699
00:38:57,595 --> 00:38:59,304
And remember your rockets?

700
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:01,640
Of course!
It runs on song power!

701
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:03,141
That's right!
Your theme song!

702
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:04,601
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

703
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:05,936
Bing bong
bing bong

704
00:39:05,937 --> 00:39:07,354
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

705
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:09,147
- Bing bong, Bing bong
- Bing bong, Bing bong

706
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:11,566
what exactly are you supposed to be?

707
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:14,361
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

708
00:39:14,362 --> 00:39:19,157
But shape- wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

709
00:39:19,158 --> 00:39:20,728
Dolphin?

710
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:26,164
You got to remember, when Riley
was three, animals were all the rage.

711
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:28,125
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

712
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:29,835
That's all people
talked about back then.

713
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:32,421
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.
What are you doing out here?

714
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:35,924
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

715
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:39,085
So I, you know...

716
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:42,514
Hey, hey. don't be sad.

717
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,683
Tell you what.
When I get back up to headquarters,

718
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:46,727
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

719
00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:49,758
- You will?
- Of course! She'd love that.

720
00:39:50,189 --> 00:39:53,349
This is the greatest day of my life!

721
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:58,271
Are you okay?

722
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:01,116
- Hey, what's going on?
- I cry candy.

723
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:03,937
Try the caramel.
It's delicious.

724
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:06,955
- Here, use this.
- Thanks!

725
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:08,696
Hold on, wait a second.

726
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:14,294
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

727
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:19,384
Here. What?
It's imaginary.

728
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:22,471
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to headquarters.

729
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:24,306
Walk?
We're not walking.

730
00:40:24,307 --> 00:40:27,087
We're taking the train of thought!

731
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:29,936
The train, of course!

732
00:40:29,937 --> 00:40:32,522
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

733
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:34,316
Well, it kind of goes
all over the place,

734
00:40:34,317 --> 00:40:36,777
but there is a station
in imagination land.

735
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:39,529
I know a shortcut.
Come on, this way!

736
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,324
I am so glad we ran into you!

737
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:45,077
The station is right through here.
After you.

738
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:46,471
- Joy.
- What?

739
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:49,706
I read about this place in the manual.
We shouldn't go in there.

740
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:52,292
Bing bong says
it's the quickest way to headquarters.

741
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:54,544
No, but, Joy,
this is abstract thought.

742
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:58,173
What are you talking about? I go in here
all the time. It's a shortcut, you see?

743
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:02,674
D- a- n- g- e- r. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

744
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:08,626
Look at me. I'm closer to the station
because I'm taking the shortcut.

745
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:10,268
Let's go around.
This way.

746
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,719
Almost there!

747
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:15,524
If you want to walk the long way,
go for it.

748
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,567
But Riley needs to be happy.

749
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,404
I'm not missing that train.
Bing bong knows what he's doing.

750
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:22,364
He's part dolphin.
They're very smart.

751
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:24,735
Well, I guess.

752
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:29,705
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

753
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:46,888
Okay, what abstract concept
are we trying to comprehend today?

754
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:48,640
Loneliness.

755
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:50,267
Looks like there's something in there.

756
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:52,769
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

757
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,010
What did I tell you?
You'll be at headquarters in no time.

758
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:58,679
Say, would you look at that?

759
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:02,442
- What's happening?
- Oh, no, they turned it on.

760
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,400
Never seen this before.

761
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:10,114
My face!
My beautiful face!

762
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:11,663
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

763
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:15,834
There are four stages. This is the first:
Non-objective fragmentation!

764
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:17,002
All right.
Do not panic.

765
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:20,123
What is important
is that we all stay together.

766
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:23,550
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

767
00:42:23,551 --> 00:42:25,251
Run!

768
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:28,509
I can't feel my legs!

769
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:29,723
There they are.

770
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:31,634
Come here, me!

771
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:36,730
We've got to get out of here before
we're nothing but shape and color!

772
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:38,315
We'll get stuck here forever!

773
00:42:38,316 --> 00:42:40,150
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

774
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:42,819
I told you, it's a shortcut!

775
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,110
The train!

776
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,953
Oh, no. We're two- dimensional!
That's stage three!

777
00:42:51,954 --> 00:42:52,996
We're getting nowhere!

778
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:56,777
- Depth! I'm lacking depth!
- Come on.

779
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:00,545
We can't fit.

780
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:04,466
Oh, no, we're nonfigurative.
This is the last stage!

781
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:06,917
We're not going to make it!

782
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:12,377
Wait! We're two- dimensional.
Fall on your face!

783
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:25,147
Stop! Stop!

784
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:28,949
No! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

785
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,952
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

786
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:34,162
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

787
00:43:34,163 --> 00:43:35,372
How long until the next train?

788
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:39,126
Who knows. But don't worry.
There's another station. That way.

789
00:43:39,127 --> 00:43:42,295
The train always stops there.
Right before it goes to headquarters.

790
00:43:42,296 --> 00:43:44,339
If we hurry, we can catch it.

791
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,330
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

792
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:49,177
Yeah!

793
00:43:49,178 --> 00:43:51,013
Is there really another station?

794
00:43:51,014 --> 00:43:52,884
Through there.

795
00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:57,185
Welcome to imagination land!

796
00:43:57,186 --> 00:43:59,313
- Imagination land?
- Sure!

797
00:43:59,314 --> 00:44:01,732
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

798
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:04,568
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French fry forest!

799
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:06,903
- No way! 
- Delicious.

800
00:44:06,904 --> 00:44:09,614
Check it out! Trophy town!

801
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:13,395
Medals! Ribbons!
Everyone's a winner!

802
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:15,495
I won first place!

803
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:18,332
- Me too!
- Participation award.

804
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:21,835
Wait, is that...
Sadness, look, it's cloud town!

805
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:23,879
That is my favorite!

806
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,339
It's so soft!

807
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,132
Let me try.

808
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,009
Hey! What's the big idea?

809
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,420
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

810
00:44:33,848 --> 00:44:35,918
Oh, no! Lava!

811
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:39,336
Imagination land is the best!

812
00:44:39,854 --> 00:44:42,689
Is it all going to be so interactive?

813
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,067
Hey, look! The house of cards!

814
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:47,486
Wait. Hang on just a minute.

815
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,029
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

816
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,822
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

817
00:44:50,823 --> 00:44:53,943
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

818
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:56,328
- I'm sorry.
- Great.

819
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:58,497
I love imagination land.

820
00:44:58,498 --> 00:45:01,948
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

821
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:05,170
Who the heck is that?

822
00:45:05,171 --> 00:45:06,588
Imaginary boyfriend.

823
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:09,119
I would die for Riley.

824
00:45:09,258 --> 00:45:12,088
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

825
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,680
Anyway, this way.
Through preschool world!

826
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:17,551
- We're nearly to the train!
- Riley, here we come!

827
00:45:20,103 --> 00:45:23,689
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

828
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,065
These kids look pretty good,

829
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:26,775
considering they're from San Francisco.

830
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:28,151
Okay, Andersen, you're up!

831
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:31,279
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie!

832
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,531
Luck isn't going to help us now.

833
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,366
If she tries to use Hockey island,
it's going down.

834
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:37,786
Which is why I've recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

835
00:45:37,787 --> 00:45:40,622
One of these has got to work
in place of the core memory.

836
00:45:40,623 --> 00:45:42,743
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

837
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:53,039
We did it, gang!
It's working!

838
00:45:55,388 --> 00:46:00,338
Line change! Line change!
Change it up!

839
00:46:04,522 --> 00:46:06,522
No!
No!

840
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:13,113
It's like we don't learn anything.

841
00:46:13,114 --> 00:46:15,198
- Come on!
- Let's pick it up out there!

842
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,359
Pass!
Shoot it! Shoot it!

843
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,705
- That's it!
- No, no, no! Breathe.

844
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,616
Find your happy place.

845
00:46:27,295 --> 00:46:29,415
What's her problem?

846
00:46:35,094 --> 00:46:37,137
- Riley. What's wrong?
- Let's go.

847
00:46:37,138 --> 00:46:39,723
- You're not going to finish try-outs?
- What's the point?

848
00:46:39,724 --> 00:46:42,100
Hey. It'll be all right.
Let's just go back...

849
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:44,851
Stop saying everything
will be all right!

850
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:48,354
Nice hustle, ladies!

851
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,730
Hockey?

852
00:47:00,203 --> 00:47:04,748
No, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

853
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:07,084
- Hey! Look at that! Very nice shot!
- Hey!

854
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:09,044
Bing bong,
we have to get to that station.

855
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:11,254
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham cracker castle.

856
00:47:11,255 --> 00:47:14,508
Hey. That's weird. Graham cracker
castle used to be right here.

857
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:16,885
I wonder why they moved it?
That's not...

858
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:19,471
I would have sworn
sparkle pony mountain was right here.

859
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:21,306
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

860
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:23,587
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess dream world!

861
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:29,427
Oh, no!
The stuffed animal hall of fame!

862
00:47:30,316 --> 00:47:32,016
My rocket!

863
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:34,319
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

864
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,905
It still has some song power left!

865
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:39,106
Who's your friend who likes to play?

866
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:48,709
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

867
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,700
Riley and I are going to the moon!

868
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,789
Riley can't be done with me.

869
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:07,936
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

870
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:09,938
We just need to
get back to headquarters.

871
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:11,315
Which way to the train station?

872
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:14,516
I had a whole trip
planned for us.

873
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:20,483
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?
Here comes the tickle monster!

874
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,320
Hey, bing bong!
Look at this!

875
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:26,913
Here's a fun game!

876
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:31,084
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

877
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:34,995
Won't that be fun?
Come on, let's go to the train station!

878
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:38,415
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

879
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,305
They took something that you loved.
It's gone. Forever.

880
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:45,724
Sadness. don't make him feel worse.

881
00:48:45,725 --> 00:48:49,019
- Sorry.
- It's all I had left of Riley.

882
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,390
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

883
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:53,982
They were wonderful.

884
00:48:53,983 --> 00:48:57,819
Once we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

885
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,987
Sadness...

886
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:02,282
It sounds amazing.
I bet Riley liked it.

887
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:06,411
She did.
We were best friends.

888
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:09,412
Yeah. It's sad.

889
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,210
I'm okay now.

890
00:49:23,972 --> 00:49:27,512
Come on.
The train station is this way.

891
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:34,940
How did you do that?

892
00:49:34,941 --> 00:49:36,942
I don't know. He was sad.

893
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:38,276
So I listened to what...

894
00:49:38,277 --> 00:49:41,397
Hey! There's the train!

895
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:55,332
We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

896
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:59,464
Oh, no! These facts and opinions
look so similar.

897
00:49:59,465 --> 00:50:02,745
don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

898
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:09,099
On a scale of one to ten,
I give this day an f.

899
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,227
Well, why don't we quit standing around
and do something?

900
00:50:12,228 --> 00:50:13,395
Like what, genius?

901
00:50:13,396 --> 00:50:15,314
Like quitting.
That's what I'm doing.

902
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:20,105
Sure it's the coward's way out.
But this coward's gonna survive.

903
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,440
Emotions can't quit, genius!

904
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,248
I thought we were supposed
to be keeping Riley happy.

905
00:50:33,249 --> 00:50:35,489
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

906
00:50:40,757 --> 00:50:42,382
- What is it?
- Nothing.

907
00:50:42,383 --> 00:50:44,760
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

908
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:47,429
All the good core memories
were made in Minnesota.

909
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:50,599
Ergo, we go
back to Minnesota and make more.

910
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,683
- Ta- da!
- Wait, wait, wait.

911
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:53,685
You're saying we run away?

912
00:50:53,686 --> 00:50:55,145
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

913
00:50:55,146 --> 00:50:57,856
I'd call it the happy core
memory development program.

914
00:50:57,857 --> 00:50:59,232
You can't be serious.

915
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:00,734
Hey! Our life was perfect

916
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:05,315
until mom and dad decided
to move to San Fran stinktown.

917
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:07,074
I mean, it's just so drastic!

918
00:51:07,075 --> 00:51:09,326
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

919
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:12,697
Our room? Our back yard? Our friends?

920
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,207
- Tripledent gum
- will make you smile

921
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,959
did I ask for the gum commercial?

922
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,461
Anyway, it was better,
that's my point.

923
00:51:19,462 --> 00:51:22,047
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

924
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:24,633
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

925
00:51:24,634 --> 00:51:26,176
Fine.
Let's sleep on it.

926
00:51:26,177 --> 00:51:29,137
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun- filled times

927
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:32,218
are just around the corner.

928
00:51:43,528 --> 00:51:45,195
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

929
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:47,656
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

930
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:49,533
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

931
00:51:49,534 --> 00:51:51,827
Yeah, the train of thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

932
00:51:51,828 --> 00:51:54,287
- We can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up?

933
00:51:54,288 --> 00:51:57,778
Sadness, that's ridiculous!
How could we possibly...

934
00:51:59,502 --> 00:52:00,627
How about we wake her up?

935
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:03,213
- Great idea, Joy.
- Thanks. Come on!

936
00:52:03,214 --> 00:52:05,544
Dream
productions

937
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:10,345
this place is huge!

938
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:13,466
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

939
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,139
I can fly?
I love that one!

940
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:20,887
Rainbow unicorn!
She's right there!

941
00:52:23,192 --> 00:52:26,278
My friend says you're famous.
She wants your autograph.

942
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:29,156
No, no, Sadness,
don't bother miss unicorn, okay?

943
00:52:29,157 --> 00:52:32,777
Sorry, she's from out of town.
That was so embarrassing, right?

944
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:35,620
I loved you in
fairy dream adventure part 7.

945
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:37,289
Okay, bye.
I love you!

946
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,540
Do not enter when
light flashing

947
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,334
wonder what that means.

948
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:42,205
Well, let's go in.

949
00:52:43,755 --> 00:52:46,548
Set up the classroom set!
Today's memories are in!

950
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:48,467
We've got a lot
to work with here.

951
00:52:48,468 --> 00:52:51,511
Riley dumped her best friend,
had a miserable day at school,

952
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:52,596
and quit hockey.

953
00:52:52,597 --> 00:52:54,890
The writers have
put together a killer script!

954
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:57,100
Just because Joy
and Sadness are gone,

955
00:52:57,101 --> 00:52:59,391
I have to do stupid dream duty.

956
00:53:00,355 --> 00:53:02,522
Okay. How are we
going to wake her up?

957
00:53:02,523 --> 00:53:05,442
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

958
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:06,526
We could scare her.

959
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:08,862
Scare her? No,
she's been through enough already.

960
00:53:08,863 --> 00:53:09,946
- But, Joy...
- Sadness,

961
00:53:09,947 --> 00:53:12,532
you may know your way
around down here, but I know Riley.

962
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:16,078
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

963
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,412
We'll excite her awake!

964
00:53:17,413 --> 00:53:19,581
That's never happened before.

965
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:21,249
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

966
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,292
I don't think that'll work.

967
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:24,044
- Bing bong?
- Yeah?

968
00:53:24,045 --> 00:53:27,795
- don't let anything happen to these.
- Got it.

969
00:53:28,383 --> 00:53:31,253
Add the reality distortion filter.

970
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:35,555
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

971
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:37,265
Riley is the camera!

972
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:41,216
Makeup, get out of there,
we are on in five, four, three...

973
00:53:42,772 --> 00:53:44,815
Hello, class.

974
00:53:44,816 --> 00:53:48,360
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

975
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:50,153
Man, she is one bad actress.

976
00:53:50,154 --> 00:53:52,614
...which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

977
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:57,244
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

978
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:59,413
Would you like to stand up

979
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,784
- and introduce yourself?
- Camera.

980
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:04,084
And cue Riley.

981
00:54:04,085 --> 00:54:05,794
My name is Riley Andersen.

982
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:09,335
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

983
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,960
Look! Her teeth are falling out!

984
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:14,594
- That's disgusting.
- Gross!

985
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:17,835
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

986
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:20,142
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

987
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:22,185
Hey, look! She came to school
with no pants on!

988
00:54:22,186 --> 00:54:23,353
Called it!

989
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:24,396
Ready?

990
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:27,733
I don't think this happy thing
is going to work. But if we scare her...

991
00:54:27,734 --> 00:54:29,944
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

992
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:32,738
Bark! Bark! Bark!

993
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:34,519
Who is that?

994
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:36,232
What's going on?

995
00:54:38,453 --> 00:54:40,033
Asleep
asleep -  awake

996
00:54:41,873 --> 00:54:44,163
you're on! Go!

997
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:47,836
Let's party! Let's dance!

998
00:54:47,837 --> 00:54:49,657
Hey, a party.

999
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:51,673
Bark, bark, bark!

1000
00:54:51,674 --> 00:54:54,294
Joy, this isn't working.

1001
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,630
Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here!

1002
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:07,313
It's just a dream, it's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

1003
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:11,638
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

1004
00:55:11,986 --> 00:55:13,654
Hi, Riley, it's me!

1005
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:15,155
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing bong?

1006
00:55:15,156 --> 00:55:18,436
- Bing bong, bing bong!
- Sadness, stop! It was working!

1007
00:55:20,078 --> 00:55:22,371
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

1008
00:55:22,372 --> 00:55:24,452
But look, it's working!

1009
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:28,197
They are not part of this dream.
Get them!

1010
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:30,041
Stop right there!

1011
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:33,161
Pan away!
Pan away!

1012
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:39,096
Pick a plotline!

1013
00:55:39,097 --> 00:55:40,889
- Careful!
- Hold still!

1014
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,265
You can't do this!

1015
00:55:42,266 --> 00:55:45,086
I know people in headquarters!

1016
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:49,564
Cut that out! Please!

1017
00:55:49,565 --> 00:55:53,777
Do you like candy? You look hungry.
I get you candy! No!

1018
00:55:53,778 --> 00:55:56,196
No, no.
No, no!

1019
00:55:56,197 --> 00:55:57,781
There go the core memories!

1020
00:55:57,782 --> 00:56:00,822
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark! Please!

1021
00:56:01,244 --> 00:56:03,244
Come on.

1022
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,665
- What is this place?
- The subconscious.

1023
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:11,286
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1024
00:56:13,423 --> 00:56:14,798
My hat feels loose.

1025
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,425
How do we get in?

1026
00:56:16,426 --> 00:56:19,011
- Let me see.
- You got my hat? Or is that your hat?

1027
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:20,095
- Yeah, it's my hat.

1028
00:56:20,096 --> 00:56:22,836
You sure?
I don't know, look in the label.

1029
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:25,309
- Yeah, it says, "my hat."
- Wait, it says, "my hat"?

1030
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,144
- My hat, it says.
- That's what I wrote in my hat.

1031
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:28,729
- What are you talking about?
- You've got my hat on.

1032
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,230
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1033
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:33,481
- Hey! You!
- You caught us!

1034
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:36,733
Get back in there! No escaping!

1035
00:56:45,872 --> 00:56:50,832
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

1036
00:56:52,086 --> 00:56:54,406
It's broccoli.

1037
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:58,789
The stairs to the basement!

1038
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:03,047
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1039
00:57:10,897 --> 00:57:12,847
Okay, come on.

1040
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,485
- Would you walk quieter?
- I'm trying.

1041
00:57:16,486 --> 00:57:18,186
What is going...

1042
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,310
Candy wrappers?

1043
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:34,002
- Bing bong!
- Joy?

1044
00:57:34,003 --> 00:57:35,703
- There you are.
- Shhh!

1045
00:57:42,428 --> 00:57:43,971
It's Jangles.

1046
00:57:43,972 --> 00:57:46,382
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1047
00:57:57,694 --> 00:57:59,486
Do you have the core memories?

1048
00:57:59,487 --> 00:58:03,767
Yeah.
All he cared about was the candy!

1049
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:23,468
We're out of here!
Let's get to that train!

1050
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:27,723
Wait! The train's not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

1051
00:58:27,724 --> 00:58:29,594
But how?

1052
00:58:31,853 --> 00:58:33,683
Oh, no!

1053
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,584
Hey, Sadness. Did you hear \about
the pa- pa- party they were having?

1054
00:58:55,585 --> 00:59:00,255
Yeah. Yes, Joy.
Isn't it a birthday party?

1055
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:03,342
Did you say birthday?

1056
00:59:03,343 --> 00:59:05,427
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1057
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:06,678
And games and balloons...

1058
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,221
A birthday?

1059
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:10,842
Okay. Follow us!

1060
00:59:11,934 --> 00:59:13,935
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1061
00:59:13,936 --> 00:59:15,437
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1062
00:59:15,438 --> 00:59:16,938
No it isn't.
That's my... I wrote that.

1063
00:59:16,939 --> 00:59:18,889
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1064
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:40,505
Who's the birthday girl?

1065
00:59:44,968 --> 00:59:47,338
Come on, let's go!

1066
00:59:53,977 --> 00:59:55,769
We made it!

1067
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:58,230
Guess who's on their way
to headquarters!

1068
00:59:58,231 --> 00:59:59,971
We are!

1069
01:00:06,197 --> 01:00:08,907
- What is going on?
- He did it again!

1070
01:00:08,908 --> 01:00:11,451
We were at school, and we were naked,
and there was a dog,

1071
01:00:11,452 --> 01:00:14,871
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw bing bong!

1072
01:00:14,872 --> 01:00:18,208
You idiot! It was a dream!
This is ridiculous!

1073
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:21,003
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1074
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:22,754
Time to take action.

1075
01:00:22,755 --> 01:00:24,464
Stupid mom and dad.

1076
01:00:24,465 --> 01:00:26,675
If they hadn't moved us,
none of this would've happened.

1077
01:00:26,676 --> 01:00:28,666
Who's with me?

1078
01:00:30,138 --> 01:00:31,918
No no no no no.

1079
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:34,631
Yeah. Let's do it.

1080
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,155
She took it.
There's no turning back.

1081
01:00:48,156 --> 01:00:50,866
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1082
01:00:50,867 --> 01:00:52,951
Well, why don't we go down
to the elephant lot

1083
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:54,119
and rent an elephant?

1084
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,412
Hey.
That sounds nice.

1085
01:00:55,413 --> 01:00:57,573
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1086
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:01,168
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1087
01:01:01,169 --> 01:01:03,211
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1088
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:05,589
- Mom's purse.
- You wouldn't.

1089
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,960
But I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1090
01:01:09,802 --> 01:01:11,887
- Tripledent gum
- no!

1091
01:01:11,888 --> 01:01:15,390
It's downstairs somewhere.
Mom and dad got us into this mess.

1092
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,591
They can pay to get us out.

1093
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:24,066
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?
You can see everything from up here.

1094
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:27,361
Look, there's inductive reasoning.
There's déjà vu.

1095
01:01:27,362 --> 01:01:30,197
There's language processing.
There's déjà vu.

1096
01:01:30,198 --> 01:01:32,866
There's critical thinking.
There's déjà vu.

1097
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:35,237
Hey, look at this, guys!
Memories!

1098
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:40,666
Hey. That was a good idea.
About scaring Riley awake.

1099
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,250
You're not so bad.

1100
01:01:42,251 --> 01:01:44,044
Really?

1101
01:01:44,045 --> 01:01:45,755
Nice work.

1102
01:01:46,673 --> 01:01:48,757
I can't wait to get
the old Riley back.

1103
01:01:48,758 --> 01:01:51,593
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1104
01:01:51,594 --> 01:01:52,928
Is this Riley?

1105
01:01:52,929 --> 01:01:55,764
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1106
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:57,265
How are we gonna
get to the moon?

1107
01:01:57,266 --> 01:02:00,102
It's that time in the twisty tree,
remember?

1108
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:04,189
The hockey team showed up
and mom and dad were there cheering.

1109
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:07,560
Look at her,
having fun and laughing.

1110
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:09,778
I love this one.

1111
01:02:09,779 --> 01:02:11,738
I love that one, too.

1112
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:14,282
Atta girl!
Now you're getting it!

1113
01:02:14,283 --> 01:02:18,120
Yeah. It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1114
01:02:18,121 --> 01:02:23,121
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1115
01:02:23,793 --> 01:02:27,333
Sorry.
I went sad again, didn't I?

1116
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:31,300
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1117
01:02:31,301 --> 01:02:33,081
Okay.

1118
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,959
But I just don't understand.

1119
01:02:38,725 --> 01:02:41,345
Why did our moving Van
even go to Texas?

1120
01:02:45,648 --> 01:02:47,848
Multiple customers?

1121
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:57,280
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1122
01:03:06,669 --> 01:03:10,909
Excuse me, isn't there any way
that you can rush it?

1123
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,666
Honesty island?

1124
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:27,643
Look out!

1125
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:34,230
Come on!

1126
01:03:37,867 --> 01:03:39,034
Hold on!

1127
01:03:39,035 --> 01:03:43,825
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!
Come on, people! Let's, go, go, go!

1128
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:56,927
That was our way home.

1129
01:03:56,928 --> 01:03:59,471
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1130
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:02,808
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1131
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:04,679
What?

1132
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:08,101
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1133
01:04:08,523 --> 01:04:10,649
Are we really doing this?
I mean, this is serious.

1134
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,359
Look.
We have no core memories.

1135
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,902
You want Riley to be happy?

1136
01:04:13,903 --> 01:04:17,233
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1137
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:21,481
Joy, if we hurry,
we can still stop her.

1138
01:04:22,078 --> 01:04:24,398
Family island. Let's go!

1139
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:41,513
Joy! Joy!
It's too dangerous!

1140
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:43,844
We won't make it in time.

1141
01:04:46,394 --> 01:04:48,604
But that's our only way back!

1142
01:05:00,575 --> 01:05:02,655
A recall tube!

1143
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:07,410
We can get recalled!

1144
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:11,543
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1145
01:05:11,544 --> 01:05:13,754
See you after school, monkey.

1146
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:15,465
We love you!

1147
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:20,835
Go! Run, run!
Go!

1148
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:34,524
Whoa! Whoa!
Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1149
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:36,276
You're hurting Riley!

1150
01:05:36,277 --> 01:05:38,612
No, no, no!
I did it again!

1151
01:05:38,613 --> 01:05:42,983
If you get in here,
these core memories will get sad.

1152
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:50,957
I'm sorry.
Riley needs to be happy.

1153
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:53,368
Joy?

1154
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:08,429
Joy!

1155
01:06:12,188 --> 01:06:14,308
Joy!

1156
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,920
Joy?

1157
01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:56,102
Joy!

1158
01:07:01,779 --> 01:07:05,189
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1159
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:12,581
don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1160
01:07:12,582 --> 01:07:14,622
We're forgotten.

1161
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:25,543
We used to play tag and stuff.

1162
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:31,681
But everything's different now.

1163
01:07:33,144 --> 01:07:35,644
Since we moved.

1164
01:08:05,802 --> 01:08:12,222
Do you remember how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring?

1165
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,980
I could listen to
her stories all day.

1166
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:41,122
I just wanted Riley
to be happy.

1167
01:08:43,381 --> 01:08:45,671
And now...

1168
01:09:41,856 --> 01:09:45,734
It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1169
01:09:45,735 --> 01:09:49,945
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1170
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:52,359
She wanted to quit.

1171
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:11,749
Sadness.

1172
01:10:12,136 --> 01:10:16,256
Mom and dad... the team...

1173
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:20,969
They came to help
because of Sadness.

1174
01:10:26,484 --> 01:10:28,854
We have to get back up there.

1175
01:10:29,112 --> 01:10:31,862
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1176
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:34,731
We might as well be
on another planet.

1177
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:42,493
Another planet.

1178
01:10:44,544 --> 01:10:48,004
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1179
01:10:50,508 --> 01:10:53,510
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1180
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:57,051
His rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1181
01:10:59,934 --> 01:11:03,020
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say?

1182
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:06,231
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1183
01:11:06,232 --> 01:11:08,562
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1184
01:11:21,664 --> 01:11:23,534
Hop in.

1185
01:11:26,336 --> 01:11:29,588
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1186
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:31,798
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1187
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:35,302
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1188
01:11:35,303 --> 01:11:37,763
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1189
01:11:37,764 --> 01:11:39,765
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1190
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:43,046
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing the song to say...

1191
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:50,692
Come on!

1192
01:11:50,693 --> 01:11:52,944
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1193
01:11:52,945 --> 01:11:55,280
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1194
01:11:55,281 --> 01:11:57,282
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1195
01:11:57,283 --> 01:11:59,483
who's your friend who likes to play?

1196
01:12:12,382 --> 01:12:14,582
Come on, Joy.
One more time.

1197
01:12:14,717 --> 01:12:16,927
I got a feeling about this one.

1198
01:12:16,928 --> 01:12:18,804
Bing bong, bing bong
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"

1199
01:12:18,805 --> 01:12:20,222
Bing bong, bing bong

1200
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,015
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1201
01:12:22,016 --> 01:12:24,393
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1202
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:27,270
Louder!
Joy, sing louder!

1203
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:30,061
To sing this song to say
who's your friend who likes to...

1204
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:32,901
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1205
01:12:32,902 --> 01:12:34,903
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1206
01:12:34,904 --> 01:12:37,322
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1207
01:12:37,323 --> 01:12:38,490
bing bong

1208
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:40,571
We're gonna make it!

1209
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:50,627
Bing bong!
We did it!

1210
01:12:50,628 --> 01:12:54,998
We... bing bong?
Bing bong!

1211
01:12:55,425 --> 01:12:57,675
You made it!

1212
01:12:58,344 --> 01:13:01,304
Go! Go save Riley!

1213
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:07,975
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?

1214
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:23,855
I'll try, bing bong.

1215
01:13:25,872 --> 01:13:28,412
I promise.

1216
01:13:41,054 --> 01:13:43,214
We're home!

1217
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:46,682
Riley?
Riley!

1218
01:13:50,313 --> 01:13:52,473
I'll call her cell.

1219
01:13:55,818 --> 01:13:57,778
This is terrible. Wait,
is that someone walking towards us?

1220
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,689
Yep, let's cross the street.

1221
01:14:03,826 --> 01:14:05,327
It's mom.
She's onto us!

1222
01:14:05,328 --> 01:14:06,662
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

1223
01:14:06,663 --> 01:14:08,205
Riley needs to get core memories.

1224
01:14:08,206 --> 01:14:10,486
- That's the stuff.
- We keep going.

1225
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:15,042
Sadness!

1226
01:14:24,847 --> 01:14:27,015
Sadness!
Sadness?

1227
01:14:27,016 --> 01:14:29,518
Come on, Sadness.
Where are you?

1228
01:14:29,519 --> 01:14:32,719
Okay. If I were Sadness,
where would I be?

1229
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:37,401
Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1230
01:14:37,402 --> 01:14:41,442
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1231
01:14:56,087 --> 01:14:58,457
Oh, no! It's mom again!
What do we do?

1232
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:07,222
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1233
01:15:07,223 --> 01:15:09,423
Let's get this idea
out of her head.

1234
01:15:09,726 --> 01:15:11,546
Sadness?

1235
01:15:13,062 --> 01:15:16,262
- Sadness!
- Joy?

1236
01:15:16,357 --> 01:15:17,927
Wait!
Sadness!

1237
01:15:17,942 --> 01:15:22,029
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1238
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:23,730
Come back!

1239
01:15:28,369 --> 01:15:32,039
Okay, you're saying your husband
was blown away by an elephant.

1240
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,165
Was he with anyone?

1241
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:34,583
Yes!
And there she is!

1242
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:36,084
Hey!
Come back here!

1243
01:15:36,085 --> 01:15:38,945
Forget it, Jake. It's cloud town.

1244
01:15:42,091 --> 01:15:44,251
What? Sadness!

1245
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:47,054
I only make everything worse!

1246
01:15:47,055 --> 01:15:49,975
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1247
01:15:59,442 --> 01:16:01,068
- It's stuck!
- Great.

1248
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:03,403
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1249
01:16:03,404 --> 01:16:05,734
Oh, no no no no!
What is this?

1250
01:16:14,123 --> 01:16:15,666
- How do we stop it?
- I got it!

1251
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,459
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1252
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,586
- Brilliant!
- I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1253
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:21,672
Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

1254
01:16:21,673 --> 01:16:22,297
- Let me try.
- Great! You broke it!

1255
01:16:22,298 --> 01:16:23,465
No, I didn't! don't touch that!

1256
01:16:23,466 --> 01:16:25,326
- Let me do it!
Get out of here!

1257
01:16:29,305 --> 01:16:33,425
Guys, we can't make
Riley feel anything.

1258
01:16:33,643 --> 01:16:36,013
What have we done?

1259
01:16:36,145 --> 01:16:39,314
Hey! Hey, look at me!
Did you mean what you said before?

1260
01:16:39,315 --> 01:16:41,775
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1261
01:16:41,776 --> 01:16:44,136
Yeah, okay, haircut.
Time to prove it.

1262
01:16:47,323 --> 01:16:49,241
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1263
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:52,492
I would die for Riley!

1264
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:09,790
That's it! I fold!

1265
01:17:40,126 --> 01:17:44,956
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1266
01:17:48,009 --> 01:17:50,629
I am positive this is crazy!

1267
01:17:53,848 --> 01:17:57,428
- Now!
- For Riley!

1268
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:06,937
- Joy?
- Hang on!

1269
01:18:07,403 --> 01:18:10,273
I wish Joy was here!

1270
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:18,858
It's Joy!

1271
01:18:19,082 --> 01:18:20,992
Stand back!

1272
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:22,417
That worked.

1273
01:18:22,418 --> 01:18:24,698
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1274
01:18:24,921 --> 01:18:27,756
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1275
01:18:27,757 --> 01:18:28,757
What?

1276
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:30,592
Of course your
tiny brain is confused.

1277
01:18:30,593 --> 01:18:33,470
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1278
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:38,471
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you, but let me try. Duh!

1279
01:18:47,443 --> 01:18:48,777
Thank goodness you're back!

1280
01:18:48,778 --> 01:18:50,779
- Things are really messed up!
- We found this idea.

1281
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:53,360
We were just
trying to make happy memories.

1282
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:04,292
Joy, you got to fix this!
Get up there!

1283
01:19:04,293 --> 01:19:06,044
Sadness, it's up to you.

1284
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:08,380
- Me?
- Sadness?

1285
01:19:08,381 --> 01:19:09,631
I can't, Joy.

1286
01:19:09,632 --> 01:19:12,922
Yes, you can.
Riley needs you.

1287
01:19:24,147 --> 01:19:26,007
Okay.

1288
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,290
Wait!
Stop! I want to get off!

1289
01:20:00,224 --> 01:20:01,975
All right.
Thank you. We will.

1290
01:20:01,976 --> 01:20:04,452
Her teacher hasn't even 
seen Riley all day.

1291
01:20:04,477 --> 01:20:05,685
- What?
- What was she wearing last?

1292
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,790
- Do you even remember what...
- I can't believe this.

1293
01:20:07,815 --> 01:20:09,691
Riley, there you are! 
Thank goodness!

1294
01:20:09,692 --> 01:20:12,152
We were worried sick!
Where have you been? It's so late!

1295
01:20:12,153 --> 01:20:14,279
Honey! What happened?
Are you all right?

1296
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,114
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1297
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,895
we talked to your teacher.

1298
01:21:44,078 --> 01:21:47,948
I know you don't want me to but...

1299
01:21:48,624 --> 01:21:50,664
I miss home.

1300
01:21:51,836 --> 01:21:54,156
I miss Minnesota.

1301
01:21:56,883 --> 01:22:00,793
You need me to be happy, but...

1302
01:22:01,846 --> 01:22:06,926
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1303
01:22:08,394 --> 01:22:10,854
I want to go home.

1304
01:22:12,231 --> 01:22:14,721
Please don't be mad.

1305
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:20,444
- Oh. Sweetie.
- We're not mad.

1306
01:22:21,324 --> 01:22:25,534
You know what?
I miss Minnesota too.

1307
01:22:26,537 --> 01:22:29,817
I miss the woods
where we took hikes.

1308
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:33,163
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1309
01:22:33,336 --> 01:22:36,826
Spring lake,
where you learned to skate.

1310
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:40,211
Come here.

1311
01:24:00,757 --> 01:24:02,507
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1312
01:24:02,508 --> 01:24:04,051
Friendship island has expanded.

1313
01:24:04,052 --> 01:24:06,720
Glad they finally opened
that friendly argument section.

1314
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:09,014
I like Tragic Vampire Romance island.

1315
01:24:09,015 --> 01:24:11,725
Fashion island?
Everyone shut up.

1316
01:24:11,726 --> 01:24:14,061
Boy band island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1317
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:17,814
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1318
01:24:17,815 --> 01:24:19,441
All right.
Here you go.

1319
01:24:19,442 --> 01:24:22,732
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

1320
01:24:23,946 --> 01:24:25,614
Cool!
Upgrade!

1321
01:24:25,615 --> 01:24:28,365
Hey! Whoops, wait.
Did I just do that?

1322
01:24:29,118 --> 01:24:30,619
Hey, guys?
What's pub- er- Ty?

1323
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:32,913
I don't know.
It's probably not important.

1324
01:24:32,914 --> 01:24:36,625
I have access
to the entire curse word library!

1325
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:39,486
This new console is the...

1326
01:24:39,837 --> 01:24:41,463
Sorry. I did it again.
My bad.

1327
01:24:41,464 --> 01:24:43,164
They're getting to the rink.

1328
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:46,218
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1329
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:47,970
- I know, dad.
- But not too aggressive.

1330
01:24:47,971 --> 01:24:50,806
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1331
01:24:50,807 --> 01:24:53,850
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!
Go foghorns!

1332
01:24:53,851 --> 01:24:58,438
- Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!
- Okay! I got to go!

1333
01:24:58,439 --> 01:24:59,773
They love us.

1334
01:24:59,774 --> 01:25:01,441
Yeah, mom and dad are pretty cool.

1335
01:25:01,442 --> 01:25:04,602
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1336
01:25:06,155 --> 01:25:07,823
She loved the face painting!

1337
01:25:07,824 --> 01:25:09,524
Told you it was a great idea!

1338
01:25:10,076 --> 01:25:14,026
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1339
01:25:18,126 --> 01:25:19,793
Just in case.

1340
01:25:19,794 --> 01:25:21,494
Oh!

1341
01:25:22,422 --> 01:25:24,122
Sorry.

1342
01:25:26,384 --> 01:25:31,214
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1343
01:25:33,182 --> 01:25:36,722
Okay. Bye.

1344
01:25:36,978 --> 01:25:39,848
Remember, just hustle.

1345
01:25:40,064 --> 01:25:43,524
- Go, Riley!
- You got this!

1346
01:25:44,861 --> 01:25:47,029
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1347
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:49,900
All right.
Let's play some hockey!

1348
01:25:50,742 --> 01:25:51,825
All right, Anger, take it!

1349
01:25:51,826 --> 01:25:53,035
Give us that puck or
you're dead meat!

1350
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:54,119
On our left. On our left!

1351
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,954
Let's just try
not to get all smelly this time.

1352
01:25:55,955 --> 01:25:58,123
Mom and dad are watching us fail.

1353
01:25:58,124 --> 01:26:00,244
Not for long!

1354
01:26:00,918 --> 01:26:03,003
We've been through a lot lately,
that's for sure.

1355
01:26:03,004 --> 01:26:05,047
But we still love our girl.

1356
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:07,716
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1357
01:26:07,717 --> 01:26:09,217
Things couldn't be better.

1358
01:26:09,218 --> 01:26:14,014
After all, Riley's 12 now.
What could happen?

1359
01:26:34,077 --> 01:26:37,412
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1360
01:26:37,413 --> 01:26:40,123
Anyone?
Jordan?

1361
01:26:42,126 --> 01:26:43,460
How much more of this?

1362
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:47,172
5 months, 2 weeks and 4 days
until Summer vacation.

1363
01:26:47,173 --> 01:26:50,884
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1364
01:26:50,885 --> 01:26:54,545
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1365
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,930
Have a nice day.

1366
01:27:00,269 --> 01:27:01,561
What are we mad about?

1367
01:27:01,562 --> 01:27:03,480
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

1368
01:27:03,481 --> 01:27:06,891
- What's Troy mad about?
- I don't know.

1369
01:27:06,943 --> 01:27:09,023
I know.
Totally.

1370
01:27:09,278 --> 01:27:11,905
We're a total fraud!
Do you think they can see through us?

1371
01:27:11,906 --> 01:27:13,782
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

1372
01:27:13,783 --> 01:27:16,517
Being cool is so exhausting.

1373
01:27:16,518 --> 01:27:22,569
Who's the birthday girl?
Hey! Hello?

1374
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:27,254
6 years of drama school for this?

1375
01:27:27,255 --> 01:27:29,375
Move it, will you?

1376
01:27:31,384 --> 01:27:33,302
What are you doing?
Come on!

1377
01:27:33,303 --> 01:27:35,012
You know what? This is okay.
This is fine.

1378
01:27:35,013 --> 01:27:37,347
We just need to go
to our happy place.

1379
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:38,515
Tripledent gum

1380
01:27:38,516 --> 01:27:40,893
No!
Not this again!

1381
01:27:45,148 --> 01:27:47,138
I smell food.

1382
01:27:47,608 --> 01:27:48,859
The man has food.

1383
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:51,149
Get the food.

1384
01:28:16,000 --> 01:34:37,000
