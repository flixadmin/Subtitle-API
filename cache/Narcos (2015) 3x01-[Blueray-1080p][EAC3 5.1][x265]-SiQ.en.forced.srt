1
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:23,195
<i>Thank you for being here with us,
with the groom and the bride.</i>

2
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:26,240
<i>Come and dance with us, everyone.
Let's begin.</i>

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,914
Congratulations.

4
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:59,189
-Don Chucho.
-Luis, how are you?

5
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:00,440
How are you, sir?

6
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,074
Hello, Paco.

7
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:15,038
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

8
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:58,493
Will you tell me something?

9
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:04,040
What happened to you over there?

10
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:07,919
-Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
-But you want to go back?

11
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:41,781
Sir, here you are.

12
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,742
Thank you.

13
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:05,305
{\an8}FOR BEING FRIENDS
WITH PABLO ESCOBAR - LOS PEPES

14
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:32,457
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

15
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:34,876
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

16
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:30,598
Hello.

17
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,187
Yes. What's up?

18
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:39,983
Let's see.

19
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,257
Palmira's police superintendent.

20
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:05,508
Didn't we just take care of him?

21
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:08,595
-I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
-How much?

22
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:10,346
-Should I put $20,000?
-No.

23
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,849
Put 17.

24
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,268
-Seventeen?
-Yes.

25
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:59,813
Anderson! Move all that over to the left.

26
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:01,898
The tables are too close together.

27
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,156
Are you planning on saying
anything tonight?

28
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,992
No.

29
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:15,787
I'll speak for the both of us.

30
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:18,414
-Did you talk to the North Valley people?
-Yes.

31
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:21,876
And?

32
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:24,546
They said what they thought
I wanted to hear.

33
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:28,174
But tonight, after the announcement,
we'll know the truth.

34
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:33,763
You're more superstitious than Aunt Luz.

35
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,416
Hey, boss.

36
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,917
Is everything ready?

37
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:07,964
It took all night, but" it's ready, sir.

38
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,592
You can handle it, you're young.

39
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,809
We're meeting Córdova.
He wants to go over the game plan.

40
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,062
Big night tonight, right?

41
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,024
Lots of company.

42
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:44,626
Gentlemen. Let's start with the obvious.

43
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,295
Tonight is fucking important.

44
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,839
The Rodriguez brothers never...

45
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,592
gather members of their organization
in one place.

46
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:57,222
That simply never happens.
But tonight, they're going to do it.

47
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:00,391
So we have to be sharp.

48
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,603
-Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
-Yes, sir.

49
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,648
-Jorge.
-Stay focused.

50
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:09,150
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

51
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,527
Tonight is his last operation.

52
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:15,490
He's leaving us
to become a fancy businessman.

53
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,493
Let's leave a good impression.

54
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:21,454
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

55
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,165
Let's go.

56
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:33,549
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

57
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:38,179
I think it's a move into the Asian market.

58
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:39,472
I have no idea.

59
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,100
After Friday, it's not my problem.

60
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,768
Are you really leaving?

61
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:46,020
I promised Paola.

62
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:51,401
I promise things to my wife every day,
brother.

63
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,196
Relax, you'll find someone else
to make you look good.

64
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:57,949
I hope so, buddy.

65
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:00,994
Because right now,
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

66
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,891
Who am I speaking with?

67
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,145
This is Andres, his brother.

68
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,774
And how can I help him?

69
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:13,042
Hey, brother. Have a seat.

70
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:17,964
Something to drink?

71
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,391
Relax. You're safe here.

72
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,437
Let's talk about tonight's party.

73
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,314
We need info on the people attending.

74
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:37,442
Cops, politicians.

75
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,318
-Cops and politicians?
-Yes.

76
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:42,488
Who work for the cartel.
These people are ruining your country.

77
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:50,288
Look, the thing is, these people
never get together in one place.

78
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:55,126
We need to know why now.

79
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,545
Our guess is Gilberto Rodriguez

80
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:00,423
is making some kind
of important announcement.

81
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:01,883
Understand?

82
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,285
Come in.

83
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,422
We were getting worried. Everything okay?

84
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,133
Yes, but...
I thought someone was tailing me.

85
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,346
I had to make sure I was alone.

86
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,643
Take off your shirt. Sit.

87
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:24,567
Ready.

88
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:18,496
Look, don't you think you should
fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

89
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,668
He's a boss.

90
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,671
We're in their territory, right?

91
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:32,718
Yes.

92
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:34,512
I'll fix it tonight.

93
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,556
Maria.

94
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,063
For our children,
and our children's children.

95
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,650
That sounded great, brother.

96
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:50,861
Let me do it from the top.

97
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:54,031
No one gives a shit about your speech.
We can hear it after...

98
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:00,162
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

99
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:03,958
What's up?

100
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,752
Look at you. How's New York?

101
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:11,132
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

102
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,051
I brought you something, baby-face.

103
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:24,645
It's been too long
since we were all together.

104
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,775
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

105
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:35,072
-Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
-Cheers!

106
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:38,242
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

107
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:42,079
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

108
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:45,624
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

109
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:48,627
Cheers, then!

110
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,171
To the Pope!

111
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:54,049
Welcome, Chepe.

112
00:20:58,262 --> 00:20:59,472
Look, Gilberto...

113
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:03,726
you know I have a personal issue

114
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:06,854
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

115
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:09,440
And he's downstairs.

116
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:11,734
I would like to solve it.

117
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,863
Okay, Pacho.

118
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:19,158
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

119
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:23,829
There's too much at stake.

120
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:28,459
Well... shall we enjoy
this expensive party or what?

121
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,756
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

122
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,175
Chepe, you motherfucker.

123
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:58,864
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

124
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,660
I pay him money every month.

125
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:05,830
I pay all these people.

126
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:08,791
Well done, big shot.

127
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,209
It's not your money.

128
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,127
But I'm the one who controls it.

129
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:14,713
-Who bought you these earrings?
-Guillermo. Enough.

130
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,007
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

131
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,305
Shit. Get out of here.

132
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:40,239
-How are you, sir?
-Pallomari.

133
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:42,241
-Enjoying the party?
-Yes.

134
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:45,619
Yes.

135
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,205
Nice to see you.

136
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:51,208
Don Gilberto, good evening.

137
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,128
-Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
-Don Gilberto, how are you?

138
00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:57,882
Good evening, Don Gilberto.

139
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:06,557
-Look, here it is.
Motherfucker.

140
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:20,738
Hello.

141
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,781
-Good evening.
-Can I have <i>aguardiente</i> with ice?

142
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:25,034
-Of course.
-Thank you.

143
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,055
Are you...

144
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:48,974
enjoying yourself?

145
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,894
Yes. Very much, thank you.

146
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:01,153
Miguel Rodriguez, nice to meet you.

147
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,655
Maria Salazar.

148
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:04,990
Thank you for having us.

149
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,930
Good evening.

150
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:29,765
Mister Rodriguez would like
for his associates

151
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:31,892
to join him in the equestrian ring
for an announcement.

152
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:33,811
Please, go right ahead.

153
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:37,815
Gentlemen, please follow the ushers
towards the stables. Thank you.

154
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:45,739
Stop there.

155
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:49,034
You must be using some high-end equipment

156
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:51,286
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

157
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:53,330
Who are you?

158
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:55,624
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodriguez brothers.

159
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,127
See that man over there?

160
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,462
His name is Navegante.

161
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:02,631
Guess what he does?

162
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:07,553
Either you come with me,
or you go with him.

163
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,929
You understand?

164
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:12,307
Follow me.

165
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:31,452
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

166
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:33,996
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

167
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:37,583
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

168
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:40,836
Your brother is Lucho.

169
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:44,256
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

170
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,176
That's why you agreed to work for the DEA.

171
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:48,927
Don't lie to me.

172
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:51,930
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

173
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:55,476
But I think you're smart enough
to realize that.

174
00:25:56,268 --> 00:26:00,022
You have another decision to make,
and it's the only way to get out alive.

175
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:02,441
Leave Cali.

176
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:07,029
Don't say goodbye to your mother
or to your girlfriend.

177
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:08,822
I need you to disappear.

178
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,828
Associates.

179
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:16,955
Friends.

180
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,917
Our enemy is dead!

181
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,630
Our business is strong!

182
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:27,800
Together we have taken this business

183
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:31,428
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

184
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:34,598
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

185
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,569
<i>Listen to me.</i>

186
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,073
<i>The law enforcement spotlight will shine 
brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.</i>

187
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:58,872
<i>And so, while we celebrate,</i>

188
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,042
<i>they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.</i>

189
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:09,174
<i>An American named Joseph Kennedy</i>

190
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:12,136
made his fortune
selling bootlegged liquor,

191
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,930
but he turned that money into legitimacy.

192
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:17,182
His children, great politicians.

193
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:20,936
And one of them
was even elected president.

194
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:24,648
Yes, gentlemen, we have been negotiating
with the authorities,

195
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,235
and soon we will reach an agreement.

196
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:36,785
Our organization, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

197
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:44,168
We will surrender our labs,
our safe houses,

198
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,672
and our trafficking routes.

199
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,842
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

200
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:58,640
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

201
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:01,268
Our money will remain ours.

202
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:04,771
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

203
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:09,443
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

204
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,113
And gentlemen,
as a token of our friendship,

205
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,283
we'll give each of you a juicy share

206
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,622
of the final profits from this year.

207
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:30,714
To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.

208
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:36,011
For our children...
and our children's children!

209
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,058
-Cheers...
-Cheers!

210
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:42,643
-Cheers, gentlemen!
-Cheers!

211
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:46,605
-What did you think?
-I think it's a great move.

212
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:51,318
-Congratulations!
-For the future!

213
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:57,157
Thank you, brother. Thank you for coming.

214
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:16,843
What would you like?

215
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,262
Whiskey. Dry.

216
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,367
Six months.

217
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:43,203
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

218
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:47,916
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

219
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,173
And then what?

220
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:00,137
We only have six months
of doing whatever the fuck we want?

221
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:16,111
I love you, brother.

222
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:21,283
I'll see you on the dance floor.

223
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,722
-Can you get in the car, please?
-Why do you want to leave so early?

224
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:45,182
Because it's time, okay?

225
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,725
-Why are you treating me like this?
-That's enough!

226
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,227
Get in the car.

227
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:17,255
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

228
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:20,133
Very good, sir.

229
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:25,764
Do you think we surprised them?

230
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:29,476
Yes. I think you surprised many people.

231
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:35,774
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.
What happened there?

232
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:41,113
Don't be modest.

233
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:43,657
Córdova told me.

234
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:46,034
It's your talent.

235
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:50,122
Spotting the threat,
knowing when they're going to fuck us.

236
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,874
It's priceless.

237
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,714
I'm told you want to leave.

238
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:05,512
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

239
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:11,309
I'm starting my own security firm.

240
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:15,856
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

241
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:21,903
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

242
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,824
You have done great things for us
over the years.

243
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,452
For my family. For me.

244
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:33,415
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

245
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:46,428
With all due respect,
I've already made arrangements...

246
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:49,473
Arrangements can change.

247
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:53,768
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

248
00:32:57,189 --> 00:33:00,192
We will need you more than ever
in the months ahead.

249
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:03,778
It's only six months.

250
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:08,533
Can I count on you, Jorge?

251
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:11,369
Yes?

252
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,167
Of course, boss.

253
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:19,336
Miguel.

254
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,335
The same.

255
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,603
Thanks.

256
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:14,649
Hello?

257
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:17,944
Hello? Who is this?

258
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:45,388
NATIONAL POLICE

259
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:13,124
Who am I speaking with?

260
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:30,350
-Juan.
-Here it is, sir.

261
00:40:30,516 --> 00:40:31,517
Thank you.

262
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:49,494
Don Gilberto.

263
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:52,622
This just arrived.

264
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,215
Put them on.

265
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:12,642
<i>Subject's name: Diaz.</i>

266
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:15,812
<i>Recorded at El Nacional Hotel. Room 117.</i>

267
00:41:18,314 --> 00:41:21,859
<i>Retirement works for these motherfuckers.
They're fish.</i>

268
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:24,237
I just bought a brand new plane.

269
00:41:24,404 --> 00:41:27,073
So that motherfucker Gilberto
can shove it up his ass.

270
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:31,160
<i>Besides, who are they to make a deal</i>
without consulting with us?

271
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:34,288
<i>They don't get to surrender on our behalf.</i>

272
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:37,709
That son of a bitch Diaz.

273
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:41,546
I'm going to send Navegante.

274
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:44,716
<i>Subject's name: Santos.</i>
Recorded in zone 4.

275
00:41:46,926 --> 00:41:49,929
They're going to have to give me more
than that fucking wrapping paper.

276
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,102
Fucking balls on the old goat
to tell me how to run my business.

277
00:41:58,438 --> 00:42:01,441
That's not going to be so easy.
These men are weak.

278
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,820
I'll handle that one myself.

279
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:07,655
The man is an animal.

280
00:42:08,322 --> 00:42:10,825
<i>Subject name: Beltre.</i>

281
00:42:11,284 --> 00:42:15,204
I'm not going to wait for Rasguño or Henao
to snatch the good territories.

282
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:17,915
Let's organize
so we can put a move together now.

283
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:21,335
Fuck Joseph Kennedy,
whoever that asshole is.

284
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:24,714
Córdova...

285
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:27,717
El Pecas will handle that one.

286
00:42:28,217 --> 00:42:29,427
You got it, sir.

287
00:42:33,056 --> 00:42:35,558
<i>Subject name: Salazar.</i>

288
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:39,270
<i>Maria, I'll be back soon.</i>
I'm going out with some friends.

289
00:42:39,437 --> 00:42:42,190
<i>What do you mean, Claudio?</i>
You're going out now?

290
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:46,027
Please don't look at me like that.

291
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,154
It's one o'clock in the morning.

292
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:50,198
Exactly, Maria. It's one o'clock.

293
00:42:50,364 --> 00:42:53,159
Keep your voice down
so you don't wake the guests.

294
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:55,953
Fuck off, Claudio. Go with your whores.

295
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,622
Don't fuck with me, Maria,
because I'm tired

296
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:01,000
from clapping all night
for that motherfucker's bullshit.

297
00:43:02,502 --> 00:43:03,753
<i>Don't fuck with me.</i>

298
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,639
Well... that's husband and wife business.

299
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:16,849
Leave him out.

300
00:43:19,268 --> 00:43:20,311
No, brother.

301
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:26,067
Salazar shows no respect.

302
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:31,155
Better safe than sorry.

303
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:13,656
Honey. What time is it?

304
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,491
It's late.

305
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:18,202
Go back to sleep.

306
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:20,538
How was work?

307
00:44:20,997 --> 00:44:21,831
Fine.

308
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:27,461
I spoke with Miguel.

309
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:32,633
And?

310
00:44:35,261 --> 00:44:36,846
He asked me not to leave.

311
00:44:37,763 --> 00:44:39,473
Just for a little while.

312
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:41,601
How long?

313
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:45,980
I'm asking you how long.

314
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:48,524
-Six months.
-Six months?

315
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:51,694
What did you tell him?

316
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:56,824
What could I tell him? It's six months.

317
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:00,077
We've talked about this for a long time.

318
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:04,040
You're telling me we can't start our new
lives because we have to wait six months?

319
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:09,921
You know what? I don't think
you really want to leave this job.

320
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:12,340
-How can you say that?
-You think I'm an idiot?

321
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:13,966
You like working for them.

322
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:17,136
It's become your life, Jorge.

323
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:21,057
You are my life. The girls are my life.

324
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:24,227
-What do you want me to do?
-Don't say another word.

325
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:27,104
-It's six months, not six years.
-Not another word.

326
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:26,706
She owns a spa.

327
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:28,958
Let's go. We should go!

328
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:12,418
What can I get you?

329
00:47:12,585 --> 00:47:15,546
A bottle of <i>aguardiente,</i>
and play "Dos Gardenias" for me.

330
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:16,881
Gladly, Don Pacho.

331
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:19,842
Thank you.

332
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:34,106
Please, Claudio...

333
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:39,320
accept this as a token of respect.

334
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,865
To let bygones be bygones.

335
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:49,622
You know what, Pacho?

336
00:47:51,499 --> 00:47:54,502
I think our differences are in the past.

337
00:48:01,842 --> 00:48:04,220
I'll be right back to share it with you.

338
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:05,388
Excuse me.

339
00:48:05,971 --> 00:48:06,806
Please.

340
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,823
-Claudito.
-And now... the bottle.

341
00:50:30,241 --> 00:50:31,283
Go ahead.

342
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,412
Claudito!

343
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:38,332
-Pacho, motherfucker!
-Pacho, please.

344
00:50:38,499 --> 00:50:40,834
Don't do this. Don't do this to me.

345
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:42,336
Please, Pacho.

346
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:47,925
Pacho, please! Pacho, wait!

347
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:51,178
Please, let's talk. Pacho!

348
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:54,348
Motherfucker.
He didn't do anything to you.

349
00:50:56,058 --> 00:50:58,602
Pacho, you motherfucker!

350
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:01,522
Wait, Pacho! Pacho, son of a bitch!

351
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:02,690
Pacho!

352
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,068
Please, no!

353
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:08,946
Son of a bitch!

354
00:51:10,322 --> 00:51:12,074
Pacho, son of a bitch!

355
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:16,787
No!

356
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:18,330
Son of a bitch, Pacho!

357
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:24,545
Motherfucker!

358
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:26,338
Claudio!
