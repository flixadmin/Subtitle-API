1
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,000
Imagine this,

2
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:25,420
President of Colombia goes
on TV and tells the whole world

3
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:27,339
he'll never make a deal with you.

4
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:30,884
Now a normal person
thinks, "I'm fucked."

5
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:34,763
But Pablo Escobar, he thinks that's
just your opening offer.

6
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,016
So the man finds a way to respond.

7
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:58,305
And how did Gaviria take Pablo's offer?

8
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:03,351
I think it's safe to say
that he didn't really care for it.

9
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:06,897
But it wasn't just Gaviria
Pablo was talking to.

10
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,484
In his mind, he was also negotiating
with the leader of the free world.

11
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:25,290
You see, the problem was, George Bush
had his own plans for Escobar.

12
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:26,875
We will, for the first time,

13
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:31,129
make available the appropriate resources
of America's armed forces.

14
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:34,925
And for the drug kingpins,
the death penalty.

15
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:39,387
And with a commander in chief who
used to be the head of the CIA,

16
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,056
well, you can use your imagination

17
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,601
as to what
"appropriate resources" might mean.

18
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,480
He started by
appointing a new ambassador.

19
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:52,484
Badass former Navy man, Arthur Crosby...

20
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:57,948
who specialized in Latin
American affairs and counterterrorism.

21
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:03,828
Next, he dug into his old CIA Rolodex,

22
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:07,332
where there was no shortage of guys
who knew how to fight dirty.

23
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,628
And he sent us one of those, too.

24
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,918
Lastly, and what Peña and I like to

25
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:19,660
call his own personal
"fuck you" to us...

26
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:25,016
he sent us something he thought
we must need: A boss.

27
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:30,605
Now just how long that person
would be my boss remained to be seen.

28
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,467
My title might be "ambassador,"

29
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,136
but that's some bullshit
politician's word.

30
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,514
I know what it means
to be on the front lines.

31
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:33,311
And everybody in this room wants
the same thing, to take down Escobar.

32
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,816
Now as a veteran of numerous
conflicts, I learned one immutable truth:

33
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,783
The only way to
succeed is by working together,

34
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:43,697
by communicating, by sharing intelligence
and collaborating.

35
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,323
Understood?

36
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:50,704
Uh, this is Claudia Messina.
She is the new DEA country attaché.

37
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:53,999
She'll be taking over all DEA
operations in-country. Messina?

38
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,875
Thank you, Ambassador.

39
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,715
The DEA will be opening field offices
in Cali, Cartagena and Barranquilla.

40
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:04,217
As far as the
Medellín team is concerned,

41
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,096
they will be housed out of CNP headquarters
until further notice.

42
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,807
But only after some
personnel changes have been made.

43
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,643
All right, now as far as
long-term intelligence is concerned,

44
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:17,731
that's under the purview of the CIA,
the station chief, Bill Stechner.

45
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,458
Bill, you have
anything you'd like to add?

46
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,859
I'm good.

47
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,350
All right, who's here from Centra Spike?

48
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,890
I am, sir. Edward Jacoby.

49
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:30,302
All right, let's get Centra Spike
back in the air immediately.

50
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:32,370
I want to know every word
these assholes say

51
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:35,334
and all information flows through me
and I will disseminate as I see fit.

52
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:36,499
Yes, sir.

53
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,724
When Escobar sticks
his fucking head out,

54
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:41,236
we're gonna nail that son of a bitch.

55
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,219
What about him?

56
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:45,115
Other than the fact that
he wasn't here today.

57
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,343
Well, I suggested that he stay home.

58
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,930
You mentioned making some changes.
What exactly does that mean?

59
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:53,433
It means I'm making some changes.

60
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:55,870
Murphy's a good agent. He's
done a lot of good work down here.

61
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:56,978
Yeah.

62
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:00,940
Looks like it.

63
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:08,114
Do you have any idea
the strings that were pulled

64
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:09,866
to get that guy not to press charges?

65
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,303
Sounds to me like the guy
would've had a dog sniffing up his ass

66
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:14,528
before he got on the plane.
Maybe Steve did him a favor.

67
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,456
Was that a thank you?

68
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,045
Be straight with me, Agent Peña,
and I'll be straight with you.

69
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,881
I don't need a guy like that
making my life more difficult.

70
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,966
- And making the DEA look bad.
- Ma'am...

71
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,136
Messina. Or boss.

72
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,805
We've been down here a long time.

73
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,890
You've been down here
all of what, two hours?

74
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:39,896
It may not make the front page, but...

75
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,941
a lot of the intel we have
is because of Steve.

76
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,903
He's a good man. He's going
through some shit right now.

77
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:48,881
You know, he was at the airport

78
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,230
to stop his wife from leaving the

79
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,929
country with their
kid. He didn't make it.

80
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,120
Add that to watching Escobar
build a five-star prison

81
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:57,997
and then walking out the back door.

82
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,545
We both deserve to see this through...

83
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,047
boss.

84
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,436
Have you, uh... had
anything to eat in the last 24 hours?

85
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,065
This new boss... Messina...

86
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,150
what do you know about her?

87
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,612
Only what I've heard.
She's out of New York.

88
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,867
Doesn't put up with any shit.

89
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,036
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

90
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,246
Am I out?

91
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,291
I don't know.

92
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:47,422
Well, I ain't ready to go
home yet, Javi. I'll tell ya that.

93
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,423
Damn it! She's fucking...

94
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:55,930
Take a shower. Sober up.

95
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:57,223
Talk to you.

96
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:20,093
Now, Gaviria had made it clear

97
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:23,304
that the government was
not to negotiate with Escobar.

98
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:25,807
But Colombia Attorney General
Gustavo de Greiff

99
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,518
didn't give a shit
what the president wanted.

100
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:34,690
Unlike the US, where the attorney general
is appointed by the president,

101
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:38,694
in Colombia, the Supreme Court
chooses the attorney general,

102
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,197
whether the president likes it or not.

103
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:47,412
And in the case of Gustavo de Greiff,
you bet your ass Gaviria didn't.

104
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,126
Uh-huh.

105
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,500
Listen, thanks for talking
to Messina, man.

106
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,670
I mean it. You saved my ass.

107
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,009
One more fuck-up, Murphy...

108
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:09,345
Oh, I know.

109
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:12,390
Is it gonna happen again?

110
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:16,310
I don't know.

111
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:22,066
DEA politics weren't the only
thing we had to navigate.

112
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,777
The Pinzón plan was in full effect.

113
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:28,823
He was doubling down on police presence.

114
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:34,203
Medellín was under martial law
and the base of Carlos Holguín

115
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,955
would look like Fort Apache.

116
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:41,002
Me and Javi were
officially guests of the CNP.

117
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,212
With all the comforts and amenities

118
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:47,091
that a guest of the National
Colombian Police could expect.

119
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:49,010
Which was zero.

120
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:52,388
And we weren't alone.

121
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:59,020
The DEA, CIA, Centra Spike
and the army, all under one roof.

122
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:03,816
It was one-stop shopping
for all things Pablo Escobar.

123
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:13,284
After Gaviria announced a new $1.4
million reward for Pablo's capture,

124
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,454
Colonel Pinzón activated
a new tip line.

125
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:20,666
And apparently he thought Javi and
I were just the guys to oversee it.

126
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,836
Forget about the fact
that my Spanish was for shit.

127
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,632
He was sidelining us and there was
nothing we could do about it.

128
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:32,219
Pablo would even have his
men call in just to fuck with us.

129
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,521
I'm not sure what we expected.

130
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:45,066
To many people, Escobar was a hero.

131
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:49,445
It was like asking Chicago
to rat out Michael Jordan.

132
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:54,075
And those that didn't worship Escobar,
they were simply too scared to call.

133
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:55,868
But we had a system anyways.

134
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:58,954
One tip in a particular location
didn't mean shit.

135
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,445
A second call with the same

136
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:03,442
information still
might not be worth acting on.

137
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:06,462
But three calls on the same
location from three different sources?

138
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,130
Yeah?

139
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:12,551
Now, that had to be checked out.

140
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,359
Hey, I said it was a system.

141
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,861
I didn't say it worked.

142
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,322
Fuck me.

143
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,955
Our inability to catch
Escobar was frustrating.

144
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,417
But back in Bogotá, it
was becoming a real liability.

145
00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:11,757
Get ready to get your balls snipped.

146
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,139
So... your wife left.

147
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:23,644
You're upset, knocked a
few back to numb the pain

148
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:27,356
and then decide to take it out
on some Wall Street scumbag.

149
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:30,525
Yeah, something like that.

150
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,279
Isolated incident?

151
00:30:35,364 --> 00:30:36,657
Yeah.

152
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:43,038
Look, I know I've been in Colombia
for all of about 20 seconds.

153
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,539
Mm.

154
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:50,754
Before that, you and Peña had
complete autonomy to call your own shots.

155
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:54,216
It's gonna take you a minute
to get used to the new order.

156
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,426
You don't trust me yet? That's fine.

157
00:30:57,219 --> 00:31:00,180
But if I'm gonna have your back,
I need to know that I can trust you.

158
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:03,517
Otherwise, I have no problem
sending you back to your wife in Miami.

159
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:06,603
Am I making myself clear?

160
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,480
Loud and clear.

161
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:09,648
Excellent.

162
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:12,734
You're dismissed.

163
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:42,848
I got "La Quica" and "toilet."

164
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:50,731
All right, well, now, that I got.

165
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:54,276
We can't take that to Pinzón.
He'll laugh us out of the office.

166
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,038
Maybe we can get
Centra Spike to do a flyover,

167
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:07,414
see what they come up with.

168
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:09,666
Be a lot better than
the fucking tip line.

169
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,127
I'll be right back.

170
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:18,425
- A toilet?
- It's a long story.

171
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,428
- Give me the CliffsNotes.
- Look, just do me a favor

172
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:24,556
and ask them to sweep over
that specific area.

173
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:28,226
We're looking for any chatter from
Escobar's sicarios. Anything at all.

174
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:31,938
You recognize a voice, you come get me.

175
00:32:32,064 --> 00:32:36,818
Duvall 1-4-4-3-6, we heard
some chatter at 1600 megahertz.

176
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:37,778
Be advised.

177
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:54,086
That is definitely Velasco.
No ID on the girl.

178
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:56,755
What's the deal with the other call?

179
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:03,178
The quality's too poor
for voice recognition.

180
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:11,561
All right... these were
taken about two hours ago.

181
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,148
What's here is fincas, fincas.

182
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:18,652
Everything else is just smaller houses
here, here and here, and the outskirts.

183
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:21,905
You can probably eliminate the smaller
ones, not Escobar's style.

184
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,493
Which of the fincas have
road access both east and west?

185
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:28,912
This one here.

186
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:31,706
It's rough terrain down the back
of the mountain, but it's drivable.

187
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,990
It's gotta be the one.

188
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,502
We'd have a good chance if
we came at him from both sides.

189
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,670
This is good.

190
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:38,505
Great. What about Pinzón?

191
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:41,716
We're gonna need vehicles,
we're gonna need men.

192
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:44,678
Leave Pinzón to me.

193
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:34,436
What did he say?

194
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:36,855
He said no.

195
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,613
Oh, she's not gonna last.
She gives up pretty fuckin' easy.

196
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:48,325
But Messina didn't give up easy.

197
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:49,701
She called Crosby...

198
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,205
Crosby called Gaviria...

199
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:55,373
and in less than 15 minutes...

200
00:34:55,457 --> 00:34:58,418
- I understand.
- ...Pinzón was gettin' a kick in the ass.

201
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,971
I guess everybody works for somebody.

202
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,145
Just because we could make Pinzón dance

203
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:19,272
didn't mean we could call the tune.

204
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:25,028
We would've gone in stealth.
Surround the fucker, then grab him.

205
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:29,115
Pinzón didn't do shit that way.
He liked kicking down the front door,

206
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,909
waking up the whole damn neighborhood.

207
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,297
Don't forget that Pablo made a career

208
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:51,007
of staying ahead of the cops.

209
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:56,054
A lot of the fincas he used had tunnels
built just for this purpose.

210
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:58,014
Even though he didn't like using them.

211
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:02,894
I guess you could say that
he was paranoid, but then again,

212
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:08,191
if people are actually after you,
that's not paranoid. That's just smart.

213
00:38:08,274 --> 00:38:11,236
Peña! Messina!

214
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,093
He was here.

215
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:23,743
You know, in all the
years I chased Escobar,

216
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:26,955
I could count on one hand
the times we almost had him.

217
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:29,249
And each time, we forgot
the two most important things

218
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,125
we already knew about him:

219
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,002
Close doesn't count.

220
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:37,131
And Pablo is never more dangerous
than when you almost have him.

221
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:08,538
With all the cops on the street,
it was easy to forget...

222
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:12,584
this was still Escobar's town.

223
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:20,216
He tolerated it all in
the interest of negotiations.

224
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,262
Chasing a man and his family
out of their home

225
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,097
in the middle of the night?

226
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,224
That wasn't a negotiation.

227
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:29,267
To Escobar...

228
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:32,228
well, that was an act of war.

229
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:20,289
Peña!
