But what they'd never tell you is
that these businesses were a front

and that the Rodriguez brothers

49
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,850
were the second biggest cocaine

The leaders of the Cali cartel.

Like Pablo and the Medellín cartel,

52
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,000
they started out as
run-of-the-mill criminals: Bank robbers.

53
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,630
And with all that money they
scored from their heists,

they quickly graduated
to smuggling weed.

And when they realized
that ten pounds of blow

56
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,260
was worth as much as a ton of marijuana,

57
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,270
they jumped headfirst into
the cocaine business.

58
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,230

of shit street dealers.

profit, minimizing risk.

60
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,070
As the business grew, a
young ambitious Colombian kid,

61
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,570
a guy you might know named Pacho
Herrera, was such a good earner

62
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,390
that the brothers
eventually promoted him to partner.

63
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,120
But they had a competitor,
and not just any competitor.

Miami, the cocaine capital of the world,

would remain Pablo’s territory, and
in return, the Rodriguez brothers

it turns out the folks in new york

73

were just as head over heels for
cocaine as the folks down south.

there were seven

As much as the Cali guys loved
money and the finer things in life,

they hated the wrong kind of attention.

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,770
I'd like to talk to you about
what happened tonight.

160
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,290
- What do you think happened?
- I know I got left behind on purpose.

161
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,800
For your own best interest.

162
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,760
You don't know a goddamn
thing about my best interest.

163
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,180
You know, Murphy, what happens out
there isn't really for everyone.

164
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,050
- But it is for Peña?
- You're not Peña.

165
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,220
- 'Cause I'm a damn gringo.
- Because I trust him.

00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,870
Why don't you try me?

167
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,560
This fight against
Escobar, you want to win it.

168
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,960
These guys aren't fighting by
the same rules, so why should we?

169
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,680
- You know what that means?
- Oh, I do.

170

So whether this is about protecting
me or protecting you, stop icing me out.

This is Moncada's biggest lab.

177
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,140
It'll have to be inventoried before
it's dismantled and moved.

178

How you know that?

179
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,770
- One of my ci's.
- Hell of a tip.

180

It's a hell of a Ci.

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,490
Look, you want Escobar's
men, there they are.

Your Ci hooked us a pretty big fish.

Yeah, he's a winner.

Wonder if he'll give us Escobar.

- Don't know, we'll see what Carrillo gets.
- Yeah. We'll see.

194
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,310
Carrillo told me that he talked
to you. He thinks he can trust you.

Yeah, he can.
