like he already knew the answer,

294

- Because you're not like that.

301
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,516
- You don't talk that way.
- Yeah, was I just putting on a show?

302
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,977
For a client?

303
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,690
Stooping to his level
to get something I needed,

304
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:06,195
or was that who I really was,
underneath it all?

305
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,369
Don't ask a question you don't
wanna know the answer to, I guess.

306
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,828
I guess.

307
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,793
A life support system for a
stupid fucking cunt is more like it.

308
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,586
How many hours you been
chained to that bed?

309
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,881
You never heard me breathe, not once.
And you know the sound.

310
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,926
You've heard it every night
for the last 11 years.

311
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,512
That tiny rumbling snore I make
in the back of my throat

312
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,848
that sometimes. I make when I'm lost
in thought. I forget myself. I zone out.

313
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,810
That tiny little "Gerald only"
fucking purr.

314
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:43,232
Hours of not hearing that sound,
total fucking silence, and you knew it.

315
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,485
Five minutes after my head hit the floor,
you saw blood. You heard the silence,

316
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,072
and you knew it, but you just laid there,
wasting precious minutes and hours

317
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,659
and breath and life, calling my fucking
name, talking to a corpse on the floor.

318
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,743
What's happening?

319
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,746
Well, I'm pretty sure
you just lost your mind.

320
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,999
Seeing a dog eating your husband
will do that.

321
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,377
If you're gonna have a mental breakdown,
that's a great excuse.

322
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,336
Right.

323
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,923
The blood stopped spreading.

324
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,259
A while ago.

325
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,638
And you did what you always do
when it gets too much, you ran.

326
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,223
In here.

327
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,061
You just laid here,
calling my name again and again,

328
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,981
and let critical time tick by

329
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,233
- like a stupid fucking...
- Stop it.

330
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,026
You should have been thinking
about life support.

331
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,112
Maybe that's why you're
remembering that joke now.

332
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,572
Gotta be for some
reason, after all.

333
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,658
And why is that?

334
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,369
- Time.
- That's right!

335
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,665
You're a life support system.
You've been unplugged.

336
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,126
There's still juice in there,
but the charge is running down.

337
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,421
And if you don't get out of the cuffs,
it will go all the way to zero.

338
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,176
When did we get here?

339
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,767
One-ish, I think.

340
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,435
And how long till
we got into bed?

341
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,564
- An hour, maybe more.
- Call that two o'clock, then.

342
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,065
And I dropped dead...

343
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,151
Ten minutes, maybe, after.

344
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,111
When's the sun been setting?

345
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,740
- 7:15 or so.
- Oh, that's pretty close.

346
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:20,913
That's another 15, 20, tops.
So, let's say... five hours, so far.

347
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,207
Five hours you've wasted,

348
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,751
screaming for neighbors
that are half a mile away.

349

350

And, you know,
if you really think about it...

351
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,966
- Nate and Kelly said they wouldn't...
- They wouldn't be heading up until June.

352
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,843
The maids came to
prep for us yesterday.

353
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,970
Because the bed is made
and the house is dusted.

354
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,056
Which means they're done and gone,
and the grass...

355
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,267
- ...was cut, fresh.
- Which means no gardeners.

356
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,439
Because I arranged it all to get
the place ready for us today.

357
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,444
And I wouldn't want them
interrupting my little game,

358
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,489
so I probably gave them
at least the weekend off.

359
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,325
- So, who could possibly...
- ...possibly hear you scream?

to more than that.

- I can't get out.
- What about the stories on the news,

where mothers lift their cars
to save their children?

383

She's no mother.

What's that supposed to mean?

385

No maternal instinct.

- Your career always came first.
- That's what you said.

Maybe you even
started to believe it.

388
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,229
I'm not so sure you can
hide things from me now.

You're wasting
precious time here.

00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,106
I can't get out.

391
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,276
- You have to.
- I am chained to the goddamn bed!

392
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,029
Don't recite facts to me.
Wake up.

393
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,948
Says the voice in your head.

394
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,117
This is you... all over.

395
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,828
Problem, panic, denial.

396
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,998
Hoping if you look away,
it'll magically vanish.

397
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,878
If you don't wake up,
you're gonna die in those handcuffs.

398
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,674
And we both know you've been sleepwalking
since you were 12 years old.

- Not now.
- If not now, when?

400
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,802
Not now, what?

401
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,974
He put you in those handcuffs
way before Gerald did.

402
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,646
Who's "he"?

403
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,429
If I can get to the phone...

404
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,732
Phone's gonna die anyway.
I never charged it.

405
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,026
Or did a load of laundry,
for that matter.

406
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,204
Tough luck.

407
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,875
Okay, scrap that.
Phone might as well be on Mars.

408
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,294
If you can't get off the bed...

409

live long enough

Life support.

How long do you think
someone lives without water?

Three days?

At best.

Five...

six, seven hours.

For what, six months?

428
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,924
I found the prescription.

You found it and
never said anything.

430
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,434

and I just stopped covering it up.

- There was that one time.

That one time.

433
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:30,407
Late one night, you tried without a pill,
and it just wasn't working.

434
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,492
- I was as soft as a kitten.
- Until...

435
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,662
- Until...
- Until you held my wrists above my head.

436
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,791
- I hadn't done that before.
- No, you had.

437
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,463
- This time, though...
- I grabbed your throat.

438
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,759
- Softly, then I squeezed, didn't I?
- Mm-hmm.

439

And, God, was I hard.

440
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,725
I was harder than
you'd felt in years.

441
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,478
And you just laid there...

442
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,522
and I went to town...

443
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,443

But, for the first time, first time

looking up at her.

She was standing there
in her red dress...

739

looking right at me.

740

741
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,006

could go down there, too.

Just... throw 'em in the well,
down in the dark.

I remember thinking
maybe she was supposed to be me.

747

Because she would never tell.
I knew that, looking at her.

You can tell yourself that
if you need to.

757
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,568
He was a trick of the mind.

758
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,404
Just like you, Gerald.
Just like both of you.

759
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,698
Then why won't you look over
there for more than a second?

760
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,033
What are you afraid
you're gonna see?

761
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,411
- Why are you still listening to him?
- Shh!

762
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,800
- It's probably from the dog.
- It's bigger than that.

763
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,262
Look at it again.

764
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,687
<b><font color="#FF8000">GERALD:</font></b> I think it's a footprint.

765
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,856
- And if it is...
- Shut up!

766
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,858
...it was Death you saw.

767
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,612
He'll be back tonight, Jessie.

768
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,658
And when you're dead, he'll have
your wedding ring in his case...

769
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,912
with the rest of his pretty things.

770
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,292
His souvenirs.

771
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,088
- I am gonna close my eyes.
- No.

772
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,340
- And count to ten.
- Stay awake.

773
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,841
And when I open them...

774
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,095
you will both be gone.

775
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:05,268
- Ten, nine, eight...
- <b><font color="#FF8000">JESSIE 2:</font></b> Do you hear me?

776
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,354
- Stay awake.
- I'm awake.

777
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:12,818
Seven, six, five...

778
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,364
four, three...

779
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,616
two...

780
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,577
one.

781
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,344
<b><font color="#FF8000">FATHER:</font></b> You all right, Mouse?

782
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,228
I'm so sorry.

783
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,890
I'm sorry you were there
when I...

784
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,477
It's not like I touched you, Jessie.

785
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,230
But still...

786
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,196
Maybe we should tell Mom.

787
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,408
I think we have to, don't you?

788
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,205
I hate to...

789
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,168
just because things have been pretty
tense between the two of you lately.

790
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,963
Hell, they've been tense
between us, too...

791
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,007
with the baby and all.

792
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,509
But this...

793
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,181
well, this could make
things a lot worse.

794
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,354
She won't think it's your fault.

795
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,731
I'm sure.

796
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,068
Fairly sure.
I mean, she might.

797
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,155
We all know...
it wasn't your fault.

798
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,119
Maybe we shouldn't tell her.

799
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,458
I have to.

800
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,211
We have to.

801
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,255
Why?

802
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,632
Because...

803
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:45,595
- Because you can't keep it a secret.
- Because you can't keep it a secret.

804
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,270
I mean, if it's ever
going to come out,

805
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:57,482
then it's better for both of us
that it happen now.

806
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:02,904
Not in a week or a year or...
even ten years from now.

807
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,120
Please...

808
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,872
I won't tell.

809
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:16,960
I mean...

810
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,423
if we don't tell your mom today...

811
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,801
then we could never tell anyone.

812
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,928
I wouldn't. Never.

813
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,013
Not ever.

814
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,432
- Ever.
- And not just your mother.

815
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:32,976
Not anyone.

816
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:38,565
That's a big responsibility
for a little girl.

817
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:40,692
I'm sorry.

818
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,527
A young woman.

819
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,156
But you might be tempted.

820
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,366
With friends...

821
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:54,080
One of them tells you a secret,
maybe you might wanna tell them.

822
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,001
- Never.
- Or your brother.

823
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,586
Or your sister.

824
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,673
There might come a time
when you wanna tell...

825
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:04,758
No.

826
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,970
No. I promise. I swear.

827
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,140
I don't know, Jess.

828
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:19,064
I think it might be better for both of us
if this were all out in the open now.

829
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,358
Take our medicine.

830
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,944
I mean, she can't kill us.

831
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,281
Please...

832
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:33,286
Please, please, please.
Please just don't tell her.

833
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,792
I won't tell anybody... ever.

834
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,587
Ever. Please.

835
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:50,970
I've never been able to refuse you
anything that you really wanted, have I?

836
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,183
Okay, Jess.

837
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,061
We'll try things your way.

838
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,146
Thank you, Daddy.

839
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,901
So I guess we have a deal.

840
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,113
I say nothing.

841
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,701
You say nothing, not to anyone else,
not even to each other.

842
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,663
We walk out of this room...

843
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,916
and it never happened.

844
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:22,961
Okay.

845
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,342
I did a shameful thing.

846
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,013
You looked away...
when you said that.

847
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:40,478
You were able to
face me with the lies.

848
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,900
But it was the truth that
finally made you turn away.

849
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,570
<b><font color="#FF8000">FATHER:</font></b> <i>I don't know
what came over me.</i>

850
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,322
Maybe it was the eclipse.

851
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,705
Well, thank God we'll
never see another one.

852
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,210
Nothing happened.

853
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,381
Nothing ever happened.

854
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:18,141
Come on, let's get grilling.
They should be back in a bit.

855
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,703
<b><font color="#00FFFF">(licking sounds)</font></b>

856
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,957
<b><font color="#00FFFF">(yells and gasps)</font></b>

857
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,085
<b><font color="#00FFFF">(growls)</font></b>
<b><font color="#00FFFF">(bone crunches)</font></b>

858
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,675
<b><font color="#00FFFF">(flesh tearing)</font></b>

859
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,705
He'll try that again.

860
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,543
It's fresher meat.

861
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,880
You're still strong enough to kick,
but you won't be for long,

862
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,173
and he can smell that.

863
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,429
Afternoon already.

864
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,809
Sun's starting down.

865
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,521
And no one came this morning.

866
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,567
Or if they did, you were asleep.

867
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:58,491
Eventually, someone will find you, Jess,
but it might take a long time.

868
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:04,163
The first assumption will be we're off
on some wild romantic fling.

869
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,248
I mean, why not?

870
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,543
Only you and I know, at the end,

871
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,379
I could only get it up
if you were handcuffed to the bed.

872
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,426
To the rest of the world,
we're the picture of marital function.

873
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,722
Sooner or later,
people will start looking, my people.

874
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,852
There are a couple of women
in New Orleans you call friends, but...

875
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,106
You've never really let them
inside your life, have you?

876
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,529
None of them are gonna worry much
if you drop out of sight for a week or...

877
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,531
ten days.

878
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,620
But I have appointments.

879
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,416
And when I don't show up by Friday,
there'll be questions.

880
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:53,546
That's how it'll start.

881
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:02,430
I think the caretaker will
actually discover the bodies.

882
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,893
He'll call the cops when he spots you
through the window or...

883
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,729
when he smells us.

884
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,402
He'll turn his face away while he throws
the blanket from the closet over you

885
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,489
because he won't wanna see your fingers
sticking through the handcuffs.

886
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,327
Stiff as pencils,
white as candles.

887
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,455
But, most of all...

888
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,501
he won't wanna look at the expression
of horror on your face.

889
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,461
Why are you doing this?

890
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,882
The forensics unit will show up
with the county coroner.

891
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,719
When they pull off the blanket,
they will...

892
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:48,518
wince and nod and tell each other
the woman on the bed died hard.

893
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,062
But they won't know
the half of it.

894
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,524
They won't know...

895
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,487
the real reason
your eyes are staring...

896
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,074
and your mouth is screaming...

897
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,538
is because of what
you saw at the end...

898
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,040
coming out of the dark.

899
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:18,005
They'll take you to the medical examiner.
He'll cut you open, inventory your guts.

900
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,592
He'll have a peek
at what's left of your last meal,

901
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:24,595
take a little section of brain
to look at under his microscope.

902
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:25,888
But in the end...

903
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:34,522
in the end, he'll just call it
"death by misadventure."

904
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,361
- They were playing a harmless game.
- Harmless.

905
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,574
Only the gentleman had a heart attack
at a critical moment...

906
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,661
and the woman was left to...

907
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,874
Well, it's best not to get into it.

908
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,462
Just to say the lady died hard.

909
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,674
You only need to
look at her to see that.

910
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,640
And maybe someone will notice
your wedding ring is gone...

911
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,189
but they won't hunt for it
for long, if at all.

912
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:22,862
They won't notice that one
of your bones...

913
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:28,284
not an important one, the third phalange
in your right foot, let's say...

914
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:32,288
is also gone.

915
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,460
But we'll know, won't we, Jess?

916
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,381
We'll know he took them.

917
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,136
Because it was Death.

918
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,807
And you did see him...

919
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,645
as people who die
in the lonely places do.

920
01:11:58,523 --> 01:11:59,607
It was Death.

921
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,655
And tonight, when the sun goes down,
he'll be back for you.

I don't want you to be sorry.

936

Then what do you want?

937
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,156
I want you to remember.

938
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,202
You think I don't remember?

939
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,287
I remember every moment.

940
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:23,334
I remember every shame-filled glance
he threw my way, and I remember Mom...

941
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,088
- looking but not seeing...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

942
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,172
Because seeing?

943
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,425
It would have meant
my little sister was also doomed

944
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:34,178
to let that son of a bitch
steal her childhood,

945
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,639
and Mom would have died
before facing that.

946
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,558
So it was up to me
to protect Maddie.

947
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,813
Even though it meant that I never
felt like part of the family again.

948
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:51,529
And that wasn't my job description.
Was it? My job was to be a kid.

949
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,406
Suddenly, that wasn't an option.

950
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,909
You've had everything you need
to survive from the beginning.

951
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,996
You just have to remember.

952
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,749
Not the sun, not the eclipse.

953
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,544
After.

Right, Mouse? We had fun.

960

Did you have a nice time
with your dad, Jess?

961

Jesus! Jess, are you okay?

01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,489
I'm... I'm...

963
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,159
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

964
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,327
Just come on,
let's get this cleaned up.

965
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,387
Oh, it's not so bad.

966
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:00,848
I think you'll live.

967
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,935
- Does it hurt?
- It's okay.

968
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,480
Just...

969
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,774
Just be careful.

970
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:12,902
The last thing I want...

971
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,322
is to have to take you
to the emergency room

972
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,282
and have your fingers sewn back on.

973
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,590
It's gonna fucking hurt.

974
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,677
- But the thing about blood...
- But the thing about blood...

975
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,555
...is that, until it clots,
it's as slick as oil.

976
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,849
That will not work.

977
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,227
Maybe not.

978
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,107
But the wrists have fewer nerves
than the body's other checkpoints.

979
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,777
That's why slitting wrists
is always the best way to...

980
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,362
How do you know
so much about that?

981
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,533
Go too deep,
you'll bleed to death.

982
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,537
Do nothing, I'll die of seizures,
dehydration or dog.

983
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,873
Or when my visitor with the
bag of bones shows up tonight.

984
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,918
The sun is starting down.
He'll be here soon.

985
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,419

Barely working, aren't they?

987
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,141
- I won't need much.
- Your legs won't be reliable.

988
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,351
It's been a day and a half
since you walked on them.

989

If my hands pull this off,
my legs better do their fucking part.

Okay.

keeping me from sleep...</i>

1066
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:41,603
<i>it was the question.</i>

1067
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,147
<i>That in all the reports,</i>

1068
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,191
<i>all the cops that combed
through that house,</i>

1070
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,115
<i>What got me through
those nights was you.</i>

1071
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:56,451
<i>Thinking of you.</i>

1072
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,996
<i>And why you came
to me that day.</i>

1073
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:04,709
<i>You, in your sunless world,
always on that swing.</i>

1074
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,796
<i>What you needed me
to understand...</i>

1075
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,761
<i>that his shackles were silence,</i>

1076
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:19,057
<i>and his were comfort.</i>

1077
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:25,689
<i>My days were better.</i>

1078
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,482
<i>I took the insurance money,</i>

1079
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:31,820
<i>and I started a foundation
for girls and boys like us.</i>

1080
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:37,784
<i>I spent so long never telling that story,
so... I made sure that I did.</i>

1081
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:42,831
<i>I tell that story every day
to every kid it could possibly help.</i>

1082
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:48,586
When I was 12, I went to
the lake house with my family.

1083
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,424
<i>And while that helped my days,
I still sat up at night...</i>

1084
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:57,220
<i>waiting for that pale face
in the moonlight...</i>

1085
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,974
<i>to claim his runaway bride.</i>

1086
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:10,191
<i>Six months after the handcuffs,
six months of being a widow...</i>

1087
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:13,194
<i>six months of living death.</i>

1088
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:18,700
<i>And then Raymond Andrew
Joubert's picture</i>

1089
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,535
<i>first appeared in the paper.</i>

1090
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,708
<i>Two years ago,
reports of graveyard vandalism</i>

1091
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,918
<i>in the backwoods of Alabama
hit the papers,</i>

1092
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,464
<i>but I never read about them,
not in New Orleans.</i>

1093
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,550
<i>And they were tiny stories, buried.</i>

1094
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,636
<i>Someone was breaking
into crypts and mausoleums</i>

1095
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:43,391
<i>of small town cemeteries
with drills, bolt cutters and hacksaws...</i>

1096
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,894
<i>and stripping corpses of jewelry.</i>

1097
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,605
<i>As the months went by, it escalated.</i>

1098
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,316
<i>Incidents started being reported
in Louisiana.</i>

1099
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:55,278
<i>He gouged out eyes, cut corpses' throats.</i>

1100
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:58,948
<i>Last February,
two were found without noses.</i>

1101
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,869
<i>Later hands. Then... ears.</i>

1102
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,539
<i>Something I'd always assumed was the dog.</i>

1103
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:11,711
<i>And when it came to removing genitalia
after having sex with the dead...</i>

1104
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,506
<i>he stuck strictly
to the gentlemen.</i>

1105
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,300
<i>This was, clearly,
extremely lucky for me.</i>

1106
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:21,930
<i>I only noticed when he finally
made the front page.</i>

1107
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,974
<i>He'd graduated,
it seemed, from the dead.</i>

1108
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:29,187
<i>And, one night, a man woke up
to find Raymond Joubert in his room,</i>

1109
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,648
<i>naked, trying to cut off his ear.</i>

1110
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,109
<i>Joubert suffers from acromegaly,</i>

1111
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,446
<i>a progressive enlargement
of the hands, feet and face</i>

1112
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,324
<i>that happens when the pituitary gland
goes into warp drive.</i>

1113
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,827
<i>It causes the forehead to bulge</i>

1114
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:47,539
<i>and abnormally long arms
that dangle almost to his knees.</i>

1115
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:52,418
<i>They went to his only known address,
a farmhouse on Kingston Road.</i>

1116
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,337
<i>They didn't find him there,</i>

1117
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,714
<i>but they did find his sister
and her husband,</i>

1118
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,634
<i>who he called his
"mommy and daddy."</i>

1119
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,097
<i>He'd scalped them both
and eaten most of "Daddy."</i>

1120
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,936
<i>They found 50 bell jars
containing ears, lips, fingers.</i>

1121
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:14,524
<i>They think he may have killed as many
as a dozen people in the last five years.</i>

1122
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,651
<i>But, for some reason,
he spared me.</i>

1123
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:21,447
<i>This monster was real,
real as they come.</i>

1124
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:25,118
<i>As real as the cuffs,
as the dog.</i>

1125
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,037
<i>As real as the eclipse.</i>

1126
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,333
<i>And so I had to write this
to you, Mouse...</i>

1127
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,753
<i>because you're the only person

<i>and you're the only one
