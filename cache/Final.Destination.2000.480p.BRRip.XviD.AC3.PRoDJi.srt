1
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,000
Alex.

2
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,800
Tod and George's dad
just called.

3
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,600
He's picking you up
at 3.30 tomorrow.

4
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,100
The bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.00.

5
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,300
How's my suitcase
working out for you?

6
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,200
Mom, you got
to leave that on.

7
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,500
The tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing...

8
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,700
so I figure it's got to be
on or with the bag.

9
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,800
For luck.

10
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

11
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm still here.

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,600
So, seventeen, on the loose...

13
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,900
senior trip
with your friends in Paris...

14
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,500
ten days in the springtime.

15
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,500
Live it up. You got
your whole life ahead of you.

16
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Hitchcock, let me give you
a hand with this.

17
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,900
There you go.

18
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
Carter, you dick.

19
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,700
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

20
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,300
- You left this on the bus.
- Thanks.

21
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Come on,
let's get your stuff together.

22
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,700
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

23
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,500
- What are you doing?
- He's the man.

24
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,200
All right.
You guys got everything?

25
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,500
Yeah, Dad, we're all set.

26
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
Does that mean go?

27
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,300
Don't know.

28
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,500
This is for both of you.
Have a great time.

29
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Thanks, Dad.

30
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

31
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,300
- Alex, take care of them.
- I will.

32
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,800
Didn't think anything could look
worse than my yearbook photo.

33
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,700
How do you think I feel
having to look at you?

34
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,100
What the fuck does he want?

35
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
The airport does not
endorse solicitors.

36
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,800
Death is not the end.

37
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,600
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

38
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,500
Hare Rama.

39
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,800
I have to ask you
a few questions this evening.

40
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,500
Did you pack your bags yourself?

41
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,100
Have your belongings been in
your possession the entire time?

42
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Mr. Browning?

43
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,200
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

44
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,300
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

45
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,200
September 25. 9.25.

46
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

47
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Fuck off, dude. Dick.

48
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,600
Babe.

49
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,200
George, Dad said both of us.
Give me some cash.

50
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
Knock it off.

51
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
You asshole.

52
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,000
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,400
Let's go take a shit.

54
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,100
- Take a shit by yourself.
- No, dude.

55
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,300
Listen, OK?
Take some knowledge.

56
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,100
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

57
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
The toilets in coach
are barely ventilated closets.

58
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
Say halfway
through the flight...

59
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
your body wants
that airplane food out.

60
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,100
You got to go
torque a wicked cable.

61
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,700
Then directly after you,
walks in Christa or Blake.

62
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,100
Want them to associate you with
that watery sting in their eye?

63
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,900
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

64
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,000
He was born

65
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,700
In the summer

66
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
Of his 27th year

67
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Comin' home

68
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,800
John Denver.

69
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
He left yesterday behind him

70
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Died in a plane crash.

71
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

72
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,800
At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding...

73
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,800
of Volee Air flight 180
to Paris through gate 46.

74
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I've seen it raining fire

75
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
In the sky

76
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How did we lose him?

77
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,000
Go. Go.

78
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,700
Go.

79
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
That hurt.

80
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,900
That's a good sign.
Younger, the better.

81
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,800
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

82
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,600
A really fucked-up God.

83
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
- Hey, Tod.
- Hello. How you doing?

84
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,700
Can you switch seats
with Christa?

85
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,300
God, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

86
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,400
It's a urinary tract infection.

87
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
Let's go ask Alex.

88
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Could you trade seats so Blake
and I could sit together?

89
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

90
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,200
Please?

91
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,200
You're so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.

92
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Thank you, Alex.

93
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
You're welcome.

94
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
You really think we'd
titty-fuck them over Greenland?

95
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,200
Because of you, I got to watch
fucking "Stuart Little."

96
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,700
Thank you.

97
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
Thanks, man. That's great.

98
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,900
Sorry I'm late.

99
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
That's my seat right there.

100
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,600
Thanks.

101
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
- Hello?
- Ain't going that way.

102
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,300
May I have your attention?

103
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
To properly fasten
your seat belts...

104
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,700
slide the flat portion
into the buckle.

105
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,100
There are six emergency exits.

106
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,100
Two doors in front,
two over the wings...

107
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
two at the rear
of the aircraft.

108
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,800
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

109
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,800
All right.

110
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,300
Whatever.

111
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
It's fine.

112
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,200
It's OK, honey.

113
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,500
Could you trade seats so
Blake and I could sit together?

114
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,600
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

115
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,100
Please?

116
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
What's up, dude?

117
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,300
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your fucking problem?

118
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,400
This fucking plane's
going to explode!

119
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
- Shut up, Browning.
- You're so not funny.

120
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,400
- If this is a joke...
- It's not a joke!

121
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,000
Alex, take it easy.

122
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,000
- Sit down!
- It's going down!

123
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
We'll remove you
if this continues.

124
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,100
I'll fucking remove myself!

125
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,000
- That's my seat.
- This plane is going down!

126
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,100
Everybody in the aisle
off the plane.

127
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,900
Just stay where you are.
Sit tight.

128
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,600
This fucking plane
is going down!

129
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,300
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

130
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,400
- Get the fuck off me!
- Let go, jerk.

131
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,500
You got this?
No one gets back on board.

132
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,200
- That's my call.
- Wait, please!

133
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,900
I've got forty students
going to Paris. Please.

134
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
You must understand
my position.

135
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
I do, and I apologize
for Alex...

136
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,400
but one of us
needs to be on that plane.

137
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,600
I cannot let those students
go to Paris for ten days...

138
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,300
Sit the fuck down, Carter!
Sit!

139
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,200
One of you
can go on the flight.

140
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Larry.

141
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
They're not taking this well.
One of us can get back on.

142
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,000
The rest can take
an 11.10 flight.

143
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,200
I'll stay.

144
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,500
You know the French thing.
Get on the plane.

145
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,300
It's fine.

146
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,300
Hi, I was in the bathroom,
and the lock was stuck...

147
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,200
Wait, I didn't fight
with anyone!

148
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,400
Damn!

149
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,000
Thanks.

150
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,500
I called your parents.
They're on their way.

151
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,600
Stupid Alex.

152
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,700
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

153
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,700
I saw it.

154
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,400
I don't know. I saw it.

155
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,500
I saw it on the runway,
I saw it take off...

156
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,100
I saw out my window,
I saw the ground.

157
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,000
And the cabin,
it starts to shake.

158
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,500
The left side blows up
and the whole plane explodes.

159
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,800
And it was so real,
like how everything happens.

160
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,700
Been on a lot of planes
that blew up?

161
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
You fell asleep.

162
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,000
We get thrown off the plane
and blow a half day in Paris?

163
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,900
All because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

164
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,600
Wait! The plane,
it's going to blow up!

165
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
Fuck you, Horton.

166
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,200
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital!

167
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,200
Get off him!
Alex, stop it!

168
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,800
There they go, here we stay.

169
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,300
You're paying for my trip.

170
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,800
I wish you were on that plane!

171
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,700
- You fucking prick!
- Shit!

172
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,100
- Call it in!
- Security!

173
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,800
You're looking at me
as if I caused this.

174
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,800
I didn't cause this.

175
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
Are there any survivors?

176
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
How should I know?

177
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
- You think I'm some...
- He's not a witch.

178
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,300
I'm Howard Seigel...

179
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
National Transportation
and Safety Board.

180
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,100
We've contacted
all your families.

181
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,300
They are on the way.

182
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,000
Is there anyone here
who feels they might need...

183
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,700
medical attention
or spiritual counseling?

184
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,200
What's going on?
Are there any survivors?

185
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,500
The cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

186
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,900
The Nassau County
authorities are on the scene...

187
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,900
naval search and rescue
en route.

188
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,900
Excuse me. I'm Agent Weine.

189
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,900
This is Agent Schreck.
We're with the FBI.

190
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,300
I understand how
you all must be feeling...

191
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
and I know it's going
to be difficult...

192
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,500
but we need to ask questions
regarding today's events...

193
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,600
while they're still fresh
in your mind.

194
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,600
This will prove invaluable
to our rescue attempts...

195
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,600
and any potential
criminal investigation.

196
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,200
You said, "Listen to me.

197
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,800
"This plane will explode
on takeoff."

198
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,400
How did you know that?

199
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,300
I got this feeling.

200
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,200
This weird feeling.

201
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,600
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding?

202
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
On board, did you take
any sleeping pills...

203
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,900
narcotics, hallucinogens?

204
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,400
Do you take any drugs?

205
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,700
I saw it.

206
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
I saw it happen.

207
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,200
I saw the plane explode.

208
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,000
Did the weird feelings
have anything to do...

209
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,700
with your saying you wished
Carter Horton was on it...

210
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,600
just before it exploded?

211
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,300
Then why'd you say it?

212
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,100
I didn't really think
it was going to happen.

213
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,600
If that's the case, Alex...

214
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,100
why did you really
get off the plane?

215
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,800
My brother George...

216
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,300
he told me to go
keep an eye on Alex.

217
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,900
And so he stayed and...

218
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,300
He told me
to get off the plane.

219
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,100
Larry Murnau said
I should get back on...

220
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,400
but I told him
that he should go.

221
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,400
I sent him back on the plane.

222
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,200
All right.

223
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Nobody forced you off the plane.

224
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,500
You said you weren't friends
with those that were...

225
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
so, Clear, why did you
get off the plane?

226
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,600
Because I saw
and I heard Alex...

227
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,700
and I believed him.

228
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,400
There he is.

229
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,600
Thank you for the ride.

230
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,400
You are looking
at the first piece of debris...

231
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,400
to wash ashore
from Volee Air flight 180...

232
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,500
which erupted shortly after
a 9.25 p.m. Takeoff...

233
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,000
from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.

234
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,100
There are no known survivors.

235
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
Coast Guard and naval
search and rescue efforts...

236
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,600
are continuing
at this moment...

237
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,600
even as jet fuel burns
on the ocean's surface.

238
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,200
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

239
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,200
of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

240
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,000
All 287 passengers
are feared dead.

241
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,400
Amongst the travelers...

242
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,000
a class of forty students
and four teachers...

243
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
from Mount Abraham High School
in south-east New York...

244
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
en route to Paris
on a field trip.

245
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
There are reports
several students...

246
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,300
were removed from the aircraft
moments before departure...

247
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,300
however, investigators
remain guarded...

248
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,200
about the specifics
of this incident.

249
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Authorities from National
Transportation and Safety...

250
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,200
and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation...

251
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,400
have arrived at JFK to begin
the initial investigation.

252
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...

253
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,900
report seeing the plane explode.

254
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
No other aircraft were
visibly near flight 180.

255
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,100
At JFK,
air traffic controllers...

256
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
are corroborating
these eyewitness accounts.

257
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,900
After the explosion,
debris apparently rained...

258
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,700
into the Atlantic Ocean
for several miles.

259
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,700
Investigators are cautious about
verifying these accounts...

260
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
believing they'll learn more...

261
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,600
Thirty-nine days
have passed...

262
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,100
since we lost
our thirty-nine loved ones...

263
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,100
friends, and teachers.

264
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,400
As each day passes...

265
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,400
without a determining cause
for the accident...

266
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
we ask ourselves, "Why?"

267
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...

268
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,300
"Man no more knows
his own time...

269
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,300
"than fish taken
in the fatal net...

270
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
"or birds trapped in the snare.

271
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,200
"Like these,
the children of men caught...

272
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
"when the time falls
suddenly upon them."

273
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,100
And so,
before we can heal...

274
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,300
before we escape the presence
of death and time...

275
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,400
we must mourn
and celebrate theirs...

276
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,700
with this memorial.

277
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
I hope you don't think because
my name ain't on this wall...

278
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
that I owe you anything.

279
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
I don't.

280
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,600
All I owe these people is
to live my life to the fullest.

281
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,800
Why don't you
stay off the J.D., then?

282
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,500
Don't you ever fucking
tell me what to do.

283
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,700
I control my life, not you.

284
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,300
I'm never going to die.

285
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,200
I took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

286
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,500
Got a seventy.

287
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,400
It's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

288
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,600
The thing is,
when I was done with the test...

289
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,200
you know the guy that drives
with you during the test?

290
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,500
Anyways, he goes...

291
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,500
"Young man, you're going to die
at a very young age."

292
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,800
Is that true?

293
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,100
Not now, not here,
not ever, Billy.

294
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,900
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

295
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Fuck.

296
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,800
Don't talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.

297
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,800
I'm going up.

298
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,900
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

299
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,600
I miss you, you know?

300
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,900
Yeah, I miss you, too.

301
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,300
But my father,
he doesn't understand.

302
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,900
Look, when he gets over
this thing...

303
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,100
you and me,
we'll road trip to the city...

304
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
catch the Yanks.

305
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,300
We'll do that.

306
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,800
Cool.

307
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,600
I better go.

308
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,500
This thing Ms Lewton
showed me in class...

309
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,800
they're going to let me read it.

310
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,200
It says what I'm feeling.

311
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
Take care, man.

312
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,100
Because of you,
I'm still alive.

313
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,000
Thank you.

314
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,600
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast.

315
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,900
But when we say this...

316
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,900
we imagine
that the hour is placed...

317
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,400
in an obscure
and distant future.

318
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,300
It never occurs to us
that it has any connection...

319
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,200
with the day already begun...

320
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,200
or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

321
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,800
This afternoon
which is so certain...

322
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,500
and which has every hour
filled in advance.

323
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,700
What happened?

324
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,900
Where's Tod?

325
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,300
Get out of here.

326
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

327
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,700
You caused Tod
so much guilt over George...

328
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,900
he took his own life.

329
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,800
He wouldn't do that.

330
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,400
He said we'd be friends again
after you got better.

331
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Why would he make plans
if he was going to kill himself?

332
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Mr. Waggner.

333
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,600
Almost autumn.

334
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,700
It's only the end of June.

335
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,500
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

336
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,800
If you focus, even now,
just one week into summer...

337
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,200
you can almost feel
autumn coming.

338
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,400
I like being able
to see the future.

339
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,200
Why were you at
Tod's house last night?

340
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,700
I've seen enough TV to know...

341
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,000
the FBI doesn't investigate
teen suicides.

342
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,400
They were there last night.
That means, one...

343
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,100
they still don't have a clue
what caused the crash.

344
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,600
Two... they haven't
ruled out anything...

345
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,500
and the fact seven people
got off the plane...

346
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
is probably weird enough.

347
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,100
Not to mention, one of
those people had a vision...

348
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,300
of the plane exploding...

349
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,400
minutes before it actually did
is highly suspicious.

350
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,400
And it doesn't help that
the visionary's friend...

351
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,300
just committed suicide.

352
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,800
Why were you there last night?

353
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,300
You know what this is?

354
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,400
This is a...

355
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,200
This is Springy Head Guy.

356
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,600
It's you. Not a likeness.

357
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,900
It's how
you make me feel, Alex.

358
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,100
I'm sorry.

359
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,300
No. Like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know...

360
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,600
what or why it is.

361
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,900
It's reluctant to take form...

362
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,100
and yet creating an absolute...

363
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,200
but incomprehensible
attraction.

364
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,500
In four years
of high school...

365
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,600
we haven't said
one word to each other.

366
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,600
At that moment, on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

367
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
I didn't even know where
those emotions came from...

368
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,700
until you started
freaking out.

369
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,100
I didn't see what you saw,
but I felt it.

370
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
You can still feel it,
can't you?

371
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,500
Something from that day
is still with you.

372
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,100
I know because
I can still feel you.

373
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,800
That's why I was there
last night.

374
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
I've never dealt
with death before.

375
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,400
This could all be in our head.

376
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,100
It just feels like
it's all around us.

377
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,900
It?

378
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,900
What if Tod was just the first?

379
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,100
Of us.

380
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Is that something
that you're feeling?

381
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,200
I don't know.

382
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,700
I wish I could see him
one last time.

383
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,000
Maybe I would know.

384
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,200
Then let's go see him.

385
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,700
Easy.

386
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,200
Gives me a rush.

387
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,200
This place?

388
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
Doing something
I'm not supposed to.

389
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,200
Come on.

390
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,700
Hurry up.

391
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,600
- Is that him?
- I think.

392
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,100
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

393
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
That's him.

394
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,800
Whatever it was that made him
Tod is definitely gone.

395
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,900
Holy Christ!

396
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,900
Please.

397
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,900
You'll wake the dead.

398
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,400
Why'd his hand do that?

399
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,700
Chemicals.

400
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,600
The vascular flush
creates cadaveric spasms.

401
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,500
Look, I'm his friend...

402
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,300
I know who you are.

403
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,300
What are all those tiny marks?

404
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,800
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

405
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,000
Pulling at the wire?

406
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,700
If he was pulling at the wire,
he didn't kill himself.

407
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,100
It was an accident.

408
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
In death,
there are no accidents...

409
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,000
no coincidences, no mishaps...

410
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,200
and no escapes.

411
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,100
What you have to realize
is we're all just a mouse...

412
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,000
a cat has by the tail.

413
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,800
Every single move we make...

414
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,800
from the mundane
to the monumental...

415
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,800
the red light
that we stop at or run...

416
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,800
the people we have sex with
or won't with us...

417
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,800
airplanes that we ride
or walk out of...

418
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,000
it's all part of
death's sadistic design...

419
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,000
leading to the grave.

420
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,200
Design.

421
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,800
Does that mean if...

422
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,000
you figure out the design,
you can cheat death?

423
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,600
Alex, you've
already done that...

424
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,600
by walking off the plane.

425
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,800
Your friend's departure...

426
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,100
shows that death has
a new design for all of you.

427
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,600
Now you have to figure out...

428
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,600
how and when
it's coming back at you.

429
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,900
Play your hunch...

430
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,800
if you think
you can get away with it.

431
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,000
But remember...

432
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,000
the risk of cheating the plan...

433
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,300
of disrespecting the design...

434
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,500
could incite a fury to terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

435
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,000
And you don't even want to
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

436
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,700
OK, then. Well...

437
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,800
I'm sorry we broke in,
and...

438
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,100
No harm, no foul.

439
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
I'll see you soon.

440
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
The mortician said
that death has a design.

441
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,200
I'm talking about omens.

442
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,700
How do we know,
that just by sitting here...

443
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,400
by sipping this coffee
or breathing the air...

444
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,300
or even crossing
the intersection...

445
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,500
we haven't started in motion...

446
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,500
the events that will
some day lead to our death...

447
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,300
forty years from now,
ten years, tomorrow?

448
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,500
We don't,
unless we open ourselves up...

449
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,600
to the signs
it's willing to show us.

450
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,400
I don't understand.

451
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,200
Did you see Tod die?

452
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,100
Did it happen again,
like on the plane?

453
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,300
No, it didn't,
but it might as well have.

454
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,900
This is a message
from something, Clear...

455
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,000
or someone,
hinting at a design.

456
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,700
Total bullshit.

457
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,100
You can find death omens
anywhere you want to.

458
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,200
Coffee starts with a "C"
and ends with an "E".

459
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,200
So does "choke."
We'll choke to death?

460
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,300
I want to hear you...

461
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
but we'll go nuts
if you start with this shit.

462
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,000
The mortician said
that death has a design, right?

463
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,600
Now, what if
you, me, Tod, Carter...

464
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,900
Terry, Billy, Mrs. Lewton
messed up that design?

465
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
For whatever reason,
I saw death's plan...

466
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,700
and we cheated it.

467
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,600
But what if it was our time?

468
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,500
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

469
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,700
What if it still is our time?

470
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,100
If it is,
then it's not finished...

471
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,100
and we will die.
Now, not later.

472
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,000
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

473
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,700
After hearing you,
I do believe...

474
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,800
that Tod killed himself.

475
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,100
Baby, come on, not now.

476
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,500
Looks like we have
a reunion here.

477
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,700
Let it go.

478
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,800
- When are you moving?
- Couple weeks.

479
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,900
- That's too bad.
- Carter, you dick!

480
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,000
Losing our favorite teacher.

481
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,900
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

482
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,500
Lived here your whole life,
and now she's gotta move...

483
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,000
We're in danger!

484
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,700
Enough! Both of you!

485
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,700
They died, and we lived.

486
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,400
Get over it.

487
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,500
I will not let
this plane crash...

488
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,900
be the most important thing
in my life!

489
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,400
God!

490
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
I'm moving on, Carter...

491
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,000
and if you want
to waste your life...

492
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

493
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
then you can just
drop fucking dead!

494
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,400
Is Alex there?

495
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.

496
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,700
It's Clear again.
You want to talk to her?

497
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,000
Clear, he's in the shower.

498
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,500
Can I get him to call you back?

499
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,400
Sure. Bye.

500
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,600
She's concerned about you.

501
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,400
I'm concerned about you.

502
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,100
Why won't you talk to her?

503
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,500
Or to me?

504
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,700
Dad, you and Mom have
both been a big help...

505
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,500
but there's something
I need to understand...

506
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,200
before I can talk.

507
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,700
To anyone.

508
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,700
The National
Transportation Safety Board...

509
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,700
has a new theory tonight
on the cause of the explosion...

510
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,700
of Volee Air flight 180.

511
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,400
Officials believe deterioration
of silicone insulation...

512
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,900
on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...

513
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
may have leaked
combustible fluids.

514
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,800
That's Tod's seat.

515
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,800
A spark beneath the coach cabin
in the fuselage...

516
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,300
may have ignited the fuel line,
proceeding to the fuel pump...

517
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,100
which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.

518
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,800
The path of the explosion.

519
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,400
First was Tod,
then it was Terry.

520
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
They're dying in the order
they would've died.

521
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,100
That's death's design.

522
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,800
Ms Lewton's next.

523
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,300
Whenever I can fall asleep,
I see Terry Chaney...

524
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,200
and in the day,
out of nowhere...

525
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,100
I hear the sound of
my own voice in my head...

526
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,100
saying to Larry Murnau...

527
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,100
"No. You know
the whole French thing.

528
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,500
"Get on the plane."

529
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,400
Everything reminds me
of that day.

530
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,500
Right. Yeah.

531
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,800
I'm hoping a change will help.

532
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,100
It's just that...

533
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,400
I lived here
my whole life, you know?

534
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,600
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

535
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:09,500
And now all I see
is Larry and those kids.

536
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,000
Just looking out
my own front yard...

537
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,400
makes me feel nothing but fear.

538
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,900
Laura, I'm going to have
to call you back.

539
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,700
Right.

540
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,700
This is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.

541
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,000
What are you doing here?

542
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,800
I was just...

543
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,700
checking the air in the tire
to make sure it's safe.

544
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,200
Get in the car.

545
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Put on your seat belt.

546
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,200
I believe that...

547
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,500
that Ms Lewton is next.

548
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,600
Next?

549
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah, next, because...

550
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,800
there's this pattern
that's occurring.

551
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,700
Right. A pattern.

552
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,600
You noticed that, too?

553
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,800
Mom's favorite.

554
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,200
So what about this pattern?

555
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,400
Did you see it
in one of your visions?

556
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,000
Did you catch it
in some TV static?

557
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,300
I never asked for
what happened on the plane.

558
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,400
You guys are going to
sit there and make fun of me.

559
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,500
Whatever. It's fine.

560
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,800
But I saved six lives
on that plane.

561
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,200
Six lives, and everybody
in my entire school...

562
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,400
thinks I'm a freak.

563
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,400
I'm not suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

564
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,600
I don't have
a narcissistic deity complex.

565
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,900
I'm not going Dahmer
on you guys.

566
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,100
This just is.

567
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,800
There is a pattern for us all.

568
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,100
There is a pattern for you.

569
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,700
There is a design for everyone,
and I don't know how yet...

570
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,700
but I'm going to break
this one.

571
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,200
You came to our attention...

572
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,700
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

573
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,000
Now...

574
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,800
I know you didn't
blow up the plane.

575
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,600
We were ready to move on...

576
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,800
but then the other survivors
started to die.

577
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,600
First, your friend Tod...

578
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,200
then Terry Chaney,
while you were at the scene.

579
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,500
And tonight, we pick you up
at Val Lewton's house.

580
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,200
Nobody has control
over life and death...

581
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,800
unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

582
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,400
Can you promise me
no one else is going to die?

583
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,700
No, I can't.

584
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,800
As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control.

585
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,300
I'm sorry.

586
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,000
Go ahead.
Get out of here.

587
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,200
Thank you.

588
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,100
That kid gives me the creeps.

589
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,200
What do we do?
We got nothing.

590
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,100
That's not
what I'm talking about.

591
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,600
There were
a couple of moments...

592
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,100
where I almost believed him.

593
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,500
Don't take this
the wrong way...

594
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,200
but sometimes
you give me the creeps.

595
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,100
You've got to stop this.
It's a stupid mug.

596
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,700
You're out of here.

597
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,300
Pretty soon you'll be gone.

598
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,900
You'll be gone.

599
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,800
All right,
just stay still, OK?

600
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,500
Oh, God, Ms Lewton.

601
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,900
Dude.

602
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,800
I don't know where he is.

603
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,600
He's not talking to me.

604
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,800
Why?

605
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,000
Because I didn't believe him.

606
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,200
If he does contact you,
I think it would be...

607
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,800
in the best interest of
your safety if you called us.

608
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,600
Now, here's my card.

609
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,500
Toll-free number.

610
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,100
Interesting work.

611
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,300
Carter, you dick!

612
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,300
What are you doing?

613
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,700
Terry should be on this wall.

614
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,600
Shit.

615
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,200
Why'd you want us
to meet you here?

616
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,300
They're watching me
to see if I go to Alex.

617
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,500
That's why you're taking me.

618
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,200
Why would I want to see him?

619
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,800
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

620
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,700
Drive the speed limit, OK?

621
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,600
And don't pass on the right.

622
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,400
Billy, wait a minute.
I'm getting a vision.

623
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,500
You're the next one, man.

624
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,200
Man, why'd you say that?

625
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,200
Because if you say another word,
I'll fucking kill you.

626
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,200
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down the road...

627
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,100
so you guys start that way
and meet back in the middle.

628
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,400
It'll take half the time.

629
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,400
Do you think
they're still up there?

630
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,800
Somehow, flight 180,
are they still in flight?

631
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,300
Somewhere... are they safe?

632
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,900
When I was a kid,
like six or seven...

633
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,500
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

634
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,300
Lying awake at night,
just worrying.

635
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,700
Most kids do, I guess.

636
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,800
Most kids never have it happen.

637
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,300
When I was ten...

638
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,800
my dad went into a 7-Eleven
for cigarettes.

639
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,300
He heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

640
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,000
On reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

641
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,900
A guy blew his head off.

642
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,200
Life became shit after that.

643
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,200
My mom couldn't deal anymore.

644
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,000
She married this asshole
who my mom with my real dad...

645
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,600
would have crossed the street
to avoid this guy.

646
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,900
He didn't really want a kid...

647
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,500
so my mom didn't, either,
anymore.

648
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,900
If that was the design
for my father and family...

649
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,200
then fuck death!

650
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,200
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere.

651
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,100
It exists, that place...

652
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,900
where my dad is safe.

653
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,500
Where he had a full pack of
cigarettes and kept driving.

654
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,600
Where me and my mom and my dad
are still together...

655
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,600
and have no idea
about this life here.

656
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,100
Where our friends
are still in the sky.

657
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,700
Where everyone
gets a second chance.

658
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,200
Alex, we can't give up.

659
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,300
I can't go home,
because after Mrs. Lewton...

660
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,800
they're looking for me.

661
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,900
We're taking you
to my dad's cabin.

662
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,500
It's a couple of miles
from my house.

663
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,700
Browning,
you fucking warlock...

664
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
did you hear about
Ms Lewton or what?

665
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,400
Why do you think I was hiding?

666
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Billy told the FBI he saw you
running from her house.

667
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,700
I was running 'cause
they blame me for everything.

668
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,400
They blame me
for Tod, for her...

669
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,800
for the fucking plane crash.

670
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,500
The fire caramelized her blood.

671
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,700
Your shoe prints were in it,
your fingerprints on the knives.

672
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,000
I told you they were not...

673
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,000
I'm not talking about
if you did it.

674
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,700
Or even if
you knew she was dead.

675
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,900
Did you know she was going
to be next before she was?

676
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,900
Yeah, I did.

677
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,300
I knew.

678
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,800
All right, out of us...

679
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,500
who's next to see it?

680
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,300
Please...

681
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,500
tell me I'm going to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

682
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,000
It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.

683
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,100
I should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

684
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,700
What are you whining about?
I'm next!

685
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,700
He didn't say anything.
Just drive.

686
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,500
You have a responsibility
to tell me.

687
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,500
Think it's easier to know?

688
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,200
It's not.
It's fucking harder.

689
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,400
You get off
having control over me?

690
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,900
Let me decide
how to deal with it.

691
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,600
It doesn't matter who's next...

692
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,400
'cause we're
all on the same list.

693
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,800
Fuck.

694
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,300
Really?

695
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,100
Then why bother?

696
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,600
What's the fucking point?

697
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,600
Me and Terry'll be back
together on the other side...

698
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,100
so why wait any longer?

699
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,600
What are you doing?

700
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,000
Carter, slow down.

701
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,400
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you!

702
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,600
Knock it off!

703
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,500
May as well go out
on my own free will!

704
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,400
Not with us
in the fucking car!

705
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,700
Jesus, Carter!

706
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:16,800
Carter, stop the car!

707
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,000
What's the fucking worry
if it ain't your time?

708
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,800
I can get nailed
running this next red light.

709
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,100
You all wouldn't get shit.

710
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,800
It doesn't work that way!

711
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,100
I fucking hated French class!

712
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,100
- Get control of yourself.
- That's what I'm doing!

713
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,700
I know what you're doing,
and it's all right to be scared.

714
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,100
I'm not afraid.
I decide when it's time.

715
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,100
I control my life.
I control my death.

716
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,500
You don't have to prove
how big your balls are!

717
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,100
Stop driving
like such an asshole.

718
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,800
What are you doing?

719
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,700
Jesus Christ!

720
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,800
Put your hands
back on the wheel!

721
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,800
- Carter, stop!
- Back on the wheel!

722
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,300
Shit.

723
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,000
Carter, easy.

724
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,000
I am so close to puking
right now.

725
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,600
We're afraid, too,
but we're not quitting.

726
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,100
Stop it and stop
this fucking car!

727
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,100
Damn it, I want you
to stop this car right now!

728
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,400
- Move it.
- Open the door, Billy.

729
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,200
Move the fucking car!

730
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,400
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

731
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,600
- Can't you open the door?
- Open the fucking door.

732
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,100
- Open it!
- Billy, open the door!

733
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,700
Carter, listen to me.
Don't do this.

734
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,900
God damn it!
Get out of the fucking car!

735
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,700
Carter, listen to me!

736
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,200
This isn't the way!

737
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,200
It's not the way!
Get out of the car!

738
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,900
It's coming!

739
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,100
It ain't my time.

740
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:37,700
Shit.

741
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,600
Listen to me!
This isn't the way.

742
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,200
Get out of the car!

743
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,600
Come on! Get out!

744
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,000
I can't get out!

745
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,900
Man, he really is next.

746
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,600
Get out!

747
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,200
Fuck!

748
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,300
Oh, God!

749
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,600
I saw it! I saw the belt!

750
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,800
You scared now?

751
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,300
It broke!

752
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,900
Bullshit!

753
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,100
He saved your life again.

754
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,500
That's right!

755
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,100
You're next, Carter!

756
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,300
I'm staying the fuck
away from you!

757
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,800
- Shut up, Billy!
- We don't need this shit now.

758
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,600
I don't need it ever!

759
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Get away from him! He's next!

760
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,700
Fuck you, Billy!
I'm not dead!

761
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,500
You will be.

762
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,700
You're dead...

763
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,200
and you ain't taking me
with you!

764
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,500
- God, no!
- Oh, shit!

765
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,100
Jesus fucking Christ!

766
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,600
You should have been next.

767
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,100
You were after Lewton.
That's the plan!

768
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,400
That's the design!
You should be fucking dead!

769
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:26,600
You're the devil!

770
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,200
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip!

771
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,100
That's how I saved him.

772
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,800
Just like the explosion.
I saw it!

773
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,000
- The police are coming.
- Fuck! I saved him!

774
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,000
Because I saved him,
it skipped Carter...

775
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,600
and went to the next person
in the path of the explosion!

776
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,500
I have to see it.

777
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,900
Then I intervene...

778
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,300
and if I intervene,
I cheat the design.

779
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,700
Intervene? Are you God now?

780
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,000
God's not afraid to die.

781
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,200
Gods don't die! We do!

782
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,400
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.

783
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,200
We have to get you
back to my cabin.

784
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,100
You can hide out
and get your head together.

785
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,200
After Billy, I'm next.

786
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,800
I'm next.

787
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,100
Then me.

788
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,000
Listen, I'm not going
to let it happen.

789
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,400
Listen to me.

790
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,700
Why don't you two
get the fuck out of here?

791
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,400
Rusted.

792
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,000
Tetanus.

793
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,800
Nice one.

794
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,700
I overlooked it.

795
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,500
You tried to capitalize,
but I caught you.

796
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,100
You fuck!

797
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,700
I can beat you.

798
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,500
Maybe not forever...

799
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,500
but I got this cabin
rigged to beat you now!

800
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,100
She was there a minute ago.

801
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,100
What are you talking about?

802
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,400
I'm not turning him in.

803
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,100
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

804
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,100
I go with you.

805
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,200
You can't.

806
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,400
Just tell us where he is.

807
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,200
Wait at home.
I give you my word...

808
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,200
we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

809
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,000
I never moved.

810
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,700
Christa asked me to change,
but I never moved.

811
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,200
I would have been up
next to Tod.

812
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,300
Fuck!
Why didn't I remember that?

813
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
I never moved. Clear's seat
was in front of mine.

814
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,400
She's next.

815
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,100
Get in the car!
We're going around!

816
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,700
- There!
- Come on, let's go!

817
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,600
Alex, we're trying to help you.

818
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,200
Prince! Get away from it!

819
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,400
Hold on!

820
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,400
Run!

821
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,600
We lost him.

822
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,100
From the direction, there's only
one place he's heading.

823
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,000
No shit.

824
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,100
Oh, my God!

825
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,100
Don't move! Stay there!

826
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,400
Don't move!

827
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,600
Don't touch anything.
You're grounded by the tires.

828
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,500
The car's going to explode!

829
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,300
I can only hold on for so long.
You know what to do.

830
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Don't!

831
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,400
When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll all be over.

832
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,400
It's the only way
we can cheat death again.

833
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:01,000
Don't!

834
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,300
I am not going to let it
beat us both.

835
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,000
You know what to do!

836
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,000
I'll always be with you.

837
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Don't!

838
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,800
Get away from there!

839
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,800
Damn it!
You can't do this to me.

840
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,600
Come on, baby. Come on.

841
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,400
Shit, he's not breathing.

842
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,600
Hold on, Alex. Come on.
Stay with me.

843
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,300
Well, we made it.

844
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,500
Paris.
I can't believe it.

845
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,600
I can't believe
we got on a plane again.

846
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,000
Know what I'm saying?

847
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,600
It's weird being here, huh?

848
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,400
We finally completed a puzzle.

849
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,100
It's just
there's something missing.

850
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,600
You know?

851
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,900
To Terry.

852
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,100
And to Tod.

853
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,800
To all of our friends
that can't be here.

854
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,400
Cheers.

855
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,300
What?

856
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,700
If you would've told me
six months ago...

857
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,400
the three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

858
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,300
I don't know.
Sometimes it feels like...

859
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,100
you two are the only ones
who understand.

860
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,600
You were right, Browning.

861
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,500
It did skip us.
There was a design.

862
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,900
We beat it. We won.

863
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,000
The only thing we won
is a chance at a full life.

864
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,200
A chance
that I won't ever waste.

865
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,600
There's just something
I can't figure out.

866
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,400
- About what?
- The design.

867
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,900
Just let it go, all right?

868
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,700
Hear me out, all right?

869
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,300
- Oh, my God.
- Just listen.

870
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,800
The explosion path determined
the order of our deaths.

871
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,000
When I intervened
and saved Carter...

872
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,500
it skipped him and went
to the next person... Billy.

873
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,000
Then it was Clear.

874
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,900
But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me.

875
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,800
But in my case,
no one intervened, right?

876
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,000
I was thrown
from that power line...

877
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,800
by the explosion, so...

878
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,000
So why did it skip you?

879
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,600
How do we know this isn't
what was meant to happen?

880
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,900
That out of everyone
on flight 180...

881
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
you, me, and Carter
were meant to live?

882
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,500
Maybe that was
the design all along.

883
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,300
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

884
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,700
I didn't make up the rules.

885
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,000
Somebody's got to intervene
before death can skip them.

886
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,100
Alex proved that three times
with the plane, me, and you.

887
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,200
For all I know,
it could circle back...

888
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:07,800
and get us all again.

889
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,600
But I am the safest fucker
in the world...

890
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,300
because you're still next.

891
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,900
Can we just stop talking
about this?

892
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,800
Let's figure out...

893
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,700
I'll meet you back
at the hotel.

894
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,100
I'll go with you.

895
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,800
No, just stay here,
OK, Clear?

896
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,100
All right?

897
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,700
See? It's true.
I told you you were next, man.

898
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,300
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.

899
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,700
Clear, stay there, OK?

900
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,400
Stay away.

901
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,300
- I told you you were next!
- It skipped me.

902
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,300
So who's next?
