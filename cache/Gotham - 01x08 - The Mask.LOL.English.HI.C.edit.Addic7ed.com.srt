1
00:00:00,993 --> 00:00:02,460
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

2
00:00:02,494 --> 00:00:05,539
- Listen, there are things I need to do.
- If you stay, I stay.

3
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:07,228
<i>ZSASZ: My name is Victor Zsasz.</i>

4
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:10,197
I'm here for Jim Gordon. Everybody out.

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,455
<i>There's not a single cop in this city</i>

6
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:13,383
<i>who'll help you.</i>

7
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:15,503
- I won't help you.
- I'm not leaving.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,761
- You don't have to join me.
- I figure I'm doomed anyhow.

9
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:21,429
<i>I might as well join the good guys.</i>

10
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:23,198
<i>MOONEY: I ain't looking for no girl.</i>

11
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,599
<i>I'm looking for a weapon.</i>

12
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,434
Excuse me.

13
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:28,503
You want to start a war over this punk?

14
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:29,904
The little guy amuses me.

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,839
<i>FALCONE: Why go to war over trifles?</i>

16
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:34,375
We'll let you have him. Our gift to you.

17
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:41,950
(panting quietly)

18
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,422
Oh, God, oh, God.

19
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,370
(yells)

20
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:04,906
(grunting)

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,912
(yells)

22
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,565
(choking)

23
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:40,408
(grunts)

24
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:43,978
(moaning)

25
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,319
(foghorn blares)

26
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:53,121
(helicopter blades whirring)

27
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:56,231
(seagulls screeching)

28
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:57,532
- (coffee spills)
- Oh.

29
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:59,767
Hell of a way to start the day.

30
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:01,269
I mean, I just cleaned this.

31
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:02,537
Harvey.

32
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:03,805
Hey.

33
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,006
Uniforms found the body.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,876
No wallet, no ID, no watch.

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,644
He got beaten up pretty good.

36
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:11,279
I'm guessing the cause of
death is that gigantic gash

37
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:12,781
in the side of his neck.

38
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:14,449
You think? What's all the black on him?

39
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:15,784
Ink? Paint?

40
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,285
Hmm.

41
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,788
- Good morning, Ed.
- Detective.

42
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:22,023
Going by overall coagulation,

43
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:25,126
I'd say time of death is midnight. But...

44
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,761
he's only been here for a couple hours.

45
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:28,530
Rats have just started on his ears.

46
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:30,198
Sneaky little buggers.

47
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:31,199
So, not a mugging.

48
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,567
Muggers don't move the body.

49
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,836
Abrasions on his knuckles...

50
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,171
put up a fight.

51
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,073
Yeah. Look at the suspenders.

52
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,641
I'm guessing he's some kind of finance guy.

53
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:42,477
Maybe it was an abduction
ransom thing gone wrong.

54
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,179
He resists, ka-chunk!

55
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,181
Do you want to talk to the
uniforms that found the body?

56
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:47,482
Uh, you do it.

57
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:48,650
We should canvass

58
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:50,318
the area, though; a lot
of homeless around here.

59
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,787
- I'll get some unis on it.
- I'll handle it myself.

60
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,322
Hey, Joe!

61
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:56,458
Go smoke somewhere else, huh?

62
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:57,826
Come on, Jim, that's
what we got uniforms for.

63
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,395
- Let them do it.
- And I'd rather handle it myself.

64
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:01,496
Detectives...

65
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,131
I'm guessing I should run all the prints?

66
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,667
Yeah, Ed, run the prints.

67
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:06,701
This one, too?

68
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,243
Yeah, Ed, that one, too.

69
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:21,549
It wasn't even a proper yacht.

70
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,518
No, it's more like a dinghy.

71
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:27,589
Can I help you?

72
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,724
What a lovely brooch.

73
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,992
Thank you.

74
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:33,361
May I have it?

75
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,529
(laughs)

76
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:37,799
I have a friend who would love that.

77
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,734
- Excuse me?
- Oh...

78
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,935
(laughing)

79
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,872
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:47,175
May I please have it?

81
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,050
You shouldn't have.

82
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:56,551
I wanted to make a gesture.

83
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:59,054
I hope, in time,

84
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:00,388
we can be friends.

85
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,556
Friends?

86
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,024
Hmm.

87
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,626
Sure.

88
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,094
Why not? What's done is done.

89
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,363
I'm so glad you feel that way.

90
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,298
Don Maroni wants us

91
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,033
to clarify terms.

92
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,635
Well, it's business as usual.

93
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,404
Maroni still has his drugs, his unions.

94
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,573
He pays tariff for the ports.

95
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:19,841
If he needs favors from the cops

96
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,811
or the mayor, Don Falcone will consider it.

97
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,780
And, of course, the
families still share Arkham.

98
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,216
And there is to be no blood
spilled on either side.

99
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,052
- Not a drop.
- Hmm...

100
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:33,321
Maybe just a drop.

101
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,923
(laughing)

102
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,558
(clucks tongue)

103
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:37,659
(laughing)

104
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:38,960
Look at you.

105
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,793
Timothy,

106
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,599
do you know this fellow
used to have your job?

107
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,602
Carried my umbrella
and thought it an honor.

108
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:49,938
Now look at him.

109
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:51,406
Has a seat at the table.

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,341
Things change, eh?

111
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,310
I've been blessed.

112
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:57,812
Perhaps I should open your gift.

113
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:02,984
(gasps)

114
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,421
My goodness.

115
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,623
That is beautiful.

116
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,593
Now I feel awful.

117
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:14,095
- I didn't get you anything.
- No.

118
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,431
Thank you.

119
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:28,977
Hmm. Sweet.

120
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:30,512
That was uncalled for.

121
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,180
I brought you into my family

122
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,015
and I treated you like a son!

123
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,016
And you betrayed me.

124
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,485
- For which I suffered.
- Not enough.

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,788
When I order some fool killed,

126
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:42,190
I expect him to stay that way.

127
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:43,858
Your boss, Don Falcone,

128
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,026
expressly said...

129
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,394
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he wants peace.

130
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,730
He's the only reason why
your ass is still alive.

131
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,465
And if I were you, I would

132
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:54,035
<i>pray for his good health.</i>

133
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,170
(laughing)

134
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,838
Oh, I do.

135
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:58,506
I do.

136
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,975
Good.

137
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,576
'Cause remember...

138
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,146
things change.

139
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,582
Convey my respects to your don.

140
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,850
Likewise.

141
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:11,286
Peace...

142
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,487
friend.

143
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:29,131
(school bell ringing)

144
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,601
(children talking, laughing)

145
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:32,969
ALFRED: Come now, Master Bruce.

146
00:06:33,003 --> 00:06:35,338
Had to happen sooner or later.

147
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:37,073
Is this really necessary?

148
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,608
Homeschooling is just as effective.

149
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:39,809
I can show you the data.

150
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,811
You need to be around
children your own age.

151
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,983
Why?

152
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:48,451
'Cause you do.

153
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,253
You know I despise that sort of answer.

154
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,421
Don't you miss your mates?

155
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:54,657
Not really.

156
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:57,193
I've always found them kind of childish.

157
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,794
Well, that's what they're
meant to be, aren't they?

158
00:06:58,829 --> 00:06:59,996
That's what they do.

159
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:04,634
Don't you want to be like a normal kid?

160
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,636
I'm not sure.

161
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,272
Define "normal" and
make a good case for it.

162
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:11,040
- You're going to bloody school.
- (bell tolling)

163
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,375
Now start walking.

164
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:24,187
Good luck, lad.

165
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,658
GORDON: Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

166
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:29,792
Can you think of anyone

167
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,194
who would want to hurt your son Coleman?

168
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,863
No, sir. Nobody.

169
00:07:33,897 --> 00:07:35,398
He was a good boy.

170
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:36,732
Yes, ma'am, I can see that.

171
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,935
No arrests. An honest young man.

172
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,473
- What did he do for a living?
- Uh, he worked in a coffee shop.

173
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:45,641
When we found him, he was in a suit.

174
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:46,709
Suspenders.

175
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,878
He was looking for a job in finance.

176
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,880
He was very ambitious.

177
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:53,783
First in our family to go to college.

178
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,384
(crying): Who would do this, sir?

179
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:56,619
Why?

180
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,987
We'll do our best to find out, ma'am.

181
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,090
Gordon's finishing up with the mother.

182
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,825
So far, nothing off the severed thumb

183
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,344
and none of the city's ERs
have seen any thumbless guys.

184
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,364
- You think he went black market?
- That's next on my list.

185
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,500
- How's Gordon?
- Angry.

186
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:12,802
How would you feel if every cop
in the building ran out on you?

187
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,704
And now they all treat him

188
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,072
like he's got the plague,

189
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,641
'cause seeing him reminds them
of what cowards they all are.

190
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,378
I'm sorry, Cap, I...

191
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:23,546
I didn't mean you.

192
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,615
Nope.

193
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:27,650
You're right.

194
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:29,118
But he's gotta get over that.

195
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:31,888
Can't do this job alone.

196
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:34,524
Lucky he's got you.

197
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:36,259
Yeah.

198
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:41,531
(gasps)

199
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:43,900
So beautiful.

200
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:46,669
As soon as I saw it, I thought of you.

201
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,671
Such a good son.

202
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,641
- Put it on, put it on.
- Oh...

203
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:53,476
(gasps)

204
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,445
Wh-What happened?

205
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,647
- Who did this?
- N-Nobody.

206
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,315
It's just a scratch. It's...

207
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:00,650
Is your mother a fool?

208
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:02,552
No. Someone

209
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,854
- is being mean to my boy.
- Hey.

210
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:07,023
It's a tough business.

211
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:10,760
The restaurant business
is so tough these days?

212
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,228
Why is that?

213
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,930
My success makes other people envious.

214
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:16,599
So tell the boss on these people.

215
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,936
This person isn't scared of the boss.

216
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,071
Not like they should be.

217
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,439
I don't know why.

218
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:24,674
I know.

219
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,442
When I was in school,

220
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:29,545
Magda Himmelfarb

221
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,915
was so mean to me

222
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,585
and teacher did nothing.

223
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:36,786
Why?

224
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,790
Because such a good dancer I was.

225
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:43,993
And Magda, with her nice hair

226
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,330
and her big bosoms, a carthorse.

227
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:50,299
I meant... why did the teacher do nothing?

228
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,335
Why you think?

229
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:54,804
"Private lessons," they said.

230
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:58,007
I put stop to that.

231
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,643
- You told on them?
- Oh, no.

232
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:04,647
I denounced Magda's father

233
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,816
to secret police.

234
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,185
(trap snaps, rodent squeals)

235
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:10,753
Ah...

236
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:15,758
Three weeks he's been turning
up his nose at my traps,

237
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,827
and now, now, today, a smidge

238
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,996
of Camembert

239
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,666
and Mr. Rat, he cannot resist.

240
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,601
No. Oh, can you?

241
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:29,238
Can you, my little greedy baby?

242
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,741
I found out your secret!

243
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:34,477
Yes.

244
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:36,679
Everybody has a secret.

245
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:40,650
(screaming)

246
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:42,685
Morphine!

247
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,053
Morphine!

248
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,890
They teach you that in med school?

249
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:49,625
Oh...

250
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,127
Bullock.

251
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:52,495
Is that Kenny Suffield?

252
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:53,763
Smash and grab guy.

253
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:54,764
Also a real hound with the ladies.

254
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:57,100
- Who shot him?
- I don't ask.

255
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,568
Well, me and my partner
doing all the rounds

256
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:00,969
of you black market sawbones.

257
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,306
Guy we're looking for would've
come in early this morning

258
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,508
- missing a thumb.
- Sorry.

259
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,043
You'd tell us if you
knew, wouldn't you, Doc?

260
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:08,211
I mean, that's the deal, right?

261
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:10,546
You give us info and we
let you keep operating?

262
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:13,549
That's a pun. Operating.

263
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:16,419
Bullock, black ink,

264
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,887
just like on the victim.

265
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,856
Oh, Doc.

266
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,891
Fine.

267
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,926
He came in about 3:00 this morning.

268
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:25,228
Didn't give a name,

269
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:27,564
but this dropped out of his pocket.

270
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:29,732
Sionis Investments.

271
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,868
- What'd he look like?
- Mid-20s.

272
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:35,204
- Suit, suspenders.
- Just like our dead guy.

273
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,707
Sorry, Doc.

274
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,275
This is Gordon. I need an ambulance

275
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,712
and a black and white at 1856 Wilton.

276
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,113
Wait!

277
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:46,349
Just... wait a second.

278
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:48,084
Just get me Alvarez, will you?

279
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:50,119
ALVAREZ: Bullock, Bullock,
what the hell, man?

280
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:51,888
I got a deal with that guy.

281
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:53,690
- Deal's off.
- But I told you everything.

282
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,291
Yeah, after we caught you in a lie.

283
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,927
He always lies. You just squeeze him.

284
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,963
- You're screwing the rest of us.
- Oh, yeah?

285
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,565
- How's that feel? You like it?
- Hey, enough, enough!

286
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,000
I get it, I get it, huh?

287
00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:06,402
None of these sons of bitches
had your back when it mattered,

288
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,771
but where was I? I was there, remember?

289
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,540
Falcone, the Mayor, blaze of glory?

290
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:12,342
Be nice for my sake.

291
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,477
- I am being nice.
- Haven't you learned your lesson?

292
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:17,046
We're only alive because
Falcone let us live.

293
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,781
You got to go along to get along, Jim.

294
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:20,783
- No, I don't.
- You think locking up

295
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,486
Doc Scumbag there is
gonna make a difference?

296
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,521
I'm on your side. I proved that.

297
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:28,224
Yeah, you did.

298
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,726
So I'm asking you, please,

299
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,428
let the doc out and tomorrow,

300
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:33,930
you and I will go check out

301
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,299
this Sionis Investments together.

302
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:43,072
All right, partner?

303
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,876
Sorry, Harv.

304
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:53,416
- This ain't right, Harvey.
- Alvarez, put a zipper on it!

305
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,660
(door closes)

306
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,299
(gun clicks)

307
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,800
(gasps) Jim.

308
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,101
Barbara, what are you...

309
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,003
I heard someone come
in, and you didn't turn

310
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:15,438
- on the light...
- So you got out my spare?

311
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:17,941
You were late! I got nervous.

312
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,609
- God.
- Not the best idea

313
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:22,502
to be handling a firearm
when you've been drinking.

314
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:25,648
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:30,220
Look, you've been through a lot.

316
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:31,821
It's over now.

317
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:36,092
I am scared, Jim. Everywhere I go, I can...

318
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:39,395
I can feel that monster, Zsasz,

319
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,764
- stalking me, and I...
- He's not a monster.

320
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,435
He's just a man.

321
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:48,972
I won't let anyone hurt you.

322
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:51,541
How can you promise me that?

323
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:56,512
Tell me it'll be okay.

324
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,214
(sighs)

325
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:01,050
Tell me there really aren't any monsters.

326
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,055
Just...

327
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,691
lie if you have to.

328
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:12,228
There aren't any monsters.

329
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:33,183
When are we gonna get out of here?

330
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:35,552
That's up to you.

331
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,311
Morning.

332
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,680
(sighing): Hey.

333
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:51,795
I didn't think you were up.

334
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,085
Look, last night was just nerves...

335
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,354
and way too much to drink.

336
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,558
I said I wanted half your
life, and I've got it.

337
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,529
Leave the gun.

338
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,243
- I wish it wasn't like this.
- Do you really?

339
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:24,944
(sighs)

340
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,113
Ignore me. I'm just tired.

341
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:28,414
Go.

342
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,717
Catch some bad guys.

343
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,253
(softly): Okay.

344
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:40,426
(door opens)

345
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,028
(glove snaps)

346
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:46,532
Forensic examination by Edward Nygma,

347
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,568
8:42 a.m., GCPD morgue.

348
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,437
The room is approximately
19 degrees Celsius.

349
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,306
I ate half a cranberry muffin earlier,

350
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,741
saving the rest for later.

351
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,056
What do a dead man, a cruise ship

352
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,457
and emu have in common?

353
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,795
Correct, nothing.

354
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:24,470
Ever more curious.

355
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,339
MEDICAL EXAMINER: He what?!

356
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:29,909
Nygma, how many times have I told you

357
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,244
to stay the hell out of here?

358
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:32,779
- But I discovered something.
- You'll discover

359
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:34,647
your butt in the street
if you keep doing this.

360
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:36,416
Out.

361
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,654
Your loss.

362
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,190
You sloppy ignoramus.

363
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:50,997
- Hi, Bruce.
- Hi.

364
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:57,170
Brucey, how you doing?

365
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:58,905
Tommy, hey.

366
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:02,041
- I'm well, how are you?
- You know, chilling.

367
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:06,145
So, uh, your mom and dad got killed, huh?

368
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,649
- Yes.
- You see the whole thing?

369
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:11,451
The blood and everything?

370
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:14,554
- I'd rather not talk about that.
- I was just interested.

371
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:16,456
I've never seen a real dead body.

372
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,359
Was there guts?

373
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,529
I'll be going to class now.

374
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,701
(bell tolling)

375
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:42,182
Forgive me, Mother, for I have sinned.

376
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,383
MOONEY: Funny.

377
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,187
It feels weird, meeting here.

378
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,255
You don't want anyone to see us together.

379
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,158
Falcone has his eyes everywhere.

380
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:55,161
So, where are we?

381
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,396
I cook for him,

382
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,432
I sing to him, we go on walks.

383
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:02,168
I don't know whether
I'm his maid, his lover

384
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:03,570
or his mother.

385
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:04,971
Or all three.

386
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:07,407
He cares about you.

387
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:09,742
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

388
00:18:09,777 --> 00:18:11,578
Have you been inside his private office?

389
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:12,912
Yeah.

390
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,447
A few times.

391
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:18,184
Inside the right bottom
desk drawer is a ledger.

392
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:20,753
Copy the last two pages.

393
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:22,455
It'll be locked; you will need a key

394
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,690
off of his key ring.

395
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:25,458
(scoffs) How do I get that?

396
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:28,695
Behind you is a vial. Give it to him.

397
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:32,765
He'll sleep like the dead for two hours.

398
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,434
It won't kill him, will it?

399
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,902
(groans)

400
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,070
(chuckles)

401
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:38,972
Liza,

402
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:42,776
you haven't caught feelings
for the old man, have you?

403
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,445
Not at all.

404
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,680
No, it won't kill him.

405
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,016
Killing him now would only create chaos.

406
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,485
I need to siphon his strength.

407
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,654
So when the time is right,

408
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,589
taking over his organization

409
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:59,125
will be like slipping on a glove.

410
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,396
What if one of his men catches me snooping?

411
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:05,165
Then you're probably dead.

412
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,935
You leave first.

413
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,311
(indistinct chatter)

414
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,184
MAN: Right, right, right.

415
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:27,020
(overlapping chatter)

416
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:28,188
I'm under a lot of pressure.

417
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:34,661
(overlapping chatter continues)

418
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,796
Something tells me we
came to the right place.

419
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,834
- You think?
- Mr. Sionis will see you now.

420
00:19:50,678 --> 00:19:52,378
Oh.

421
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:55,582
- Richard Sionis.
- James Gordon.

422
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,183
This is my partner, Harvey Bullock.

423
00:19:57,218 --> 00:20:00,653
How can I help you detectives?
I don't have much time.

424
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,956
You know this man? Coleman Lawson?

425
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,058
He might have interviewed for a job.

426
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:06,559
Sorry, no.

427
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:09,362
Any of your employees miss work yesterday?

428
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:12,365
Any of them show up today
with an injured right hand?

429
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,201
I don't take roll call, Detective.

430
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:17,470
You mind if we check?

431
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:19,873
Perhaps you can tell me what this is about?

432
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:21,508
Coleman Lawson was killed two night ago.

433
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:24,077
The man who did it had your
firm's card in his pocket.

434
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:27,814
Well, there's a thousand
ways he could've gotten that.

435
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:30,183
What's with all the warrior baloney?

436
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,886
It inspires me.

437
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,822
High finance is tough business.

438
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:38,258
In order to succeed,
you have to be a warrior.

439
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,060
No, you don't.

440
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:42,195
You have to be a good businessman.

441
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:45,298
Warriors fight wars. It's different.

442
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:48,001
So you fancy yourself a killer?

443
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:50,603
Have you killed people, Mr. Sionis?

444
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:52,639
Only metaphorically.

445
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:54,574
So all this is just juvenile play acting.

446
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:55,709
Exactly.

447
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:58,778
Thus speaks a man who's seen actual combat.

448
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:01,581
You've killed people for real, haven't you?

449
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,683
True killers are easy to spot.

450
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:06,252
Yes, they are.

451
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,122
Why all the masks?

452
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,057
A shrink would say you're hiding something.

453
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:12,592
To the contrary.

454
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:16,930
A mask hides the face, but frees the soul.

455
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:20,467
A mask speaks the truth.

456
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:21,935
Deep.

457
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,603
How come so many of your employees

458
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:24,938
have scars and injuries?

459
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:27,374
Our touch football games get very rough.

460
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:28,975
You're a liar, Mr. Sionis.

461
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:31,978
Such fire.

462
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:36,783
You must miss the battlefield desperately.

463
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:39,886
I imagine killing gets quite addictive.

464
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:43,390
You murdered Coleman Lawson, didn't you?

465
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:45,091
Prove it.

466
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:46,926
We will.

467
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,100
I'd give you a good cop routine,

468
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:56,236
but it's not in my tool kit.

469
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:01,274
(indistinct chatter)

470
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:25,832
(water running)

471
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,535
GCPD.

472
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,537
- (turns off water)
- Turn around slowly.

473
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:35,442
Let me see those hands!

474
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:38,211
(toilet flushes)

475
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:42,782
Don't move!

476
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:44,818
(both grunting)

477
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:52,959
You should've waited for me.

478
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:55,061
(door closes)

479
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:57,731
(school bell ringing)

480
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,766
(indistinct chatter)

481
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:06,306
Hey, Brucey.

482
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,308
It's Bruce.

483
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:09,843
No "Y."

484
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:12,145
No parents, either, so I
can call you what I like.

485
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,180
Please, get out of my way.

486
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:16,416
Snobby little jerk, isn't he?

487
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,684
For an orphan.

488
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:20,220
You're being very unkind.

489
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:22,155
I don't understand why.

490
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,224
Boy, you're a weirdo.

491
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:27,360
- Your mother must...
- (grunts)

492
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:29,663
Don't talk about my mother.

493
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,501
Oh, really?

494
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:46,836
Oh, is that Timothy?

495
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:55,345
(chuckles) We met at Fish Mooney's, hmm?

496
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:58,515
I'm the fellow who used to have your job.

497
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,884
I was hoping to ask you a few questions.

498
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:02,886
- I don't know any...
- (shushes)

499
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:07,524
They'll be time for that.

500
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:09,359
First things first.

501
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,227
(grunting)

502
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:13,263
(blows landing, Timothy grunting)

503
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:21,838
BULLOCK: Most killers leave their prints

504
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:23,840
at the crime scene, but not you, no.

505
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:26,543
You left your whole thumb
in the dead guy's mouth.

506
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:28,511
You got style! I like you, kid.

507
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:30,213
This is your last chance.

508
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:33,817
Once we walk out that door... it's over.

509
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,318
It was self-defense.

510
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:36,586
BULLOCK: Of course it was.

511
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,021
Wasn't that what I said, Jim?

512
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:40,223
Didn't I say it was probably self-defense?

513
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:44,027
Talk.

514
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:45,662
Gordon's getting the rest of his statement.

515
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,364
Apparently it was part
of the hiring process.

516
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:50,200
Sionis told the top three
candidates to fight it out.

517
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,835
They weren't supposed to
fight to the death, but...

518
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:53,570
This is unbelievable.

519
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:55,038
They all signed confidentiality agreements,

520
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:57,007
so they're accomplices to whatever happens.

521
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,174
Do we know where the fight was held?

522
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,710
Some old office building.
The windows were boarded up.

523
00:25:00,745 --> 00:25:02,512
And he was taken there blindfolded.

524
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:05,517
- Yes, Ed?
- Printer toner.

525
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:07,536
Do you know what he's talking about?

526
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,163
The medical examiner's
report said it was black ink.

527
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:13,062
But I did my own examination,
and it was printer toner.

528
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,997
Also, I pulled staples from his shoulders.

529
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:17,366
And found graphite chips between his ribs.

530
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:18,901
Your man was killed in an office.

531
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,937
Yeah, we're kind of past
that, Ed, but thanks.

532
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,373
- Is there something else?
- Yes.

533
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:26,209
It made me think of a case from a year ago.

534
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:27,477
Young man, business suit,

535
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:29,479
esophagus lacerated from index card

536
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:31,447
shoved down his throat.
So, I did some digging...

537
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:34,150
How many other bodies were
killed with office supplies?

538
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,953
Four... in the last three years.

539
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:39,822
Get that man to sign a confession. Now.

540
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:42,925
I think we have a problem.

541
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,128
I explained to Detective
Gordon, as counsel to Mr. Adams

542
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:46,662
I'd advised him against speaking further.

543
00:25:46,697 --> 00:25:47,797
Also, any statements

544
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:49,098
he has made will be considered having

545
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,466
been made under duress.

546
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:53,102
Uh-huh, and how much is Sionis
paying him to take the fall?

547
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:54,637
Good day.

548
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,741
He showed up before Adams
could sign his statements.

549
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:01,477
We got to figure out where
Sionis is staging these fights.

550
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:04,147
I'll run all the buildings he
or his company owns in Gotham.

551
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:06,115
This make any sense to you?

552
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,918
No, but how's it any worse
than the Goat or the Balloonman?

553
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:11,254
When did this become normal for this city?

554
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:12,455
What changed?

555
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,589
Maybe nothing. Maybe it was always

556
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:15,825
just below the surface.
Only needed a spark.

557
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:17,627
Like Thomas and Martha Wayne being killed?

558
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:20,630
I'm not blind, Gordon.

559
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,365
I know you're still looking into it.

560
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,501
But how could their deaths
have caused all this?

561
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:27,804
Why were they so important?

562
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:29,872
I think it's what they represented.

563
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,341
A different Gotham.

564
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:33,810
Decent, hopeful.

565
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,046
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

566
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:40,683
When Zsasz came for
you, I should've stayed.

567
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:42,118
I told you to go.

568
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:44,320
That doesn't matter. I should've stayed.

569
00:26:45,722 --> 00:26:47,290
Now, let's get this guy.

570
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:49,325
Yeah.

571
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:55,565
(door opens)

572
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:58,968
Tad late, Master Bruce.

573
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:00,470
Oi.

574
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:02,038
- Oi. What happened to you?
- I'm perfectly fine!

575
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:03,339
What happened?

576
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:09,412
Someone spoke disrespectfully
about my mother.

577
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:12,014
Oh, did they now?

578
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,684
Well, I hope you broke
their bastard teeth for them.

579
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,019
No.

580
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,755
He's much bigger than me, and I...

581
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:21,891
I'm not very good at fighting.
Didn't hurt him at all.

582
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,427
Not at all?

583
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:27,864
Don't tell the school.

584
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,034
Not bloody likely.

585
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,771
<i>BULLOCK: Take a look at this.</i>

586
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,139
Sionis owns half of Gotham!

587
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,340
All right, we'll split up.

588
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:38,941
Focus on the buildings that are abandoned

589
00:27:38,976 --> 00:27:40,243
or under construction first.

590
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:41,511
This son of a bitch is not getting away!

591
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:43,513
I'll say one thing... he has your number.

592
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,615
- What are you talking about?
- Sionis.

593
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:47,417
You may not have put
down Cobblepot, Jimmy boy,

594
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,352
but you got a demon in you.

595
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:51,287
You can call yourself a soldier,
but all this fighting Falcone,

596
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,723
fighting other cops,

597
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,358
you love it. So, when you find something

598
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:58,561
that seems remotely possible, call me.

599
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,596
(cell phone ringing)

600
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:05,068
Barbara, everything all right?

601
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,003
Fine. I just, uh,

602
00:28:07,037 --> 00:28:08,971
I wanted to check in.

603
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:11,240
Can we talk later? I'm kind
of in the middle of something.

604
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,341
Of course. (laughs)

605
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:14,277
- I love...
- (clicks, dial tone droning)

606
00:28:16,547 --> 00:28:18,548
(phone beeps off)

607
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:26,489
MAN: Hey!

608
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:28,458
Boss wants his tea.

609
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,660
It's almost ready.

610
00:28:56,954 --> 00:28:58,955
(lights buzzing)

611
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:05,428
(rattling nearby)

612
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,967
GCPD!

613
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,369
(gasps)

614
00:29:15,406 --> 00:29:16,939
Anybody else here?

615
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,175
(Taser clicking) (grunts)

616
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:21,177
That...

617
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,179
would be a yes.

618
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:29,639
- All right, cream and sugar.
- Yeah.

619
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:35,812
Hey.

620
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,241
Uh...

621
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:42,810
hi.

622
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:44,946
A girl's got to shop.

623
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:56,658
(siren wailing in distance)

624
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:04,165
This...

625
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,700
is your father's watch.

626
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:08,736
Don't you lose it now.

627
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,641
Tommy Elliot's house.

628
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:19,078
- Don't you be scared.
- I'm not.

629
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:22,917
I'm visualizing what I'm gonna do.

630
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,351
'Cause you if you don't want to do this,

631
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:25,719
there's no shame in it.

632
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:28,622
There would be immense shame in it.

633
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:39,867
(buzzer rings)

634
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:46,273
What the hell are you doing here?

635
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:48,008
We have unfinished business.

636
00:30:48,043 --> 00:30:49,577
Listen, if you think you're
gonna tell my parents...

637
00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:51,712
- (grunts)
- Are you crazy?!

638
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:54,615
Don't talk about my mother!

639
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,617
ALFRED: Master Bruce!

640
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,358
Point well made, I think.

641
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:07,128
You all right, mate? Any broken bones?

642
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:08,696
He-he tried to kill me!

643
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,399
That's right. He did.

644
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,466
He tried to kill you.

645
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:16,237
Just you remember that
next time you see him.

646
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:18,072
And you remember

647
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:20,474
that I let him try.

648
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:24,779
Now, let's get some ice on those knuckles.

649
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:28,249
What do you fancy for your dinner?

650
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:30,651
- Pizza.
- Pizza?

651
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:33,888
Superb choice, Master Bruce.

652
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:38,359
Jim, where the hell are you?
My list crapped out. Call me.

653
00:31:38,393 --> 00:31:40,561
Nygma, Gordon hasn't called in, has he?

654
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:44,465
No. But if the detective
becomes the mystery...

655
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:50,004
<i>SIONIS (over loudspeaker): Wake up.</i>

656
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,106
<i>Detective Gordon?</i>

657
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,908
<i>Wake up!</i>

658
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:57,178
<i>So, three of you</i>

659
00:31:57,212 --> 00:32:00,648
<i>applied for a position at my firm.</i>

660
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:03,351
<i>I explained then</i>

661
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,953
<i>you can use anything here as a weapon</i>

662
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:08,489
<i>and the last man standing gets the job.</i>

663
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:09,857
<i>However...</i>

664
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,993
<i>tonight is special.</i>

665
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:15,830
<i>You see the man without the mask?</i>

666
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:18,799
<i>Whoever kills him... is the victor.</i>

667
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:22,003
Listen to me. I'm a cop.

668
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:24,705
So far, none of you have broken any laws.

669
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,307
<i>Let the games...</i>

670
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,342
<i>- begin.
- (bell rings)</i>

671
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:30,678
One last chance!

672
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:33,180
- Nobody move!
- Oh.

673
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:35,516
And I'll throw in a
million-dollar signing bonus.

674
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,853
Ah, crap.

675
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,244
Alvarez.

676
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,742
I need help checking these addresses.

677
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:48,963
Gordon might be in trouble.

678
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:50,231
Busy.

679
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:51,932
I'm gonna remember that
next time your wife calls,

680
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:53,968
asking where you are, you putz.

681
00:32:58,006 --> 00:32:59,440
Collins.

682
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:01,475
Listen up, man, can I have some help?

683
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,015
Now, listen up, you sons of bitches!

684
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:11,919
So, you don't like Gordon!

685
00:33:11,953 --> 00:33:12,953
Fine.

686
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:14,955
He can be a total asshat.

687
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,325
But he is still a cop.

688
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,394
And not one of you, not one,
stood up when he needed it.

689
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:21,963
That ain't happening twice.

690
00:33:23,598 --> 00:33:25,299
I need help checking these addresses.

691
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:26,500
Now.

692
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,171
Give me a couple.

693
00:33:37,846 --> 00:33:39,847
Okay.

694
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:42,083
But you cover with my wife, right?

695
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:43,718
Yeah.

696
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:49,724
(grunting)

697
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:54,295
(cheering)

698
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:03,404
(gasping)

699
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:10,344
(exclaiming)

700
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,682
(grunting)

701
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:22,423
- (murmuring)
- It's over.

702
00:34:22,457 --> 00:34:24,458
(sword unsheathing)

703
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,498
I knew you had a killer in you.

704
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:32,433
(murmuring)

705
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:35,102
So...

706
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:37,038
where are your brother police?

707
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:40,942
- Did they abandon you?
- I don't need them.

708
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:53,120
(cheering)

709
00:34:57,626 --> 00:35:00,835
Seems I'll have to give
myself the million dollars.

710
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:30,758
(sword clatters on floor)

711
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,260
ESSEN: Jim?

712
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:33,794
- (footsteps approaching)
- Jim?!

713
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:38,165
Jim!

714
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:43,170
(groans)

715
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:54,215
Thanks.

716
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:56,717

You'd better have a good
reason for being here.

726
00:36:53,363 --> 00:36:55,397
Did you get what I asked for?

727
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:58,300
I want out.

728
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,670
No.

729
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:03,839
He's gonna find out.

730
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,842
Maybe not today, but soon.

731
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:08,377
Is it worth it?

732
00:37:08,411 --> 00:37:11,880
You are rich.

733
00:37:11,915 --> 00:37:13,882
People are afraid of you.

734
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:17,696
- Is that not enough?
- No.

735
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:20,130
It's not.

736
00:37:21,857 --> 00:37:23,976
I grew up not too far from here.

737
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:26,628
One bedroom, cold water.

738
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,297
Just me and my mama.

739
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,566
I used to sleep in a bed behind a curtain.

740
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,002
It's where I would hide
when she entertained men.

741
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:38,173
And that's where I was when he killed her.

742
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,275
One of Falcone's men.

743
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,412
Didn't like the service.

744
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:45,247
I hid there,

745
00:37:45,281 --> 00:37:49,184
silent, until morning.

746
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:52,221
With my mama two feet away from me.

747
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:54,423
That night, I made a promise.

748
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:56,725
To get revenge.

749
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,229
To never again be powerless.

750
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:05,601
<i>To never let any man, any man, be over me.</i>

751
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:09,138
This is about keeping that
promise to that little girl.

752
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:14,877
So, what's this about?

753
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,347
(chuckles under her breath)

754
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:19,882
This is a thread.

755
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:24,286
I pull this and Falcone comes undone.

756
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,098
You're scared.

757
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:40,102
But I won't let anything happen to you,

758
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:41,737
and that's a promise.

759
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,440
I want you to say...

760
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:46,608
"I believe you, Mama."

761
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:50,112
I believe you, Mama.

762
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:53,782
That's my girl.

763
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:01,123
OSWALD: The thing is, when I had your job,

764
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:03,859
had someone asked me, "What
is Miss Mooney's secret?"

765
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:06,161
I could've answered.

766
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:09,331
Ooh.

767
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:11,166
(chuckles)

768
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:14,770
Timothy...

769
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:17,640
I think you're holding back on me.

770
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:20,175
Okay, I...

771
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,810
I might've heard her with Butch.

772
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:23,712
Talking about what? Whom?

773
00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:26,348
Fal... Falcone.

774
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:28,117
She said, "Our...

775
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:30,119
our friend with Falcone."

776
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:31,520
That's it.

777
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:33,789
She was whispering. Please.

778
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:36,125
She has someone close to Falcone.

779
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:39,328
Of course.

780
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,466
Thank you.

781
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:49,571
No one can find the body.

782
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:51,507
We are at peace after all.

783
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,642
No! No, please!

784
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:55,744
No! No...!

785
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:58,280
(distant siren wailing)

786
00:39:58,315 --> 00:39:59,815
(low chatter)

787
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:03,752
BULLOCK: Alvarez and Collins
are bringing in Sionis' minions.

788
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:06,288
Pansies tried to rabbit when
they saw you cuffing their boss.

789
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:07,323
You okay?

790
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,060
Essen told me you made a speech.

791
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:12,761
I wouldn't call it a speech.

792
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,663
Said you called me an asshat.

793
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,765
I did call you that.

794
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,535
Thank you.

795
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:21,537
For having my back.

796
00:40:21,571 --> 00:40:24,607
Now and before.

797
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:26,909
Just try not to be such a pain in the neck.

798
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:28,577
Makes my day harder.

799
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:31,680
You know, you were wrong.

800
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:33,782
What you said earlier.

801
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:36,252
It's not that I love fighting.

802
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:39,455
But I'm not afraid to, either.

803
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:41,857
And if we don't fight
for this city, who will?

804
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:47,296
I'm not gonna stop, Harvey.

805
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,033
Falcone, the Mayor, every
cop I know that's dirty,

806
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:52,368
I'm gonna get them.

807
00:40:54,804 --> 00:40:57,740
You should know that.

808
00:40:57,774 --> 00:40:59,775
Go home, Jim.

809
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:12,221
You were listening tonight, weren't you?

810
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:15,291
You gonna get in trouble, old woman.

811
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:18,727
Heard you telling that girl stories.

812
00:41:18,762 --> 00:41:23,766
A lie with a heart of
truth is a powerful thing.

813
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,801
Go on, it's late.

814
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:39,014
(phone rings)

815
00:41:51,494 --> 00:41:53,462
(answering machine beeps)

816
00:41:53,496 --> 00:41:56,832
Hey, it's me. I'm coming home soon.

817
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:59,101
Everything is gonna be better, I promise.

818
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:01,103
I love you.

819
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,706
Hey, Gordon. Got a minute?

820
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,707
Can it wait?

821
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:06,342
Kind of on my way out of here.

822
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:08,277
Some unis brought in a perp.

823
00:42:08,311 --> 00:42:09,445
Claims to know you.

824
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:11,113
Oh, yeah? What's the charge?

825
00:42:11,147 --> 00:42:13,115
B and E, some fancy store uptown.

826
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:14,683
Pretty professional job.

827
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:15,951
Kid didn't even trip the alarm.

828
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:17,953
Kid?

829
00:42:17,988 --> 00:42:20,589
- Boy or girl?
- Girl.

830
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,825
Said to ask if you been
down any sewers lately.

831
00:42:28,198 --> 00:42:31,100
Hey, Detective.

832
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,235
Miss me?

833
00:42:40,744 --> 00:42:43,579
I enjoyed it.

834
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:45,681
I enjoyed hurting him.

835
00:42:45,715 --> 00:42:47,716
Of course you did.

836
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:53,722
He deserved it.

837
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:56,759
I'm so angry all the time.

838
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:00,229
Will that ever go away?

839
00:43:00,263 --> 00:43:03,332
That I don't know.

840
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:06,368
Alfred...

841
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:11,073
can you teach me how to fight?

842
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:19,949
Yes, Master Bruce.

843
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:22,117
Yes, I can.

844
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:26,909
