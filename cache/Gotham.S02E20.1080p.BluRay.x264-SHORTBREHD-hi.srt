Aren't you?

162
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,481
I am your guardian, Master Bruce.

163
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,234
And it's my job to protect you.

164
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,112
Is it your job to watch me sit on my hands
and do nothing?

165
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,951
Alfred, please.

166

00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:56,495

- (HONKING)

171
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,800

- Yeah, all right, mate. Keep...

172
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,886
Just keep your bloody hair on.

173
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,430
Don't go, baby, come on.
Let's talk about this, huh?

174
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,558
- Is this because I kicked Barbara out?
- Just let me go, Butch.

175
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,102
Come on, I'll do whatever you want.
(STUTTERS) I'll eat more fruit.

176
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,104
I'll work on the snoring.

BUTCH: Seriously?
How do people keep getting in here?

179
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,401
Do I have no security at all?

180
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,736
Why the rush?

181
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,572
- Just time to move on.
- Oh, yeah, is that it?

182
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,116
Or are you worried
Galavan's coming after you, too?

183
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,743
Don't worry, Butch.

184
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,286
It's not about you.

185
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,497
She's just scared of her brother.

186
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,583
Come on, help me find him.

187
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,795
You two hardly left on the best of terms.

188
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,421
Must have been weird
to see your dead brother

189
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,216
show up dressed like a ninja
from Medieval Times.

190
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,018
That thing that stabbed your captain
last night?

191
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,437
It wasn't my brother.

192
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:07,024
That was a 300-year-old
assassin called Azrael.

193
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:09,735
Azrael?

194
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,239
That image I saw on the news, his clothes,
the way he moved...

195
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,615
It was Azrael.

196
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,411
A mythical figure worshipped by the monks
who raised my brother.

197
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,374
A cold-hearted killing machine sent into
the night to kill his master's enemies.

198
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,876
And he wants you.

199
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,045
An ancient assassin?

200
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:29,964
A legend.

201
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,300
My family used to tell stories of him.

202
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,218
He was real?

203
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,720
Who knows?

204
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,055
It was 300 years ago. Probably, yes.

205
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,975
So your brother's gone nuts?

206
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,561
You tell me.

207
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:47,189
Theo convince you that he was Azrael
last night, or was he acting?

208
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,736
Someone got inside my brother's head.

209
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,196
It's not a safe place to be.

210
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,073
If you're right, I wanna find this person,

211
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,034
but first I have to find your brother.

212
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,411
So, help me.

213
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,539
If a search team finds him,
they're gonna kill him.

214
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,292
He is still your brother, after all.

215
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,252
He's blood.

216
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,301
The sword that was used last night?
The one that broke?

217
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,428
- It was fake.
- And you know this how?

218
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,513
The real one belonged to my grandfather.

219
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,017
He was an antiquities collector,
obsessed with Dumas history.

220
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,519
I saw it once. It was beautiful.

221
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,064
Forged by the monks themselves.

222
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,442
It's said to hold supernatural powers.

223
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,277
Theo knew this.

224
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,988
It's possible
he'll attempt to steal it back.

225
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,867
Does your grandfather still have it?

226
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,327
And where is he?

227
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,704
Gotham Cemetery.

228
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,458
He's been dead for 20 years.

229
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,796
But he was buried with his treasures.

230
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,437
Selina?

231
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,818
(SIGHS) What's up?

232
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,905
I remember you telling me you were
still feeding your friend's birds.

233
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,199
Someone has to.

234
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,119
Why are you here?

235
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,621
- Have you seen the news?
- Walking zombies in Gotham?

236
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,665
What's new?

237
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,501
Strange worked for my father
on a project designed to help people.

238
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,336
He perverted it
and now I believe he's found a way to--

239
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,712
Bring back the dead?

240
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,549
- A little far-fetched, don't you think?
- Perhaps.

241
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,635
But he's hiding something.
The police have failed to find out what.

242
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:41,846
I think I can do better.

243
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,681
That so?

244
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,644
When my father shut down Strange,
he was killed.

245
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,023
Selina, I just want the truth, that's all.

246
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,901
You just won't be happy
until you get yourself killed, will you?

247
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,696
Victor Fries and Theo Galavan
both went to Arkham as dead men.

248
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,030
Both returned.

249
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,533
- I don't care.
- So did your friend Bridgit.

250
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,038
Wait, they sent her to Arkham?

251
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,170
She may still be there right now.

252

<i>- Alive.</i>

253
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,553

254
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,638
<i>To run, but she didn't listen.</i>

255
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,559
It's my fault she's there.

256
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,812
Selina, we can put this right.

257
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,232
Strange was ready for the police.

258
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,234
He may even have been tipped off.

259
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,154
The only way we're gonna find out
what's really going on in there,

260
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,490
is if we break in ourselves.

261
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,658
Break in?

262
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,785
To Arkham?

263
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,331
A highly guarded place
that's packed with crazy people?

264
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,210
If that's too dangerous for you,
I'll just go myself.

265
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,422
I didn't say that.

266
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,511
Prisons are meant to stop people
from breaking out, not in. It can be done.

267
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,304
It's a looney bin.

268
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:06,805
Not a prison.

269
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,599
I know it can be done.

270
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,352
But I go alone.

271
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,479
- Why?
- (CHUCKLES)

272
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,190
I get caught, they'll just toss me out.

273
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,900
Nobody cares about me.

274
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,695
But you? They see you coming,
and they'll shut that whole thing down

275
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,322
quicker than you can say rat.

276
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,159
And then you'll never find out
what they've been up to.

277
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,038
That, or they'll just kill you.

00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,458
Besides,

279
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,294

The Dumas crypt.

282
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,401
Dozens of my relatives are buried here.

283
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,071
So, does someone have a key?

284
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,661
