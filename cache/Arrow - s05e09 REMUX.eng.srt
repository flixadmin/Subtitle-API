1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,588
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:07,633
You're all this city has,
so stop being so hard on yourself.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,261
That notebook belonged to my father.

4
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,638
I thought that it was my way
to save the city.

5
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,449
We all want to believe
in Oliver's crusade,

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,553
but I'm pissed that the guy

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,995
who only shares the important information
with his inner circle

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,270
used to be a serial killer.

9
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:22,064
For a long time, I blamed you
for my parents dying.

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,193
Knowing all this
doesn't make it any easier.

11
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:32,158
Nobody followed me.
They don't suspect a thing.

12
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,305
I brought what you asked for.

13
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,479
Addresses are on the back.

14
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,571
I took those last two myself.

15
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,082
What, that's it? We had a deal.

16
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,293
I get you the intel, I get to be there
when you take him down.

17
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:27,213
You think
you can make demands of me?

18
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,173
No.

19
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,051
No, of course not. I know he's your Kill,

20
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,638
but I want to watch him die.

21
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,351
You haven't been listening.
I'm not going to kill him.

22
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,234
I'm gonna make him wish he was dead.

23
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,624
This is incredible, Speedy.

24
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,043
I can't believe you pulled it off,
especially after...

25
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:10,089
Oh, I thought we decided
not to talk about aliens anymore?

26
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,633
- Right.
- And besides, how can you be so surprised?

27
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,927
I'm Moira Queen's daughter,
and that means

28
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,346
throwing a killer Christmas party
is in my blood.

29
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,366
Mom and Dad would be very
proud of you, Speedy.

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,392
Me? Come on, you're the Mayor.

31
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,870
They'd be so happy, they wouldn't know
what to do with themselves.

32
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,731
Are you all right? Because,
what the Dominators showed us,

33
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,317
it was a little like losing them
all over again.

34
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,820
They didn't take anything away from me,
they gave me something.

35
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,906
They reminded me how lucky I am
to be a part of this family

36
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,326
and to have you as my brother.

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,827
How sweet.

38
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,583
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, it's fine.

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,390
I know, I know, I already broke
the first rule of being a good date

40
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,380
by not arriving with you,
but I had a crushing deadline.

41
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,067
Glamorous life of a journalist, right?

42
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,651
The dress that you're wearing
makes up for it.

43
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,635
_I...

44
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,096
You're his... His date?

45
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,723
Yeah.

46
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,433
Yeah, just... Just for this party.

47
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,561
Which, by the way,
is a definite improvement

48
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,731
over the previous Mayor's holiday bash.
Nicely done.

49
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,733
Thanks. It's really great to know

50
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,986
that this administration can do,
like, one thing right.

51
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,279
- Be nice, Thea.
- No,

52
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,782
I'm gonna go get a drink now,
talk to you later.

53
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:23,037
She's... I mean,
she's just being protective.

54
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,082
Mmm. To be fair,
I didn't make the best first impression.

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,751
Well, I of all people understand
that sometimes doing your job

56
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,002
means pissing people off.

57
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,645
It just means that you're doing it well.

58
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,840
I see you've reclaimed your optimism.

59
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,342
Oh, thanks to you.

60
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,803
Cheers.

61
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,563
- Is that your second champagne?
- Third.

62
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,483
Are you really that nervous
to finally introduce me to your friends?

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,153
I just want them to love you
as much as I I...

64
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,073
like you.

65
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,244
These are my friends.

66
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,246
Guys, this is my Malone boyfriend.

67
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,083
This is Billy Malone,
my boy... Boyfriend.

68
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,004
I'm Curtis, by the way,

69
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,817
the guy awkwardly standing in front of you
waiting to be introduced.

70
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,069
- And this is my husband, Paul.
- Curtis is my best friend at work.

71
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,595
Well, was, until I was fired
from my own company. Cheers.

72
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,824
I thought you guys were working
on a startup together?

73
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,700
The one he's been putting
all the late nights in on?

74
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,005
The very late nights at the startup, yes!
We, it's just...

75
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,312
The startup is so fun, I mean,
we barely call it work,

76
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,522
because it's just like...

77
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,065
Whoo-hoo!

78
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,192
So much fun.

79
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,931
Who needs a fancy party at City Hall

80
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,620
when all the most important people
are right here?

81
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,541
Oh, shucks, John,
you're gonna make us all blush.

82
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,978
Do you think it's a fire hazard
to light the menorah in here?

83
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,187
I think the only hazard's gonna be

84
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,131
if you mess with that table setting
before Lyla gets back with the turkey.

85
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,050
Oh.

86
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,844
- What do you think?
- Nice.

87
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,013
- Cute kid.
- Yeah, he gets it from his mom.

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,306
I figured.

89
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,644
Must be weird
finding out about Flashpoint.

90
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,851
Yeah, I'm still not sure
how I feel about that, man.

91
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,057
I should be used to all the unusual things
around here,

92
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,429
especially after last week, but,

93
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,613
I could never imagine a daughter.

94
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,239
Cool car!

95
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,868
Being a father's
the best thing in the world,

96
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:27,912
especially around the holidays.

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,280
Sounds like you know something
about kids, you got any?

98
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,834
Sorry, I'm late, but I come bearing gifts.

99
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,062
We had this tradition in my family
where we all open our presents

100
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,881
at the exact same time.

101
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:42,259
Since you guys are the only family I have,
I figured I'd try it with you.

102
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,594
Thanks.

103
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,390
Were you even listening to the rules?

104
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,352
I don't like rules, or listening.

105
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,564
This is dope, Evie!

106
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,274
Wow.

107
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,360
Thanks, Evelyn, it's very sweet.

108
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,528
You're welcome.

109
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,072
You know, the best part is,
this is gonna piss Oliver off

110
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:06,116
when we hang these up all over the place.

111
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,036
Happy Holidays, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.

112
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,623
My favorite Christmas movie is Die Hard.

113
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:19,004
It's true. My second favorite
Christmas movie is It's a Wonderful Life.

114
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:24,843
And I was very lucky to be able to
rewatch that movie last week.

115
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,973
It reminded me how much work
I still have to do,

116
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,475
how much work all of us still have to do,

117
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,645
and it inspired me to recommit myself

118
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,607
to making our city, our home,

119
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,735
a better and safer place. Cheers.

120
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,741
Great speech.

121
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,118
Uh...

122
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,662
What she said.

123
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,248
Uh, Felicity, right?

124
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,375
Yeah, you must be the super-hot reporter.

125
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,043
Um, Thank you.

126
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,838
What I meant to say was, this is my,
this is my boyfriend, Billy.

127
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,816
It's nice to see you again, Mayor Queen.

128
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,133
Billy, please call me Oliver.

129
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,887
Hey, um, we're actually gonna head out.

130
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,848
- Everything all right?
- It will be.

131
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,475
I think.

132
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,691
So, you guys want to go on a double date
some time, or...

133
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,277
No. Cool.

134
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,910
Paul! Paul, come on!

135
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,764
Tell me the truth. All those nights
you said you were with Felicity,

136
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,373
- what have you been doing?
- Nothing.

137
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,667
- Are you seeing someone?
- Baby, of course not!

138
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,961
- I don't believe you.
- Let me explain.

139
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:51,847
Curtis!

140
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,268
Get out of here, run!

141
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,943
No!

142
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,159
Do what you want to me,
just leave him alone.

143
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,752
No!

144
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,426
Help! Somebody help us!

145
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,387
Please! Help!

146
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,854
- Hey.
- How you feeling?

147
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,108
Like someone threw a throwing star at me,

148
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,611
kicked me down a flight of steps,
and knocked me out.

149
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,615
The doctor said you're not
supposed to sit up.

150
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,119
Yeah, well, the doctor
doesn't know me that well.

151
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,329
Not sure I do anymore, either.

152
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,248
I can explain everything.

153
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,376
Great. Let's start with
where you learned to fight like that.

154
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:06,296
Fight like what? In case you
hadn't noticed, I lost. Badly.

155
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,424
You think I don't know who
that was, Curtis?

156
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,094
That was the Throwing Star Killer.
He's murdered people.

157
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,806
And yet somehow, you're still alive.
How is that even possible?

158
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,808
Oh, my God, Curtis, are you all right?

159
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,060
I'm great. Just a little banged up,

160
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,980
like I always am when I get into
street fights with muggers.

161
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,315
It wasn't a mugger,
it was a serial killer,

162
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,817
the Throwing Star Killer.

163
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,171
I thought you had the Anti-Crime Unit
taking care of this.

164
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:34,074
We do, Paul, and-and we're working
very hard to catch him. I promise.

165
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,760
Actually, your statement
could really help.

166
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,104
Detective Malone is just outside,

167
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,242
if you'd feel comfortable answering
a few questions?

168
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,082
It's all right, Paul.

169
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,672
Prometheus.

170
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,593
He attacked me, as well "me."

171
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,052
So he knows you're Mr. Terrific.

172
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,513
Yeah. Which means he probably knows...

173
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,432
He knows that I'm the Green Arrow.

174
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,147
If you remember anything else
that could help us, give me a call.

175
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,315
My cell's on there, too.

176
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,524
Thank you, Detective.

177
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,239
I can't believe that this is happening.

178
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,449
Can't you?

179
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,256
You think I haven't figured out
that the tall guy in the black mask

180
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,928
rolling with the Green Arrow is Curtis?

181
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,358
Promise me you didn't tell Paul.

182
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,999
No, but right now,
I'm more worried about you.

183
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,603
If Prometheus is targeting the people
working with the Green Arrow...

184
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,628
I'll be fine.

185
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,731
And I'll feel better if you're
staying at my place

186
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,174
at least until we track down Prometheus.

187
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,301
- We?
- It's my job, Felicity.

188
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,529
If there's a killer out there,
I'm gonna stop him,

189
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,889
especially if he's a threat
to someone I care about.

190
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,183
Billy. Billy!

191
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,857
Everything all right?

192
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:52,569
No. The doctor was speaking with Curtis,
he's gonna be fine,

193
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,856
but they found a drug in his system
called Dycloserol.

194
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,740
No, never heard of it.

195
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,992
But you have, what is it?

196
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,749
Well, it's gonna take some adjusting,

197
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,253
not trying to catch you
giving me the slip.

198
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,739
I grabbed some Big Belly on the way in,
hope you're hungry.

199
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,758
I lost my appetite. Come look at this.

200
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,763
TB outbreak in Lamb Valley?
Since when?

201
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,765
Since this guy got greedy.

202
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,409
That's one smug-looking
son of a bitch.

203
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,519
Justin Claybourne owns
Claybourne Pharmaceuticals

204
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,648
that recently acquired the rights
to this drug, Dycloserol,

205
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,276
which fights this particular strain of TB.

206
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,087
Let me guess,
as soon as the outbreak started,

207
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,112
he jacked up the prices.

208
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,447
Price went from $10 a pill
to $1,000 overnight.

209
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,075
The people of Lamb Valley,
they're working class,

210
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,743
low income, they can't afford this.

211
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,230
It's disgusting, but not illegal.

212
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,374
Claybourne is on the list.
I'm not worried about illegal.

213
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,793
Just because your father
wrote down his name?

214
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,422
My father explained this list.
These are terrible people.

215
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,941
How would you know that?
I thought he was dead.

216
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,759
I am gonna make sure that Claybourne
stops gouging people.

217
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,366
And what if he refuses to cooperate?

218
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,430
You ask that like he has a choice.

219
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,065
After what seems like a respite
from the serial murders weeks ago,

220
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,359
the Throwing Star Killer strikes again.

221
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,862
Another attack by the Throwing Star Killer

222
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,489
disrupted the annual holiday party
at City Hall.

223
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,993
Maybe we should change
the security codes on the bunker.

224
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,495
Yeah, we did that over an hour ago.

225
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,080
All the good that'll do.

226
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,290
Rene's right.

227
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,208
And you know
how much she hates saying that.

228
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,878
If Prometheus knows who Curtis is,
he knows who we all are.

229
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,505
Maybe Barry could do that
Flashpoint thing again?

230
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,216
Yeah, he does that,
Digg might end up with five kids.

231
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,927
Stuff makes my brain hurt.

232
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,219
How's Curtis?

233
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,387
He's gonna be fine.

234
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,594
Better, now that
the Dycloserol's out of his system.

235
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,720
Prometheus injected him with it
when he attacked him.

236
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,810
Dycloserol. Now, why does that
ring a bell?

237
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,522
Because four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne,

238
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,525
the CEO of the pharmaceutical company
that manufactures it.

239
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,212
And by took him down, you mean killed.

240
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,278
- Right?
- Yeah.

241
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,325
After Claybourne's death,
his company went down,

242
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,324
he had no other family members
to leave it to.

243
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,285
Still, Prometheus using Dycloserol
four years after the fact

244
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,453
can't be a coincidence.

245
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,538
- It does send a message.
- What message?

246
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,874
I'm alive and I'm coming after you.

247
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,751
You think Prometheus is Justin Claybourne?

248
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,044
How's that possible?

249
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,731
Well, in our town, people who are dead
turn out to be secretly alive

250
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,756
almost every Wednesday.

251
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,003
Case in point, the old Claybourne
manufacturing plant

252
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,570
reports heavy usage of water and power
over the last few months.

253
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,929
Doesn't mean it's Claybourne.

254
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,807
Worth checking out. Suit up.

255
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,025
- We're in.
- Copy.

256
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,907
Ragman, are you in position?

257
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,743
If he's in there, he's not getting out.

258
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,287
Nobody makes a move
until I give the order.

259
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,831
Got it.

260
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,250
Hey, he said don't make a move.

261
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,460
Yeah, but he knows I never listen to him.

262
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,260
That could be something.

263
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,137
You keep moving, I'll check it out.

264
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,016
- Overwatch.
- Already on it.

265
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,147
Tracking the transmission
from the sensors now.

266
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,981
- That was fast.
- No, that was impossible.

267
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,232
He's letting me in.

268
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,039
No, you need to pull back, it's not safe.

269
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,071
Five years and he still doesn't listen.

270
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:52,142
Justin Claybourne,
you have failed this city.

271
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,978
Not as badly as you have, Mr. Queen.

272
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,219
Spartan, go upstairs,
Green Arrow needs your help.

273
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,246
Me and Artemis are on the stairwell,
we can get there faster.

274
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,332
You ready for a rematch with this bitch?

275
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,335
More than. Prometheus doesn't scare me.

276
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,704
I've been waiting four years for this.

277
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,292
Let him go, you son of a bitch.

278
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,337
What the...

279
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,717
Evelyn?

280
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,638
- Why?
- Because you're not a hero,

281
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,890
you're a fraud.

282
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,394
This city needs to be saved from you.

283
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,407
Where's Prometheus?

284
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,244
He's gone with Evelyn.

285
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,829
He took her?

286
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,747
He's working with her.

287
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,630
- Stuff from the plant.
- Can you put it over there?

288
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,027
- Where's Oliver?
- He's with Thea, helping her pack.

289
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,094
He wants her to stay here.

290
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,430
Lyla and J.J.
are at a A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

291
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,783
Give me the names and socials
of the people you care about,

292
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,447
I'll make sure they get to the safehouse.

293
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,146
Wait. What other secret information could
Evelyn have told Prometheus about us?

294
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,565
We've got to assume everything.
No one is safe.

295
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,526
This is on me. I should've done
a better job at vetting her.

296
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,694
This wasn't your fault.

297
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,405
Seriously. No one
could've seen this coming.

298
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,175
We don't have time
to play the blame game.

299
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,279
We have to find Claybourne.

300
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,566
We were hoping there was
something here that could help.

301
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,079
- Like ashes?
- Those look like crematorium ashes.

302
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,040
Question is, whose?

303
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,461
Right. Well, I got to go, so you guys need
to run a DNA test

304
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,838
on these ashes and bone fragments,

305
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,717
find out who this person was and why
Prometheus is keeping their remains.

306
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,445
You guys know how to run
a DNA sequencer, right?

307
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,971
No, of course you don't.
Look, who I'm talking to.

308
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,908
Just put some of the bone fragments
onto the slide,

309
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,951
put it in the slot, and the machine
will do the rest. Got it?

310
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,310
Uh, sure.

311
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,686
I'll be back.

312
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,818
Did you get all that?

313
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,820
You're the smart one, remember?

314
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:00,080
Hey. I thought you were gonna
let the Green Arrow handle this.

315
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,832
No, I'm pretty sure my exact words were,

316
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,039
"If there's a killer out there,
I'm gonna stop him."

317
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,504
Yeah, I was just hoping
that was boyfriend posturing.

318
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:12,092
I cross-referenced Curtis'
medical records with old SCPD case files.

319
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,761
Prometheus injected him with Dycloserol,

320
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,639
- which was manufactured at the Clay...
- Claybourne Pharmaceuticals

321
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,849
and their plant just came online.

322
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,102
Yeah, I know.

323
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,022
How did you know?

324
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,985
Because the Green Arrow hit it already.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,546
And we already got everything
that there is to get there.

326
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,571
Why didn't you tell me?

327
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,175
Remember that part about me
not wanting you to work on this case?

328
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,493
Yeah, I'm a cop, Felicity, this is my job.

329
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,831
Yeah, and Prometheus' job is killing cops,
SO you need to stay away.

330
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,083
Hey, if you're not gonna do it
for yourself,

331
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,376
can you do it for me?

332
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,795
I'm not letting this go.

333
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,089
Felicity, you know how I feel about you,

334
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,842
but I have to be true to who I am.

335
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,766
I can't believe it.

336
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,560
Evelyn was playing us this whole time?

337
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:04,728
Not the whole time.

338
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,414
Rene thinks she went dark
after we all found out about The Hood.

339
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,239
You know, I always thought she had
a sort of Children of the Corn vibe.

340
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,652
Anyway, I was just calling
to give you the heads-up.

341
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:13,945
Watch your back.

342
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,655
Will do. Thanks, Rory.

343
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,827
Hey, baby, what's going on?
Were you able to find me that ice cream?

344
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,120
- Who's Rory?
- Oh...

345
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,874
Oh, Rory. He's a friend of mine
from my Palmer Tech days.

346
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,169
He saw what happened on the news
and was just checking in on me.

347
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,171
You're the world's worst liar, Curtis.

348
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,232
It's one of the reasons I married you.

349
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,382
What're you talking about?

350
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,217
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

351
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,555
The late nights out, canceled dinners,

352
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,640
the inexplicable accidents.

353
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,934
I can't do this anymore.

354
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,065
You have to tell me what's going on.

355
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,609
How do I put this?

356
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,198
I work with the Green Arrow.

357
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,369
You? You work with the Green Arrow?

358
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,912
Yeah.

359
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,665
- Come on.
- It's not impossible.

360
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,353
You're helping the guy who is going around
putting arrows into people?

361
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,879
Well, yeah, but only bad people,

362
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,940
and only the ones who really
try to put up a fight.

363
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,467
Most guys, we just try to send to jail.

364
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,968
This is completely insane.

365
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,428
Yes, I know that,

366
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,077
but, you know, when you're out there
doing it, it's different.

367
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,017
It feels amazing.

368
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,520
Empowering.

369
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,523
Almost a little inspiring.

370
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,900
You lied to me.

371
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,653
- For months.
- To keep you safe.

372
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,489
To keep me safe? And what about you?

373
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,991
You've been hurt how many times
since you started this?

374
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,494
- Actually lost track.
- Which is why you need to stop.

375
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,830
- Stop what?
- This, being a vigilante.

376
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,123
I made a commitment.

377
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,791
You made one to me, too.

378
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,919
Last time I checked, our vows
didn't include me worrying every night

379
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:56,548
about whether or not you were gonna
make it home alive the next morning.

380
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,344
Paul...

381
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,723
You can be a vigilante,
or you can be married to me,

382
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,268
but you can't do both.

383
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,396
I can't do both.

384
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,899
Paul, wait...

385
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,700
Think in Flashpoint, I maybe dated her
back in high school?

386
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,536
It's an alternate timeline,
not an alternate reality.

387
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,847
What's that supposed to mean?

388
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,708
It means, and no offense,
but in a multiverse of possibilities,

389
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,252
there's no world where Thea Queen
goes out with...

390
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,004
You know, someone like you.

391
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,940
What's that supposed to mean,
"someone like me"?

392
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,883
It means you're not my type.

393
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,718
- Any news?
- Nothing.

394
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,029
If Claybourne's out there,
he's not showing his face.

395
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,056
Well, maybe his dead friend
will give us some information.

396
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,404
- You get the sequencer working?
- I think?

397
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,644
Oh, good work!
You got the sequencer working.

398
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,273
Great. So whose ashes
was Claybourne keeping as a souvenir?

399
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,400
Claybourne's.

400
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,278
The ashes are his.

401
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,532
So if Claybourne isn't Prometheus, who is?

402
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,419
Thanks to the influx of cash
from our Dycloserol acquisition,

403
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:20,089
our R & D pipeline's fully funded
for the next two years.

404
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,176
These are exciting times, gentlemen,
and it's just the beginning.

405
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,945
Justin Claybourne,
you have failed this city.

406
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,616
I think you got the wrong guy, pal.
My company makes drugs that help people.

407
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,576
Not the people in Lamb Valley.

408
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,471
It's not my problem if some people
can't afford it.

409
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,871
It is now.

410
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:59,045
Your days of holding
this city's health hostage are over.

411
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,421
Do you understand me?

412
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,173
Okay, okay, yes!

413
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,804
You have until 11:00 p.m. tomorrow
to make this right.

414
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,182
And what happens if I don't?

415
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,813
I'll aim higher.

416
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,036
Jackpot.

417
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,021
SCPD! Show yourself!

418
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,005
Cute baby.

419
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,453
Cute, yeah, but why would your boyfriend
send this to you?

420
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,278
That is what I'm trying to figure out.
That, and why men don't listen

421
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,238
when you specifically tell them
not to do something.

422
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,388
Why don't you guys listen?

423
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,390
Okay,
did you ask him why he sent it?

424
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,893
Yeah, texted him right back, no reply.
I'm kinda worried.

425
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,330
Billy says he found it at
the Claybourne manufacturing plant?

426
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,397
Yeah, according to the
GPS tag on his text.

427
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,067
Why would he send this photo?
What's the relevance?

428
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,377
It's what's I'm trying to figure out.

429
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,446
Right after I try to figure out
why men don't listen.

430
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:52,408
This is so strange. First human remains,
now baby pictures?

431
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,577
Prometheus, he's...

432
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,722
He's leaving a trail of breadcrumbs
for me to follow.

433
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,266
- Try facial recognition?
- Facial recog isn't exactly baby friendly.

434
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,085
Well, try it anyways,
it's kitchen sink time, and

435
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,504
we don't listen because we're stubborn.

436
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,839
Yeah, tell us something we don't know.

437
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,055
Take it Claybourne wasn't impressed
with your Robin Hood act.

438
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,891
No, he wasn't.
So I did some more digging.

439
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,103
Claybourne didn't just price gouge
with his drug, he created the epidemic.

440
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,939
He is connected to something called
the AK Desmond Group.

441
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,941
They are black marketeers

442
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,944
who specialize in creating bioweapons.

443
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,988
What do you think they've
been working on?

444
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,700
Weaponized tuberculosis.

445
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,451
He created the marketplace, Diggle,

446
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,787
and he didn't care
who died in the process.

447
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,998
And now you're gonna Kill him.

448
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,644
How can you read what's in that folder
and have a problem with that?

449
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,771
Have you thought about the ramifications
of your actions?

450
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,463
Of actually crossing names off a list?

451
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,382
Of being judge, jury, and executioner?

452
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,801
Men like Claybourne buy judges,

453
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,595
they buy juries.
The law doesn't apply to them.

454
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,724
- I'm not saying you don't do some good!
- So what are you saying?

455
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,890
What I'm saying is that
maybe one day, your actions

456
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,770
might have some unintended consequences.

457
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,447
Got your 911.

458
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,074
911 might've been
understating things a bit.

459
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,494
Detective Malone's been abducted.
ACU thinks by Prometheus.

460
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:19,662
Why do they think that?

461
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,831
He went out to track down a lead,
didn't come back.

462
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,168
He's missed his last three call-ins,
GPS on his phone's been switched off.

463
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,335
Do you think he's dead?

464
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,380
I think that every cop
that's crossed paths with Prometheus is.

465
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,091
Whether or not Billy's alive,
and believe me, I hope that he is,

466
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,761
the ACU and the SCPD,
they need instructions.

467
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,321
Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.

468
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,665
I'm not talking about a Be-On-the-Lookout-
Order, I'm talking about a shoot-to-kill.

469
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,068
I don't know
how that'll sit with the public.

470
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,519
I do. They'll love it.

471
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,355
You know why? Because they are as sick
and tired as I am

472
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,650
of watching this psycho murder Star City's
finest and get away with it.

473
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,657
Our cops need to know
that they can fight back,

474
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,988
they don't have to take it easy
on this guy anymore.

475
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,491
Okay, do it, but you pull in
every cop that you can find,

476
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,257
you tell them holiday hours are revoked.

477
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,577
Yeah.

478
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:08,878
Talk to me.

479
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,315
Facial recognition did kick back
something on the baby photo.

480
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,299
Court records
related to Claybourne's divorce.

481
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,218
The baby is Claybourne's son.

482
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,070
You told me that Claybourne
didn't have any kids.

483
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,031
Not of the legitimate variety.
But the divorce petition.

484
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,765
Claybourne's ex-wife filed says otherwise.

485
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,701
There's no record
of the kid's name in the files,

486
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:23,805
but due to the filing date,

487
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,686
he'd be about 30 today.

488
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,897
Just old enough to put on
a hood and a mask.

489
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,443
Old enough to want revenge on the man
who murdered his father.

490
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,239
Oliver, this isn't on you, man.

491
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,573
Yes, it is.

492
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,243
Yes, it is.

493
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,365
You warned me, John. You warned me that
there would be unintended consequences

494
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,998
and I didn't listen.

495
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,168
Prometheus surprised me
at the plant with a move,

496
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,087
a very specific, unique move.

497
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,259
It was taught to me by a woman
that I met in Russia.

498
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,385
You think you and Prometheus
had the same teacher?

499
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,614
I think what he's saying is,
Prometheus had over four years

500
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:01,973
to learn everything he does.

501
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,307
Right.

502
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,520
Felicity, Billy has gone missing.

503
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,022
Chase thinks that it's Prometheus.
We alerted the police.

504
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,441
We've ordered them to shoot
Prometheus on sight.

505
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,944
Now, we are gonna find Billy,

506
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:18,447
we are gonna bring him back to you,
I promise,

507
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,261
Let's call Rory and Rene,
we're gonna hit the streets.

508
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,453
If you learn anything, contact me.

509
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,123
Do not engage this enemy
under any circumstances.

510
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,465
I thought you weren't suiting up anymore.

511
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,426
Yeah, well, it's Felicity's boyfriend.

512
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:39,927
I figured, all hands.

513
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,014
Plus, John told me about Claybourne,
and four years ago.

514
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,142
Speedy, are you about to tell me,
after everything that's happened,

515
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,812
and everything that's happening,
this isn't my fault?

516
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,149
Do you remember when Tommy and I
went to the US Open?

517
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,818
And you tried to land that helicopter
on the grounds

518
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,238
'cause Tommy wanted to impress
Maria Sharapova and then

519
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,365
made Dad blow that huge acquisitions deal?

520
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,885
Because he had to bail me out, yeah.

521
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,828
Pretty sure that was the most disappointed
he's ever been in you.

522
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,663
I'm not seeing the relevance, Speedy.

523
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,709
My point is, Dad wouldn't be disappointed
in who you've become.

524
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,878
It's like you were saying
at that Christmas party,

525
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,922
Mom and Dad would be proud.

526
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,673
They might not be proud if they knew

527
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,468
that I created something like Prometheus.

528
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,846
There're two types of every legacy,

529
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,016
two versions of what we leave behind.

530
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,560
There's the good and then the bad.

531
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,689
You just really have a lousy habit
of focusing only on the bad.

532
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,990
Why are you not still in the hospital?

533
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,993
Rory called me,

534
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,287
told me what happened to Billy.

535
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,581
There's no way I'm sitting this out.

536
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,333
Wow, what did Paul have to say?

537
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,877
Actually, he made it pretty easy.

538
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,631
Give up the team or give up him.

539
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,810
Well, he clearly
doesn't know you very well.

540
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:01,968
What do you mean?

541
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,303
Well, you don't really respond well
to ultimatums.

542
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,389
He just doesn't get it.

543
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,558
I have to do this no matter what.

544
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,478
I have to be true to who I am.

545
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,486
- A singing telegram? Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

546
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:23,090
My friend loves them and I thought
that I would surprise her.

547
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,573
- Her?
- Just a friend.

548
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,993
But I don't know
where her office buildings are.

549
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,620
She works at the AK Desmond Group...

550
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,498
AK Desmond Group. Hmm.

551
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,227
They're not on the Internet,
like, at all, that's really weird.

552
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:37,753
- Super weird.
- All right, well, lucky for you,

553
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,088
there is the Internet

554
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,257
and then there is the "Internet."

555
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:44,111
And these magic fingers can pull things
out of it, even Google can't find.

556
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,846
Not that I believe in magic.

557
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:50,474
Or, that I have magic fingers. I just,
I'm really good at, I'm... I can...

558
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,643
Felicity? Please.

559
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,437
Right. Uh...

560
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:00,609
Mmm-hmm. 1852.

561
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:04,113
West Maple, 30th Floor.

562
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:05,990
- Great.
- What? There you go. Just...

563
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,909
It's... I meant to put it there,
just leave it there. It's...

564
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,119
Thank you.

565
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,954
You can just...

566
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,457
Felicity.

567
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,795
I do believe in magic.

568
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,801
- 1852.
- What?

569
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,513
1852. I just remembered something
I should've thought of a long time ago.

570
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,307
Thought of what?

571
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,660
- I think I know where Prometheus is.
- I'll call the team.

572
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,729
No, I created this situation,
I am going to deal with it alone.

573
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,831
Detective Malone.

574
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,491
Kill that Robin Hood son of a bitch!

575
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,264
You going to tell me again
I failed this city?

576
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:38,642
You infected the people
in Lamb Valley to turn a profit.

577
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,369
You want to make this city great again?

578
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,521
This is how.

579
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,107
With business, money.

580
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,109
You are sentencing

581
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,446
innocent families, children, to death.

582
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,615
Nobody cares about those people.

583
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,949
They're a blight.

584
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,745
And I'm just thinning the herd.

585
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,622
Soam I.

586
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,260
Did you hesitate at all
when you killed him?

587
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:16,805
Or was he just another name
you crossed off your list?

588
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,058
If you want revenge,

589
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,769
I'm right here.

590
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:26,148
This is about so much more than revenge.

591
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,006
I've studied you, Oliver Queen.

592
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,842
I know everything.

593
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,137
Who you love, who you trust,

594
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,223
who you've hurt.

595
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,018
Do you know how easy it was
to turn Evelyn against you?

596
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:07,189
How easy it will be to turn them all?

597
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:11,443
You're not a hero, you're a Killer,

598
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,363
and I'm going to show them that.

599
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,367
I'm going to show them
how everything you touch dies.

600
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:40,931
Four years I've waited,
to make you answer for your sins.

601
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,609
I told you, Oliver,

602
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,612
everything you touch dies.

603
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,593
What happened out there, man?

604
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,762
Did you kill Prometheus?

605
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,058
Billy. Did you find Billy?

606
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,312
Oliver?

607
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:35,944
Prometheus staged Billy.

608
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:39,698
He duct-taped his mouth,
and he put a weapon in his hand,

609
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,325
and he put him in his suit.

610
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,327
Prometheus knew...

611
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,096
- No, Oliver, don't.
- That I was there to kill him.

612
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,331
- Don't!
- And he'd calculated every moment.

613
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,416
Where is he?

614
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,127
Where is Billy?

615
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,383
I killed Billy.

616
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,178
I'm so sorry, Felicity.

617
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,847
I didn't know it was Billy,
I couldn't have known

618
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,309
that it was him. I could...
I couldn't have known.

619
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,230
Oh, my God.

620
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,652
This was Prometheus.

621
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:19,363
This was all him.

622
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,950
He's trying to prove to me
that everyone, I...

623
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:26,078
I come into contact with,
everyone close to me dies.

624
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:29,498
And he's right, he...

625
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,670
I think that, uh...

626
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,793
I think that all of you
should get as far away from me

627
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,093
as you possibly can.

628
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:56,692
Oliver, we are exactly
where we're supposed to be.

629
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:07,703
Okay.

630
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,789
I know I picked the worst

631
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,876
possible night to come home late again,

632
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,961
but you have to believe me,

633
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:20,507
this was a seriously terrible day.

634
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,721
Which is not going to get any better.

635
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,323
I'm going to my brother's house.

636
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,392
Come on, baby, it's been less than
24 hours since your ultimatum.

637
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,104
That's the thing, I never wanted to be
the guy that makes ultimatums.

638
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,315
You know what's funny?

639
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,776
You were coming home every night, late,

640
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:41,987
banged up all to hell,

641
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:45,741
and I've never seen you happier.

642
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,613
I don't want to be the one
to take you away from that.

643
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,079
You don't have to be.

644
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,500
But I also can't live knowing that

645
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,835
every time I see you might be the last.

646
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:00,130
I love you too much.

647
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,549
Paul, please.

648
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,009
I'm sorry.

649
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,970
Paul, please. Please.

650
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,130
- Hey.
- Johnny, I need you to come

651
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,197
to the safe house.

652
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,444
Something's wrong with J.J.

653
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,574
Lyla?

654
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,619
Lyla?

655
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,374
Oliver.

656
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,377
What time is it?

657
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,754
I'm sorry. I didn't know
where else to go.

658
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,256
You want to talk about it?

659
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:43,966
Not really.

660
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,801
Come on. Come in.

661
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,059
Can I get you a drink?

662
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,644
I could use a drink.

663
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,484
Why?

664
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:04,757
I thought things were getting better.

665
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,281
So did I, but, um...

666
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,493
That feeling never seems to last.

667
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,537
Thank you.

668
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,875
And, why do you think that is?

669
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,674
I was reunited with someone
from my past recently.

670
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,302
I knew their father.

671
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,347
And they told me

672
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:37,477
that I ruin the lives of everyone
that I come into contact with.

673
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,315
Doesn't matter who they are.

674
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,234
Doesn't matter how much I love them.

675
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,866
If I'm in their life,

676
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,119
that life turns to ash.

677
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,332
I think that's ridiculous.

678
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,169
Everyone's life touches everyone else's.

679
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:05,756
Sometimes the result is good,
and sometimes it's bad,

680
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,135
but you are only focusing on the bad.

681
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,472
My sister
said something very similar to that.

682
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,182
Well, she's a smart woman.

683
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,561
Look, no matter what's going on
in your life, Oliver,

684
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,938
shutting people out
is the last thing you should do.

685
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,942
Let me show you.

686
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,928
Hi, Ollie.

687
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,588
English - SDH
