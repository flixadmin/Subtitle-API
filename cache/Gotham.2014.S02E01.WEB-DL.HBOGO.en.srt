1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,400
<i>Last season, on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,920
It's in here. It's in this room.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,320
My father's secret,
it's in this room.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,240
Going after Loeb is suicide,
plain and simple.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,400
As usual, wrong place, wrong time.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,960
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,080
What's black and white
and red all over?

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,200
Stop talking like that.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,520
Why did you kill your mother, Dru?

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,960
Barbara, Jason Lennon
killed your parents.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,440
- You didn't kill them.
- Yes, I did.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,960
Goodbye, Fish!

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,160
I'm the king of Gotham!

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,280
What is it, do you think?

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Bloody hell.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,200
No, wait, wait, wait!

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,200
There must be a million possible
combinations, Master Bruce.

18
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,200
- Drink it all.
- Thank you, Master.

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Now go.

20
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,160
Come on, bro. Let's go. Let's go.

21
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I am Zaardon, the soul reaper!

22
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,280
Forward, slaves!
You cannot escape me!

23
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Sir, drop the guns!

24
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,720
- You! You!
- Please don't!

25
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,360
Your primitive weapons
cannot hurt me!

26
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,760
Prepare to die, insect!

27
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,280
Hey, listen. I don't wanna shoot you,
man, all right?

28
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,400
Too much paperwork.

29
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
So why don't you just
put the sword down?

30
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,920
Stay down. Relax.

31
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,440
Yo, Gordon. What's up? Busy shift?

32
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,800
- You're late.
- Jeez, relax, will you?

33
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,200
What's the matter with you, man?

34
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Hey!

35
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Bad idea.

36
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
How can this be?

37
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,960
Zaardon drank dragon's blood
from the master's chalice.

38
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,240
Zaardon? That's spelt how it sounds?

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
- Two A's.
- Close enough.

40
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,000
You dare send me to prison.

41
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,160
Oh, no, you're a cinch for Arkham.

42
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Hear me, Gordon.

43
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,200
You might have won this battle
but the war has just begun.

44
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,640
The master will unleash hell
upon you.

45
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,400
Dark days are coming.

46
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Thanks for the heads up.

47
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Ed.

48
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,760
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,520
<i>Officer Gordon, 236.1,</i>

50
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,840
<i>report to the captain's office
immediately.</i>

51
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm up. See you.

52
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,440
He's gone. Relax.

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,920
Holy moly. Look at you.

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Everyone's gonna think
you're going nuts.

55
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,880
I get nervous when you talk to me
with other people around like that.

56
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,600
Stop doing that.

57
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,800
- What?
- That.

58
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Copying me.

59
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,480
Dude, it's a mirror.
That's how they work.

60
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,840
You know what I think we need?

61
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,040
I think that we need
a little more fun.

62
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,640
Some romance.

63
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,640
Stop. I know where this is going.

64
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,960
I told you, leave Miss Kringle alone.

65
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
Imagine her in our arms.

66
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,720
Those big eyes looking up at us
and soft, trembling flesh.

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,040
Be quiet!

68
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
It's a simple question,
Officer Gordon.

69
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,720
Did you or did you not put your
hands on Officer Franks here?

70
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,200
Yes, I did.

71
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,360
From the first day on the job,

72
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,960
you have been an insubordinate
troublemaker.

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,720
I hope demotion to uniform duty
would suffice to make you quit.

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,920
It worked for your partner, Bullock.

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,480
However, you've now confessed
to violation of Section 12,

76
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,600
immediate dismissal is mandatory.

77
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,360
Commissioner, this is not just.

78
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,960
Officer Frank sustained no harm

79
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,600
and Officer Gordon showed
admirable restraint

80
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,560
in diffusing
a dangerous hostage situation.

81
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,360
Thank you so much for your input,
Captain.

82
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,640
The facts speak for themselves.

83
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,200
The facts say he deserves
commendation, not dismissal.

84
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,840
You're letting gutter politics...

85
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,160
That's enough, young lady.

86
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Take Officer...

87
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,400
Mr. Gordon's badge and gun.

88
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
That's an order.

89
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
All good.

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Let it go.

91
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Thanks, Loeb.

92
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,560
It's been an honor working for you.

93
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,240
This is all for the best, you know.

94
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,360
Some men
are just not meant to be cops.

95
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,040
I told you I'd break you.

96
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I will.

97
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,000
{\an5}What did you say to him?
Did you get mad?

98
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,920
{\an5}Well, I disagreed with his decision.

99
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,280
{\an5}Come on. You know I need the details.

100
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,040
{\an5}I said I'd break him.

101
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
Words to that effect.

102
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,440
{\an5}Hey, you went out with a bang.

103
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,320
{\an5}Maybe it's for the best.

104
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,800
{\an5}That's what Loeb said.

105
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,680
{\an5}I should have walked away.

106
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,440
I just hate to quit.

107
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,760
{\an5}You didn't quit. You were fired.
What can you do?

108
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,920
There's things I can do.

109
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,400
{\an5}I though you said you didn't have
any legal moves left.

110
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
I don't.

111
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,400
{\an5}You wanna be a cop so bad
you're willing to break the law.

112
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,240
{\an5}I'm willing to bend it a little,
yeah.

113
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
You're happy I got fired, huh?

114
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
{\an5}You got me.

115
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,080
Well, only because I know
that you'll never quit.

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
And I love that about you.

117
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,680
But they have you
directing traffic, Jim.

118
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Why keep beating your head
against the wall?

119
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm a cop, Lee.

120
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm a cop.

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,880
{\an5}Hi, gorgeous. I'm Dru.

122
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,120
Keep moving, Ginger.

123
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
{\an5}Just being polite.

124
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,960
- So, what are you in for?
- Killing my parents.

125
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
{\an5}Me too. Well, Mum, anyhow.

126
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,840
{\an5}Liberating, right?

127
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,440
{\an5}What a rush!

128
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
Yeah, alrighty then.

129
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,120
{\an5}I see the big handsome fellow
staring at you

130
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,640
{\an5}like you're fried chicken.

131
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,640
{\an5}Richard Sionis. He's a millionaire.

132
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,160
{\an5}Daddy's on the airplane,
got a boat with a hot tub on it.

133
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,360
He killed 25 people. Just for fun.

134
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,800
So what?

135
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
{\an5}So, he likes you.

136
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,960
{\an5}He wants to be your friend.

137
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
{\an5}Let me think.

138
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
{\an5}No.

139
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,880
{\an5}A girl needs a good friend in here.

140
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,560
See, the guards, they don't care.

141
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,440
{\an5}They figure bad things happen
to bad people.

142
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,760
{\an5}And they happen all of the time.

143
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,520
{\an5}All the time.

144
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,520
Hey, you.

145
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Hello.

146
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,240
{\an5}Baldy. Here, here. Hello. Yes!

147
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,080
{\an5}Hi. Come here.

148
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,280
- Hi.
- Hi.

149
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,680
My name is Barbara.

150
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,320
- Would you be my friend?
- Yes.

151
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,720
Hey, if someone here
tries to hurt me

152
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,000
- would you protect me?
- Yes.

153
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
Thank you so much.

154
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
You cutie.

155
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,800
Now, I have a friend.

156
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,520
You're bad.

157
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,040
Yes. So why don't you go
and make me a sandwich?

158
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,520
Your friend is a gorilla.
My friend runs the joint.

159
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,400
And he can get you things
that people other can't get you.

160
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,320
- Things like what?
- Anything you need.

161
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,960
I need a telephone.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
Ogden Barker, in for 70 grand
plus two months vig

163
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,480
250 in change.

164
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,040
Says he owes Falcone.

165
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,320
Falcone's gone,
so his debt is forfeited.

166
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,520
Well, we can't have him saying that.

167
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,960
What if everybody started
saying that?

168
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,800
There'd be anarchy.

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,040
What is it?

170
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,760
Splendid.

171
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,560
Jim! Come on in.

172
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,240
My dear old friend.

173
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
We need to talk.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Leave us.

175
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Hey, Selina. Moving on up, huh?

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Trying.

177
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Isn't she a darling?

178
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,480
It's like having a cat
around the house.

179
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,400
But no horrid dead mice.

180
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
I need a favor.

181
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,040
I figure you owe me one.

182
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I do.

183
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm always happy to help you, Jim.

184
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,560
But I, I don't recall...

185
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,720
The hospital.
I saved you from Maroni's men.

186
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,040
I was only there
because you arrested me.

187
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,760
For attempted murder.

188
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Remind me again why I let you go.

189
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,840
Enlightened friendship.

190
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,520
I call us even but let's not quibble.

191
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
I'm so happy you came to me
for help, Jim.

192
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,840
The answer is yes.
Your wish is granted.

193
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,120
You don't know what it is yet.

194
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
You want Loeb fired
and your old job back, no?

195
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Yes.

196
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
For a good friend like you,
it can be done.

197
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,600
If you're sure that's what you want.

198
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm sure.

199
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,520
May I ask why?

200
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,840
Police work in Gotham
is such a thankless job.

201
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Good pension.

202
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,800
What does Lee think?

203
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Who?

204
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
Are you gonna help me or not?

205
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Relax. I already said I would help.

206
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,880
He is so brusque, isn't he?

207
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, thank you.

208
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
While I think on it...

209
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,520
perhaps there's a small favor
you could do for me in return.

210
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,960
I know how you hate to owe favors.

211
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,600
I am having a small business
dispute with a friend of mine.

212
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,120
Ogden Barker.

213
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,360
You have a persuasive personality.

214
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,480
Perhaps you could talk to him.

215
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,000
You want me to collect a debt
for you?

216
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,240
I want you to prove to me
that our friendship is a real one

217
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,000
based on trust and equity.

218
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
That's fair.

219
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,000
No. Sorry. Can't help you.

220
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,920
Congratulations on all your success.

221
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,280
- Be good, Selina.
- Always.

222
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,080
Don't say no now, Jim. Sleep on it.

223
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,680
Screw, Penguin. Screw the GCPD.
And screw this city.

224
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,560
Amen. You're doing
the right thing, brother.

225
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,480
Walk away, Jim. Just walk away.

226
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,720
You would do the same thing,
right?

227
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,080
Me, I'm serving sandwich
to Beelzebub, but that's just me.

228
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,960
You are a moralist.
You could never work for Penguin.

229
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,280
Shame would eat away at your guts.

230
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Yeah.

231
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Yeah.

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,520
Slow down, slurp-man.

233
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,760
- You're not joining me?
- I've been sober 32 days.

234
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,560
- 32 days, huh?
- It's no biggie.

235
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,920
Once I quit the job,
quitting drinking was easy.

236
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,920
It's the job, Jim.
Makes us angry, makes us hard.

237
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,240
Yeah, it does.

238
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,480
It's hard to walk away
but it can be done.

239
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,360
I just couldn't carry
that badge anymore.

240
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Look at me now.

241
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm sober.

242
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,120
I have a woman
who does not dislike me.

243
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,400
I live in a house. I sleep at night.

244
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,640
I've never been happier in my life.

245
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,080
Here's to civilian life.

246
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,440
I'm proud of you, bro.

247
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Gotta go.

248
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
Oh, really,
I'm most frightfully sorry

249
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,240
it took so long
to answer the door, sir.

250
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Strange.

251
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,600
Normally, our buzzer sounds
when a car comes through the gates.

252
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
I walked.

253
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,840
You two are dirty.
What have you been doing?

254
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,440
I imagine you have something
important to say.

255
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Yes.

256
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,600
I have been fired from the GCPD.

257
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,280
I won't be able to keep the promise
I made you.

258
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,480
I wanted to apologize.

259
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
Your apology is accepted,
of course.

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,800
But you didn't need to walk here.

261
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,840
A phone call would have been fine.

262
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,520
I needed the air.

263
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
No hope for reinstatement then, sir?

264
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
No.

265
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
Well, there is a way
but it's too ugly.

266
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
I would have to collect a debt
for Penguin

267
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,320
to prove our friendship.

268
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,160
But you can't do that
because he's a bad man.

269
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,920
The task could be demeaning.

270
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,160
Well, yes.

271
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,040
You were going to find
my parents' killers.

272
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,160
You were gonna fight for justice.

273
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,360
You were gonna clean up the GCPD,
change Gotham.

274
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
I had hoped to do that.

275
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,160
If you remain at the GCPD,

276
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,000
you might still be able to do
all of those good things.

277
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,560
But first, you must do
something ugly.

278
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
And your personal honor forbids that.

279
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Yes.

280
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,520
Are you not sacrificing
the greater good

281
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,640
for the sake of your dignity
and self-esteem?

282
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,240
- For vanity?
- Steady on there, Master Bruce.

283
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,800
- Manners.
- He walked all the way here

284
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
to discuss the issue, Alfred.

285
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm simply asking a question.

286
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,880
Surely sometimes the right way...

287
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,440
is also the ugly way.

288
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,960
Sometimes, a man can't tell you
the right way he is dealing with.

289
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,400
All kinds of business
you can't possibly understand yet

290
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,600
because you're still a child.

291
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,320
Yes, Alfred, there's still
a great deal I don't understand.

292
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Please forgive me
if I've offended you, Jim.

293
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
No, no.

294
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's okay.

295
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,120
I'll show you out, sir.

296
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Screw it.

297
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,400
Dru says you can get me
a telephone.

298
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,440
I try and help my friends.

299
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,040
What do your friends do for you?

300
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,760
Well, that depends on
how much you want the telephone.

301
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,160
Hold it right there.

302
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,320
Ogden Barker.

303
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,680
Penguin asked me to talk to you.

304
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
The hell, boy.

305
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,040
You got me worried there
for a minute.

306
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,560
I know you. You're Jim Gordon, cop.

307
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,680
Supposed to be a cold-stone hard-ass.

308
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,960
But you're Penguin's bitch, huh?

309
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,080
How many dickens
can you trust anymore?

310
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
He wants his money.

311
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
How many times
I gotta tell you, people, no.

312
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,680
To Don Falcone, I'll pay.

313
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,080
To that fruitcake leprechaun,
nish, not a penny.

314
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,280
Falcone's retired. Time's changed.

315
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
Penguin is boss now.

316
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,760
Like hell.
The freak won't last a year.

317
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,040
Don't underestimate him.

318
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
Advice now?

319
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm trying to be nice here.
Let's work this out.

320
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,480
Yeah?

321
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Let's not.

322
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Walk away.

323
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,440
Walk away before I kick your ass,
you crooked punk bitch.

324
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,720
How much money you got there?

325
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Looks like a lot.

326
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,440
- What is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

327
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,880
Give me the money you owe.

328
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,920
How about I put a hole
in your face?

329
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm gonna count to three.

330
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
You're crazy.

331
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
One...

332
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,400
Put the money in the bag. Do it!

333
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
Get him, man.

334
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Stop! Thief!

335
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Out of the way!

336
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Hey, cop.

337
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Fertilizer? What is your game?

338
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,320
I would have thought that's obvious
to a man of your perception.

339
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,600
It occurred to me
to follow my own advice.

340
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Sometimes the ugly way
is also the right way.

341
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,960
I mean, a bomb, inside the house?

342
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,520
I mean, you're having a laugh,
ain't you, a bomb?

343
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,640
I was going to tell you.

344
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I wanted to present it
as a fait accompli.

345
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,600
Don't start talking French to me.

346
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,240
You don't know the first thing
about bomb-making anyway, do you?

347
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,200
I read a book, Alfred.
It seems simple enough.

348
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
A book?

349
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,200
I mean, you're gonna blow
your bloody head off

350
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,720
before you put a dent in that thing.

351
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,320
You know, maybe that door
is trying to tell us something.

352
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,120
Maybe you're not ready
to find out what's behind it.

353
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,800
Maybe we should wait
until you're older.

354
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,200
I mean, who knows
what your dear old dad was up to

355
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
down there, anyway?

356
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,280
Like what?

357
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,280
Like things I wouldn't want
to describe to a child

358
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,800
which is exactly what you are.

359
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm building a bomb
to blow down that door.

360
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,960
You may assist me or not.
As you wish.

361
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,840
But if not, some tea would be nice.

362
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,840
Right. Well, you're gonna need

363
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,120
ten more sacks of that.
Okay, for starters,

364
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,800
three more jerry cans, too,
extra timber,

365
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,360
and a heavy tarpaulin.

366
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,920
And I'll put the kettle on.

367
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,440
Excellent.

368
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,600
Excellent.

369
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,400
I'm so sorry things got messy.

370
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,400
What a foolish fellow.

371
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,680
Never mind. I will make sure
that there is no follow-up

372
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,080
from your colleagues.

373
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,440
Don't worry about a thing.

374
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
You knew.

375
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,760
You knew Ogden would go off.

376
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,920
What a devious mind do you have?
I have no idea.

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,040
We have a deal.

378
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,640
We do. We do.

379
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,960
Are you okay, Jim?

380
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,160
Yeah. Daydreaming.

381
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,600
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

382
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,360
- Hello.
<i>- Hello. Jim?</i>

383
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,080
<i>- Hello. Are you still there?</i>
- I'm here.

384
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,800
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

385
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,040
How did you get to a phone?

386
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Who cares?

387
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,680
We're talking at last,
that's the important thing.

388
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,400
What do you want?

389
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,520
Jim, there's been a terrible mistake.

390
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,320
I never told Lee
that I killed my mum and dad.

391
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,240
<i>And I never attacked her.</i>

392
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,040
She attacked me, Jim.

393
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,560
She's completely insane.

394
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,920
That's enough.

395
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,080
Don't call again.

396
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,160
Who's that?

397
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Sales call.

398
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,560
- It can drive you crazy, huh?
- Sales call?

399
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Don't.

400
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,160
- What?
- Don't answer it.

401
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
- Jim, you're scaring me.
- It's Barbara.

402
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,280
<i>Go ahead, leave a message.</i>

403
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
<i>Hey, girlfriend.</i>

404
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
<i>Guess who?</i>

405
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,160
<i>Sorry I missed you. Bummer, eh?</i>

406
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,800
I just wanted to say
that I hope you die screaming, bitch.

407
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
<i>Bye.</i>

408
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Nice.

409
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,120
All right, look.

410
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,320
She's safely locked up in Arkham,
she can't hurt you.

411
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,800
I know. I know. She's just
a sick person spreading sadness.

412
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,800
Screw her. Let's be happy.

413
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
Let's go away some place.

414
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,240
We can't let a crazy woman
drive us out.

415
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,560
Why not?

416
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,840
Pride? Who cares?

417
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,240
We could go away and never come back.

418
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,640
What's keeping us here?

419
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
I can't leave.

420
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Why not?

421
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Jim?

422
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,800
I did a bad thing.

423
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,360
I did a bad thing.

424
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Hi.

425
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,920
Do you have any peanut butter?

426
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
What?

427
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Peanut butter? Smooth.
Food preference.

428
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,080
Guard. Help! Help!

429
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,760
Hi, boss.

430
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
How about a bottle of beer?

431
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,080
Let me share a dilemma with you.
May I?

432
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,600
I need you to do something for me
that I know you won't wanna do.

433
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,680
What is it?

434
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,560
With most people,
there is no problem.

435
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,440
I find their weak spots

436
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,040
and use violence or blackmail
to persuade them.

437
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,280
But you...

438
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,600
you are a man of monkish virtue.

439
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,160
You have no vices to expose.

440
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,800
So, threats of personal violence
will only harden your resolve, huh?

441
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
No, that...

442
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,680
Come, sir, don't be modest.

443
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,240
You are a rare animal.

444
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,160
But that does lead us
to a sad pickle.

445
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,360
Since I can't persuade you
to do as I ask,

446
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,560
the only rational option is
to kill you

447
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,360
and negotiate with whoever
replaces you as a commissioner.

448
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,960
Now, Chief?

449
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,840
One moment, Victor.

450
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,240
The commissioner deserves time
to process all this.

451
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,720
Say a prayer or what have you.

452
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,920
What do you want me to do?

453
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
It's not worth talking about.

454
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
You wouldn't do it.

455
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
Tell me.

456
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,800
I need my friend Jimmy Gordon
reinstated as a detective.

457
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,920
See? You hate that idea.

458
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,040
No, I don't. I'll do it.

459
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
I can tell that you're not sincere.

460
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,680
Even if you do as I ask,

461
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,320
someday down the line,
you'll change your mind,

462
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680
and you'll turn on him again.

463
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,000
- You want me to kill him now?
- No, make him a nice cheese toast.

464
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,160
- Yes, kill him now, please.
- I just want it to be clear.

465
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,680
No, wait! Let's talk about this.

466
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,160
Sorry, least worst option.

467
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,840
Unless of course...

468
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,280
No, you would never agree?

469
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
To what? Agree to what?

470
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:42,840
<i>So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

471
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,480
<i>Goodbye</i>

472
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,280
<i>Goodbye</i>

473
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,920
<i>Goodbye</i>

474
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,560
Lovely, lovely. Bravo.

475
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,840
Mayor James regrets
he's unable to attend today.

476
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,360
But he sent a dear friend
in his stead.

477
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,080
Please welcome
distinguished businessman,

478
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,000
visionary, scientist,
acclaimed philanthropist,

479
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,120
and new chairman of the development

480
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,080
at the Gotham Chamber of Commerce,

481
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,520
Mr. Theo Galavan.

482
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,040
Thank you so much.

483
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,280
What an honor it is to be here today

484
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,960
to help bid farewell to a great man

485
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,440
and a faithful servant of this city.

486
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
What can I say about Gillian Loeb?

487
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,040
Someone tell me a funny story.

488
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
I have a good one.

489
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,800
So when I was in college,

490
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,720
I played for the varsity polo team,
and I had a, a string of ponies...

491
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,840
Greetings!

492
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,440
I am Zaardon, the soul reaper!

493
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,000
So, I have these ponies...

494
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm an adopted son of this city.

495
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,200
I haven't lived in Gotham very long,
but I already love her like a native.

496
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,200
It just, it just kind of grabs
hold of you, doesn't it?

497
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,960
There's magic here.

498
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Magic.

499
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,240
And that is down to everyday heroes
like Gillian Loeb.

500
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,280
Mr. Commissioner,
thank you for your service.

501
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,640
Thank you very much, everybody.

502
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,040
My best wishes to...

503
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,080
Commissioner Essen.

504
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,000
And the maitre d' says,
"You can't bring them in here."

505
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,120
Hear me, slaves!
My patience is wearing thin.

506
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,760
Surrender your souls to my mercy.

507
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,240
I swear by the master,
I shall feast on your pain.

508
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,120
I shall gorge on your torment.

509
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,880
I shall crush you like a bug.

510
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,240
Back up, Area Five! Area Five!

511
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,760
Welcome back, Jim.

512
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,480
I don't know how you pulled this off,
but I'm glad you did.

513
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,760
He's a resourceful man.

514
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,240
- Congratulations to both of you.
- Thank you.

515
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,480
And it is a new day, Jim.
We're going to do great things.

516
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Yes, we are.

517
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,600
It is a new day.

518
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
Things are gonna be all right,
I promise.

519
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,720
- I hope it was worth it.
- I hope so, too.

520
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Jim.

521
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,720
What's wrong?

522
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,440
There's been an incident
at Arkham Asylum.

523
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,720
Six inmates have escaped.

524
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,240
Barbara Kean was one of them.

525
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,360
Oh, my God.

526
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,240
- What the hell is this place?
- In Arkham, anyhow.

527
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,480
Things are looking up.

528
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,120
Welcome, everyone.

529
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,520
My name is Theo Galavan.
This is my sister, Tabitha.

530
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,640
- I gotta get my hands on that.
- Hey, come on.

531
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,080
I understand you're feeling
confused...

532
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,440
scared, a little groggy.

533
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,640
But please, relax.

534
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,040
Today is the first day
of a wonderful future for all of you.

535
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
If you want it.

536
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,880
Who are you?

537
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,960
Well, now the question is
who are you?

538
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,520
The world sees criminal lunatics.

539
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,960
I see brilliance.

540
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,200
I see charisma.

541
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,640
And power.

542
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,120
I see power.

543
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,720
Yes. Exactly, my man.

544
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,080
That is so spooky,
that is me to a tee.

545
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,160
These other bozos, I don't know,
but you're singing my song.

546
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,920
Quiet, Jerome.

547
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Keep talking.

548
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,120
Imagine a group of brilliant outlaws
like yourselves,

549
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,800
each selected for a unique ability,
are working together as a team.

550
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,120
Imagine the synergy.
Imagine the impact.

551
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,480
Gotham will tremble before you.

552
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,720
Well, that sounds fabulous,
but I am not a brilliant outlaw.

553
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,520
I just have...

554
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
issues.

555
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,080
You have ferocity, and beauty,
and desire.

556
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,200
And that's enough.

557
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,880
Come with me, Barbara.

558
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,320
Whatever you want in the world,
it's yours.

559
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,400
Theo.

560
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,280
That's your name, right? Theo?

561
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,120
You're getting way ahead
of yourself here.

562
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,440
First of all,
keep your hands off her.

563
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,080
Second, this whole magic team,
I got to pass.

564
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,120
I don't take orders.

565
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,680
Good luck on everything, though.
It's an intriguing concept.

566
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,400
- This is very disappointing.
- Oh, fair play.

567
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,240
You want a reward
for busting us out of Arkham.

568
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,440
I am grateful.

569
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,560
How's a million bucks sound?
Pretty good, huh?

570
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,240
I can get it for you today
as soon as I hit the street.

571
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,080
Money is not the concern.
I had such high hopes for you.

572
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,160
And unanticipated sexual jealousy
that always poisons the well.

573
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,800
You have to go.

574
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,600
Tabitha will see you out.

575
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,480
Miss Kean is coming with me.

576
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,480
Oh, she doesn't wanna go
where you're going.

577
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,800
Anyone else who wanna leave?

578
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,840
Now, you're absolutely sure
about this, Master Bruce?

579
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
- I strongly advice...
- Alfred.

580
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
I need to know.

581
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Let's do this.

582
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah. All right, sir.

583
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,880
- Yes!
- Yeah!

584
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
<i>Dear Bruce</i>

585
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,720
<i>these last weeks,
I began to feel very mortal...</i>

586
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,680
<i>which prompts this note to you.</i>

587
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,120
<i>Perhaps, I'm being paranoid.
I hope so.</i>

588
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,280
<i>In any case, if you're reading
this, then I'm dead.</i>

589
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,320
<i>And you figured out
that the entry code is Bruce.</i>

590
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,120
<i>I'm sorry I had to hide
this part of my life from you</i>

591
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,360
<i>because this place only exists
because of you.</i>

592
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,640
<i>Becoming a father made me want
to be a better man.</i>

593
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,520
<i>And I started asking hard questions
about the family business.</i>

594
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
<i>So, here we are.</i>

595
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,400
<i>As I write this, you're 12
and a fine, good-hearted boy.</i>

596
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
<i>So I'm sure you'll be a fine,
good-hearted man.</i>

597
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
<i>But that's all I know.</i>

598
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,160
<i>I don't know what happened to me
or your mother...</i>

599
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,800
<i>or how life has turned out
for you...</i>

600
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,880
<i>I don't even know how old you are.</i>

601
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,080
<i>So, I'll resist giving you
much fatherly advice.</i>

602
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
<i>Only this.</i>

603
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,400
<i>You can't have both happiness
and the truth.</i>

604
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
<i>You have to choose.</i>

605
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,160
<i>I beg of you, my son,
please choose happiness.</i>

606
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,280
<i>Unless...</i>

607
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,720
<i>Unless you feel a calling.</i>

608
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,080
<i>A true calling.</i>
