1
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,493
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,200
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,267
Now, listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,501
I know.

5
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,611
How do I look?

6
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,282
Perfect.

7
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,177
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,812
It's great.

9
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,078
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,723
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,920
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,454
Did you give Roz
the phone and pager numbers?

13
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,131
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,332
Coming.

15
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,758
All right.

16
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,265
I'm ready.

17
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,982
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,189
Roz.

19
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,525
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,588
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,130
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,962
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch <i>The Nutcracker</i>?

23
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,070
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

24
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,034
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,203
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,676
The phone number is on the fridge,

27
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,543
and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,515
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,416
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,987
You be good, baby.

31
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,622
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

32
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:53,203
- Victor, Illona.
- Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,899
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,780
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,042
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,318
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,184
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

38
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,358
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,994
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,687
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,299
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,231
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,242
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,079
Not a soul.

45
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:54,366
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:00,029
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,346
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,046
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,657
Really?

50
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,454
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,792
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,373
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,010
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

54
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,779
Thank you.

55
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,853
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,456
I desperately need to
go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,652
You go and say hello,
and I'll meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,254
Good.

59
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,108
Nightingale.

60
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,171
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,608
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,116
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,685
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,252
And a couple.

65
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,789
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

66
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,923
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,032
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,965
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,400
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,200
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,669
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,873
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

73
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,384
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

74
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,622
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,757
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,156
Cheers.

77
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,198
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,026
Be right with you.

79
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,863
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later,

80
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,837
I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Café.

81
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,770
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

82
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,582
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,482
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,822
I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,838
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,894
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,286
I'm American.

88
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,830
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:52,201
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on <i>The Art of Love</i>?

90
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,972
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

91
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,945
crying his eyes out

92
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,879
in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,021
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,753
A very good time.

95
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,025
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,191
With my husband.

97
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,469
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:30,176
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,143
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,085
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,255
I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,156
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,024
But it went broke.

104
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,590
What a shame.

105
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,839
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,735
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,173
Thank you.

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,959
Someone you know?

109
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,499
My...

110
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,634
husband.

111
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,340
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage

112
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:49,250
is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,754
May I ask why a beautiful woman,

114
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,926
who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

115
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,860
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,732
Is it as bad as that?

117
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,410
As good as that.

118
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,944
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:19,779
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,813
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,328
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,828
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,594
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,570
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:47,142
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza

126
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,940
on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,347
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,313
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief,

129
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,993
which was also clean.

130
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,393
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,495
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,200
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,944
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,939
and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

135
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,212
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,813
Fascinating.

137
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,594
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,660
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,068
They always seem so...

140
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,502
knowledgeable.

141
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,380
Oh, they are very knowledgeable

142
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,416
about all sorts of things.

143
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,516
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,823
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,096
You're probably right.

146
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,899
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,096
Exactly?

148
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,033
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,577
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,181
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,512
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,415
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,455
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,959
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,459
Fine.

156
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,635
To be continued?

157
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,519
Bill, thanks for coming.

158
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,362
We had a little accident here.

159
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,165
What happened?

160
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,635
Well, she was...

161
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,301
she was shooting up,
and she had a bad reaction.

162
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,271
What did she take?

163
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,780
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

164
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,848
It's heroin and coke.

165
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,811
Heroin and coke?

166
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,589
Anything else?

167
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,525
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

168
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,692
How long has she been like this?

169
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,398
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

170
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,729
What's her name?

171
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,064
Mandy.

172
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,516
Can you hear me, Mandy?

173
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,479
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

174
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,086
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

175
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,854
You can hear me.

176
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:28,296
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

177
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,369
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

178
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,507
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

179
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,578
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,506
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

181
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,217
Good.

182
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,051
Good.

183
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,290
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

184
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,130
It's wonderful.

185
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,603
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

186
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,638
I haven't.

187
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:15,244
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

188
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,511
Do you like the period?

189
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,416
I do.

190
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,253
I adore it.

191
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,797
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

192
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,223
Would you like to see it?

193
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,068
I can show it to you.

194
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,609
We won't be gone long.

195
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,816
Maybe...

196
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,652
not just...

197
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,227
now.

198
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,547
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

199
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,450
Sorry.

200
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,556
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

201
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,727
Better.

202
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,871
You are a very, very lucky girl.

203
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,348
You know that?

204
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,214
I know.

205
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,555
You're gonna be okay this time.

206
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:11,092
But you can't keep doing this.

207
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,332
You understand?

208
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,604
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

209
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,002
I know.

210
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,413
Well, Victor...

211
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,185
I'll leave the rest to you.

212
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,091
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

213
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:48,029
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

214
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,724
Another hour?

215
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,533
Then I'd have someone take her home.

216
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,136
Good night, Mandy.

217
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,315
I can't thank you enough for this.

218
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,284
- You saved my ass.
- I'm glad I was here.

219
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,958
Bill. I probably...

220
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,323
I know I don't have to mention this,

221
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,465
but this is just between us.

222
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,197
Of course.

223
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,999
Thanks.

224
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:49,588
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

225
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,327
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

226
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:01,166
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

227
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,075
Yes...

228
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,106
but will I?

229
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,510
Of course you will.

230
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,489
I really have to go.
I have to go.

231
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,456
You don't, you know.

232
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,790
Yes... I do.

233
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,969
I must see you again.

234
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,402
- That's impossible.
- Why?

235
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,676
Because...

236
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,479
I'm married.

237
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,884
Good morning, Lisa.

238
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,178
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

239
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,321
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

240
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,116
- Sure.
- Thank you.

241
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,729
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

242
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,954
<i>" 'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house,</i>

243
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:09,032
<i>"not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."</i>

244
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,765
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

245
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,208
Hold this for Mommy.

246
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,580
Looking forward to Christmas?

247
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,346
Does this hurt?

248
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,930
Right there?

249
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,881
Daddy's gonna like that.

250
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,279
Very good choice.

251
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,417
"...before me...

252
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:07,860
"when I jump into my bed."

253
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:14,059
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

254
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,866
I've taken care of that.

255
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,871
Good.

256
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,200
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

257
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,075
Let's do that tomorrow.

258
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,254
Tell me something.

259
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,493
Those two girls...

260
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,966
at the party last night...

261
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,805
Did you...

262
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,184
by any chance...

263
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,884
happen to...

264
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,321
fuck them?

265
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,292
What?

266
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,928
What are you talking about?

267
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,604
I'm talking about the two girls

268
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,780
that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

269
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,477
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

270
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,523
Who were they?

271
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,490
They were just a couple of models.

272
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:34,062
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

273
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,308
Wait a minute.

274
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:44,616
I didn't disappear with anybody.

275
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,081
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

276
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,756
and I got called upstairs
to see him.

277
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,566
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

278
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,606
A friend of the Zieglers.

279
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,709
What did he want?

280
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,004
What did he want?

281
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,348
Sex...

282
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,325
upstairs.

283
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,261
Then and there.

284
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,257
Is that all?

285
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,193
Yeah, that was all.

286
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,169
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

287
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,002
That's right.

288
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,643
Well, I guess that's understandable.

289
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,813
Understandable?

290
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,849
Because you are a very...

291
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,087
very beautiful woman.

292
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,562
Wait.

293
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,230
Because I'm a beautiful woman,

294
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:15,738
the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

295
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:21,946
is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

296
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,388
Well, I don't think it's
quite that black and white...

297
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:36,424
but I think we both know
what men are like.

298
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,430
So on that basis,

299
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:45,570
I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

300
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,532
There are exceptions.

301
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:56,147
And what makes you an exception?

302
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:02,549
What makes me an exception is that...

303
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,190
I happen to be in love with you.

304
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,885
And because we're married,

305
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:13,361
and because I would never
lie to you...

306
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,625
or hurt you.

307
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,442
Do you realize that
what you're saying

308
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,946
is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models

309
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,744
is out of consideration for me?

310
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,013
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

311
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,154
Let's just relax, Alice.

312
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,953
This pot is making you aggressive.

313
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,564
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

314
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,393
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

315
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,195
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

316
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,601
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

317
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,037
I'm not arguing.

318
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:03,272
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

319
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,242
Where I'm coming from?

320
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:14,419
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

321
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:18,763
standing in your office naked,

322
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,661
and you're feeling her fucking tits.

323
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,665
Now, what I want to know...

324
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,807
I want to know what you're thinking about
when you're squeezing them.

325
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,202
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

326
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,971
It's all very impersonal

327
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:39,776
and you know
there's always a nurse present.

328
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:45,188
So when you're feeling tits,
it's nothing more than your professionalism?

329
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,448
Exactly.

330
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:51,220
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

331
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,627
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed,

332
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,133
do you think she ever
has fantasies

333
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:03,639
about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

334
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:10,011
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing

335
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,447
on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

336
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,620
And what makes you so sure?

337
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,654
If for no better reason,

338
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:27,166
because she's afraid of
what I might find.

339
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:32,834
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

340
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,265
What then?

341
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,904
I don't know, Alice...

342
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,709
What then?

343
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,576
Women don't...

344
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,281
They basically just don't
think like that.

345
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:58,120
Millions of years of evolution, right?

346
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,467
Men have to stick it
every place they can,

347
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,865
but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

348
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,330
and whatever the fuck else!

349
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,305
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

350
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,475
If you men only knew.

351
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:21,947
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight,

352
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,283
and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

353
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,584
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

354
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,022
No, I'm not.

355
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,321
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

356
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,530
No, I haven't.

357
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,200
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

358
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:39,404
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

359
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,971
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child,

360
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,973
and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

361
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:49,478
You are very, very sure of yourself,

362
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,012
aren't you?

363
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,644
No.

364
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,181
I'm sure of you.

365
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,298
Do you think that's funny?

366
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,039
All right. Fuck it.

367
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,613
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

368
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,527
Do you...

369
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:43,362
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

370
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,403
Do you remember,
one night in the dining room,

371
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,774
there was this young naval officer,

372
00:31:55,981 --> 00:32:00,509
and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

373
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,111
No.

374
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:09,954
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

375
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,824
Nothing rings a bell?

376
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,801
Well...

377
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,802
I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

378
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,241
He was checking into the hotel...

379
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,975
and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

380
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,654
to the elevator.

381
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:45,630
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

382
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,560
Nothing more.

383
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,070
But I could hardly...

384
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,270
move.

385
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,519
That afternoon...

386
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:19,856
Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

387
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,700
and you and I made love.

388
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,278
And we made plans about our future...

389
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:38,438
and we talked about Helena.

390
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,879
And yet...

391
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,683
at no time...

392
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,620
was he ever...

393
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:54,629
out of my mind.

394
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:05,009
And I thought if he wanted me...

395
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,344
even if it was only...

396
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,781
for one night...

397
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,786
I was ready to give up everything:

398
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,858
You.

399
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,999
Helena.

400
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:34,334
My whole fucking future.

401
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,202
Everything.

402
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:49,117
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

403
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,053
you were dearer to me than ever.

404
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,622
And at that moment,
my love for you...

405
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,528
was both...

406
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:12,003
tender and sad.

407
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,582
I barely slept that night...

408
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,823
and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

409
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,968
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

410
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:42,807
or that he might still be there.

411
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,377
But by dinner...

412
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,852
I realized he was gone...

413
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,463
and I was...

414
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,490
relieved.

415
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,327
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

416
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,397
When did it happen?

417
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,872
I have the address.

418
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,978
Thank you.

419
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,853
Lou Nathanson just died.

420
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,404
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

421
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,089
- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr. Harford.

422
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:21,296
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

423
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,591
Thank you.

424
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,110
Come in.

425
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,519
Marion.

426
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,225
Oh, Dr. Harford...

427
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,724
how good of you to come.

428
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:56,401
I came as soon as I got the message.

429
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:57,864
Thank you.

430
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,067
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

431
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,071
Your father was...

432
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,043
He was a very brave man.

433
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,303
Oh, thank you.

434
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,744
How are you holding up?

435
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,747
I'm a bit numb.

436
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,089
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

437
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,451
Would you like to sit down?

438
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,488
It's so unreal.

439
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,786
Daddy had such a good day.

440
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:05,431
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

441
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,634
Then he had a little dinner,

442
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:14,274
and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

443
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:20,484
I went into the kitchen
and talked to Rosa for half an hour at most...

444
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,948
and when I went to see how he was, I...

445
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,454
I just thought he was asleep.

446
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:36,459
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

447
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,866
From what you've said,

448
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:48,137
I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

449
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,076
Oh, God, I hope so.

450
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:59,223
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

451
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,052
than his death itself.

452
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,628
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

453
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:13,235
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

454
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,672
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls,

455
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,707
and he'll be coming over soon.

456
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,343
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

457
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,779
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

458
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,015
A math professor.

459
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:40,728
We're going to get married in May.

460
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,627
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

461
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,840
Thank you.

462
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,137
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

463
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,477
We'll be moving out there soon.

464
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:05,213
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

465
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,921
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

466
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,680
Oh, my God, no...

467
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,336
I love you.

468
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,374
I love you.

469
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,277
I love you, I love you, I love you.

470
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,453
I don't want to go away with Carl.

471
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,778
Marion, I don't think you realize--

472
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,285
I do.

473
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,528
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

474
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,332
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

475
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:27,471
You're very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you're saying.

476
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,572
I love you.

477
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:34,944
We barely know each other.

478
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,613
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

479
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,512
I love you.

480
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,524
That's probably Carl.

481
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,995
Please don't despise me.

482
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,798
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr. Thomas.

483
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:05,772
- Is she in the bedroom?
- Yes, she is.

484
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,138
Thank you.

485
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,513
Come in.

486
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,092
Darling.

487
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,163
I'm so very sorry.

488
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,597
Are you all right?

489
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,629
I'm okay.

490
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:42,111
- Dr. Harford, good evening.
- Good evening, Carl.

491
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:45,214
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

492
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,386
- It's the least I could do.
- It means a lot to us.

493
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,745
Thank you.

494
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,524
I was actually on my way out.

495
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,525
Marion...

496
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:05,527
your father was very proud of you,

497
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:10,674
and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

498
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:13,404
Thank you.

499
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,215
I'll show you out.

500
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,085
Good night.

501
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:16,406
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

502
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,133
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

503
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,745
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

504
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,813
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

505
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,417
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

506
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,382
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

507
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,885
Merry Christmas, Mary!

508
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,717
- Your butt-brothers are back there!
- Prime cut of meat!

509
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,418
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

510
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,398
You should have tits,
you're standing so close!

511
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,764
- I got dumps that are bigger than you!
- Come on, macho man!

512
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:50,168
- You want a piece of this, baby?
- Exit only, honey.

513
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,943
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

514
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,399
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

515
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,964
Ten past 12.

516
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,242
Going anywhere special?

517
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,670
No, I'm just taking a walk.

518
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:36,784
How'd you like to have a little fun?

519
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,714
I'm sorry?

520
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,887
Have a little fun?

521
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:46,697
I just live right down there.

522
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,992
Would you like to come inside with me?

523
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:53,365
Come inside with you?

524
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,636
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

525
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,610
You live in there?

526
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,021
By yourself?

527
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:16,055
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

528
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:18,993
Hey, it's okay.

529
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:21,822
Listen, no one will bother us.

530
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,358
It's okay. Come on.

531
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:26,194
Come on.

532
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,759
This is it.

533
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,427
That's a nice tree.

534
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:09,441
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

535
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,626
It's...

536
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,595
cozy. It's a...

537
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,931
cozy place.

538
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,467
It's okay.

539
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,689
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

540
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,960
Yeah, I guess so.

541
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,723
That depends on what you want to do.

542
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,769
What do you want to do?

543
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,802
What do you recommend?

544
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,342
What do I recommend?

545
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,830
I'd rather not put it into words.

546
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,864
How about you just leave it up to me?

547
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,102
I'm in your hands.

548
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,604
And how does 150 sound?

549
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,105
Sounds wonderful.

550
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,023
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

551
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:08,932
<i>Thank you.</i>

552
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,066
Prego, prego.

553
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,531
- Grazie.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

554
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,996
<i>If I was Italian,
he'd have answered me in Italian.</i>

555
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,581
Shall we?

556
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,368
Excuse me.

557
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,484
Is everything all right?

558
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,625
I was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer?

559
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:51,168
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

560
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,801
It could be awhile.

561
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,501
Any idea how long?

562
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,743
No, I don't really know.

563
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,910
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

564
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:10,182
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

565
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:32,237
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

566
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,054
Do you have to go?

567
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,460
Do I have to go?

568
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:03,766
I think I do.

569
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,011
Are you sure?

570
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,414
Yes, I'm afraid so.

571
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,523
But listen,
I want to pay you anyway.

572
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:27,462
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

573
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,896
But you know what?
You don't have to bother about that.

574
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,573
No, it's all right.

575
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,637
- No, really. You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

576
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,180
Really?

577
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,718
Well, thank you very much.

578
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,623
Thank you.

579
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:52,480
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

580
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,516
- I'd like a table.
- Please follow me.

581
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:05,857
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

582
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,988
Could I get you anything to drink?

583
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:12,534
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

584
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,510
One, two, one-two-three-four.

585
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,979
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

586
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:33,919
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

587
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:38,220
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

588
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:42,626
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

589
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,393
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

590
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,406
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

591
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,117
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

592
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,812
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

593
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:09,049
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

594
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,923
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

595
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:15,522
Thank you.

596
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,599
So what brings you out at this hour?

597
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,966
- I have a patient in the neighborhood.
- You live in the Village?

598
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:26,108
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

599
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,675
You're married?

600
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:29,710
Nine years.

601
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,048
- Any kids?
- Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

602
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,342
How about you?

603
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,145
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

604
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:38,788
You're a long way from home.

605
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,886
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

606
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:43,717
Thank you.

607
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,269
- Is this your band?
- No, it's a pick-up band.

608
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,497
- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

609
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,175
I got another gig later tonight.

610
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:01,310
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

611
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,206
They only get started around 2.

612
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,208
In the Village?

613
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,853
Believe it or not,
I don't actually know the address yet.

614
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,345
You don't?

615
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:17,722
No. It may sound ridiculous,
but it's in a different place every time,

616
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,761
and I only get it
an hour or so before.

617
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,661
- A different place every time?
- So far.

618
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:25,997
What's the big mystery?

619
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,035
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

620
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,975
Nick, I'm sorry.
Is there something I'm missing here?

621
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,816
I play blindfolded.

622
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:45,149
What?

623
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:49,585
I play blindfolded.

624
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,155
You're putting me on.

625
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,857
No, it's the truth.

626
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:03,467
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

627
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,573
Oh, man.

628
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:13,012
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

629
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,078
but never...

630
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:17,921
never anything like this...

631
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,716
and never such women.

632
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,232
Excuse me.

633
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,101
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

634
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,814
I know where that is.

635
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:56,392
Right.

636
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,897
Well, I'm on my way right now.

637
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:05,158
Okay, sir. Thank you.

638
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:08,936
What is this?

639
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:13,136
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

640
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,609
It's the password.

641
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:21,807
The password?

642
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,750
Yeah. Look. I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

643
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,625
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

644
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,625
You know there is no way on earth...

645
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:44,631
that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

646
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:48,973
- Come on, buddy, give me a break.
- Nick, I'll tell you what.

647
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,410
I've already got the password.

648
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:56,514
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself,

649
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,315
and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

650
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:07,192
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

651
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,293
that I was prepared to do that.

652
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,965
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

653
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:16,536
Why not?

654
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:21,240
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

655
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:25,776
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

656
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,898
Thanks. Keep the change.

657
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,316
<i>Yes? Who is it?</i>

658
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,284
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

659
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:09,925
I apologize for disturbing you at this hour,
but I need your help.

660
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,961
<i>Who is it that you want?</i>

661
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,499
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning,

662
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:20,193
the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

663
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:23,807
<i>What's your name?</i>

664
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:26,408
My name is Bill Harford.

665
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,806
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

666
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,747
<i>You are Grenning's doctor?</i>

667
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:36,045
<i>Okay.</i>

668
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,088
<i>Just a moment.</i>

669
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,329
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

670
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,136
Yes, I am.

671
01:02:57,574 --> 01:03:01,477
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

672
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,508
He moved to Chicago?

673
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,208
I wasn't aware of that.

674
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,749
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

675
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,585
Yes, I am.

676
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,027
Well, first of all,

677
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:23,098
please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr...

678
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,529
Milich.

679
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:28,898
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford,

680
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:32,097
this is my
New York State Medical Board card.

681
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:36,001
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

682
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:39,614
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

683
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,978
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

684
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:46,078
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was...

685
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:53,062
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

686
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,330
And I'd be happy to pay you
$100 over the rental price

687
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,127
for the inconvenience.

688
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,301
A hundred dollars?

689
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,503
I don't think so.

690
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,813
How about $200?

691
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:16,010
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

692
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,059
Come in.

693
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,164
Can't be too careful these days.

694
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,502
Please.

695
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:46,248
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

696
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:54,223
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood,
and a mask.

697
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:57,752
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

698
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:04,158
I think we'll find something for you.

699
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,561
Follow me, please.

700
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,137
Good.

701
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,242
Looks like alive, huh?

702
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,008
- It's wonderful.
- Come.

703
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,317
So what color cloak?

704
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,486
Red, brown, red?

705
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:31,986
Black.

706
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:35,688
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

707
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:38,596
- I don't think so.
- Clowns, officers, pirates?

708
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:41,464
No, just the tux, the black cloak--

709
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,901
With a hood and a mask.

710
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,867
May I take your coat?

711
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:53,046
- You are medicine doctor, yes?
- Yes, I am.

712
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:57,851
- I have some problem with my hair.
- Your hair?

713
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,113
It's starting to fall down too fast.

714
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,258
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

715
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,451
Look at this. Here.

716
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,888
You see?

717
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:09,759
And?

718
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,931
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

719
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,104
What? You can't help me?

720
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,900
No. You should see a trichologist.
It's a hair specialist.

721
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,738
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

722
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,675
So if you don't mind--

723
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,940
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

724
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,481
I understand.

725
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,011
So black cloak?

726
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,358
Did you hear something?

727
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,256
What is this?

728
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,773
What is it?

729
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:00,850
What is this?

730
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:17,226
What on earth is going on here?!

731
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,561
Milich, I can explain everything.

732
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,067
You! What are you doing here?

733
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,070
I promise I'll kill you!

734
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:28,177
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

735
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:32,212
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

736
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:36,045
Milich, are you crazy?
We were invited here by the young lady.

737
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:40,621
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

738
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,622
- You will have to explain to police!
- To the police?!

739
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,693
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

740
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:50,423
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

741
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,829
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

742
01:07:53,036 --> 01:07:56,995
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

743
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,300
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

744
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:01,170
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

745
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:04,176
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

746
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,974
You will please stay here
until I return.

747
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,844
Let us out of here!

748
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,986
That's out of the question.

749
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:14,817
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

750
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,617
- Black?
- Black.

751
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:20,856
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

752
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:23,328
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

753
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:24,533
Sorry.

754
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:28,629
And you, little whore,
go to bed at once, you depraved creature.

755
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,273
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

756
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:34,807
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

757
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,812
Okay, that's $74.50.

758
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,388
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

759
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,084
There's 80.

760
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,428
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

761
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:40,135
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

762
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:41,895
Just let the meter run.

763
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:45,473
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

764
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:48,303
- Okay?
- How long you gonna be?

765
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:51,913
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

766
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:55,083
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

767
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,334
Good evening, sir.

768
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,568
Good evening.

769
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:18,571
Can we be of any help?

770
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,209
I suppose you'd like the password.

771
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,037
If you'd like, sir.

772
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,460
Fidelio.

773
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:28,610
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

774
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,352
Good evening, sir.

775
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,891
Good evening.

776
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:13,786
Password, sir?

777
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:15,664
Fidelio.

778
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,667
Thank you, sir.

779
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,068
I'm not sure what you
think you're doing.

780
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:28,293
But you don't belong here.

781
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:34,109
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

782
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:40,505
Please! Don't be foolish.

783
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:42,947
You must go now.

784
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:49,019
Who are you?

785
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:51,420
It doesn't matter who I am.

786
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:54,391
You are in great danger.

787
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:58,130
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

788
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:05,430
Would you be so good
as to excuse us for a moment?

789
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,922
Have you been enjoying yourself?

790
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:12,455
Well, I've had a
very interesting look around.

791
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:18,624
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

792
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:23,096
Private?

793
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:27,502
That might be a good idea.

794
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:32,476
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

795
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:36,443
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

796
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:39,144
I promise to bring him right back.

797
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:52,266
I don't think you realize
the danger you're in now.

798
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,493
You can't fool them for much longer.

799
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,673
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

800
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:01,669
Why are you telling me this?

801
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,843
It doesn't matter.

802
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:05,279
Who are you?

803
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:11,080
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

804
01:23:12,855 --> 01:23:14,482
Will you come with me?

805
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,419
That's impossible.

806
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:17,683
Why?

807
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:22,126
Because it would cost me my life
and possibly yours.

808
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,194
Let me see your face.

809
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:27,994
Go!

810
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:31,764
Excuse me, sir.

811
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:38,379
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

812
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:41,043
Yes.

813
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:45,448
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

814
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:51,176
Please, come forward.

815
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:26,752
May I have the password, please?

816
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:29,857
Fidelio.

817
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:36,153
That's right, sir.
That is the password

818
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,029
for admittance.

819
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:43,734
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

820
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:52,314
The password for the house?

821
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,184
I'm sorry, I...

822
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,393
I seem to have...

823
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,695
forgotten it.

824
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,839
That's unfortunate.

825
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:26,615
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

826
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,712
or if you never knew it.

827
01:26:30,986 --> 01:26:35,048
You will kindly remove your mask.

828
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,839
Now...

829
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:59,138
get undressed.

830
01:27:05,487 --> 01:27:08,787
Get undressed?

831
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:13,154
Remove your clothes.

832
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,071
Gentlemen, please...

833
01:27:30,946 --> 01:27:33,643
Remove your clothes.

834
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:37,752
Or would you like us to do it for you?

835
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,380
Stop!

836
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:49,060
Let him go.

837
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:52,761
Take me!

838
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:57,829
I am ready to redeem him.

839
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:07,779
You are ready to redeem him?

840
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:11,219
Yes.

841
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:18,251
Are you sure you understand
what you're taking upon yourself...

842
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:20,584
in doing this?

843
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,436
Very well.

844
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:38,342
You are free.

845
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:41,943
But I warn you...

846
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:45,144
if you make any further inquiries,

847
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:49,347
or if you say a single word
to anyone

848
01:28:49,558 --> 01:28:52,255
about what you have seen,

849
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:56,954
there will be
the most dire consequences for you

850
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,190
and your family.

851
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:03,064
Do you understand?

852
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:45,347
What is going to happen to that woman?

853
01:29:46,248 --> 01:29:49,240
No one can change her fate now.

854
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:52,812
When a promise has been made here...

855
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,247
there is no turning back.

856
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:58,789
Go!

857
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,291
It's okay.

858
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:12,949
I'm sorry.

859
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:18,058
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

860
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,090
Oh, God.

861
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:24,103
I just had such a horrible dream.

862
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,467
What time is it?

863
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,775
It's a little after 4.

864
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,538
Did you just get home?

865
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:40,984
It took longer than I thought.

866
01:32:41,356 --> 01:32:43,552
You must be exhausted.

867
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:47,526
Come on, lie down.

868
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:58,033
What were you dreaming?

869
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:07,180
Just these weird things.

870
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:08,883
What was it?

871
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:15,285
It was so weird.

872
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:19,156
Tell me.

873
01:33:40,315 --> 01:33:43,478
We were in a deserted city...

874
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:50,959
and our clothes were gone.

875
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:54,795
We were naked...

876
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,929
and I was terrified...

877
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:10,411
and I felt ashamed.

878
01:34:11,513 --> 01:34:13,174
Oh, God...

879
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:21,514
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

880
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:28,460
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

881
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:36,861
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

882
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:43,100
I felt wonderful.

883
01:34:47,582 --> 01:34:52,281
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

884
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:55,950
stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

885
01:35:00,929 --> 01:35:03,830
and a man walked out of the woods.

886
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:12,370
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

887
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:16,875
The naval officer.

888
01:35:21,783 --> 01:35:23,945
He stared at me...

889
01:35:28,957 --> 01:35:31,119
and then he just laughed.

890
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:36,190
He just laughed at me.

891
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,278
But that's not the end...

892
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:56,613
is it?

893
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,688
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

894
01:36:10,632 --> 01:36:12,600
It's too awful.

895
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,235
It's only a dream.

896
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,855
He was kissing me...

897
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,070
and then we were making love.

898
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:01,639
Then there were all these
other people around us,

899
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:04,682
hundreds of them, everywhere.

900
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:07,412
Everyone was fucking.

901
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:14,820
And then I...

902
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:20,391
I was fucking other men.

903
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,764
So many...

904
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:27,204
I don't know how many I was with.

905
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:35,249
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

906
01:37:38,119 --> 01:37:41,020
just fucking all these men.

907
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:48,157
I wanted to make fun of you...

908
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:52,298
to laugh in your face.

909
01:37:55,636 --> 01:38:00,574
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

910
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:17,852
That must have been
when you woke me up.

911
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:03,570
Shit!

912
01:39:40,608 --> 01:39:42,736
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

913
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:51,447
Anything else?

914
01:39:52,753 --> 01:39:54,517
No, thank you.

915
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:02,730
Excuse me.

916
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:06,894
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Café?

917
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:10,537
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

918
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:19,570
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

919
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:22,715
He's playing piano
over there right now.

920
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:24,484
Nick Nightingale?

921
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:27,546
Sure, he comes in here.

922
01:40:30,324 --> 01:40:33,123
Look, maybe you can help me,

923
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:36,957
because it's important
that I get in touch with him.

924
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:39,894
Do you know where he's staying?

925
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:46,699
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

926
01:40:46,908 --> 01:40:49,240
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

927
01:40:49,577 --> 01:40:52,012
I'm actually an old friend of his.

928
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:55,104
Well, doctor...

929
01:40:57,585 --> 01:41:01,249
he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

930
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:06,158
To be perfectly honest...

931
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:10,191
it's a medical matter.

932
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:14,932
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

933
01:41:42,196 --> 01:41:43,196
Excuse me.

934
01:41:44,799 --> 01:41:47,029
Hi! How can I help you?

935
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:51,000
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

936
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:55,134
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

937
01:41:55,376 --> 01:41:56,935
He checked out?

938
01:42:01,015 --> 01:42:04,918
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I'm afraid not.

939
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:08,085
When did he check out?

940
01:42:09,557 --> 01:42:11,548
About 5:00 this morning.

941
01:42:11,759 --> 01:42:13,158
5:00?

942
01:42:14,829 --> 01:42:16,797
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

943
01:42:16,998 --> 01:42:19,763
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

944
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:26,738
Did you notice anything...

945
01:42:27,108 --> 01:42:28,542
I don't know...

946
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:32,269
unusual about him
when he left?

947
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:35,680
Unusual?

948
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,309
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

949
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:42,371
No, I'm an old friend of his.

950
01:42:42,423 --> 01:42:43,515
Really?

951
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:45,448
I'm a doctor.

952
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:53,364
- Well... Bill...?
- Sure.

953
01:42:55,503 --> 01:42:58,438
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill,

954
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:02,007
because there was something
a little strange

955
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:04,735
about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

956
01:43:05,079 --> 01:43:07,446
Really? What was that?

957
01:43:15,623 --> 01:43:20,185
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

958
01:43:20,728 --> 01:43:22,628
with two men.

959
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,393
Big guys.

960
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,892
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

961
01:43:29,103 --> 01:43:32,767
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with,

962
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:34,771
if you know what I mean.

963
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:39,035
Anyways...

964
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:45,114
I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

965
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:50,756
To be perfectly honest,
I also thought he looked a little scared.

966
01:43:51,759 --> 01:43:52,954
Scared?

967
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:57,323
He said he wanted to check out.

968
01:43:57,531 --> 01:44:01,434
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

969
01:44:01,769 --> 01:44:05,637
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

970
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:10,538
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

971
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:12,474
But they saw it and took it,

972
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:15,615
and said that
any mail or messages for him

973
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:20,378
would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

974
01:44:21,222 --> 01:44:23,714
And then they just
took him off in a car.

975
01:44:25,025 --> 01:44:27,323
Do you have any idea where they went?

976
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:29,661
No, not a clue.

977
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:43,938
I certainly appreciate your help.

978
01:44:44,145 --> 01:44:45,806
Anytime, Bill.

979
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:24,579
Oh, the good doctor!

980
01:45:26,353 --> 01:45:31,291
- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

981
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:33,157
Good, good.

982
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:38,298
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

983
01:45:40,935 --> 01:45:44,701
I think you forgot the mask.

984
01:45:45,973 --> 01:45:47,441
It's not there?

985
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:50,934
Maybe you left it at the party?

986
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,609
I don't think so.

987
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:03,080
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

988
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,290
Sure.

989
01:46:08,629 --> 01:46:10,529
Here we are.

990
01:46:12,066 --> 01:46:16,128
That was 150 for the rental,
200, you said, for my trouble,

991
01:46:16,337 --> 01:46:19,873
25 for the mask. Sorry...

992
01:46:22,576 --> 01:46:24,203
Three hundred seventy-five.

993
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:28,110
Yes, dear?

994
01:46:28,482 --> 01:46:29,950
Come, come.

995
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:34,153
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

996
01:46:43,464 --> 01:46:46,263
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

997
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,100
Goodbye, gentlemen.

998
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:52,667
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

999
01:46:53,607 --> 01:46:55,871
Well, Dr. Harford...

1000
01:46:57,144 --> 01:46:58,703
here is your receipt.

1001
01:47:00,047 --> 01:47:02,311
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1002
01:47:03,484 --> 01:47:05,816
and thanks for the business.

1003
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:13,691
Mr. Milich, last night...

1004
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:18,932
you were going to call the police.

1005
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:24,531
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1006
01:47:24,738 --> 01:47:29,676
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1007
01:47:30,344 --> 01:47:32,073
anything at all...

1008
01:47:33,047 --> 01:47:35,641
it needn't be a costume.

1009
01:48:03,077 --> 01:48:04,340
Come in.

1010
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,845
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1011
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:12,944
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1012
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:18,091
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30,
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1013
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:22,692
Well, something's come up,
and I'm not going to be able to see them.

1014
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:26,594
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit them in.
Otherwise, just apologize

1015
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,734
- and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1016
01:48:29,136 --> 01:48:33,232
And please call the garage
and have them get my car out in half an hour.

1017
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:34,805
No problem.

1018
01:52:24,605 --> 01:52:27,267
Any calls for me?

1019
01:52:27,474 --> 01:52:31,411
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1020
01:52:32,713 --> 01:52:35,148
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1021
01:52:36,049 --> 01:52:38,017
Look, I got all these right.

1022
01:52:38,218 --> 01:52:40,209
You got all of those right?

1023
01:52:40,721 --> 01:52:42,485
Every single one of them?

1024
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:44,220
That's good.

1025
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:45,949
You hungry?

1026
01:52:47,094 --> 01:52:48,425
Sort of.

1027
01:52:48,629 --> 01:52:50,427
Want to eat at 7?

1028
01:52:50,631 --> 01:52:52,929
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1029
01:52:53,133 --> 01:52:57,092
I have some appointments
at the office.

1030
01:52:57,304 --> 01:52:59,363
You have to go out again tonight?

1031
01:52:59,573 --> 01:53:00,573
I'm afraid so.

1032
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:04,301
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1033
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:07,380
We'll see about that, okay?

1034
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:12,078
He could be a watchdog...

1035
01:53:12,286 --> 01:53:13,720
We'll see.

1036
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,719
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1037
01:53:16,923 --> 01:53:20,553
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1038
01:53:20,761 --> 01:53:25,358
And Mike has $1.75.

1039
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:29,262
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1040
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:31,836
$0.75?

1041
01:53:33,707 --> 01:53:37,143
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1042
01:53:40,847 --> 01:53:44,147
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1043
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:47,343
Yeah, because you're going
to be taking. Right.

1044
01:53:47,688 --> 01:53:50,953
<i>And there were all these
other people around us.</i>

1045
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:53,794
<i>Hundreds of them, everywhere.</i>

1046
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:56,524
<i>Everyone was fucking.</i>

1047
01:53:57,497 --> 01:54:00,956
<i>And then I...
I was fucking other men.</i>

1048
01:54:02,369 --> 01:54:03,962
<i>So many...</i>

1049
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:07,405
<i>I don't know how many I was with.</i>

1050
01:55:44,905 --> 01:55:47,670
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1051
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,271
What is it?

1052
01:56:19,406 --> 01:56:20,601
Domino?

1053
01:56:20,974 --> 01:56:22,840
No, she's not in.

1054
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:29,043
Are you expecting her back soon?

1055
01:56:29,249 --> 01:56:30,739
No, I'm not.

1056
01:56:37,357 --> 01:56:40,816
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1057
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:42,992
Just a minute.

1058
01:56:50,036 --> 01:56:51,834
Can I say who it's from?

1059
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,707
Well, just tell her it's from...

1060
01:56:56,743 --> 01:56:57,743
Bill.

1061
01:56:58,278 --> 01:56:59,575
You're Bill?

1062
01:57:01,147 --> 01:57:05,175
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1063
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:08,654
Well, I suppose I am.

1064
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:11,286
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1065
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:13,684
Did she?

1066
01:57:16,563 --> 01:57:18,554
Why don't you come in for a second?

1067
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:22,625
Sure.

1068
01:57:43,423 --> 01:57:44,891
I'm Sally.

1069
01:57:45,659 --> 01:57:47,525
Hello, Sally.

1070
01:57:50,597 --> 01:57:55,535
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1071
01:57:59,139 --> 01:58:01,073
I have no idea.

1072
01:58:02,008 --> 01:58:03,999
You have no idea?

1073
01:58:09,516 --> 01:58:14,454
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1074
01:58:16,723 --> 01:58:19,522
She may not even be coming back?

1075
01:58:40,246 --> 01:58:41,475
I...

1076
01:58:44,884 --> 01:58:46,010
You...?

1077
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:50,621
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1078
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:52,252
Really?

1079
01:58:54,027 --> 01:58:56,792
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1080
01:58:56,997 --> 01:59:00,262
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1081
01:59:04,337 --> 01:59:06,669
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1082
01:59:12,312 --> 01:59:15,179
Why don't you have a seat?

1083
01:59:15,882 --> 01:59:17,611
Let's sit down.

1084
01:59:33,767 --> 01:59:38,136
- I don't quite know how to say this.
- You don't quite know how?

1085
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:46,308
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1086
01:59:48,882 --> 01:59:53,285
I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1087
01:59:56,389 --> 01:59:59,689
that she got the results
of a blood test this morning,

1088
01:59:59,893 --> 02:00:03,158
and it was HIV-positive.

1089
02:00:14,174 --> 02:00:16,006
HIV-positive?

1090
02:00:31,491 --> 02:00:36,361
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1091
02:00:43,603 --> 02:00:46,538
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1092
02:00:59,619 --> 02:01:02,316
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1093
02:01:02,822 --> 02:01:04,756
A cup of coffee maybe?

1094
02:01:13,366 --> 02:01:14,834
No, thank you.

1095
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:21,131
I think...

1096
02:01:22,509 --> 02:01:24,443
maybe I'd better be going.

1097
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:14,946
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1098
02:05:04,764 --> 02:05:07,790
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1099
02:05:08,001 --> 02:05:09,833
I'll bring it over to you.

1100
02:05:10,036 --> 02:05:11,128
Thank you.

1101
02:06:51,204 --> 02:06:52,569
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1102
02:06:52,772 --> 02:06:54,206
I'm Dr. Harford.

1103
02:06:54,407 --> 02:06:58,810
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1104
02:06:59,011 --> 02:07:01,105
Could you please
give me her room number?

1105
02:07:01,314 --> 02:07:05,114
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1106
02:07:05,485 --> 02:07:08,011
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1107
02:07:08,221 --> 02:07:10,417
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1108
02:07:15,027 --> 02:07:16,859
Miss Amanda Curran?

1109
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:18,961
That's right.

1110
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:23,158
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1111
02:07:27,206 --> 02:07:29,072
She died this afternoon?

1112
02:07:29,442 --> 02:07:32,776
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1113
02:07:33,246 --> 02:07:34,714
I'm sorry.

1114
02:08:22,895 --> 02:08:25,523
<i>Because it could cost me my life...</i>

1115
02:08:26,465 --> 02:08:28,490
<i>and possibly yours.</i>

1116
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:16,171
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1117
02:10:18,344 --> 02:10:19,607
Tonight?

1118
02:10:20,346 --> 02:10:22,440
No, no, that's okay.

1119
02:10:26,519 --> 02:10:29,545
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

1120
02:10:53,145 --> 02:10:54,442
Come in.

1121
02:10:56,515 --> 02:11:00,247
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1122
02:11:00,486 --> 02:11:03,251
- Let me have your coat.
- I was out anyway. Thank you.

1123
02:11:03,456 --> 02:11:04,821
How about a drink?

1124
02:11:05,424 --> 02:11:07,290
- Are you having one?
- Sure.

1125
02:11:07,727 --> 02:11:09,126
What would you like?

1126
02:11:09,628 --> 02:11:10,891
Just a little scotch.

1127
02:11:11,097 --> 02:11:12,189
Good.

1128
02:11:14,133 --> 02:11:15,362
How do you take it? Neat?

1129
02:11:15,568 --> 02:11:16,660
Please.

1130
02:11:18,404 --> 02:11:20,600
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1131
02:11:20,806 --> 02:11:24,606
- Alice and I had a wonderful time.
- Well, good.

1132
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:27,342
It was great seeing you both.

1133
02:11:27,546 --> 02:11:29,036
Cheers.

1134
02:11:29,715 --> 02:11:31,114
Were you playing?

1135
02:11:31,617 --> 02:11:34,882
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1136
02:11:36,155 --> 02:11:38,886
- Beautiful scotch.
- That's a 25-year-old.

1137
02:11:39,091 --> 02:11:41,583
- I'll send you over a case.
- No, please.

1138
02:11:41,794 --> 02:11:42,794
Why not?

1139
02:11:46,265 --> 02:11:48,393
You feel like playing?

1140
02:11:48,601 --> 02:11:51,935
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1141
02:11:54,507 --> 02:11:55,975
I was just...

1142
02:11:58,778 --> 02:11:59,836
Listen...

1143
02:12:06,452 --> 02:12:11,390
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1144
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:15,726
I need to talk to you
about something.

1145
02:12:16,629 --> 02:12:17,858
Sure.

1146
02:12:21,066 --> 02:12:22,727
It's a little bit awkward.

1147
02:12:25,404 --> 02:12:28,271
And I have to be completely frank.

1148
02:12:30,476 --> 02:12:32,501
What kind of problem are you having?

1149
02:12:37,183 --> 02:12:39,277
It isn't a medical problem.

1150
02:12:44,924 --> 02:12:46,358
Actually...

1151
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:50,194
it concerns you.

1152
02:13:03,242 --> 02:13:06,303
I know what happened last night.

1153
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:13,877
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1154
02:13:18,557 --> 02:13:21,925
And I think you just might...

1155
02:13:23,295 --> 02:13:26,754
have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1156
02:13:40,079 --> 02:13:42,548
I'm sorry, Victor, I...

1157
02:13:44,517 --> 02:13:47,748
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1158
02:13:49,889 --> 02:13:52,517
Please, Bill, no games.

1159
02:13:54,693 --> 02:13:56,183
I was there.

1160
02:13:58,130 --> 02:13:59,689
At the house.

1161
02:14:03,235 --> 02:14:06,330
I saw everything that went on.

1162
02:14:18,250 --> 02:14:22,187
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1163
02:14:25,824 --> 02:14:29,158
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1164
02:14:30,362 --> 02:14:32,057
how you'd heard about it,

1165
02:14:32,264 --> 02:14:35,894
let alone got yourself
through the door.

1166
02:14:39,738 --> 02:14:44,676
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player,

1167
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:48,141
Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1168
02:14:49,114 --> 02:14:52,049
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1169
02:14:56,555 --> 02:14:58,353
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1170
02:15:00,192 --> 02:15:01,751
It was mine.

1171
02:15:02,127 --> 02:15:04,186
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1172
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:08,091
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1173
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:10,997
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people,

1174
02:15:11,203 --> 02:15:14,173
and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1175
02:15:21,847 --> 02:15:23,747
What can I say?

1176
02:15:30,122 --> 02:15:31,453
I had...

1177
02:15:32,958 --> 02:15:34,517
absolutely...

1178
02:15:35,461 --> 02:15:40,058
no idea you were involved
in any way.

1179
02:15:41,533 --> 02:15:43,627
I know you didn't, Bill.

1180
02:15:45,504 --> 02:15:47,563
But I also know that you...

1181
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:51,168
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning,

1182
02:15:51,377 --> 02:15:53,175
and talked to the desk clerk.

1183
02:15:54,713 --> 02:15:56,374
How do you know that?

1184
02:15:58,384 --> 02:16:00,409
Because I had you followed.

1185
02:16:06,358 --> 02:16:08,019
You had me followed?

1186
02:16:10,429 --> 02:16:12,761
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1187
02:16:13,132 --> 02:16:15,066
All right? I owe you an apology.

1188
02:16:15,267 --> 02:16:17,998
This was for your own good, believe me.

1189
02:16:18,404 --> 02:16:22,398
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1190
02:16:22,608 --> 02:16:25,805
all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1191
02:16:26,211 --> 02:16:30,011
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1192
02:16:30,582 --> 02:16:32,482
banging Mrs. Nick.

1193
02:16:33,852 --> 02:16:37,083
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1194
02:16:39,158 --> 02:16:42,355
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1195
02:16:43,429 --> 02:16:46,399
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1196
02:16:47,232 --> 02:16:51,328
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1197
02:16:52,771 --> 02:16:54,899
Who do you think those people were?

1198
02:16:55,507 --> 02:16:57,703
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1199
02:16:57,910 --> 02:17:01,210
If I told you their names —
I'm not gonna tell you their names —,

1200
02:17:01,413 --> 02:17:05,213
but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1201
02:17:08,787 --> 02:17:10,949
Was it the second password?

1202
02:17:12,324 --> 02:17:14,019
Is that what gave me away?

1203
02:17:16,161 --> 02:17:18,459
Yes, finally.

1204
02:17:20,566 --> 02:17:22,898
But not because you didn't know it.

1205
02:17:24,803 --> 02:17:27,704
It's because there was
no second password.

1206
02:17:28,874 --> 02:17:33,436
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos,

1207
02:17:33,645 --> 02:17:36,137
and you showed up in a taxi.

1208
02:17:36,415 --> 02:17:40,113
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat,

1209
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:43,448
made out to you-know-who.

1210
02:18:01,173 --> 02:18:04,632
There was a woman there...

1211
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:12,178
who tried to warn me.

1212
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:19,153
I know.

1213
02:18:24,863 --> 02:18:26,661
Do you know who she was?

1214
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:42,340
She was a hooker.

1215
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:53,585
Sorry, but...

1216
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:56,751
that's what she was.

1217
02:19:01,133 --> 02:19:02,294
A hooker.

1218
02:19:17,216 --> 02:19:19,685
Suppose I told you...

1219
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:24,221
that everything that
happened to you there —

1220
02:19:25,757 --> 02:19:29,887
the threats, the girl's warnings,

1221
02:19:30,095 --> 02:19:32,860
her last-minute intervention —,

1222
02:19:33,065 --> 02:19:36,797
suppose I said that all of that...

1223
02:19:38,237 --> 02:19:40,865
was staged.

1224
02:19:42,975 --> 02:19:46,912
That it was a kind of charade.

1225
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:50,414
That it was fake.

1226
02:19:55,053 --> 02:19:56,384
Fake?

1227
02:19:58,156 --> 02:20:00,682
Yes. Fake.

1228
02:20:12,204 --> 02:20:14,138
Why would they do that?

1229
02:20:15,007 --> 02:20:16,202
Why?

1230
02:20:17,509 --> 02:20:19,238
In plain words...

1231
02:20:20,145 --> 02:20:22,671
to scare the living shit out of you.

1232
02:20:23,849 --> 02:20:27,285
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1233
02:20:27,753 --> 02:20:29,482
and what you'd seen.

1234
02:20:49,541 --> 02:20:51,168
Have you seen this?

1235
02:21:08,493 --> 02:21:10,484
Yes, I have.

1236
02:21:16,001 --> 02:21:19,062
I saw her body in the morgue.

1237
02:21:27,913 --> 02:21:31,110
Was she the woman at the party?

1238
02:21:43,428 --> 02:21:44,862
She was.

1239
02:21:59,177 --> 02:22:01,703
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1240
02:22:03,715 --> 02:22:05,615
was the woman at the party.

1241
02:22:14,259 --> 02:22:19,197
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1242
02:22:20,065 --> 02:22:23,501
You called it a fake, a charade.

1243
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:28,572
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade

1244
02:22:28,774 --> 02:22:32,642
ends with somebody turning up dead?

1245
02:22:38,517 --> 02:22:43,216
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1246
02:22:43,422 --> 02:22:46,221
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1247
02:22:46,425 --> 02:22:49,884
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1248
02:22:51,163 --> 02:22:54,793
That whole play-acted, "take me"
phony sacrifice

1249
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,631
that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1250
02:22:59,838 --> 02:23:03,468
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1251
02:23:03,675 --> 02:23:06,736
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1252
02:23:08,146 --> 02:23:12,515
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1253
02:23:13,185 --> 02:23:14,914
and the rest is in the paper.

1254
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:18,784
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1255
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:23,188
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1256
02:23:24,629 --> 02:23:29,567
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1257
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:31,596
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1258
02:23:31,803 --> 02:23:35,637
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1259
02:23:52,524 --> 02:23:56,688
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1260
02:23:57,129 --> 02:23:59,757
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1261
02:24:01,233 --> 02:24:03,531
But life goes on.

1262
02:24:03,969 --> 02:24:05,403
It always does,

1263
02:24:05,604 --> 02:24:07,094
until it doesn't.

1264
02:24:08,707 --> 02:24:10,641
But you know that, don't you?

1265
02:27:35,246 --> 02:27:37,772
I'll tell you everything.

1266
02:27:43,221 --> 02:27:45,485
I'll tell you everything.

1267
02:28:37,342 --> 02:28:39,538
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1268
02:28:56,461 --> 02:29:00,694
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1269
02:29:25,523 --> 02:29:26,615
That's nice.

1270
02:29:26,825 --> 02:29:29,453
I could put Sabrina in here.

1271
02:29:30,161 --> 02:29:32,630
It's really pretty.

1272
02:29:32,831 --> 02:29:34,822
It's old-fashioned.

1273
02:29:43,975 --> 02:29:45,204
He's big.

1274
02:29:45,410 --> 02:29:48,812
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1275
02:29:49,013 --> 02:29:50,276
You do?

1276
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:54,778
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1277
02:30:08,933 --> 02:30:10,958
What do you think we should do?

1278
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:17,665
What do I think we should do?

1279
02:30:17,876 --> 02:30:19,207
Look, Mommy!

1280
02:30:28,553 --> 02:30:31,215
What do I think?
I don't know.

1281
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:35,155
I mean, maybe...

1282
02:30:47,205 --> 02:30:50,698
Maybe I think...

1283
02:30:51,376 --> 02:30:53,674
we should be grateful.

1284
02:30:59,717 --> 02:31:01,310
Grateful...

1285
02:31:01,886 --> 02:31:06,824
that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1286
02:31:07,759 --> 02:31:09,454
adventures...

1287
02:31:11,896 --> 02:31:14,228
whether they were real...

1288
02:31:14,766 --> 02:31:16,996
or only a dream.

1289
02:31:26,277 --> 02:31:30,111
Are you sure of that?

1290
02:31:33,985 --> 02:31:35,646
Am I sure?

1291
02:31:51,469 --> 02:31:53,233
Only as sure as I am,

1292
02:31:53,438 --> 02:31:57,306
that the reality of one night...

1293
02:31:58,576 --> 02:32:01,443
let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1294
02:32:03,948 --> 02:32:06,349
can ever be the whole truth.

1295
02:32:13,124 --> 02:32:15,115
And no dream is ever...

1296
02:32:16,995 --> 02:32:18,759
just a dream.

1297
02:32:27,305 --> 02:32:29,330
The important thing is...

1298
02:32:31,242 --> 02:32:32,971
we're awake now...

1299
02:32:34,312 --> 02:32:36,644
and hopefully...

1300
02:32:39,617 --> 02:32:41,881
for a long time to come.

1301
02:32:45,556 --> 02:32:47,024
Forever.

1302
02:32:49,227 --> 02:32:50,695
Forever?

1303
02:32:53,031 --> 02:32:54,465
Forever.

1304
02:32:56,901 --> 02:33:00,462
Let's not use that word. You know?

1305
02:33:01,806 --> 02:33:03,774
It frightens me.

1306
02:33:14,052 --> 02:33:17,147
But I do love you...

1307
02:33:20,291 --> 02:33:21,986
and you know...

1308
02:33:23,194 --> 02:33:25,322
there is something very important

1309
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:28,261
that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1310
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,863
What's that?

1311
02:33:34,072 --> 02:33:35,540
Fuck.
