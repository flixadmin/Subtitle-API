I have heard that more than one Unsullied
has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.

168
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,847
May I ask you why?

169
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,310
Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

170
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,650
I do not know.

171
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,195
I must go.

(METAL CLANGING)

174
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,838
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

175
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,049
If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword.
Now get it up.

176
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,231
Come. Try it again.

177
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,235
Drive at me. Keep your shield up,
or I'll ring your head like a bell.

178
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,864
Shouldn't you be training, too?

179
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,743
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

180
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,790
How many brothers can say that
they've killed a White Walker and a Thenn?

181
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,334
I might be the first in history.

182
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,836
- JON: Shield up.
- ALLISER: These men need a firm hand.

183
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,671
Always have.

184
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,633
They're poachers and thieves.

185
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,261
Not soldiers.

186
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,018
That one hates me.

187
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,231
SAMWELL: If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander...

188
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,818
- He hates the wildlings.
- (BABY CRYING)

189
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,654
All the wildlings.

190
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,864
- Don't let them send us away.
- It's not a sure thing.

191
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,742
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years,

192
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,578
and people say he's a good man.
He's running against Ser Alliser...

193
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,997
Sam, don't let them send us away.

194
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,249
I told you.

195
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,794
Wherever you go, I go, too.

196
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,046
You can't leave. They'll execute you.

197
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,890
Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.

198
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,767
Shield up.

199
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,480

You're not cold, my lady?

00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,303
Never.

204
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,099
The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

Feel.

206
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,945
Are you a virgin?

207
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,118
No.

208
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,496
Good.

00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,172
Your Grace.

00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,383
The bastard of Winterfell.

211
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,977
You know who rules at Winterfell now?

212
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,563
Roose Bolton.

213
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,734
Hmm. The traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

214
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,570
Don't you want to avenge him?

215
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,200
I want a great many things, Your Grace.

216
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,410
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

217
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,830
I've been talking to your sworn brothers.

218
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,540
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

219
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,334
DAVOS: Many don't.

220
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,421
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

221
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,048
Why?

222
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,674
It's where she belonged.

223
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,094
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have
too much affection for the wildlings.

224
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,306
They were born on the wrong side of the Wall.

225
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,141
That doesn't make them monsters.

226
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,309
STANNIS: No matter.

227
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,978
I shall take back the North
from the thieves who stole it.

228
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,648
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

229
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,819
I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.

230
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,779
But if I'm to take Winterfell, I need more men.

231
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,782
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part...

232
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,909
I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch.

233
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,911
I'm talking about the wildlings.

234
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,129
Your Grace,

235
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,758
you want the wildlings
to march in your army?

236
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,552
If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them.

237
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,678
We'll take Winterfell.

238
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,472
Once the North is won,
I'll declare them citizens of the realm.

239
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:29,890
I'll give them land to live on.

240
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,103
It's a fair offer. More than fair.

241
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,063
I'll offer them their lives and their freedom

242
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,108
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

243
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,651
I don't think that's likely.

244
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,280
STANNIS: You admire him, don't you?

245
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,823
I respect him.

246
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,157
He likes you.

247
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,411
- Convince him to bend the knee, or he burns.
- Your Grace.

248
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,875
How much time do I have?

00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,376

will never be a great warrior.

My lord.

MAN: Sword up, my lord!

262
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,834
LITTLEFINGER: Some boys
develop more slowly.

263
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,128
He's still young.

264
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,214
ROYCE: He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

265
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,800
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

266
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,011
The gift of a great name.

267
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,640
Sometimes that's all one needs.

268
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,975
(GROANS LOUDLY)

269
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,481
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all you've done for me.

270
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,942
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

271
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,401
I have no doubt that on my return,

272
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,112
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

273
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,365
He'll be safe here.

274
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,242
As for his skills,

275
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,703
I make no promises.

276
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,677
Will we head north at some point?

277
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,264
He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.

278
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,642
We're a few days' ride from the King's Road.

279
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,061
- But that will take us...
- Us?

280
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,106
The only reason you're here

281
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,067
is because Jaime Lannister
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

282
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,155
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

283
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,157
No one knows what you look like.

284
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,244
No one cares. You're safe.

285
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,080
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

286
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,417
An attendant to a knight.

287
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,043
I'm not a knight.

288
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,254
That means you're not a squire.

289
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,630
Well, where would I go?

290
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,341
I don't care. I'm not your mother.

291
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,060
You swore to find the Stark girls.

292
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,855
I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.

293
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,149
- Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?

294
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,277
I didn't ask for your advice.

295
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,033
I don't want anyone following me.
I'm not a leader.

296
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,494
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

297
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,790
The good lords are dead,
and the rest are monsters.

298
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,168
(HORSES NEIGHING)

299
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,844
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

300
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,262
I did.

301
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,099
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

302
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,268
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

303
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,523
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

304
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,817
but he's not alone in that castle.

305
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,905
Do you trust all those knights and ladies,
stable boys and serving girls?

306
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,158
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

307
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,077
No. (CHUCKLES)

308
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,912
But I pay them well,

309
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,456
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

310
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,624
So where are we going?

311
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,252
To a land where you trust everyone?

312
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,963
To a land so far from here,

313
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,925
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

314
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,186
It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.

315
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,483
Your father was a...

316
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,361
A force to be reckoned with. He truly was.

317
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,199
I wouldn't presume to claim
to have known him as such, but...

318
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,785
But just being in his presence was enough

319
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,495
to make it so clear

320
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,706
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

321
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,544
What a force to be reckoned with.

322
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,297
Thank you so much for your kind words.

323
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,304
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

324
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:23,559
This tragedy... I never trusted Varys.
I often warned...

325
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,398
Your Grace.

326
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,695
Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

327
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,989
My deepest sympathies.

328
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,200
I apologize for my son's appearance.

329
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,702
Uncle, that's quite all right.

330
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,416
They call themselves Sparrows.

331
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,293
Bloody fanatics.

332
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,338
Religion has its place, of course,
but at a certain point...

333
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,092
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

334
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,429
I'm sure he'll grow out of it, whatever it is.

335
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,265
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

336
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,286
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

337
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,540
It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

338
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,461
What can I do for you?

339
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,797
You can forgive me.

340
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,383
What could you possibly have done
to warrant my forgiveness?

341
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,178
I led you into the darkness.

342
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,722
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

343
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,600
I tempted you into our...

344
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,101
unnatural relations.

345
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,649
And, of course, there was the king,

346
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,653
his boar hunt.

347
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,322
His wine.

348
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,495
I don't know what you're talking about.

349
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,289
I'm a different person now.

350
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,669
I've found peace in the light of the Seven.

351
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,254
You can, too.

352
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:19,174
They watch over all of us,
ready to dole out mercy

353
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:20,926
or justice.

354
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,765
Their world is at hand.

355
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,019
I will pray for your father's soul.

356
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,521
(LAUGHS)

357
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,567
The day Tywin Lannister's soul
needs your help...

358
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,453
- OLYVAR: It looks like Dorne.
- LORAS: It doesn't.

359
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,538
(OLYVAR LAUGHS)

360
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,872
It does.

361
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:55,711
That's the Sunspear bit, right there.

362
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,381
And that's where the mountains are.

363
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,550
And over here is...

364
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,803
Is Sunsnake?

365
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,179
Stonespear?

366
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,889
Sandstone.

367
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,433
Yes.

368
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,768
Yes, Sandstone.

369
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,563
Just there.

370
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,273
Fine.

371
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,736
It's Dorne.

372
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,905
We should go there.

373
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,659
I think we would have a lovely time,

374
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,786
judging by my experience.

375
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,871
That would be wonderful.

376
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,540
Dorne, Highgarden.

377
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,792
Anywhere but here.

378
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,428
We're late for dinner as it is.

379
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:48,930
You're very respectful.

380
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,807
I'm very hungry.

381
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,409
What's your name?

382
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,787
Olyvar, my lady.

383
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,125
I'm afraid my brother
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

384
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,928
My lady.

385
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:45,320
Perhaps you might consider
being a bit more discreet?

386
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,988
Why?

387
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,032
They all know about me anyway.

388
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,494
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

389
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,579
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

390
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,707
In any event,
you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

391
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,169
My intended? Please.

392
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,921
Tywin's dead.

393
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,965
That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

394
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,925
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

395
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,177
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

396
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,014
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

397
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,183
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

398
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,354
Which means you're trapped here
with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

399
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,689
Perhaps.

400
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:22,858
Perhaps?

401
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,027
Perhaps.

402
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:43,295
Eunuch, the spider, the Master of Whisperers.

403
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,964
Imp, halfman.

404
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,218
There are faster ways to kill yourself.

405
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,220
Not for a coward.

406
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,348
You are many things, my friend,
but not a coward.

407
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:00,896
You never told me why

408
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,355
you set me free.

409
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,524
Your brother asked me to.

410
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,985
Could have said no.

411
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,362
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

412
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,698
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

413
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,326
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

414
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,329
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

415
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,748
I didn't do it for you.

416
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,833
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

417
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,170
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

418
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,297
I don't believe in saviors.

419
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,800
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

420
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,305
You're going to have to find another soldier.

421
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,183
I'm done with Westeros,
and Westeros is done with me.

422
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,812
You have many admirable qualities,
self-pity is not one of them.

423
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,401
Any fool with a bit of luck
can find himself born into power.

424
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:52,280
But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

425
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,574
I'm not well-suited for work.

426
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,034
I think you are.

427
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,787
You have your father's instincts for politics,

428
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,038
and you have compassion.

429
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,415
Compassion? Yes.

430
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,836
I killed my lover with my bare hands.

431
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,798
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

432
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,841
I never said you were perfect.

433
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,804
What is it you want exactly?

434
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,347
Peace.

435
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,808
Prosperity.

436
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,186
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

437
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,522
Where the castles are made of gingerbread,

438
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,149
and the moats are filled with blackberry wine.

439
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,610
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

440
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,988
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

441
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,906
Perhaps.

442
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:40,245
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,
we assume there's no other way.

443
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,748
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

444
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,126
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

445
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,920
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

446
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,755
No, you won't.

447
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:55,969
But you could help another climb those steps
and take that seat.

448
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,888
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

449
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,266
but gentler than Stannis.

450
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,769
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

451
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,858
A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army
and the right family name.

452
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,193
Good luck finding him.

453
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,363
Who said anything about "him"?

454
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,411
You have a choice, my friend.

455
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:26,207
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace
and drink yourself to death,

456
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,794
or you can ride with me to Meereen,
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

457
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,380
and decide if the world is worth fighting for.

458
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,845
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

459
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,067
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

460
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,153
Looks like your friends
haven't been behaving themselves.

461
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,992
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

462
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,370
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

463
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:07,999
to a council of elders made up of both
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

464
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,127
All matters of consequence
will be brought to you for review.

465
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,837
Good.

466
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,422
They did ask for some concessions.

467
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:16,883
Concessions?

468
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,135
Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace.

469
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,097
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

470
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,183
HIZDAHR: Forgive me. You're right, of course.

471
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:29,145
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

472
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,815
DAENERYS:
I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.

473
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,110
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

474
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,113
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

475
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,865
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

476
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,410
DAENERYS: The fighting pits?

477
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,995
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

478
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,166
In the new world that you've brought to us,
free men would fight free men.

479
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,130
The pit fighters you liberated
pled for this opportunity.

480
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,632
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

481
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,717
No fighting pits.

482
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,302
Opening them would
show the people of Yunkai and Meereen

483
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,971
that you respect their traditions.

484
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,099
I do not respect
the tradition of human cockfighting.

485
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,225
If you...

486
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,602
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

487
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,399
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

488
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,901
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

489
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,236
DAARIO: You should reopen the fighting pits.

490
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,282
What?

491
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,868
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

492
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,289
She liked to drink pear brandy.

493
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,915
The older she got,

494
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,002
the less she made selling her body,
the more she wanted to drink.

495
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,755
So one day when I was 12,

496
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:40,008
she sold me to a slaver
she fucked the night before.

497
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,052
I'm sorry.

498
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,764
Why? I was a bad child.

499
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,642
I wasn't big, but I was quick

500
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,935
and I loved to fight.

501
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:55,273
So they sold me to a man in Tolos
who trained fighters for the pits.

502
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,817
I had my first match when I was 16.

503
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,611
You were sold into slavery,

504
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,113
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

505
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,282
- and you're defending the fighting pits?
- (LAUGHS)

506
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,328
I'm only here because of those pits.

507
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,705
I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,

508
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,458
a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.

509
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,834
Soon I was famous.

510
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:18,922
Ten thousand men and women screamed
my name when I stepped into the pit.

511
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,967
I made so much money for my master,
he set me free when he died.

512
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,512
I joined the Second Sons,

513
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,222
and then I met you.

You've made thousands of enemies
all across the world.

You're the Mother of Dragons.

He wants me to bend the knee.

And he wants the free folk to fight for him.

I'll give him this much, he's bold.

A life's work uniting them.

You didn't do it for power.
You didn't do it for glory.

You brought them together to save them

not if they're north of the Wall.
