1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,417
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,836
It's a samurai.

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,290
<i>Bring me the Flash,
or else your city falls.</i>

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,919
Barry's still stuck in the Speed Force?

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,002
I'm gonna get him out.
But I need your help.

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,222
Barry? It's me, Iris.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,099
Loud, cloud, proud!

8
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,304
Please come back to me.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,511
Barry, Iris is in trouble!

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,680
Flash is back!

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,734
<i>Flash, welcome home.</i>

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,023
The Flash is back in Central City.

13
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,521
You came back to me.

14
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,774
<i>I'm not going
anywhere ever again.</i>

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,702
Not only is this the most modern,
lavish penthouse on the market,

16
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,034
it also has one of the best views
in all of Central City.

17
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,668
Join me on the balcony.
See for yourself.

18
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,416
I couldn't care less about the view.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,206
Is it your most expensive listing?

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,792
- Yes, but the price is negotiable.
- I'll take it.

21
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,214
Yes!

22
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,969
Just let me lock up,
and I'll ride down with you.

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,808
Sorry. Not sure
which button does what.

24
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,597
Schmuck.

25
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,156
Damn it.

26
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,536
Dana. Yeah, listen,
I think I'm in some busted elevator...

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,906
I don't know...

28
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,079
No.

29
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,834
<i>Just take those old records
Off the shelf</i>

30
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,633
<i>I'll sit and listen
To 'em by myself</i>

31
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,721
<i>Today's music
Ain't got the same soul</i>

32
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,349
<i>I like that old-time rock 'n' roll</i>

33
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,141
<i>Don't try to take me to a disco</i>

34
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,061
<i>You'll never even get me
Out on the floor</i>

35
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,694
<i>In ten minutes I'll be late for the door</i>

36
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,534
<i>I like that old-time rock 'n' roll</i>

37
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,289
<i>What?</i>

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,916
Whoa.

39
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,171
No...

40
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,304
- Barry. Hi.
- Hey.

41
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:02,968
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

42
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,219
Doing what, exactly?

43
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,642
I'm just catching up on
all the TV I missed

44
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,102
while I was stuck in the Speed Force.

45
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,056
When you've been gone six months,
the world is a minefield of spoilers.

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,139
But Cisco hooked me up

47
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,022
with a 1,000-times sped up version
of my favorite shows.

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,061
Jon Snow died. Oh, he's alive.

49
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,986
And here I was thinking you'd need
a jump-start for your loopy brain.

50
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,363
Nope. Brain good. All of me is good.

51
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,113
Joe needs me. Crime scene.

52
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,164
That's okay.
I should probably get started

53
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,117
on our neglected wedding plans.

54
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,749
It's gonna take me forever
to get through this binder. So...

55
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,422
No, don't worry about it.
I'm done with it.

56
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,877
- You're done?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

57
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,634
I locked in a caterer,
I got you your favorite flowers.

58
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,963
I put a deposit on a venue
with an amazing view.

59
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,218
I got that seven-tier
raspberry chocolate cake.

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,637
Well, I guess you've got
everything covered.

61
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,596
So, my lovely fiancée
can remain stress-free.

62
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,638
Save me a bear claw?

63
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,692
Oh, no promises, Speedster.
You whoosh, you lose.

64
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,488
- What do we got, Joe?
- Not much to go off.

65
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,615
The only witness
was an elderly resident,

66
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,992
and she's still pretty rattled.

67
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,873
Hey.

68
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,669
Mr. Allen. Six months
and five minutes late.

69
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,041
Sorry, Captain Singh.

70
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,418
Thank you again for granting me
that extended sabbatical.

71
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,999
But I'm back, I'm ready to work,

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,005
and what can I say?
It's a beautiful day.

73
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,178
Sorry. What are we dealing with?

74
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,800
Well, I hope you had
a light breakfast.

75
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,884
No, I had a good spread, actually.
Pancakes, sausage, fruity cereal...

76
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,308
Whoa.

77
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,186
He's everywhere.

78
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,604
Far as we can tell,
it dropped him 100 stories.

79
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,400
Were you able to ID the vic?

80
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,908
Yeah. Kurt Weaver.
Worth billions. Capital "B."

81
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,860
What do you think, Mr. Allen?

82
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,412
You see the impacts on the ceiling?

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,157
And the repeated
lateral stress fissures on the frame?

84
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,541
This guy didn't just drop,
he was shaken to death.

85
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,207
Excuse me. Coming through.
CCPD Tech Consultant.

86
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,884
That's right. Look at the badge,
that means it's official.

87
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,171
He's aware that badge is plastic, right?

88
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,589
Fellas. So sorry I'm late.

89
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,845
The curls were not cooperating
this morning.

90
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,644
Good Lord.
Why would you show me that?

91
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,229
We think this is because of
some weird technical glitch.

92
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,228
And you're our weird tech expert.

93
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,144
It's completely ruined sriracha for me.

94
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,652
Yoink.

95
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,489
- That shouldn't be there.
- What is it?

96
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,532
It's encrypted code.

97
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,958
This wasn't a glitch. This was a hacker.

98
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,180
The Cortex's quantum algorithm
should decrypt this code in no time.

99
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,054
That should help us ID
our new hacker.

100
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,181
But while we wait, I've got
a little welcome-back gift for you.

101
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,811
Come, come. Walk with your boy.
Gather 'round, class.

102
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,276
Kablam!

103
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,570
I mean, that was a cool reveal
and everything,

104
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,445
but I've seen that suit.
I've actually already worn it.

105
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,449
Yeah. We all know you gave Barry's
suit a nice little fancy makeover.

106
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,826
Yeah, but you don't know
what you don't know.

107
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,081
And under all this red beautiful,
I've built in self-repairing armor,

108
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,955
nano-liquid circuitry,
full-spectrum scanning,

109
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,836
and a whole bunch of other big words.
Chief among them...

110
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,429
Your very own custom-made HUD.

111
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,804
This thing is loaded with maps,
schematics, delivery menus.

112
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,226
<i>You know that Thai place
you love so much?</i>

113
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,975
<i>- Yeah, the one with the pad see ew?
- You know how we pad see do.</i>

114
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,057
<i>Dude, this is awesome.
What else does it do?</i>

115
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,485
Well, lucky for you, I even wrote you
an instruction manual.

116
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,443
- Yay!
- Come on, we're not cavemen.

117
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,652
- Really good work.
<i>- I know!</i>

118
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,410
I'll look at this later.

119
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,371
Um, I gotta get back to CCPD.

120
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,950
And you can blame this on Cisco,
but I'm thinking Thai tonight?

121
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,878
Honestly, babe,
I'll probably be too tired to eat out

122
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,420
after our evening training session.

123
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,122
I canceled that.
Don't worry about that.

124
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,374
You canceled it?

125
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,544
Yeah, I mean,
I don't think we need it, right?

126
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,721
Besides, I'm back.
I'll make a reservation, okay?

127
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,717
It must be so nice having Barry back.

128
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,221
Yeah. Yes, it is.

129
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,931
But...

130
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,732
Well, I mean,
it's just gonna take some time

131
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,356
for him to get used to the new dynamics
around here, that's all.

132
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,561
Yeah.

133
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,148
You know, when Ronnie and I went from

134
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,780
just working together
to working together and dating,

135
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,406
we had some trouble communicating.

136
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,955
I mean, Barry and I
communicate just fine.

137
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,244
Yeah. I'm just saying,

138
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,453
we actually went to couples therapy
and it really helped a lot.

139
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,464
I appreciate the advice, Caitlin.
Really, I do.

140
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,301
But, you know, Barry and I have
known each other since childhood.

141
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,675
You know, we don't need therapy.
I mean...

142
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,599
- We're Barry and Iris, right?
- Right.

143
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,811
Thanks, though. I mean, I don't have
anything against it. It's just...

144
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,395
You're Barry and Iris. Gotcha.

145
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,770
Unauthorized breach incoming.
We gotta move.

146
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,028
Don't change, don't change,
don't change, don't change...

147
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,110
Caitlin, let's go!

148
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,452
You ready?

149
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,922
For anything.

150
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,130
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire!

151
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,341
- Hey.
- Girl...

152
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,759
Hey, you wanna give me
a little more notice next time?

153
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,846
You know people who want to kill us
come through here, right?

154
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,847
Oh, my bad, guys.

155
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,730
Cisco, that was very heroic of you
to just jump in,

156
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,686
protecting Gypsy like that.
It's very impressive.

157
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,732
Dude, I'm protecting you from her.
She would've vaporized you guys.

158
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,857
Pfft.

159
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,738
He's not lying.

160
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,787
As you were.

161
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,785
Okay.

162
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,251
- So, you almost ready for our date?
- Yeah. Almost.

163
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,453
Um...

164
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,756
I hit a snag in trying to decrypt
this hacker code for the CCPD.

165
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,010
I mean, you know how we do.
It's just kind of like <i>The Matrix...</i>

166
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,336
You care about none of this.

167
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,173
Just give me, like, one hour.
Two, tops. And then...

168
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,182
It's you and me, promise.

169
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,345
You're lucky you are so cute.

170
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,681
- And you are amazing.
- Yeah.

171
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,230
And you're so right
about the cute thing, too, huh.

172
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,438
- BRB.
- Okay.

173
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,462
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

174
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,412
Guys, there's a car going 120,
swerving between lanes.

175
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,830
Someone's going to get killed.

176
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,124
- You both need to get out there.
- That's one car. I got it.

177
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,325
Yeah, but I can...

178
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,419
I can help you.

179
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,216
Help! Help!

180
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,186
<i>Okay, guys, it's a runaway.
The driver's trapped inside.</i>

181
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,558
<i>I'm gonna change his trajectory.</i>

182
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,684
Okay. Then turn him left.

183
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,523
There's a turn-off
for runaway trucks coming up.

184
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,936
Just clear a path, and the car
will come to a safe stop there.

185
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,312
<i>No, no, no,
I'm gonna push him right.</i>

186
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,068
<i>That street's empty.
I can help him there.</i>

187
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,444
<i>Barry, you can't go
down that road.</i>

188
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,528
What? Why?

189
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,449
Because they started construction
on that street three months ago.

190
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,003
No, no, no, no, no.

191
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,749
I know a guy almost died,

192
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,795
but what happened to this sexy beast
here today is the real tragedy.

193
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,167
It could've been a lot worse.

194
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,499
I'm sorry, guys. This one is all on me.

195
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,210
Okay, so, my dad talked to the driver,
Tim Kwon, he's fine.

196
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,047
He's gonna question him and see
if they can figure out who did this.

197
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,009
- Cisco, what do we got?
- Beginning auto-topsy, now.

198
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,391
That is the same weird code
from the elevator murder scene.

199
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,568
- Wait. Doesn't that mean...
- Our hacker's got a hit list.

200
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,727
Can you crack it?

201
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,105
Man, I've been trying to
crack this code all day.

202
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,191
It looks like a virus.

203
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,906
Well, yeah. Because it's
a computer virus. I mean...

204
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,736
No, no, no. Scooch.

205
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,196
<i>Oh, I feel violated.</i>

206
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,460
- It looks like an organic virus.
- But with a digital sub-base.

207
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,209
Our killer isn't just hacking
machines, he's controlling them.

208
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,380
Our hacker's not a hacker.

209
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,753
He's a meta.

210
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,051
Is there a connection
between the two victims?

211
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,594
There's nothing online.

212
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,883
But their names, Weaver, Kwon,
they sound very familiar to me.

213
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,723
I started collecting these tech
magazines in high school, they're...

214
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,141
Those are the magazines
you collected in high school?

215
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,021
Okay, that's hurtful.
That's really hurtful.

216
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,441
Anyway, I'm 90% sure
that's where I read those names.

217
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,938
Okay, great. Start digging.

218
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,320
Barry, can I talk to you
for a second?

219
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,487
Mm-hmm.

220
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,040
Hey, about what happened, I'm sorry.
I should've listened to you.

221
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,247
It's just sometimes when I'm out
there, things move so fast,

222
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,127
and I'm really excited
to be the Flash again.

223
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,457
Anyway, I hope you're not mad.

224
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,377
And you are. You're mad, aren't you?

225
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,671
No, no. I'm not mad.

226
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,262
I just think with us being engaged,
and now we're working together,

227
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,719
that it's more important than ever
that we communicate.

228
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,307
I completely agree.

229
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,306
Good. Because Caitlin mentioned
something earlier,

230
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,564
and I sort of dismissed it. But now, I'm
really thinking that it could help us.

231
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,643
What is it?

232
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,645
Couples therapy.

233
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,323
- Couples therapy? You...
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,410
- We're not, like, in trouble, are we?
- No, no. No, of course not.

235
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,491
I just think that any couple
that's doing everything we're doing

236
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,702
could use some advice.

237
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,202
Mm-hmm.

238
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,167
We're just talking about a tune-up.

239
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,499
I mean,
there's nothing wrong with that, right?

240
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,131
A tune-up. Right, yeah. I mean...

241
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,678
Sure. If it's what you wanna do,
then sure, yeah. Let's try it.

242
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,758
Great. 'Cause we've got an appointment
in 30 minutes. I'll get my purse.

243
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,847
What?

244
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,406
Later.

245
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,284
- Hi. Iris?
- Hi.

246
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,987
- Hi, Barry.
- Hello.

247
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,289
Hi, I'm Dr. Sharon Finkel.

248
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,992
I am so sorry I kept you waiting.

249
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,669
No, no. It's fine.
Thank you for squeezing us in.

250
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,623
Well, you made it sound so urgent
on the phone.

251
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,130
No. Not urgent.

252
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,633
I'm excited. To dive in.

253
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,515
- Right?
- Oh, absolutely. I love therapy.

254
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,098
- Oh, have you been before?
- Just once. When I was a kid.

255
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,646
- After my mom died.
<i>- Oh, your mom...</i>

256
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,642
But I'm okay with that.

257
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,901
I mean, I'm not okay with it, obviously.
I mean, I'd prefer that she was alive.

258
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,572
I just meant that
I've already dealt with it.

259
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,447
So, I don't think
it's worth writing down.

260
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:16,406
These notes are just for me.
No one is judging you guys.

261
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,581
Yes, we know.

262
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,625
Well, my dad died, too.

263
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,293
Just for your notes.

264
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,421
So, Barry,
Iris filled me in a little bit

265
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,795
about the two of you
on the phone before.

266
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,509
<i>- Getting married.</i>
- Yeah.

267
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,929
Yeah, it's been a long road,
getting here.

268
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,474
First, us growing up together.

269
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,599
And then I was engaged
to someone else.

270
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,727
- Okay.
- That's worth a write-down.

271
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,979
He's actually dead, too.

272
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,482
You two have had to deal with
a lot of trauma.

273
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,983
- Well...
- No, not...

274
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,486
- Eddie and Ronnie.
- I mean, a little.

275
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,818
- My mother, H.R.
- Not too much.

276
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,618
- Laurel. Snart.
- Some.

277
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,288
- We've been to a few funerals.
- Yeah.

278
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,960
So, Barry, why do you think Iris
wanted you two to see me today?

279
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,039
Well, Iris and I,
we recently started working together.

280
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,175
You see, I went away for a while on a...

281
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,714
- Business trip.
- Business trip.

282
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,925
For six months.

283
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,551
I guess now, yeah, we're just
learning to get back in sync.

284
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,599
To sync up again. Is that right?

285
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,565
Well, there's no right or wrong, Barry.

286
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,066
Right.

287
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,649
I think we could work on
listening a little bit more, right?

288
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,729
Yeah.

289
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,406
Or else, someone could get really hurt.

290
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,073
Like if they crash their car into a
brick wall, going 100 miles per hour.

291
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,829
She means that emotionally.

292
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,581
Do I?

293
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,960
Hello, <i>mamacita.</i> They don't
make 'em like you anymore.

294
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,288
What the hell?

295
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,459
Easy, it's just the Motherboard
of the Month, July of '07. Okay?

296
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,010
- Look at her. Err.
- I kind of wish it was a girl.

297
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,679
Baby, it's been hours. You guys
haven't made any progress yet?

298
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,764
No mention of Kurt Weaver or Tim Kwon,

299
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,387
or any connection
between the two of them.

300
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,720
Until now. Got 'em.

301
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,685
Take note, people. It's only hoarding
if it doesn't pay off.

302
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,225
Okay, so, that's Tim Kwon,
that's Kurt Weaver,

303
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,402
that's Sheila Agnani...

304
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,479
Who's that guy?

305
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,028
- Sorry about that.
- No. It's definitely my fault.

306
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,882
You don't have any idea
who would want to do you harm?

307
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,017
Not even a gut feeling?

308
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,890
No. I mean, everyone loves
a billionaire, right?

309
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,305
No, I have no idea.

310
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,726
Grenade! Everybody, move!

311
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,829
<i>So, what would you say
your goals are for this session?</i>

312
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,625
Well, I just want to know that

313
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,759
Barry hears my concerns about our
issues with miscommunication.

314
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,049
- I gotta go.
- You gotta go?

315
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,596
- He's gotta go.
- Yeah.

316
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,938
Sorry. This was... Sorry.

317
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,440
You're gonna write down that
he ran out of here, aren't you?

318
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,642
Yes.

319
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,610
Get down!

320
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,234
Everybody okay?

321
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,241
I don't know, it must've been a dud.

322
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,874
Same corrupted code. Same guy.

323
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,173
Someone very creatively tried to kill
Tim Kwon and Kurt Weaver.

324
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,419
Where's Kwon now?

325
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,376
He ran out of here,
scared out of his mind.

326
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,382
He wouldn't even wait
for a protected escort.

327
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,636
But the good news is, I found
a connection between our victims.

328
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,967
Four years ago,
Kurt Weaver and Tim Kwon

329
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,516
created an app in their garage
with two other programmers.

330
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,141
Some kind of malware called Kilg%re.

331
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,019
And then they sold it off
to a big tech company.

332
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,811
So, that's how they made their money.

333
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,105
I saw this guy. He was here.

334
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,858
Ramsey Deacon.
Looks like we found our meta.

335
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,065
And for some reason,
he's going after his old partners.

336
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,274
It's like <i>Silicon Valley</i>

337
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,906
if Richard went nuts and started
killing everyone at Pied Piper.

338
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,534
I feel like he's got more of
an anarchist Gilfoyle vibe.

339
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,614
Erlich, maybe.

340
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,622
Guys, I love that we're so confident
in our ability to apprehend villains

341
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,625
that we can have this debate,
but, hi, what about her?

342
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,165
That's Sheila Agnani.
She's like a big deal tech guru now.

343
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,959
She could be next on Deacon's list.
We'll definitely have to protect her.

344
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,719
Yeah, well, my dad and Wally
can do that, right?

345
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,920
- I'm on it.
- Great.

346
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,047
- I'll keep working on the code.
- Sure.

347
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,470
Sorry about therapy.

348
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,892
It's okay. I told Dr. Finkel
that you had a work emergency.

349
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,313
- True. Kind of.
- Yeah.

350
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,774
And she had a cancellation
this afternoon,

351
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,351
so, we should get over there.

352
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,943
- Don't want to be late.
- No. Yeah, let's get back in there.

353
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,403
This guy is a living computer virus.
That's a new one.

354
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,785
Look at this code. From the elevator,
to the car, to the bomb robot,

355
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,243
this code keeps changing,
but I can't figure out why.

356
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,123
Okay, we have to remember
that it's not just digital,

357
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,374
it's bio-digital.

358
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,833
Most organic viruses mutate
to avoid being killed.

359
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,669
So, if we manage to create
digital antibodies,

360
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,924
then we can shut this guy down.

361
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,638
Oh! Nice one!

362
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,558
Hi.

363
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,680
I'm so glad you're here.

364
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,601
'Cause I truly, deeply,
from the bottom of my heart,

365
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,852
I am sorry,

366
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,019
but I'm gonna have to cancel our date.

367
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,776
If you're gonna vi-blast me,
can I at least pick the spot?

368
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,358
It's fine, Cisco.

369
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,360
- I get it.
- You get it?

370
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,408
Yeah, what's not to get?
You have to work, so...

371
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,206
We will cancel our date.

372
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,539
Well, good luck, you guys.
I hope it works out.

373
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,710
What a cool chick.
She took that so well.

374
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,302
No. No, she didn't.

375
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,263
When a girl says she gets it,
what she really means

376
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,057
is she doesn't get it at all.

377
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,842
I'm confused.

378
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,303
Don't be. Very simple.

379
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,481
You, my friend, are in so much trouble.

380
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,528
You just had to fall for the girl

381
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,321
in head-to-toe black leather,
didn't you?

382
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,409
We're back. That was quick. Even for me.

383
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:10,902
That's funny.

384
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,197
Inside joke between us.

385
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,456
<i>Work emergency aside,</i>

386
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,745
I have a sneaking suspicion that
you'd rather be somewhere else, Barry.

387
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,710
No, no. I mean, we do have

388
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,134
a big work thing
that we're dealing with.

389
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,758
- It's important.
- Yeah, but so is this.

390
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,553
You know, if we're not on the same page,
Barry, people could die.

391
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,885
- Ah.
- Metaphorically.

392
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,975
No. No, no, don't hold back.

393
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,437
Turn to Iris, look her in the eyes,
and tell her what you wanted to say.

394
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,981
I don't know... Well, I...

395
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,196
I said I was sorry about this morning.

396
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,869
Iris, turn to Barry. Talk to him.

397
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,666
It's not just this morning, Barry.

398
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,543
You canceled training the other day
without asking me.

399
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,665
<i>Training?</i>

400
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,791
- Swimming.
- For a marathon.

401
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,843
It's a triathlon.

402
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,555
Anyway, I didn't think canceling
training was that big of a deal.

403
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,632
Yeah, but you made
all those wedding plans, too,

404
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,138
and you didn't consult me.

405
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,765
I was trying
to be a good fiancé.

406
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,098
I'd think most brides would be happy

407
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,274
that their future spouse cared about
helping with the wedding.

408
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,771
That is a good thing, right?

409
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,440
Look, I don't know... I mean,
I guess our wires have gotten crossed

410
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,274
a few times the last few days,

411
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,074
but I think that hardly rises
to the level of a crisis.

412
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,079
After everything
we've been through together,

413
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,538
you and me, we're Barry and Iris.
We're the gold standard.

414
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,659
I am so in love with you...

415
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,211
Then how could you leave me?

416
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,216
You left me, Barry. You just left me.

417
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,843
Standing there alone.

418
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,005
How could you do that?

419
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,788
All the listening devices are in place.

420
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,092
Well, keep your ears open.
Gotta make sure she's safe.

421
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,586
Yeah.

422
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,636
What? I like punk music.

423
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,727
Tim?

424
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,180
What the hell, man?
You can't just come into my house.

425
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,981
'Cause you wouldn't return my calls.
I really...

426
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,151
If it's about your weird crush,
let it go, Tim.

427
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,944
- We are not happening.
- Sheila, listen.

428
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,146
Deacon's coming for us.

429
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,856
He wants payback for
what we did to him.

430
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,361
What did we do to him?

431
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,283
Kurt scrubbed any connection
between us from the net.

432
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,783
So, as far as the world's concerned,
we're innocent.

433
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,862
But we're not.

434
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,457
I should have never let you talk me
into going along with this.

435
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,000
And now, Kurt's dead.

436
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,076
Deacon killed him.

437
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,787
- He did not.
- Oh, yes.

438
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,207
He did.

439
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,886
Well, this is a nice house.
How much did you pay for it?

440
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,594
Ten mil?

441
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,646
Let's talk about this.
We can make it right.

442
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,182
Shut up, Tim!

443
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,899
You could have had all this, too.
This all could have been yours.

444
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,356
Kilg%re was my idea.

445
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,737
And you three stole it away from me.

446
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,113
Somebody had to.

447
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,487
Otherwise, it would have just been
a halfway clever idea

448
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,996
that died in someone's garage.

449
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,285
- Sheila...
- No. I'm not

450
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,704
going to apologize
because after four years,

451
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,710
you finally found some balls.

452
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,877
I found something else.

453
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,048
Something I never had with my family
or at MIT,

454
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,213
- or with any of you.
- Really?

455
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,376
And what was that?

456
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,003
Power.

457
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,304
You're not still diabetic, are you?

458
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,564
Those new computer-controlled
insulin pumps

459
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,150
are a real lifesaver.

460
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,819
Way too much insulin...

461
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,105
Well, that can be lethal.

462
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,442
And how should we kill you?

463
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,414
He put her in insulin shock.

464
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,335
Glucose.

465
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,186
Deacon took him.
He took Tim.

466
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,281
No sign of Deacon or Kwon

467
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,485
on facial recognition,
traffic cameras, nothing.

468
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,820
We don't even know
if Kwon is still alive.

469
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,488
We gotta move fast.

470
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,325
Where were you two?

471
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,753
- Dry cleaners.
- Wedding... Cleaners. Dry cleaners.

472
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,839
Cisco, where are you
with those bio-digital antibodies?

473
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,919
<i>I'm nowhere.</i>

474
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,259
Actually, no, you know what?
I am somewhere.

475
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,339
I'm in the doghouse.

476
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,100
Apparently,
the pan-dimensional doghouse.

477
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,143
I don't know if this doghouse
has a door or a window.

478
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,892
But if it did, I'd be jumping out of it!

479
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,806
It's okay, I'll go talk to him.

480
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,697
Has everybody lost their minds?

481
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,786
She must think I'm blowing her off,
but I'm just trying to do my job.

482
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,664
I guess the word "reschedule"
doesn't exist on Earth-19.

483
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,829
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

484
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,164
and guess that the reason
you can't focus on science

485
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,717
is because you're so worried
about what's going on with Gypsy.

486
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,636
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear anything you said.

487
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,839
But I think I figured it out.

488
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,595
I think I can't focus on anything

489
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,176
'cause of this whole Gypsy situation.

490
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,182
I think
I'm just gonna have to talk to her.

491
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,475
What a great idea.

492
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,475
Hey.

493
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,520
What's up, Cisco?

494
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,855
You're mad at me.

495
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,282
- I said it was fine.
- No, no, no.

496
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,827
Rule number one, when
a girl says it's fine, it's not fine.

497
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,200
Amen!

498
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,450
I'm gonna go.

499
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,087
Rule number two,

500
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,415
you don't blow off a date
with your favorite person.

501
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,256
The day got away from me.
Let me make it up to you.

502
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,551
Okay? Date night tomorrow?

503
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,803
No, Cisco, it had to be today.

504
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,309
- Why today?
- Because today is One-One-One Day.

505
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,386
- One what... What?
- One-One-One Day.

506
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,683
What is that?

507
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,686
One-One-One Day on my Earth is...

508
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,485
It's the day that you celebrate
with the one...

509
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,816
With the one you love, all right?

510
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,117
It's when one soul plus one soul
equals one soul.

511
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,987
- That is so sappy.
- Yes.

512
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,284
It is sappy and it's stupid
and schmoopy,

513
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,583
but there is something about you that...

514
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,870
It makes me want to do stupid,
schmoopy things.

515
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,210
And I hate the word "schmoopy"
and people who use it.

516
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,044
Well, that is the sweetest and
angriest thing you've ever said to me.

517
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,423
Why didn't you just tell me that?

518
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,176
Because I was embarrassed, Cisco!

519
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,759
So, you know what?
Let's just forget about it.

520
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,013
Because the day is already over,

521
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,221
and I would really like to forget
that I ever brought this up.

522
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,522
No, no, no, no.
I will not forget it, okay?

523
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,107
You are important to me.

524
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,985
And if One-One-One Day
is important to you...

525
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,484
One-One-One.

526
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,192
That's it.

527
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,864
I gotta go.

528
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,036
It's like he doesn't know
that he's a dead man.

529
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,459
<i>Hey.</i>

530
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,542
I don't know why I thought

531
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,793
that we didn't have to talk
about what happened.

532
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,258
You were so happy I was back.

533
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:08,258
I am happy. You're everything to me.

534
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,558
Look.

535
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,261
I had to explain
to our friends and family

536
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,393
why they had a save-the-date
for our wedding but no invitation.

537
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,776
I had to constantly lie
about why you were gone.

538
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,942
You don't know the looks people gave me
because they knew that wasn't the truth.

539
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,660
You know,
what they must have thought about us,

540
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,329
what it made me think about us.

541
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,493
Iris...

542
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,462
It's not like I wanted to leave you.

543
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:46,210
I had to put on a brave face for
everyone, but it was killing me inside.

544
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,179
And I think part of why
I didn't talk it through with you

545
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,381
is I was afraid.

546
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,348
I was afraid
that you would tell me to stay.

547
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,682
And I wouldn't have been
strong enough not to.

548
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,890
Barry, how do you know what
I'm gonna say if you don't ask me?

549
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,645
I'm here to help you.
Especially when everything seems lost.

550
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,274
But you have to let me.

551
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,816
Sometimes, it's not about us.
Or the team.

552
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,823
Sometimes, the weight of the whole city
falls on my shoulders,

553
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,404
and it's up to me to carry it.

554
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,573
I'm the Flash.

555
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,286
See, that's what you don't get.

556
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,961
When I put this ring on my finger,
it wasn't just about you or me anymore.

557
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,754
It was about us.

558
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,125
You are not the Flash, Barry. We are.

559
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,425
<i>Guys, we need you.
It's about Deacon.</i>

560
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,013
<i>I have something to confess.</i>

561
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,348
<i>Kurt Weaver, Sheila Agnani and I,</i>

562
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,681
<i>we stole the Kilgore malware program
from Ramsey Deacon.</i>

563
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,065
<i>We sold it for billions.</i>

564
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,437
<i>But it was all his idea.</i>

565
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,686
<i>We got rich and he got nothing.</i>

566
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,568
I guess that explains
why Deacon's got such a vendetta.

567
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,945
Cisco, if he's live streaming,
can you track the signal?

568
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,241
In, like, two seconds.
Papa loves having his own satellite.

569
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,371
What are you going to do
when you find him?

570
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,789
- Hit him with this.
- What is that?

571
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,209
Deacon's powers are derived
from the binary code in his DNA.

572
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,536
So, we created a compound

573
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,247
encoded with a numerical string
pattern of ones and zeros

574
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,503
to invert the order of the code.

575
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,217
Ones become zeroes and vice versa.

576
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,719
One plus one plus one.

577
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:12,837
All right, we're on it.

578
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,093
- Send us the location once you have it.
- Okay.

579
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,549
Let's do it.

580
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,176
<i>And now, you know the truth.</i>

581
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:24,812
We stole Kilg%re from Ramsey Deacon.
He is the real victim.

582
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,892
Good.

583
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,237
- You forgot one thing.
- What?

584
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,233
You didn't say goodbye to anyone
who's gonna miss you.

585
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,545
You ever play wishbone, Tim?

586
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,012
He and the others destroyed my life!

587
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,964
Listen, I know you feel wronged, Deacon,

588
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,300
but that doesn't give you a right
to take his life.

589
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,679
I smell technology in your suit.

590
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,982
What have you got in there?

591
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,943
Oh, crap.

592
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,735
I can't move.

593
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,319
<i>Weapon system online.</i>

594
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,160
<i>Targeting.</i>

595
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,782
Run.

596
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,212
Call me Kilg%re.

597
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,851
<i>Barry, what's happening?</i>

598
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,769
It's Deacon.
He's done something with my suit.

599
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,471
<i>Remote access complete.</i>

600
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,311
You put your voice in Barry's suit?

601
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,983
Well, it had to be somebody,
and my voice is soothing.

602
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,561
How much tech did you put in the suit?

603
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,237
So much.

604
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,649
I've actually always
been a huge Flash fan

605
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,279
this past couple of years.

606
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,279
But this is like having
a giant action figure.

607
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,577
Frak me! He's locked me
out of my own programming!

608
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,953
Do something!

609
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,420
Barry, get away from him!

610
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,083
It might lessen
his technopathic hold over you.

611
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,292
I can't!

612
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,628
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

613
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,881
Someone listening in? Can't have that.

614
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,715
Barry?

615
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,597
Barry! His comms are offline.

616
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,438
You have a defibrillator.
How about I stop your heart?

617
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:50,995
Hello?

618
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,796
<i>You have a collect call from...</i>

619
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,590
<i>- Guys, help me!</i>
- We accept the charges!

620
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,501
The suit's still freaking out!

621
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,586
Well, get it off!

622
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,973
Nope, I can't get it off!

623
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,055
That would be the deadlock function.

624
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,761
I built it in case
he ever got knocked out,

625
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,312
so, a bad guy
wouldn't reveal his identity.

626
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,889
It seemed like a smart idea at the time!

627
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,940
<i>Flotation Mode activated.</i>

628
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,482
What?

629
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,147
What the hell
does he need a raft for, Cisco?

630
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,866
He runs on water!
He might lose his speed out there.

631
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,318
What's he going to do then?
He might drown.

632
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,369
You couldn't just put
an oxygen tank in the suit?

633
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,529
That's a good idea.

634
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,913
How is this thing still intact?

635
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,869
Cisco!

636
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,670
<i>Babel Protocol activated.</i>

637
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,124
What? What's the Babel Protocol?

638
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,001
Why am I ticking?

639
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,753
It's the self-destruct sequence.

640
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,962
- What?
- Self-destruct?

641
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:46,017
I'm sorry, have we not faced an evil
version of Barry before? My mistake!

642
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,934
Well, how do I stop it?

643
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,229
Hell, no.

644
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,228
Oh, God.

645
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,981
Cisco, there must be something
we can do.

646
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,657
Not as long as this thing's
powered up.

647
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,661
Come on, come on.

648
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,455
Barry, can you hear me?

649
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,543
Iris! Hey, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

650
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,336
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

651
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,042
You need to throw a lightning bolt.

652
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,122
At what?

653
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:18,837
Yourself.

654
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,339
You want him to do what?

655
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,630
It might short the suit out,
give him back control.

656
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,719
Or it might set off
the self-destruct early.

657
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,425
Or it might stop his heart!

658
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,392
Barry? Barry, you need to listen to me.

659
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,143
Okay? We can do this.

660
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,067
Okay. I trust you, Iris.

661
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,730
Then run, Barry. Run.

662
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,558
Barry?

663
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,732
Oh, Tim, I know I have
the coolest superpower ever but...

664
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,567
I'm kind of tired.

665
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,274
<i>Hello, gorgeous.</i>

666
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:12,072
Here, on Earth-1,
we celebrate One-One-One Day today.

667
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,706
Even though I have zero idea
what that means.

668
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,456
Or what any of
your Earth's holidays mean.

669
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,958
I mean, I literally cannot believe

670
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,462
you celebrate a day called
St. Shaquille O'Neal's Day.

671
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,503
You guys have a magical elfling
in a red suit

672
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,929
that breaks into your house
and eats your cookies.

673
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,679
Actually, he's the boss of the elves,
so maybe do your research before.

674
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,387
What I do know is
how special you are to me.

675
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,183
And how sorry I am that I didn't
get to spend yesterday with you.

676
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,937
Well, I guess you were busy
catching a deranged killer.

677
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,114
Baby, we are always catching
a deranged killer around here.

678
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,357
True.

679
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:54,493
But I will always make it up to you.
I mean that.

680
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,875
You just gotta let me know
when it's this important.

681
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,827
I will.

682
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,589
All right, then.
You ready to get your schmoopy on?

683
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,042
'Cause, you know,
my schmoopy game is real strong.

684
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,306
This is cruel and unusual.

685
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,481
How will I survive in here
without my Kindle?

686
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,019
You ain't touching anything
electronic ever again.

687
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,773
There's three layers of
signal-dampening walls

688
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,403
between you and the world.

689
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,401
No wiring, not even a light bulb.

690
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,111
There's technology everywhere
these days.

691
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,747
That's fine.
We just have one question for you.

692
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,830
The particle accelerator explosion
four years ago,

693
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,036
you were living in Silicon Valley.

694
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,047
So, if you weren't here that night,
how did you get your powers?

695
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,582
Oh, wow.

696
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,799
<i>You're not going to believe it.</i>

697
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,093
It was really something, though.

698
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,670
A real life-changer.

699
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,755
And do you two
want to know the best part?

700
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,597
I wasn't the only one.

701
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,304
So, good luck, gentlemen.

702
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,474
I think Central City
is about to have its hands full.

703
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,866
Thank you for letting us
see the prisoner, Warden Wolfe.

704
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,735
My pleasure.
Did you get what you needed?

705
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,821
- We think so.
- Well, not to worry.

706
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,830
This so-called Kilg%re
isn't going anywhere.

707
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,249
We'll take good care of him.

708
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,916
How is it possible that Deacon's a meta
if he didn't get his powers

709
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,841
from Wells' particle accelerator
blowing up?

710
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,716
However it happened, we will
figure it out, and we will be ready.

711
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,013
After Cisco gets all that tech
out of your suit.

712
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,599
You don't need fancy gadgets
to be the Flash.

713
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,927
- You are the Flash.
- No. We are.

714
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,231
Did I miss something?

715
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,373
Ah, one of my childhood favorites.

716
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,708
Schubert's unfinished eighth symphony.

717
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,585
Unfinished until now.

718
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,794
You didn't.

719
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,177
It was surprisingly simple to
extrapolate the remaining movements

720
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,009
once I familiarized myself
with the body of his work.

721
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,098
<i>All 600 of his works?</i>

722
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,975
I woke up early this morning.

723
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,483
Do you have an update?

724
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,357
Subject One has been located.

725
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,734
<i>He's safe.</i>

726
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,162
Locked up in the meta-human
wing of Iron Heights as we speak.

727
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,574
He's right where you wanted him.

728
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,746
What do we do now?

729
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,421
Now, we find the others.

730
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:57,445
