00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,869
<i>Rangooo!</i>

3
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:02,027
<i>Rangooo ...</i>

4
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:05,427
<i>Rangoo!</i>

5
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:08,287
<i>Rangooo ...</i>

6
00:01:10,288 --> 00:01:13,422
<i>Rangooo ...</i>

7
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:16,893
We are gathered here today
to immortalize in song.

8
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:21,009
The life and untimely
death of a great legend.

9
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:26,779
So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low
calorie popcorn and assorted confections.

10
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,943
While we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero.

11
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:35,836
Who has yet to enter
his own story.

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:49,465
Hmmm. Hmmmaoh. Muh.
Mmmuh! Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

13
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,894
Crunchy-creamy-coky-candle.
-cupcake.

14
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,828
Okay, everybody!
Let's take it from the top.

15
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:00,796
The stage is set. The night
moist with apprehension.

16
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:05,126
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

17
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:09,711
<i>It is far better to nourish
worms than to live without love!</i>

18
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,809
<i>She reaches for
the poison chalice.</i>

19
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:14,961
<i>Meanwhile, the wicked malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne.</i>

20
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,268
<i>While her aging father
lies gravely ill.</i>

21
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,982
Yes, I'm gravely ill...

22
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:22,918
<i>Hark, who goes there?</i>

23
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:26,249
It is I!
The much anticipated hero.

24
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,235
Returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden.

25
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:34,195
Unhand her you jailers of virtue or
taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!

26
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:38,505
The sting of my...The....

27
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:43,390
Doctor marks? Doctor marks,
I'm not getting anything from you!

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,741
People, we've talked about this!
Acting is reacting.

29
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:50,025
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

30
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,760
Mister tims, you were good.

31
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,631
Perhaps a little too good!

32
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:59,746
What's that, victor?
My character's undefined? That's absurd!

33
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:04,573
I know who I am. I'm thee... I'm the guy!
The protagonist, the hero!

34
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:07,009
Every story needs a hero!
I mean...

35
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,236
Who else is better
qualified to bask

36
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:12,543
in the adulation of his
numerous companions!

37
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:37,412
<i>The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure.</i>

38
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,047
<i>Who am I?</i>

39
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,590
<i>I could be anyone!</i>

40
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,512
I...I could be the sea captain
returning from a mighty voyage,

41
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:50,613
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

42
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:56,187
Or the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the congo!

43
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:58,322
Down, chunga!

44
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:02,097
And if you desire romance,
I will become the

45
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:05,944
greatest lover the
world has ever known!

46
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,672
Hola!

47
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:16,724
I couldn't help but notice
you noticing me noticing you.

48
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,517
You know the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

49
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:23,381
But you seem remarkably at ease.

50
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:25,560
Oh, stop it!
No, really...

51
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,672
Well, if you must!
Ha ha! What are you doing?

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,147
Oh! That tickles!
Are those real?

53
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:36,038
That's it! Conflict! Victor, you
were right! I have been undefined!

54
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:41,115
People, I've had an epiphany!
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

55
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:44,508
What our story needs is
an ironic, unexpected event,

56
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:47,640
that will propel the hero into conflict.

57
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:44,936
Mister tims?

58
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:21,304
<i>...Oye...</i>

59
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:28,710
<i>That's right! You!</i>

60
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:33,803
<i>Don't be shy. Come on.
Is okay.</i>

61
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,100
<i>That's it,
a little closer...</i>

62
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,141
<i>Ah. Good.</i>

63
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,165
<i>I won't bite you.</i>

64
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,343
I need a little help here.

65
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,472
Uh...Are you okay?

66
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:50,502
I must get to the other side.

67
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,977
The other side? You mean just now
that was you crossing the road?

68
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:59,957
That's why... why did you do that?!
- This is my quest. He waits for me.

69
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:01,531
Whe... what...Who?

70
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,154
The spirit of the west, amigo.
The one.

71
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:09,681
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

72
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:11,659
Wha...
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:15,101
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

74
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,687
Nothing?! Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

75
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:21,452
I had an incredibly
complex social network!

76
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:24,215
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!

77
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,453
Friends? I don't see no friends.

78
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,375
- Well, uhm...
- You are a very lonely lizard.

79
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:35,502
Now...Help me up, and I'll
help you find what you seek.

80
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:38,568
Uhh...You will?
- Quickly now. I must get back to my quest.

81
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:42,510
You mean, you've done this before?
- O, yes. Many times.

82
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,992
Come, come. - Argh... - That'sit.
Pull my finger.

83
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:48,600
Uhh... - The spirit is
waiting for me!

84
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,957
Okay, okay...

85
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,632
Okay! That's not gonna work.
- I must get to the other side.

86
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:03,423
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

87
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,316
Is not so easy as it looks...

88
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:06,370
A what?

89
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,252
Is a metaphore.

90
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:39,993
Hey, there's another one!

91
00:08:41,252 --> 00:08:42,723
I knew it!

92
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:56,320
You need a little help,
amigo?

93
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,989
I think the metaphore broke my spleen.

94
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,953
- The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

95
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,881
Yeah... I'm just lookog for
the path to water.

96
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:10,074
If you want to find water,
you must first find dirt.

97
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,691
Dirt?

98
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:15,495
Destiny, she is kind to you.

99
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:19,143
Tomorrow is wednesday,
the water comes.

100
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,184
At noon the towns people gather
for a mysterious ritual...

101
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:26,550
Wow! What uhhh...A town? Like
with real people and everything?

102
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,084
Where? - A days journey.
Follow your shadow.

103
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:35,357
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

104
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:36,726
Uhumm... tha's the way.

105
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:43,302
Okay. So you're saying there's a town,
a real town? Not a metaphor town?

106
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,504
Go on.
It's okay.

107
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,325
Okay. Well, then I'm going.

108
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,911
I am leaving the road.
- now!

109
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:56,485
I'm walking ... into...
The desert!

110
00:09:56,772 --> 00:10:00,772
Alone!
- We all have our journeys to make!

111
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,191
I will see you on the other side...

112
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,672
<i>Welcome, amigo,
to the land without end,</i>

113
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:29,040
<i>the desert and death are
the closest of friends...</i>

114
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:35,545
<i>We sing of his courage
in this gleeful sung song,</i>

115
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:42,010
<i>better pay close attetnion,
he won't be here long...</i>

116
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,061
Here in the mojave desert, animals
have had millions of years to adapt

117
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:10,235
to the harsh environment.

118
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:14,053
But the lizard, he is going to die.

119
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:18,358
Four score and seven years ago...
Our fathers... - Don't move!

120
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,318
What?

121
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,650
Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

122
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,716
I'm not moving.
- Try to blend in.

123
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,893
What? Blend in?
Wha...Whaaa...What do you mean?

124
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,777
Blend in!

125
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,575
Huh? Wh..Wha...Wha...
What are you saying?

126
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:45,015
Too late. - No! No! It's not too late!
I..I'm blending! I'm a blender!

127
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,513
Calm down!
What are you doing?

128
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:52,301
Don't move!

129
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,516
Try not to look conspicuous.

130
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:04,366
Hey, pst!
Whad'ya doing?

131
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,019
I'm blending.
- Go and blend somewhere else.

132
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:07,554
Don't distract me!
- No room at the inn!

133
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:10,055
It's an art not a science!!
- Find your own hiding place!

134
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:14,090
This is good. - Oh, here she comes!
You better run, mojito!

135
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,990
What? But you said "don't move".
- That was before. Now... you run!

136
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,785
Adios, amigo.

137
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,508
Oh, hey!
Where's your basket?

138
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,433
Oh, thirsty?

139
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:25,538
Please! Please don't! Please don't!
I have vertigo! My glands are swollen!

140
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,972
Please, no...

141
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,394
Hey...Madre de dios!

142
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:41,468
You! I kill you, you stupid lizard
get out of there!

143
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,063
I can't help but taste the days
of action! - Oh just shut up and shoot!

144
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:47,781
No, wait! Come back!
I was just kidding!

145
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,529
We friends, hey?
- I...I don't know you.

146
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,037
Lizards, frogs...- Move over!
- We' practically related!

147
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:57,194
Move over! - I let you
kiss my sister!

148
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:09,007
You son of a ....

149
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:06,349
<i>Where are your friends
now, amigo?</i>

150
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,302
Heeeeeeeelp!

151
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,099
Get your slimy,
webbed phalanges off my boots!

152
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:42,254
Oh! Uh...Sorry!! - I got a beat on you,
stranger. You get up real slow.

153
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:45,845
Or you wanna spend your afternoon
pickin' your face back together!

154
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,217
No, no, no, no, ma'm,
I don't...

155
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,315
Who are you?
- Whhhoo...Am I?

156
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,591
I'm askin' the questions here!
We're in the middle of a drought

157
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,125
now someone's
dumping water in the desert.

158
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,240
Now I suppose it's indeterminable s
omethin' to mention

159
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,743
but I intend to find out
what role you play in all this.

160
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,297
Role? - What are you involved in?

161
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:05,655
Oh! Well, I...I'm glad you asked.

162
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:08,989
 I've got two one acts, a mystery
and a musical I've been gestating.

163
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,989
I've got the words. I'm just kinda
workin' on the melody. It's like a...

164
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,055
It's...I think it's gonna be
a western.

165
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,398
<i>Hey, monkey got a cracker...</i>

166
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:22,010
<i>hmhmhm His mother's making supper..
La-la-la-la...</i>

167
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,746
You ain't from round here,
are you?

168
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:30,155
I..I'm...I'm still workin' on it.

169
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,797
Uh...So, what's your name?

170
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:34,946
Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

171
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,248
What can I say, my daddy
plum loved baked beans.

172
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,137
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plum love asparagus.

173
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:43,409
What...What are you sayin'? - I mean,
I...I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

174
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:46,166
but I'm not sure that the child uh...
Would appreciate the moniker.

175
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,835
My daddy was a fine man.
Even if he did exibit

176
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:51,045
proclivity for lagoons ...
- Hm, spicey.

177
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,713
You're eating his ashes!
- Uh. You carry his remains?

178
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:59,556
No! His ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

179
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,320
Oh! Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

180
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:03,562
What are you implyin'?
- Nothing. I...

181
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,893
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd been sober for over a month.

182
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,886
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities.

183
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:13,474
At a delicate time in my personal
development is an up front to my

184
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,358
miss beans?

185
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,266
Miss beans?
Hello?

186
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,098
Hee-lo?

187
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:45,202
...And I'm telling to people that
"adndromeda 5" will return safe and sound

188
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:47,883
and I will not sell my ranch!

189
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,891
What? - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

190
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,908
What am I doing?
- You... were cuddling me.

191
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,926
We... well went frozen.
- No I didn't ...

192
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:58,396
Yes. You stopped talking.
- That's defence mechanism.

193
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,371
Actually lots of people have it.
- Now you've made that up!

194
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:04,123
So, you're gonna die out here
or you wanna a ride into town?

195
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:06,880
No! No! No! Uh... yeah! No!
Yeas please! Thank you.

196
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:10,850
Today's wednesday. - Wednesday when we all get to it.

197
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:13,919
So who are you really?

198
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,779
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

199
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:18,146
There's my stage name,
my pen name, my avatar.

200
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,126
Had a pseudonym once,
but had to ...

201
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:24,142
And so the stranger
seeking companionship

202
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:29,048
finds a woman. Much like
the sirens of the ancient times

203
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:33,705
luring him to his certain demise.

204
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,642
...And I'm actually of the few men
with the maiden name!

205
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:40,992
Whow! Here we are.

206
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,677
Oh, oh, right...

207
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,469
Well, I sure do appreciate
this miss beans...

208
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:53,762
and if there's
anything I could...

209
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:00,554
See ya,
beans.

210
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,714
Welcome to "dirt"
- w_anna 2001 -

211
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:19,742
your're leaving us, jim?
- Well, we gave it up on that shop.

212
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:23,686
Gotta sell it. Can't roll
no crowd for I got no water.

213
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:25,534
Bye!

214
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:33,849
What is it?

215
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:38,893
What was that for?
- You're funny looking.

216
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:42,849
Well, you're funny looking too!
- That's a funny looking shirt!

217
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,866
That's a funny looking dress!
- You got funny looking eyes!

218
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,622
You gotta funny looking face!

219
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,782
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

220
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,086
Here's your beans, beans.
-I'm gonna need some more feed, too, willie.

221
00:19:56,286 --> 00:20:00,283
Well you almost got three corts already.
I can't give you no more credits.

222
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,624
But I have what I
owe you at noon.

223
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:08,931
You don't understand. It's mr. merrymack,
from the bank, he cut off all credits.

224
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:10,288
Hey, beans?

225
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:14,936
You know that there fella?
- Beans? Miss beans?

226
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,325
Nope. - Hey, beans...

227
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,781
Hey...

228
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:23,566
Oh. Right! Blend in!

229
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,748
I'd like a... glass of water?

230
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,551
He wants a glass of water!

231
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:05,393
Make it a double!
- Give him two!

232
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:11,205
Cactus juice.
That's all we got.

233
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:41,381
Hey, Fruitcup? You are
a long way from home, ain't ya?

234
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:45,103
Who exactly are you?

235
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,425
<i>Who am I?</i>

236
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:53,508
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

237
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,988
HECHO IN: DURANGO

238
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:00,991
What's the matter? Your miss
your mamma's mangos?

239
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:04,272
As a matter of fact, I am.

240
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:08,235
But not as much as your
daddy's cooking!

241
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:12,478
Exactly... where did you say
you were from?

242
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:15,999
Me? I'm from the West.

243
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:20,121
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Pass the sunset.

244
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:22,321
The Far west...

245
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:25,685
Yea, that's right hombres.

246
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:31,047
The place I come from, we kill a man
before breakfast, just to work up an appetite.

247
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:35,488
We salt him and we pepper him,
we braise him clarified butter

248
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:38,050
and then we eat him.

249
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,131
You eat him?
- That's what I said!

250
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:44,494
Hell, I've seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular function.

251
00:23:44,694 --> 00:23:47,654
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, livin' off you own juices.

252
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:51,016
It'll change a man!
Oh, yes.

253
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:58,100
Have a few extra aces in this deck, yea?
Just the way I like it.

254
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,102
So no, my hair shootin' rodent little friend,
I am not from around these parts.

255
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:05,183
You might say I'm from everywhere

256
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:08,145
there's trouble brewin'
and hell waiting to be raised.

257
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:11,506
You might say I'm
what hell's already raised up!

258
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:15,415
Name's...
Rango.

259
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,792
Are you that fella that
killed them Jenkins brothers?

260
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:26,274
Aha, killed them with one bullet.

261
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:28,356
Don't get no deader.

262
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:30,957
All seven of 'em?

263
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:33,358
That's right.

264
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,319
All sven of them.

265
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,832
Exactly how did you do that,
Mr. Rango?

266
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:45,640
Y'know I'm glad you asked me that.
And... I would be happy to tell you!

267
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,400
But you all gotta have to
listen up,

268
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,723
because this is where it gets...
complicated.

269
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:58,326
I'm about to close the account, Mrs. Goats -
two go to the swig.

270
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:02,367
Hands off, Mordekao, that's what
swept off your college education!

271
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:06,609
I don't have any other choice, Beans.

272
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,594
Times being so hard, we...
we just can't give no more credit.

273
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:13,395
But this here is a bank!
This is where you keep the water.

274
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,036
Keep the wate..

275
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:21,652
Beans, you've been like a niece to me.
Ever since your daddy...

276
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,402
did NOT fall drunk down a mine shaft.
And uh...I've...

277
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:31,245
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

278
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:34,085
Oh...the weight of them realities...
- G. Merrymack?

279
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:36,247
G. Merrymack?

280
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:39,048
Are you all right?

281
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,370
Beans, I need to
sh...show you something.

282
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:54,136
That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

283
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:59,579
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just
ain't makin' deposits on a Wednesday no more.

284
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:03,181
If I don't get some water
I'm gonna lose my ranch,

285
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:05,584
and you're tellin' me that's all
that's left in the whole tank!

286
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:08,017
Now, that just don't
make no sense.

287
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:12,258
Now, listen. Someone is
dumpin' water in the desert.

288
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:15,619
I've seen it with my own eyes!

289
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:22,304
Water in the desert! Was this durin'
one of your...special times?

290
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:27,666
No! - Well, we can all dream.
But this is the reality.

291
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:31,788
Why do you think so many people
are sellin' out? They just can't make it.

292
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,390
Well...I...what am I supposed to do?

293
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:37,792
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

294
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:40,313
I hear he's been helpin'
people out in this time of crisis.

295
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,355
The Mayor?
- He may be...our only hope.

296
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:47,836
...bullet hits the shovel, richochets back
towards number three

297
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:51,319
and that's where the roof gave in
ingiting with a pure green alcohol

298
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,160
instantly vaporized his bodily form
into nothing but

299
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:58,243
a charcoal statute
and high-ptiched squeel.

300
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:07,045
Ho-hold on there. That's only six.
What happend to number seven?

301
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:13,773
Number seven? Damn...
Died of infection.

302
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,629
One bullet...

303
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:21,340
All seven men.

304
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,823
Dance for me!
Dance like a real chicken!

305
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:28,224
Dance, dance.

306
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:33,546
You got coal in your ears, mate? You don't
pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!

307
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:38,203
That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Your broke law!

308
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:43,406
If I see you're face in this town again
I'm gonna slice it off.

309
00:27:43,606 --> 00:27:47,848
And use it to wipe my unmentionables....
- Mind the beak.

310
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,570
And don't come back!!!

311
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:56,813
What are you all coping at?

312
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:02,935
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something
I gotta tell ya...

313
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:12,811
Oi, what is this?
- You know who this is, Bill? It's Rango!

314
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:16,653
Yeah! He ain't afraid of you.
He ain't afraid of any of you.

315
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:19,895
Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill...

316
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:21,977
All seven of them!

317
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:23,856
Is that right...

318
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:04,238
Lemme get that for you.

319
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,841
Eh... No! I know. Here.

320
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:17,565
Just will care 'bout that
for you...

321
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:20,125
Here! All better!

322
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:47,019
Here, here... just a second...

323
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:54,623
All right, listen. I wanna give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider.

324
00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:02,005
And if you don't wanna reconsider,

325
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:06,126
I might consider
reconsidering myself.

326
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:18,333
Now, that's what I'm
talking about!

327
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:23,616
Yeah. All right now, listen up! Things
gonna be different now Rango's in town.

328
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:29,378
Got some new rules; my shoe shined every
mornin', my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

329
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:32,300
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye!

330
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:35,702
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

331
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:36,183
It's Rango!
- What's he up to?

332
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:39,665
He ain't afraid of nobody! - He's gonna
turn that bird butt-forward!

333
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:41,505
When you see me comin',
stand aside.

334
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:47,188
I take large steps and I don't want
your hey-sees bodily fluids on my boots!

335
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:55,273
Of course, there is no need for violence.
As long as we stick together, work as team.

336
00:30:55,473 --> 00:31:01,475
So I want you all
to come on outside, now.

337
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,116
Line up single file
while I take a recreation!

338
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:07,038
What's he doing now?
- I think it's A number two.

339
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,960
OCUPADO

340
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,489
Well, never mind!

341
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:52,623
You can best see
over here!

342
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,904
Look at him!
He's taking that hawk!

343
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:57,825
Give him here, Rango!

344
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:53,581
Did you see that?
- He killed than banger!

345
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:59,106
What do you...what do you
say, doc? - This hawk is dead!

346
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,867
Shoo. I say we'd cook that
right out!

347
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,989
He did it with one bullet!
- Well just like he said!

348
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:07,271
It's about time
we had a hero around here!

349
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:08,990
One who ain't in a pine box...

350
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:12,765
I  think it's time he met the Mayor.

351
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:15,986
- You hear that, Rango?
You're gonna meet the Mayor.

352
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:18,291
Let's here it for Rango!

353
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:26,816
And so the stranger basks
in the adulation of his new friends.

354
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:32,298
Sinking deeper into the
guacamole of his own deception.

355
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:37,541
When is he goin' to die?
- Soon, compadre. Soon.

356
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,431
<i>My land is not for sale!</i>

357
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:59,273
I thank you would save our land,
not sell it!

358
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:03,394
I'm sure we'd work out something
if you just talked to him...

359
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:06,317
Beans, where're you going?
Beans!

360
00:35:06,676 --> 00:35:09,277
The Mayor will see you now.

361
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,602
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

362
00:35:17,802 --> 00:35:21,405
Without it, there's nothing
but dust and decay.

363
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:25,966
But with water... there's life.

364
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:33,050
Look at them! They're so desperate to live
they'll follow it anywhere...

365
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,692
That's the immutable law
of the desert.

366
00:35:37,773 --> 00:35:41,695
Control the water and
you control everything else.

367
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:47,177
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rain water, from the Great Deluge.

368
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:52,258
Oh, not Noah's deluge.
Goodness, I'm not that old!

369
00:35:54,556 --> 00:35:59,157
I guess power has some privileges.
- You made the good point, son.

370
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:03,257
But with privilege comes
responsibility.

371
00:36:04,737 --> 00:36:07,698
Hell, I was Mayor here before
there was the Dirt!

372
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,619
I may be just a sentimental,
old turtle...

373
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:13,488
but I think there's a future to
this town

374
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:15,849
and I hope you'll be part of it.

375
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,771
To Dirt!
- To Dirt!

376
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:26,334
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

377
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:31,057
It's a hard life here...
Very hard...

378
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:34,859
Do you know how they make it
through each and every day?

379
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,661
They believe. They believe
it's going to be better.

380
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:43,343
They believe that the water
will come!

381
00:36:43,543 --> 00:36:46,304
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

382
00:36:46,824 --> 00:36:48,705
that tomorrow will be
better than today.

383
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:53,308
People have to believe in
something.

384
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:57,750
Right now,
they believe in you.

385
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,232
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.

386
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,954
Your destiny awaits.

387
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:10,277
People have to believe in
something.

388
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,840
It just don't make no sense.

389
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,003
This whole town is drying up
and the Mayor seems

390
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:22,684
the only one who's not affected!

391
00:37:22,884 --> 00:37:23,003
Don't that make you just
a wee bit suspicious?

392
00:37:23,203 --> 00:37:27,446
What about that water I saw out
in the desert? I seen it with my own eyes!

393
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:31,048
Alright! No need to insight anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

394
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:38,131
If you really feel there's some conspiracy,
I suggest you take it up with the sheriff!

395
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,664
Excuse me, Mr Rango?

396
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:06,984
I will blow that ugly right off your face!
- Uh...I was just thinkin' that uh..

397
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,208
Oh! You want the old John Hancock,
do you? Well, here hold this.

398
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:15,090
This isn't a social call! - Oh,
I know all about the all dig...

399
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,171
I ordered myself some
nice fancy-dandies.

400
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:20,173
G. Rango! - You too? No problems, just...
- I need you to investigate...

401
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:23,294
You know Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice if you put a little effort into it.

402
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:26,776
Son, stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespear.

403
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:31,897
Who...who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango! If that is your real name!

404
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:35,219
I am tryin' to save my daddy's ranch,
which is on the verge

405
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,341
of an agricultural meltdown while
you're playin' patty cake with each...

406
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:44,384
Sad girl...
Such a drabbly pain..

407
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,986
Why does she do that?

408
00:38:46,186 --> 00:38:49,187
It's a survival reflex.
- 'xcept her switch is just broken.

409
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,107
Well! That's an inconvenience.

410
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:53,949
It is not a rash!
It is a birth mark.

411
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,591
I did it again, didn't I?
- Did what?

412
00:38:57,992 --> 00:39:00,073
Let me ask you something...

413
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:04,115
Did anybody here mention to you
what happened to our last sheriff?

414
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:50,419
Uh...May I ask you...the last sheriff.
Pardon me...

415
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,220
Where did everybody go?
What happened to him?

416
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,120
Oh...oh... I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

417
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:49,689
his is heck of a hoedown you got goin'.
Still workin' out those steps.

418
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,370
So, is this considered
normal civic behavior?

419
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,092
Mmhmm. Every Wednesday.
Just like clock work.

420
00:40:56,852 --> 00:41:01,335
You kill bird? - Yea, ha...
as a matter of fact, I did.

421
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:03,977
Bird dead. Snake come.

422
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:07,019
Is it snake? - He means
Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

423
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:10,739
He wasn't coming to town because
he was scared of that hawk.

424
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:13,462
but might come now. May I have
your boots when you're dead?

425
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:18,144
No! Rango's got no problem with this Rattlesnake
Jake. - That's exactly what Amos said.

426
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:19,904
Amos?

427
00:41:21,306 --> 00:41:22,706
Sheriff AMOS
Thursday - Friday

428
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:24,906
You got any gold fillings?

429
00:41:44,117 --> 00:41:46,758
My fellow Dirtonians!

430
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:53,162
I welcome you to this great day
of deliverance! Halellujah! - Halellujah!

431
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:57,724
Acolytes, prepare
the holly spigot!

432
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:14,133
We have a newcomer amongst us,
a man I think needs little introduction

433
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:18,414
to you, so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.

434
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:21,336
Mr. Rango?
Would you step forward?

435
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:23,737
Mine!
- Mine!

436
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:33,221
The time has come! The time
that was foretold! - Hallelujah!

437
00:42:34,062 --> 00:42:36,462
The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!

438
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:41,305
The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!

439
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:44,347
The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!

440
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:49,829
It is the time of...
hydration!

441
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:08,158
It's his fault! - It's the newcomer!
- Burn him!

442
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,841
He's a witch!
- I want his boots!

443
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:14,062
My friends! My friends!
Temper your frustrations.

444
00:43:14,262 --> 00:43:19,144
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices have to be made.

445
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:23,426
But if I can help in any way,
please know that my door is always...

446
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:27,549
Hold it! hold it! Now this whole
thing stinks three ways to Sunday!

447
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:30,590
First the bank's run dry,
and now this here spigot!

448
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:32,471
Bank's run dry?
- What's she talkin' about?

449
00:43:32,912 --> 00:43:34,993
She said there's no
water in the bank!

450
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:39,474
I want mine in cash!

451
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,158
We can't just give away...
- We can't move again!

452
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,041
There'll be no civil disobedience
in my town. Thank you very much!

453
00:43:53,202 --> 00:43:55,683
Thank Goodness you're here, sheriff.
Things were getting outta hand!

454
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,323
Ooo... come right in,
join us.

455
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:02,606
Well now! Let me get the source
of the societal discontentment here.

456
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:06,208
Go..ho...hod, have mercy...

457
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:11,049
All right. Listen up! I've been thinkin'
and I believe I figured somethin' out.

458
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:14,533
You folks have a water problem!

459
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,774
Now, just pay attention everybody!
I'm tryin' to make a point here.

460
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:21,655
Let's say this fella here were
to take a drink of water.

461
00:44:22,056 --> 00:44:24,817
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul. Right?

462
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:31,662
And you! Why you're just as dried up
and parched as a Jack rabbit in July!

463
00:44:31,862 --> 00:44:34,742
So you belly on up and
take you a double shot!

464
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,184
Stay with me...

465
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:41,066
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinkin'!

466
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:46,308
Before you know it,
there wouldn't be anymore water!

467
00:44:46,508 --> 00:44:48,829
And then where would we be?

468
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:53,952
We'd be thirsty!
Real thirsty!

469
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:57,194
Why we'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

470
00:44:59,515 --> 00:45:05,078
Now, look here. We have got
six days of water...

471
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:12,362
Fi.. - We have got five
days of water.

472
00:45:13,482 --> 00:45:18,364
As long as we got water,
we got ourselves a town.

473
00:45:19,822 --> 00:45:24,183
Sheriff Rango is right. As long
as we have this water, we have some hope.

474
00:45:24,584 --> 00:45:27,425
And you can all take it from me.
My one hundred percent

475
00:45:27,985 --> 00:45:33,228
full time employment from this moment
I'll protect our precious, natural, resource.

476
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,230
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango!

477
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:52,637
Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, sheriff.

478
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:57,561
Hold on their, Gordy.  Now you
get on back in there and assert yourself.

479
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:03,444
I think you'll find the people in this
town to be surprising hospitable.

480
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:04,645
Thank you, sheriff!

481
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,685
What? Not you!

482
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:09,807
I stand corrected.

483
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:18,092
This ain't the bank!
- Hold you, Jedidiah!

484
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:20,933
Hold it right there!
- It's the sheriff.

485
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:23,214
Get them hands up
where I can see 'em.

486
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:28,857
Just as I suspected. Prospecting
without authorized equipment!

487
00:46:29,217 --> 00:46:31,178
Don't move a muscle!
- Prospectors?

488
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:39,142
Now, here's the shovels, pickaxe, drills,
some snacks, puzzle works

489
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:41,983
and you gonna need the permit.

490
00:46:42,743 --> 00:46:45,145
Ezekiel! Jedidiah! What the
Sam hill's goin' on up there?

491
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:49,066
I've had colobs removed
smarter than the two of you!

492
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:54,230
Hells bar! This ain't the bank! - Pappy,
the Sheriff is standin' right here!

493
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:57,951
Helpin' us out.
- Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

494
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:01,193
That's right, sir. Just doin' my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds,

495
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:06,436
keepin' and eagle eye out
for meyham and malfeasance.

496
00:47:06,636 --> 00:47:09,237
Does he look like he sounds?
- Uhum.

497
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:15,841
If we was to hit the mother load,
being prospectors and such,

498
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,202
where would we deposit said annuity?

499
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:24,884
Well, in Dirt we happen to have the finest
financial institution this side of Missouri.

500
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:29,127
Protected mornin', noon and night
by yours truly.

501
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:32,489
Much obliged.

502
00:47:32,689 --> 00:47:35,691
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

503
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:38,532
O, God Lord,
the bank's been robbed!

504
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:41,174
What's goin' on?
- I don't know. The water is gone!

505
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:43,615
What's he sayin'?
- The bank's been robbed!

506
00:47:43,975 --> 00:47:47,537
Doctor Marks, I'm on fire,
embrace me!

507
00:47:48,138 --> 00:47:50,701
<i>The bank's been robbed,
the town is striked...</i>

508
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:55,703
<i>to die of thirst or equal,
what they thought is all his fault</i>

509
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:59,505
All right folks, stand back, clear
the area, this is a crime scene now.

510
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:02,546
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints
and  fiber, scamper DNA

511
00:48:03,643 --> 00:48:06,404
I wanna urin sample from everyone
and get me a latte.

512
00:48:06,604 --> 00:48:08,006
Don't mix up the two...

513
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:12,647
What's this? Prospecting permit?
- I'll take that. Material evidence!

514
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:15,569
What are we doin' now, sheriff?
- We need that water.

515
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:20,811
We're all gonna die! - Friends,
we all know what we have to do.

516
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:24,653
That's right. We all know
what we have to do now.

517
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:26,694
And that would be?

518
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:29,495
(Form a posse).
- Form a possum"!

519
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:33,337
A posse.

520
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:37,420
Now we gonna be doing this
in orderly fashion.

521
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:43,463
First of all, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

522
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,905
All right then.

523
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:48,865
What do we do now,
sheriff?

524
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,427
Now,...
we ride.

525
00:49:04,937 --> 00:49:08,099
Where're we going?
- What?

526
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:10,939
Where're we going?

527
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:21,113
Now, as my deputy you'll be in charge
of all trackin' and findin' of villains.

528
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:24,274
Utilizin'' your well developed ingenuity.
No offense taken.

529
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,836
So which way do you think they went?
You wanna sniff the air...

530
00:49:27,157 --> 00:49:29,757
or commune
with a buffalo or somethin'?

531
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,159
Oh... you're good!

532
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:41,004
I am depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobacco ih your beard.

533
00:49:41,204 --> 00:49:45,925
Always good to have a medical man on,
doc? - Reptiles gotta stick together!

534
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:49,928
Right, my brother? - I'm an amphibian.
- Ain't no shame in that...

535
00:49:50,848 --> 00:49:55,850
Woh! Are you sure you're fit for
duty there, soldier? - What?

536
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:59,532
Well, you gotta a little
something in your eye there...

537
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:04,134
Oh, that! That there is conjunctivitis,
sir. It's hereditary.

538
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,856
Oh... I'm glad to hear
it ain't contageous.

539
00:50:08,537 --> 00:50:12,219
Now, just wait a cotton pickin' minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

540
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,500
Never mind.

541
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:17,781
Woh! Woh! Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look

542
00:50:18,142 --> 00:50:22,904
after the town while I'm gone.
- Can I get to shoot someone?

543
00:50:23,785 --> 00:50:25,866
Uh...let's put a pin in that.

544
00:50:27,907 --> 00:50:29,898
Sheriff, you're gonna bring that water
back, aren't you?

545
00:50:30,098 --> 00:50:31,058
Count on it, little sister.

546
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:36,061
Which way do we go, sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere!

547
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:39,165
The whole town is purpurated
with them.

548
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:42,406
How'd them fellas found
the bank, anyways?

549
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:47,288
Khm...Gentlemen, if we can stay
on the task here? - Sheriff, over here.

550
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:52,602
Would you look at that!

551
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:55,323
Like seeing the face of God!
-  Amen, brother.

552
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:58,356
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

553
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,376
Those were the halcyon days...

554
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:01,256
Must be a reason she quit
on us...

555
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:04,899
Whatever the reason, someone
is controlling this here water!

556
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,179
What do you say, sheriff?

557
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:10,982
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

558
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:15,415
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin,

559
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:18,043
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

560
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:21,243
What'd he say? - I thin he said
follow the pipe. - He said follow the pipe.

561
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:39,130
Whatever you do,
do not look down!

562
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:44,501
What is this place?
- It's an aquafor.

563
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:49,823
Ah...What is aquafor?
- Well, it's for aqua.

564
00:51:50,384 --> 00:51:52,501
Well, it's empy now!

565
00:52:11,355 --> 00:52:13,315
Thank you, big one.

566
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:18,668
It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

567
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:22,099
Someone or something is
messing with our hydration.

568
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:24,072
And that pipe has something
to do with it.

569
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:26,554
Now, I thought we was following
bank robbers!

570
00:52:26,874 --> 00:52:26,874
We're experiencing a paradox shift!

571
00:52:27,074 --> 00:52:30,556
I'm gonna shift the features
on your face if you don't shut up!

572
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:36,158
Quite you savages! Stop your battlin'.
You're effectin' my cogitation.

573
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,840
Wow! I got it!

574
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,721
Snap out them torches!

575
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:50,966
Smart thinking there,
fellow!

576
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:54,048
Start climbing! - Get your boot
out of my face!

577
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:56,769
Not bad, ha, Beans? - If you keep
thinking like that,

578
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:59,290
your hat's gonna catch on fire.
- Well, you know...

579
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,893
You get on the road...
ahhh! Hot, hot, burn, ow...

580
00:53:13,778 --> 00:53:17,579
Poor things... All they wanted
was a little water.

581
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,222
Cactis dying of thirst?
They don't bold way...

582
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:23,422
Hey look what I've found!
- What'd you got?

583
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,344
I saw it first!
- It got some water!

584
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,424
It's mine!
- Give me that!

585
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:31,347
Aaa...It's empty anyway.
- I knew that...

586
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:35,509
Hey, where'd you find that?
- Sheriff, you gonna wanna see this!

587
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:41,191
It's Mr. Merrymack,
from the bank.

588
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:43,673
What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back!

589
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:47,074
All right, lemme see it. - Looks like
them barriment shot him in the back!

590
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,596
No...this man wasn't shot.

591
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:51,756
He was drowned.

592
00:53:52,198 --> 00:53:54,198
Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

593
00:53:54,638 --> 00:53:57,200
Oh, what a way to go...

594
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,561
Well now... who's boot prints
are those?

595
00:54:04,684 --> 00:54:10,406
That's interesting. Ground still wet...
- I suppose we should bury him...

596
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:15,248
Oh, no...birds gotta eat too.
- Circle of life!

597
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:20,772
Hey, what's that there dumb
Indian doin'?

598
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:25,933
I see you're consulting
with the spirits.

599
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:29,296
No, I'm molting. Means
I'm ready to mate.

600
00:54:29,857 --> 00:54:32,257
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

601
00:54:32,698 --> 00:54:34,539
Cactus fruit.

602
00:54:34,979 --> 00:54:36,740
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit!

603
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,101
I believe you people use it as seasoning
while preparing your native dishes.

604
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:43,062
Also natural laxative.

605
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:48,746
Pick up trail. Three men, headed west.
One blind. One with...

606
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:52,908
...a large prostate, riding side saddle.

607
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:55,510
What...What'd he say?
- They're ridin' side saddle!

608
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,591
What? - Sshh! We're whisperin'.
- What'd he say?

609
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,620
Someone's got a bad south.

610
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,101
All right. Which one of you
fellas need a check up?

611
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,101
Awkward.

612
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:08,136
Aaa...what exactly are we
gonna do now?

613
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:11,691
Now? We ride.

614
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:20,432
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

615
00:56:02,768 --> 00:56:05,409
Marshmallows remind me of
goin' campin' with my daddy.

616
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:07,570
I could eat 'em all night long.

617
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:12,852
Of course, he did make me cough
'em back up again for breakfast.

618
00:56:14,573 --> 00:56:17,257
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

619
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:21,138
That ain't nothin'.
I coughed up a whole tribe of Pygmies.

620
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:24,099
They started lookin' at me weird.

621
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,941
I remember them.
They was quit friendly.

622
00:56:27,502 --> 00:56:31,423
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

623
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:36,306
You might wanna get
that looked at.

624
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,267
Pass the beans,
Beans.

625
00:56:39,908 --> 00:56:41,908
Sheriff?
- No, thanks...

626
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,071
Mr. Rango, can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

627
00:56:46,672 --> 00:56:49,552
Oh, yes, talk about that?
- Is it true what they say?

628
00:56:51,154 --> 00:56:56,597
Ah...yes...the Spirit of the West.
The eternally unobtainable eye view.

629
00:56:56,957 --> 00:57:01,239
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

630
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,001
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest...

631
00:57:06,442 --> 00:57:10,283
and have made it to the other side.

632
00:57:13,205 --> 00:57:15,606
Uh... Other side of what?

633
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:20,408
It's a metaphore. - My eye!
- Uh...that's gonna heal right up.

634
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,603
Sheriff, what're you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

635
00:57:24,803 --> 00:57:27,644
Hm? What? Where!?

636
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:31,686
Sorry 'bout that. Word is, you come
against him once or twice.

637
00:57:32,127 --> 00:57:35,488
Ooh! Yeah! Jake!
You mean, my brother.

638
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:38,570
Your brother?
- That's what I said!

639
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,531
But... he's a snake and
you're a lizard.

640
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:44,773
Well, mamma had an active...
social life.

641
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:48,575
Did he ever bite you? - Sure enough
did. Look at that baby.

642
00:57:49,016 --> 00:57:53,937
Go ahead. You can touch it.  - Oh.
That's interesting. It's a belly button.

643
00:57:54,378 --> 00:57:57,660
Luckily I'm immune to his venom. Put
some in my coffee to get a little tang.

644
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,182
Is it true he's only scared of
them hawks?

645
00:58:00,621 --> 00:58:04,622
Them is what we call -
natural predators.

646
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,266
All this talk about them devils is
splitting my queels on edge!

647
00:58:08,665 --> 00:58:11,746
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir!
- Don't you all worry 'bout a thing.

648
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:16,869
Come tomorrow we'll locate that water
and return to a hero as well!

649
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:22,432
Friends, before we bunk down, I'd like
us all to join hands for a moments.

650
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:25,353
Say a few words
to the Spirit of the West...

651
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,674
Good idea.

652
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:32,237
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West,

653
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:38,560
but tonight I wanna thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

654
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,923
It's a hard life we got. Sometimes
I don't know how we're gonna make it,

655
00:58:44,363 --> 00:58:48,164
but somehow Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

656
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:52,087
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

657
00:58:52,448 --> 00:58:55,288
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

658
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:59,891
Thank you,
Spirit of the West. Amen.

659
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,453
Amen.

660
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:36,718
Just checkin'...

661
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,041
It's so cold tonight.
- Thank you.

662
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:46,828
You ever feel like
those things are lookin' at you?

663
00:59:47,028 --> 00:59:51,487
That's a Spanish Dagger. But around here
we just call 'em the Walkin' Cactus.

664
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:56,608
Walking? - There's an old legend they
actually walk across the desert to find water.

665
00:59:57,049 --> 00:59:59,690
When I was a little girl I'd stay up
late watchin' if they move.

666
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:03,596
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to some place wonderful.

667
01:00:03,796 --> 01:00:08,038
Some place with enough water
for everyone...

668
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,482
Night after night I watched 'em.
I never saw 'em move.

669
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:18,284
But you're still watching? - Who didn't
wanna find some place wonderful?

670
01:00:18,644 --> 01:00:22,686
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

671
01:00:24,848 --> 01:00:27,808
That's such a lonely sound.

672
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:31,410
You ever get lonely?
- Sometimes.

673
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:36,773
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

674
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:40,974
I never made friends easily
like that. - No?

675
01:00:41,336 --> 01:00:43,616
No. We're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch.

676
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,180
Sorta of like being sealed up
in a little box.

677
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,421
Don't really see uh...a lot of folks.

678
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:52,182
I wouldn't know what that's like.

679
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:55,464
Is there someone special
in your life, Rango?

680
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:58,345
Oh! Well, there used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

681
01:00:58,706 --> 01:01:01,107
Besides... My life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

682
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:04,348
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

683
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:07,230
Ridin' the ranges and the such like...

684
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,192
Beans?

685
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:38,006
Disfunctional family...
Need intervention.

686
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:41,168
What's that coming?

687
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:45,209
It's the water!

688
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:50,211
I have a plan! And each and every
one of you has a part to play.

689
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:53,935
What do I do? - Spoons, you've got
the most important job of all!

690
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:56,535
You will stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

691
01:01:57,016 --> 01:01:59,737
you give... the signal.

692
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:10,102
Muh. Mmmuh!
Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

693
01:02:10,622 --> 01:02:13,143
Beans, what size of dress
you're wearing?

694
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:15,865
I've done it!
- Hallelujah!

695
01:02:16,306 --> 01:02:18,186
I have the water!
- You did it, son.

696
01:02:18,587 --> 01:02:21,548
Well, actually...
- Why can't you be like your brother?

697
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:24,470
Pappy, about that water, there's
something I gotta tell you...

698
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:28,231
Hush! Hush up now!
Somebody's comin'!

699
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:32,353
Gracious! Good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee!

700
01:02:32,994 --> 01:02:38,236
May I present my Madame Repones steps
accordion troops of travelling thespians!

701
01:02:38,757 --> 01:02:41,278
What is that?
- I think they's thespians!.

702
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,160
Thespians!
That's illegal in seven states.

703
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,962
The stage is set, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

704
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:50,122
I yearn for love.

705
01:02:50,563 --> 01:02:53,605
Meanwhile, the lone centry
stands and watch at the castle gate.

706
01:02:54,165 --> 01:02:56,125
Hark! Who goes there?

707
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:59,727
This plots highly predictable!!
- Quite! This is my favorite part!

708
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:03,889
Arriving to great phanphare
was her aging father.

709
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,692
Strike a spike, Cupid.

710
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:14,575
Ergh... pretty... unhand... my fair daughter.
And reach for the...

711
01:03:15,656 --> 01:03:19,138
Line? Reach for the sky!

712
01:03:20,899 --> 01:03:24,420
Wha... what was that? - Must
be one of them immersive talers.

713
01:03:24,741 --> 01:03:26,501
We got you surrounded!

714
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:29,303
You and your entire family get your
hands up where I can see 'em.

715
01:03:29,744 --> 01:03:33,025
Ha, my entire family?

716
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:58,237
O, it's a full house!

717
01:03:58,558 --> 01:04:02,920
Looks like we gonna have ourselves
a good oldfashioned stand-off.

718
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,961
I'll have you know you are not
looking at our entire continuing.

719
01:04:13,285 --> 01:04:17,768
Wha...What's that? What's that
supposed to be? - That's the signal.

720
01:04:18,127 --> 01:04:21,689
That's the signal. Something
must have gone wrong!

721
01:04:25,412 --> 01:04:29,253
So...uhm, something's
supposed to happen?

722
01:04:29,774 --> 01:04:33,055
I ... am... open to suggestions.

723
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:42,300
Run!

724
01:04:47,903 --> 01:04:49,744
Get on the wagon!

725
01:04:55,827 --> 01:04:58,708
Do we have ourselves some
sport turns?

726
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:05,471
Ha...I likes it when they run.
- Mabel, give the holler!

727
01:05:10,995 --> 01:05:14,437
Looks like we've made it!
- They're on into to square spots?

728
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,944
Yea! I hope them conmen to
spook right out!

729
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:45,629
They got bats!

730
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:48,430
Oh...Here, you drive.

731
01:05:55,897 --> 01:06:00,135
Looks like it's gonna be
soft dinner, come on!

732
01:06:10,746 --> 01:06:13,346
You damnation!
Don't shoot the water!

733
01:06:13,787 --> 01:06:18,349
Jedidiah, it's time for the
Alabaman squeeze-box! - OK, paps.

734
01:06:25,353 --> 01:06:29,074
I'm sensing hostility.
- They're coming!

735
01:06:33,878 --> 01:06:36,799
Helloo!
- Good bye!

736
01:06:46,404 --> 01:06:49,605
Lassoo that swag!

737
01:07:09,336 --> 01:07:13,578
I suggest we take the days of
action! - Just shut up and shoot!

738
01:07:14,017 --> 01:07:16,459
What happened to the sheriff?
- They got him.

739
01:07:16,758 --> 01:07:20,120
Bosefus, give 'em some
jumbo now!

740
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:28,356
What was that?
Go, check it out.

741
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:32,262
What is it?
Is there a problem?

742
01:07:33,024 --> 01:07:35,424
Ah... you can count on that.

743
01:08:23,769 --> 01:08:25,609
Headache!

744
01:08:27,063 --> 01:08:29,664
Is that all you got?

745
01:08:47,114 --> 01:08:50,515
That was not yet that unpleasant!

746
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:05,092
Hey, here! Hold this!

747
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:16,697
You get your hands of me!

748
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:28,463
Hold on!

749
01:09:31,946 --> 01:09:33,626
Jump!

750
01:09:56,078 --> 01:09:57,718
That's impossible!

751
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:00,959
It can't be.
It's empty.

752
01:10:01,321 --> 01:10:03,042
There's no water!

753
01:10:03,522 --> 01:10:06,522
No water? What the hell have we
been fightin' for?

754
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:10,845
Sir! You have defauled and desacrated
the very sustainance of our livelihood.

755
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:13,846
I think that part
in that dress is the sheriff.

756
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:16,488
That's the same fella who gave us
the prospecting permit?

757
01:10:17,049 --> 01:10:19,449
A what!?
- Irelevant! Confiscation!

758
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,851
You and your kin are
under arrest for bank robbery

759
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:24,052
and the murder of our beloved
financial advisor

760
01:10:24,372 --> 01:10:27,293
Johannes Merymack III,
a.k.a ... Fluffy Joe.

761
01:10:27,814 --> 01:10:30,216
Sheriff, we ain't killed nobody.
We tunelled into that vault,

762
01:10:30,575 --> 01:10:32,335
but there was nothing
in it.

763
01:10:32,737 --> 01:10:34,498
Someone robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

764
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:36,578
Where did you get this here jag?

765
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,380
That's what I was tryin' to tell
you pappy. I found it the desert.

766
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:42,702
Then why darn it did you
bring it here?

767
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:46,304
Hold on! You're saying this here
jug was empty when you found it?

768
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,105
Aha, that's right!
- Nah, I don't believe a word of him!

769
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,305
Let's hang him, sheriff.
- Spring him up!

770
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:54,467
Who would take the water into
the desert? - Wouldn't be the first time...

771
01:10:55,029 --> 01:10:57,629
It's a puzzle!
Like a bit of mammagram!

772
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,791
What's goin' on sheriff?
- I don't know.

773
01:11:01,232 --> 01:11:04,832
But I'm gonna strip away this mistery
and expose its private parts!

774
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:07,474
You and your kin are
comin' with me.

775
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:13,001
They're coming.

776
01:11:13,322 --> 01:11:14,474
Here they come.

777
01:11:15,803 --> 01:11:17,803
Looks like they caught
the robbers.

778
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:42,313
Where's the water?

779
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,472
There weren't no water.

780
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,080
Where is he going?

781
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,922
He's going to see the Mayor...

782
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:12,044
Aaa...he's gotta be pleased with
that, yea! - That's a good one, boss.

783
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,050
Interesting...

784
01:12:24,443 --> 01:12:26,604
I do apologize for the shoes,
Mr. Rango,

785
01:12:26,964 --> 01:12:32,426
but there's certain protocol to this game.
And I'm a bit of strict for protocol.

786
01:12:32,626 --> 01:12:37,188
That's good. 'Cause you gotta few questions
answering, and I got my own protocol.

787
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:44,606
But why would anyone dump water
in the bloomin' desert?

788
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:48,295
It does seem a bit naive taking
the word of admitted bank robbers.

789
01:12:48,495 --> 01:12:51,415
Besides, once they hanged,
your job is done.

790
01:12:51,856 --> 01:12:53,817
Bravo! - Job well done!

791
01:12:54,258 --> 01:12:56,759
But what if someone did rob the
bank before they got there?

792
01:12:56,959 --> 01:13:00,680
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
- I was hoping that you could tell me.

793
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:03,842
That sounds marshally near to an
accusation.

794
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:06,003
Take it anyway you like it.

795
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:14,728
Something you said keeps
rattling 'round my frontal lobe.

796
01:13:15,048 --> 01:13:16,929
What's that?

797
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:21,412
"Control the water,
and you control everything."

798
01:13:21,932 --> 01:13:26,334
Come on, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!

799
01:13:26,775 --> 01:13:30,456
How on Earth could I possibly
control the water?

800
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:38,780
You obviously mastered this game.
- Well...I've been playing it for many years.

801
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:42,061
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

802
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:47,824
I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.

803
01:13:48,346 --> 01:13:51,667
Perhaps it's time you started
to take a long view.

804
01:13:51,946 --> 01:13:55,748
You'd begin to appreciate the
broad sweep of history.

805
01:13:56,110 --> 01:14:02,632
Look out there, son. You can
almost see time passing.

806
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:09,877
What're you building out here?
Future, Mr. Rango, future.

807
01:14:10,317 --> 01:14:13,599
One day soon, all this is going to
faint into myth.

808
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:16,639
the frontier town, the lawmen,
the gunslinger...

809
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:21,122
There's just no place for them
anymore. We're civilized now.

810
01:14:21,643 --> 01:14:23,187
That's right, civilized.

811
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:25,028
That's what the future holds.

812
01:14:25,469 --> 01:14:28,429
You can either be part of it
or you can be left behind.

813
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:32,591
Is that what happened to Mr. Merrymack?
Did he get left behind?

814
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:36,875
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to
forget you're just one little lizard.

815
01:14:37,396 --> 01:14:41,837
You seem to forget -
I'm the law 'round these parts.

816
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,762
Our new sheriff's been playing
the hero for so long

817
01:14:47,121 --> 01:14:49,402
he has actually started
to believe it.

818
01:14:49,843 --> 01:14:52,244
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

819
01:14:52,684 --> 01:14:56,806
Jake's the Grim Reaper. He'll never
leave a rat without ruining his soul!

820
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:59,528
Do it!

821
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:17,457
Now be still. You gotta look presentable.
Going to meet your Maker.

822
01:15:17,977 --> 01:15:26,381
<i>La muerte allegado,
death has arrived.</i>

823
01:15:27,502 --> 01:15:35,545
<i> Como estanto suevos?
How will the hero survive?</i>

824
01:15:39,147 --> 01:15:44,630
The Mayor has bought all of the
land in the valley. Except yours, Miss Beans.

825
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:48,991
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

826
01:15:49,513 --> 01:15:53,275
Unless he controls the water!
Like a monkey's bladder!

827
01:15:53,755 --> 01:15:56,076
Then he can bring it back once
he bought up all the land.

828
01:15:56,396 --> 01:15:58,396
And then how does he control
the water?

829
01:15:58,918 --> 01:16:01,198
Sheriff, we got a problem.

830
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:11,363
Hold on, Beans, that
won't be necessary.

831
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,422
Hang them!
- Tear them apart!

832
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:19,800
Calm down.
Calm down!

833
01:16:20,921 --> 01:16:22,781
Let them pay the price!

834
01:16:22,981 --> 01:16:24,581
We can smack down
their gimmicks!

835
01:16:24,941 --> 01:16:26,982
You too, Spoons?

836
01:16:27,342 --> 01:16:30,063
They're done taking that water.
They'd taken everything we got.

837
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:32,464
No one to hang anyone up.
Not while I'm the sheriff.

838
01:16:32,784 --> 01:16:34,345
But it's all his fault!

839
01:16:34,665 --> 01:16:36,707
You said you was going
to bring the water...

840
01:16:37,187 --> 01:16:41,429
It's just we got no hope without that
water.- We got nothing left to believe.

841
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:44,787
You see that sign up there?

842
01:16:45,342 --> 01:16:47,282
As long as that sign says "sheriff"!

843
01:16:47,963 --> 01:16:50,018
You can believe there's law
and order in this town!

844
01:16:50,394 --> 01:16:52,756
But without law and order!
Luminate on that!

845
01:16:53,266 --> 01:16:57,078
Oh, yea! Starts out slow...
like a... fungus.

846
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:00,118
Somebody says a cross word,
accusations start climbin'...

847
01:17:00,323 --> 01:17:02,671
neighbour turn on neighbour,
pretty soon we're eating our children

848
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:04,911
and dogs and cats will get togehter
to create all sorts

849
01:17:04,242 --> 01:17:06,722
of unatural murant apparitions!

850
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:11,338
So you want something to
believe in, Spoons?

851
01:17:12,097 --> 01:17:14,338
Believe in me.

852
01:17:15,139 --> 01:17:17,940
Believe in that sign.

853
01:17:18,381 --> 01:17:22,102
As long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

854
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:50,156
Hello, "brother".

855
01:17:50,597 --> 01:17:52,878
Thirsty?

856
01:18:02,723 --> 01:18:05,524
Long time, brother.

857
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:11,448
How've you been keeping?
- Oh, well, you know...

858
01:18:11,968 --> 01:18:16,050
I heard all that turnabout how you
killed them Jenkins brothers.

859
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,852
with one bullet,
wasn't it?

860
01:18:19,212 --> 01:18:21,493
Isn't that right?

861
01:18:22,013 --> 01:18:25,735
All these good folks here believed
your little stories, don't they?

862
01:18:26,055 --> 01:18:30,201
Why, they believe you're
just a stone killer, don't they?

863
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:33,122
Seems these folks trust you.

864
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,963
They think you're gonna
save their little town.

865
01:18:36,324 --> 01:18:41,938
They think you're gonna
save their little souls.

866
01:18:43,161 --> 01:18:46,161
But we know better.
Don't we?

867
01:18:53,022 --> 01:18:56,784
So why don't you show your friends
here what you're made of?

868
01:18:57,104 --> 01:18:59,824
Show 'em who you really are.

869
01:19:00,226 --> 01:19:02,986
Why don't you just pull your
gun and shoot me?

870
01:19:03,307 --> 01:19:05,668
But of course, you won't need
all the bean...

871
01:19:06,029 --> 01:19:09,441
Just one, right?

872
01:19:09,641 --> 01:19:14,705
Go ahead, hero.
Pull the trigger.

873
01:19:15,632 --> 01:19:18,993
You got killer in
your eyes, son?

874
01:19:20,114 --> 01:19:22,476
I don't see it.

875
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:30,279
You didn't do any of them things
you said? You didn't kill Jenkins brothers?

876
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:33,841
You ain't even from the West,
are you?

877
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:36,243
Say it!

878
01:19:36,682 --> 01:19:41,165
No. - O, speak up.  I don't think
your friends here heard you.

879
01:19:43,327 --> 01:19:49,369
No. - All you done is lied to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a freak and a coward.

880
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,144
Isn't that right?

881
01:19:52,344 --> 01:19:58,307
Yes. - Louder!
- Yes.

882
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:04,037
Listen closely, you pathetic
fraud. This is my town.

883
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:09,756
If I ever see you again, I'll take
your soul straight down to hell!

884
01:20:25,574 --> 01:20:27,574
Who are you?

885
01:22:24,621 --> 01:22:27,141
<i>Who am I?</i>

886
01:22:28,164 --> 01:22:30,564
<i>I am nobody.</i>

887
01:24:23,787 --> 01:24:27,388
Golden guardians!

888
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:30,646
The alabaster carriage!

889
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,631
The Spirit of the West!

890
01:24:41,636 --> 01:24:42,996
Excuse me... Mister...
Spirit? Sir?

891
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:50,359
Aaa...here's the beauty. Sometimes
you gotta dig deep

892
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,962
to find what you're
looking for.

893
01:24:54,201 --> 01:24:56,483
So you made it...

894
01:24:57,043 --> 01:24:59,204
Is this Heaven?

895
01:24:59,524 --> 01:25:02,559
If it were, we'd be eating
Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

896
01:25:02,759 --> 01:25:05,101
Yea...ha...no kidding?

897
01:25:06,339 --> 01:25:09,662
What are you doing out here?
- Searching...same as you.

898
01:25:11,647 --> 01:25:14,608
I don't even know what I'm
looking for.

899
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:15,971
I don't even know
who I am.

900
01:25:16,171 --> 01:25:18,891
And they used to call you
"The Man with Name".

901
01:25:19,332 --> 01:25:22,733
These days, they gotta a name
for just about everything.

902
01:25:23,134 --> 01:25:27,176
It doesn't matter what they call
you, it's the deeds, that make the man.

903
01:25:27,696 --> 01:25:31,097
But my deeds just made things worse.
I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

904
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:35,339
My friends believed in me, but
they need some kinda hero...

905
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:39,382
Then be a hero.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

906
01:25:39,622 --> 01:25:42,422
I'm not even supposed
to be here. - That's right.

907
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:46,585
You came a long way to find
something that isn't out here.

908
01:25:46,906 --> 01:25:50,067
Don't you see?
It's not about you.

909
01:25:50,428 --> 01:25:53,790
It's about them.

910
01:25:54,990 --> 01:26:00,472
But I can't go back... - You don't
know that you gotta choice, son.

911
01:26:02,554 --> 01:26:07,316
No man can walk out on his
own story.

912
01:26:17,722 --> 01:26:20,763
So, you made it.

913
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:25,486
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.

914
01:26:27,206 --> 01:26:30,447
Did you just see that?

915
01:26:30,809 --> 01:26:37,252
We all see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?

916
01:26:48,138 --> 01:26:51,858
Yes... It is.

917
01:26:52,299 --> 01:26:56,581
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

918
01:26:59,383 --> 01:27:04,425
Many years ago, this entire valley
was covered in aqua.

919
01:27:05,626 --> 01:27:08,547
Now... only one question
remains:

920
01:27:09,628 --> 01:27:11,749
Where did it go?

921
01:27:46,687 --> 01:27:48,929
They follow the water.

922
01:27:49,288 --> 01:27:52,529
They follow the water!
Come on!

923
01:28:27,588 --> 01:28:32,349
<i>It just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.</i>

924
01:28:32,711 --> 01:28:34,911
<i>What are you building
out there?</i>

925
01:28:35,432 --> 01:28:37,432
<i>The future, Mr. Rango.</i>

926
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:42,435
<i>You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.</i>

927
01:28:43,596 --> 01:28:47,758
<i>I was here before the highway
split this great valley.</i>

928
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:54,721
<i>I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.</i>

929
01:28:59,764 --> 01:29:04,887
<i>Control the water,
and you'll control everything.</i>

930
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:16,492
<i>Come, now, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!</i>

931
01:29:16,773 --> 01:29:21,135
<i>How on Earth could I
possibly control the water?</i>

932
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:49,790
EMMERGENCY SHUT OFF
valve 6

933
01:29:55,146 --> 01:29:58,188
What now, amigo?

934
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:08,353
No man can walk out
of his own story.

935
01:30:09,354 --> 01:30:10,994
I'm going back.

936
01:30:11,648 --> 01:30:12,358
But why?

937
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:17,526
Because that's who I am.

938
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:34,035
You gotta lot of nerve showing up
here, lawman! What do you want?

939
01:30:34,235 --> 01:30:36,635
Your pappy and them boys are
'bout to hang for something

940
01:30:37,076 --> 01:30:40,678
they didn't do. But I have a plan.

941
01:31:09,253 --> 01:31:12,415
I appreciate how difficult this is
for you, Beans.

942
01:31:12,774 --> 01:31:15,073
But you're making a practical
decision.

943
01:31:15,273 --> 01:31:17,434
Decisions... Decisions...

944
01:31:17,914 --> 01:31:21,155
There is no need
for any more suffering...

945
01:31:27,756 --> 01:31:31,598
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

946
01:31:32,078 --> 01:31:38,080
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

947
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:41,327
My daddy was not a burden!

948
01:31:41,768 --> 01:31:45,369
Keep your blood money,
and I'll keep my land!

949
01:31:49,653 --> 01:31:52,894
Do what he says or by all
the fires of the black pit

950
01:31:53,254 --> 01:31:57,576
I'll squeeze them pretty brown
eyes right out of your skull!

951
01:31:57,936 --> 01:32:01,418
Now, hold on, Jake, there's no need...
- Let me do my job!

952
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:05,540
You brought me here now we're
gonna play this sling out to the end.

953
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:10,062
Sign the damn paper, woman!
- Go to hell!

954
01:32:10,503 --> 01:32:13,343
Where do you think
I come from?

955
01:32:13,864 --> 01:32:16,226
Look into my eyes...

956
01:32:16,586 --> 01:32:19,627
I wanna see you die!

957
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:26,190
Jake!

958
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,473
I'm calling you out!

959
01:32:31,887 --> 01:32:33,647
Jake!

960
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:38,651
This day just got a
little more interesting.

961
01:33:05,425 --> 01:33:07,586
Put her down.

962
01:33:07,906 --> 01:33:10,258
Or what, little man?
You gonna kill me?

963
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:14,099
That's just about the
size of it.

964
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:17,581
Get those filthy paws of me!
- Shut up your gob!

965
01:33:18,022 --> 01:33:21,383
All right, sheriff.
Make your move.

966
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,591
Now, amigos!

967
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:02,435
Pull! Pull!

968
01:35:19,044 --> 01:35:21,884
That was a bad idea.

969
01:35:25,566 --> 01:35:28,287
Thirsty, "Brother"?

970
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:34,650
It's coming!

971
01:35:40,414 --> 01:35:43,255
This is a miracle!
- Hold on!

972
01:35:50,139 --> 01:35:52,780
Look, the water!
- What is that?

973
01:35:53,621 --> 01:35:55,381
It's our salvation, pappy!

974
01:35:55,942 --> 01:35:59,503
It's our jailway going out!
We're gonna escape!

975
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:11,821
I'm gonna blow so many holes
in your body, you're be leaking led!

976
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:15,102
Then it's a good thing
I brought some back-up.

977
01:36:15,863 --> 01:36:17,662
What?

978
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:35,151
Ain't no hawk!
Ain't nothing but bats!

979
01:36:37,353 --> 01:36:40,715
Stick to the plan boys!
Aim for his head!

980
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:56,963
It only takes one bullet.
- You ain't got the nerve!

981
01:36:57,964 --> 01:37:00,124
Try me.

982
01:37:04,288 --> 01:37:08,650
Oh, Mr. Rango... aren't you
forgetting something?

983
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:17,373
Hand me your gun, sheriff.

984
01:37:18,254 --> 01:37:21,456
Now, Mr. Rango!

985
01:37:32,341 --> 01:37:35,061
Beans, hold on!
Don't worry! I've got a plan!

986
01:37:35,824 --> 01:37:39,946
Help!
Open the door!

987
01:37:40,746 --> 01:37:42,626
OK, plan B.

988
01:37:43,347 --> 01:37:45,468
What? Beans,
you're mumbling!

989
01:37:46,188 --> 01:37:49,710
All my problems are taken
care of. Except for one.

990
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:53,752
It's a new West, Jake, there is
no room for gunslingers any more

991
01:37:54,193 --> 01:37:57,874
We're businessmen now.
- We got new hats.

992
01:37:58,315 --> 01:38:01,916
Where I come from, we call
this im-provi-sation.

993
01:38:02,557 --> 01:38:05,078
You're came back!

994
01:38:12,842 --> 01:38:14,482
What was that!?

995
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:19,365
No need to panic! But I think you just
swallowed our plan B. - What?

996
01:38:19,926 --> 01:38:21,765
OK... panic time.

997
01:38:22,207 --> 01:38:26,048
You and the sheriff are more alike
than you think. Nothing but legends.

998
01:38:26,489 --> 01:38:31,291
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed.

999
01:38:33,253 --> 01:38:36,294
One last bullet to kill the
last outlaw.

1000
01:38:37,695 --> 01:38:40,656
How fitting!

1001
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:18,636
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,
we can reach mutually beneficial

1002
01:39:18,996 --> 01:39:24,638
solution to our current situation.
- You better take it up with him.

1003
01:39:34,564 --> 01:39:37,285
One bullet...

1004
01:39:37,726 --> 01:39:40,366
I tip my hat to you.

1005
01:39:40,807 --> 01:39:44,929
As one legend to another.

1006
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,650
What was that you say?

1007
01:39:48,011 --> 01:39:53,532
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed?

1008
01:40:06,447 --> 01:40:12,770
Rango! You brought the
water back. Just like you promised.

1009
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:15,269
You really are a hero...

1010
01:40:15,469 --> 01:40:20,832
Well, thing about heros is you never...
- Don't spoil...

1011
01:40:21,472 --> 01:40:24,874
Well I don't know about you,
but I could sure go for a dip!

1012
01:40:28,235 --> 01:40:31,876
<i>And so the lizard completes
his journey.</i>

1013
01:40:32,397 --> 01:40:35,599
<i>From the humble beginnings to the
legend we sing of today.</i>

1014
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,241
<i>And although, he's certain to die.
Perhaps from ...er... household accident!</i>

1015
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:43,322
<i>Which account for 65 % all
unatural deaths.</i>

1016
01:40:43,642 --> 01:40:47,244
<i>The people of the village will
always remember</i>

1017
01:40:47,565 --> 01:40:50,485
<i>the name of the ONE
who saved them.</i>

1018
01:40:50,767 --> 01:40:52,767
<i>Rango!</i>

1019
01:40:54,833 --> 01:41:22,962
Brought 2 u by
Cipi and OrUp
