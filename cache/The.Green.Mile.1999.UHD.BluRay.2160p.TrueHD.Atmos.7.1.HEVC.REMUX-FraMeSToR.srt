1
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,743
Katie!

2
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,912
Cora!

3
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,705
You love your sister?

4
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,458
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,423
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,301
- How am I looking, Paul?
- That's better. That's better.

7
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,194
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,654
Some Danish this morning?

9
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,074
No, just two pieces of dry toast,
Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,617
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,288
-Dry and cold, same as always.
-Cold is better.

12
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,789
Hmm.

13
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,791
Especially on those long walks.

14
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,419
Am I right?

15
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,466
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

16
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,760
We're not supposed to let you
wander off.

17
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:45,975
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

18
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,061
Just walk.

19
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,229
I like to walk.

20
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,734
You try not to fall down, bust a hip.

21
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,029
I don't wanna be in
no damn search party.

22
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,725
You want this man
constantly in your life?

23
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,894
Explain the moral basis of that.

24
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,187
I've made mistakes.

25
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,606
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

26
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,652
She can't ask nothing. You can't
ask nothing. I have six kids myself.

27
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,364
Why do we always watch this stuff?

28
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,575
It's interesting.

29
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,955
Interesting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

30
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,749
All they ever talk about is fucking.

31
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,751
ain't no way in this green earth...

32
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,253
<i>...I'd have a father like that.</i>

33
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,133
If what you saying is true--
No, I'm talking now. I'm talking now.

34
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,718
What kind of a mother are you?

35
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,428
One that causes people more--

36
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,014
is going to let you try the bodystrider--

37
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,932
You're dead! You can't come back!

38
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,436
It's back. The Popeil Pocket Fisherman.

39
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,521
Take my husband, take my kids...

40
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,691
-Are you all right?
-Hmm?

41
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,360
You look tired. You're not yourself.

42
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,238
No, I'm fine. I promise.

43
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,326
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

44
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,453
Not that you asked me.

45
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:13,623
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

46
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,960
I had a few bad dreams. It happens.

47
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,795
I'll be fine.

48
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,973
If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

49
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,308
Neither do I.

50
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,144
Now, this here is worth a look.

51
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,856
I'm in heaven

52
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:45,821
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

53
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,407
And I seem to find

54
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,328
The happiness I seek

55
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:59,001
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

56
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,837
Heaven

57
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,882
I'm in heaven

58
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,427
And the cares that hung around me

59
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,430
Through the week

60
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,391
Seem to vanish

61
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,686
Like a gambler's lucky streak

62
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:22,024
Paul, what is it?

63
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,861
My God.

64
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,411
I've got to get out of here.

65
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,894
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

66
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,189
...whether you want it to or not.
It's silly.

67
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,901
Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?

68
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,574
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

69
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,200
Over 60 years.

70
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,203
Paul, I'm your friend.

71
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,503
I ever tell you that I was a prison guard
during the Depression?

72
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,589
You've mentioned it.

73
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,925
Did I mention that I was
in charge of death row?

74
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,386
That I supervised all the executions?

75
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:41,479
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

76
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,273
We called ours "The Green Mile."

77
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,027
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

78
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,530
We had the electric chair.

79
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,783
"Old Sparky," we called it.

80
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,996
Oh, I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

81
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,626
...but 1935, that takes the prize.

82
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,796
That year, I had...

83
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:10,216
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

84
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,344
It was...

85
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,639
It was also the year of...

86
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,350
...John Coffey...

87
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,937
...and the two dead girls.

88
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,743
All right, now, hold on!

89
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,875
Up on the tower!

90
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,376
New prisoner's coming in!

91
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,504
You men down in the yard,
step off the fence! Clear that gate!

92
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,555
Put me through to E Block.

93
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,945
E Block.

94
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,739
Yeah.

95
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,407
Right.

96
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,005
Oh.

97
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,847
Paul? Prisoner.

98
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,641
Christ, give me a minute.

99
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,439
You all right in there?

100
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,030
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.
Ahh...

101
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,963
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

102
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,882
With a new arrival?
You know better.

103
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,968
Besides...

104
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,972
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

105
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,935
-All right. Let's look alive, Dean.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,527
Damn.

107
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,822
They're riding on the axle.

108
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:30,874
What'd they do?

109
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,876
They bust the springs?

110
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,425
Ho...

111
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,178
Dead man!

112
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,639
Dead man walking!

113
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,351
-Who--?
-We got a dead man walking here!

114
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,688
Jesus, please us,
what is he yelling about?

115
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,192
Paul...

116
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,821
...you might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

117
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,448
He's enormous.

118
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,617
Can't be bigger than you.

119
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,420
Dead man!

120
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,756
Dead man walking!

121
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,424
Dead man!

122
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,176
Dead man walking!

123
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,346
Dead man walking here!

124
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,890
Dead man!

125
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,438
We got a dead man walking here!

126
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,231
Dead man walking!

127
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,820
- We got a dead man walking here!
- Percy.

128
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,781
That's enough.

129
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,431
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

130
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,604
Can you talk?

131
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,155
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

132
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,291
Move your ass. Let's go.

133
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,168
Come on.

134
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,342
Percy...

135
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,595
...they're moving house
down in the infirmary.

136
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,099
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help.

137
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,476
They got all the men they need.

138
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,812
Why don't you just go
and make sure.

139
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,858
-Uh-uh.
- I don't care where you go...

140
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,318
...as long as it's not here
at this very moment.

141
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:08,907
All right.

142
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,003
Ow!

143
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,173
God, you bust my finger.

144
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,759
I wiped that grin off your face,
didn't 1?

145
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,387
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

146
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,727
Uh-huh.

147
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,358
Fuck you, Percy.

148
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,820
We'll get that looked at, Del.
In the meantime, you stay quiet.

149
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,907
Yeah. Yeah.

150
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,163
I let Harry take those chains off you...

151
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,998
...you gonna be nice?

152
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,683
Your name is John Coffey.

153
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,685
Yes, sir, boss.

154
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,397
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

155
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,191
Oh, you can spell, can you?

156
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,778
Just my name, boss.

157
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,906
J-O--

158
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,242
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

159
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,954
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

160
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,249
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

161
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,919
Questions?

162
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,089
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

163
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,262
Because I get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

164
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,557
...if it's a strange place.

165
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,440
It stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

166
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,235
We always keep a few lights burning
out in the corridor.

167
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,321
The corridor?

168
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,324
Right out there.

169
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,062
You can sit.

170
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,712
I couldn't help it, boss.

171
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,382
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

172
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:21,850
Dean, take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

173
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,518
-Yes, sir.
-Of course they're broken.

174
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,395
I heard the bones crack.

175
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,398
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

176
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,651
How could I miss it?
The whole prison heard.

177
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,694
Goddamn Percy.

178
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,365
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

179
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,534
I'll chew that food when I have to.

180
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:44,206
Right now I wanna hear about this new
inmate. Aside from how big he is, okay?

181
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,084
Monstrous big. Damn.

182
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,294
Oh, he seems meek enough.

183
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,254
- Is he retarded, you figure?
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,383
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

185
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,886
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

186
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,475
Make your blood curdle.

187
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,420
-What?! For God's sake, what?
-The girls! The girls are gone!

188
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,090
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

189
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,263
Oh, my God.

190
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,522
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone
now. You tell them we headed west.

191
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,817
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

192
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,445
Central! Are you on the line?

193
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:00,824
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

194
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,962
Katie!

195
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,506
Coral!

196
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,081
Jesus.

197
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,541
Jesus.

198
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,804
I'll kill you!

199
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,226
I'll kill you!

200
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,714
I couldn't help it.

201
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:44,344
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

202
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,767
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

203
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,729
I interrupt?

204
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,942
Well, I'm just about done.

205
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,078
Hey...

206
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,206
...how's that pretty gal of yours?

207
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,418
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

208
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,378
Not so well at all.

209
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,590
More headaches?

210
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,801
Got laid up
with another one yesterday.

211
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,887
Worst one yet.

212
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,558
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

213
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,312
Head x-rays
and who knows what else.

214
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,273
She is scared to death.

215
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,360
Truth to tell, so am I.

216
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,489
If it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

217
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,950
...maybe it's something they can fix.

218
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,494
Maybe.

219
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,375
This just came in.

220
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,961
DOE on Bitterbuck.

221
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,467
You didn't come all the way down here
to hand me a DOE.

222
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:10,931
I had an angry call from
the state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

223
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,475
Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

224
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,976
It is.

225
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,397
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

226
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,401
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

227
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,487
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

228
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,614
Little Percy calls his aunt...

229
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:31,326
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

230
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,040
He also mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

231
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,001
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

232
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,837
I didn't hear that part.
I'm sure she didn't either.

233
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,923
The man is mean and careless
and stupid...

234
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:48,009
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

235
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,679
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

236
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,222
Stick with it, Paul.

237
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,182
It may not be much longer.

238
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:58,979
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

239
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,690
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

240
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,233
Administration job.

241
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,943
Better pay.

242
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:06,403
Hmm.

243
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:08,655
Then why is he still here?

244
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:12,867
He could get that application
pushed through.

245
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,373
Hell, with his connections, he could
have any state job he wants.

246
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,834
You know what I think?

247
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,423
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

248
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,388
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

249
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:38,393
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

250
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,896
-...you'll keep the peace?
-Of course.

251
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,524
Of course.

252
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,569
Thank you, Paul.

253
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,074
Hal...

254
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,119
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

255
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:00,874
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

256
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,460
You bet.

257
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,905
Paul.

258
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,823
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

259
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,909
The music too loud?

260
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,827
No.

261
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,581
There's just this empty spot in the bed
where my husband usually sleeps.

262
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,796
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

263
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,426
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

264
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,596
Is that what's got you up?

265
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,807
Yeah, that...

266
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,601
...and things.

267
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,145
Things.

268
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,736
We got a new inmate today.

269
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,364
Simple-minded fella.

270
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,909
Do I wanna know what he did?

271
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,620
-No.
-Mmm.

272
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,998
Things that happen in this world.

273
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,460
It's a wonder God allows it.

274
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,716
Why don't you come to bed.

275
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,679
I think I have something
that'll help you sleep.

276
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,182
You can have all you want.

277
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,811
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

278
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,021
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

279
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,150
-Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?
-No.

280
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:52,235
Paul.

281
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,071
He'll just want me
to take sulfa tablets...

282
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,740
...and I'll spend the week
puking in my office.

283
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:02,036
It will run its course all by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

284
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,374
Poor old guy.

285
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,170
-Hmm.

286
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:23,391
Paul. Dean.

287
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,105
Yeah?

288
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,857
Come here. Go on.

289
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,905
I guess the legislature loosened
up the purse strings enough...

290
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,573
...10 hire on a new guard.

291
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,541
Look again.

292
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,251
He's right...

293
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,961
...there.

294
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,723
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people this way.

295
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,809
- Maybe it's rabid.
- Oh, my Christ.

296
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,812
-Yeah, it could be.
-Oh, the big mouse expert.

297
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,190
The Mouse Man.

298
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,318
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

299
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,737
I don't see its mouth at all.

300
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:31,167
-Brutal, no. We'll be hip-deep in mice.
-I just wanna see what he'll do.

301
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,753
In the interest of science, like.

302
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:16,170
He's in the damn restraint room.

303
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,840
And you just know he's chewing
the padding out of the walls...

304
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,009
...making himself a nice little nest.

305
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,849
All right.

306
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,685
Let's go get the damn mouse.

307
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,990
Boss.

308
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,992
Saw me a mouse go by.

309
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,369
Can't put anything over on you.

310
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,509
Just watch your toes. Watch your toes.

311
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,571
You let him get past you.

312
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,199
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

313
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,242
Then where the hell is he?

314
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,911
Well, I don't know.

315
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,248
Three grown men...

316
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,585
...outsmarted by a mouse.

317
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:44,926
Well, bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

318
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,428
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,431
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

320
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:44,485
You little son of a bitch.

321
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,989
Well, I'll be damned.

322
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:53,077
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

323
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,997
-That's a goddamn mouse.
-Yeah.

324
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,168
Brute said he was in here last night...

325
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:01,961
...begging for food.

326
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,630
He come right on up to the desk.

327
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,592
-Give him some room, Percy.
-Huh?

328
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,011
-See what he does.
-All right.

329
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,859
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

330
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:54,847
Goddamn!

331
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,434
You little scurvy! Damn!

332
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,604
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

333
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,898
I'm gonna kill you!

334
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,736
-I'm gonna take you out!
-Percy! Percy!

335
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,406
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

336
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,617
It's just a little mouse, dumb merde.

337
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,577
You ugly little piece of sh--

338
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,455
- Are you listening to me?
- Fuck!

339
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:23,417
-Percy!
-I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

340
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,044
...you little piece of shit!

341
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:30,091
- Get on out of there!
- I want you to stop this!

342
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,101
- Hey, boss!
- What's going on?

343
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,317
Percy met your mouse.

344
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:55,199
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

345
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,996
Percy, we already tried that.

346
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:03,207
Huh?

347
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,959
What'd you say?

348
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,627
I said that we--

349
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,634
Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

350
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,554
Oh, yeah.

351
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,818
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

352
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,155
Don't that beat the mousy band?

353
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,367
Percy...

354
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,330
...you wanna think about
what you were doing just now?

355
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:46,167
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

356
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,837
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

357
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,672
...not to mention the inmates.

358
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,257
So what?

359
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,011
They aren't in cradle school,
in case you didn't notice.

360
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,639
Although you treat them that way.

361
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:03,017
We don't scare them
any more than we have to, Percy.

362
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:07,146
-They're under enough strain as it is.
-Men under strain can snap.

363
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,858
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

364
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,277
...talking...

365
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,529
...not yelling.

366
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,659
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward of a hospital.

367
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,371
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

368
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,247
That's all.

369
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,334
Anybody doesn't like it? Hmm?

370
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,753
You can kiss my ass.

371
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,839
Don't. Yeah, you try it. Go on.

372
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,718
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

373
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,553
Okay, Brutal.

374
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,276
We all know who
your connections are.

375
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,906
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

376
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,700
Job be damned.

377
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,745
You done?

378
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,003
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

379
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,609
Arlen...

380
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,112
...your daughter and her family
are here.

381
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,622
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

382
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,128
Sitting down, sitting down!

383
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,005
Rehearsing now. Everybody settle!

384
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,132
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

385
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,969
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

386
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,473
-Is his head properly shaved?
-Nope. It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

387
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,684
I will take that as a yes.
Let's go, Arlen.

388
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:12,563
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

389
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:17,109
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

390
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,652
...walking the Mile.

391
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,906
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

392
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,825
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

393
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:29,497
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

394
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,166
And I hope they forgive me...

395
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:35,169
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

396
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,215
Paul, we're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

397
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,383
...hollering and shaking his dick,
are we?

398
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,178
- Well, actually--
- Still praying, still praying.

399
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:48,182
-Getting right with Jesus.
-Do it quietly! You old gink!

400
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,436
As I was saying, I don't believe
they actually shake their dicks.

401
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:56,148
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

402
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,860
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked-up.

403
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,947
On your feet. Come on, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

404
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,908
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

405
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,453
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

406
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:11,539
Walking the Mile.

407
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,457
Walking in the Mile.

408
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,377
Sitting down now.

409
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,422
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

410
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,882
What do I do?

411
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,220
- Watch and learn.
- Watch and learn.

412
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,935
Getting strapped.

413
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,729
Getting clamped.

414
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,066
Getting wired.

415
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,236
All right.

416
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,573
Getting all electrode.

417
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,371
Roll on one.

418
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,250
"Roll on one" means I turn
the generator up full.

419
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,627
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

420
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,588
Arlen Bitterbuck...

421
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,424
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

422
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,802
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

423
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,805
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

424
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,473
Yeah.

425
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:16,604
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

426
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:22,151
I got to have Mae West sit on my face
because I'm one horny motherfucker.

427
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,823
You bastard.

428
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,451
That's a good one.

429
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:32,036
Quiet.

430
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,579
Quiet! Shut up!

431
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:36,290
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

432
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:40,628
Toot, one more remark like that,
I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real.

433
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,339
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

434
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,507
It was pretty funny.

435
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,302
That's why I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

436
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:53,098
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

437
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,808
Ever try not to laugh in church

438
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,770
when something funny gets stuck in your head?
It's the same thing.

439
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,856
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

440
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,691
Let's keep going.

441
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,276
Harry.

442
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,282
Soak the sponge.

443
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,537
Putting on the black hood.

444
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,042
And putting on my cap.

445
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,294
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

446
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,464
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

447
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,677
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

448
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,431
Hush up there, Toot.

449
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,353
Getting screwed.

450
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,231
I'm getting the cap.

451
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,861
Arlen Bitterbuck...

452
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,448
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

453
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,909
...in accordance with state law.

454
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,704
God have mercy on your soul.

455
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,456
Amen.

456
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,002
Roll on two.

457
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,549
And that's that.

458
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,888
I'm frying! I'm frying!

459
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,727
I'm a done tom turkey!

460
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,273
This is a shocking experience!

461
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,068
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

462
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,786
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

463
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,414
Get that idiot out of the chair.

464
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:45,145
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

465
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,650
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

466
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:52,027
...and live there forever?

467
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,490
Could that be what heaven's like?

468
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,494
I just about believe that very thing.

469
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,249
Hmm.

470
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,837
Had me a young wife when I was 18.

471
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:15,175
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

472
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,971
And she'd lie there after...

473
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,266
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

474
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,728
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

475
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:32,276
That was my best time.

476
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,964
It'll be fine.

477
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,884
You'll do fine.

478
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,213
Arlen Bitterbuck...

479
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:36,715
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body...

480
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,969
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

481
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,597
God have mercy on your soul.

482
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,493
Roll on two.

483
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,831
Again.

484
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,714
Adios, chief.

485
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:03,677
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

486
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,432
He's paid what he owed.

487
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,143
He's square with the house again...

488
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,021
...So keep your goddamn hands
off him.

489
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:36,043
What's up his ass?

490
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,544
You.

491
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,131
Always. You, Percy.

492
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,885
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

493
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,182
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

494
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,560
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

495
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,356
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

496
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:02,194
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

497
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,738
Yeah, you heard me.

498
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,949
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

499
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,791
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

500
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,418
I just wanna be out front, is all.

501
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,713
Come on. One time.

502
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,424
And then you know what?

503
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,552
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

504
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,596
And if I say no?

505
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:34,267
Well, I might just stick around
for good.

506
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,978
Make me a career of this...

507
00:47:38,271 --> 00:47:39,606
...boss.

508
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,661
You are not gonna believe this.

509
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,547
Look.

510
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,676
I done tame me that mouse.

511
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,053
We see that.

512
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:57,100
Ooh, ooh. Watch this.
Watch what he do.

513
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,109
Ain't he something, now?

514
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,321
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

515
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,698
-Mr. Jingles?
-That his name.

516
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:14,242
He whispered in my ear.

517
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,869
Hey, captain...

518
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,706
...could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

519
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,584
Your English gets better
when you want something.

520
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,711
Wanna see what else he can do?

521
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,714
Watch, watch.

522
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,926
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

523
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,219
Wanna play fetch?

524
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,847
Play fetch. Watch, watch.

525
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,578
He fetch it every time. Every time.

526
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:03,416
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

527
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,797
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

528
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,049
When I get out,
he'll make me rich.

529
00:50:11,424 --> 00:50:13,760
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

530
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,263
Play fetch? We play fetch again?

531
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,765
Well, well, well.

532
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,434
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

533
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,436
Don't hurt him.

534
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,440
-Okay?
-Is that the one I chased?

535
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,484
Yeah, that's the one.

536
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,280
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

537
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,407
Is that so?

538
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,285
Del's been asking for a box.

539
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,914
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
I guess. Might keep it for a pet.

540
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,585
What do you think?

541
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:51,631
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

542
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:56,761
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

543
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,889
Yeah.

544
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,142
Yeah. That should do real nice.

545
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:13,987
Man said get a cigar box.

546
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,040
Morning.

547
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,922
Hal, you wanted to see me?

548
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,506
Yeah.

549
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,550
Close the door.

550
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,225
So you know...

551
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,563
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

552
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,358
"William Wharton."

553
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,735
He's what you call...

554
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,029
...a problem child.

555
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:00,575
Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed
on his left arm.

556
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,871
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

557
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,499
...causing all kinds of trouble.

558
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:10,210
Finally hit the big time.

559
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,881
Killed three people in a holdup.

560
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,217
One of them a pregnant woman.

561
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,721
Bad news all around.

562
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,225
Hal?

563
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,404
It's a tumor, Paul.

564
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,824
A brain tumor.

565
00:52:42,575 --> 00:52:44,244
They got...

566
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:46,663
...X-ray pictures of it.

567
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,583
It's the size of a lemon, they said.

568
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,587
And...

569
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,257
...way down...

570
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,302
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

571
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,015
I haven't told her.

572
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,768
I can't think how.

573
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,649
For the life of me, Paul...

574
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,154
...I can't think how
to tell my wife...

575
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:24,617
...she's going to die.

576
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,261
Oh.

577
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,142
Aah.

578
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,937
Aah!

579
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,116
Oh!

580
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:51,371
Oh, God.

581
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,581
Oh, God.

582
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,878
I'm going.

583
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:03,049
-What?
-To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

584
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,884
Today.

585
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,304
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

586
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,973
That bad?

587
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,808
Oh, yeah.

588
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,082
The boy is doped to the gills.

589
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:38,918
Hmm?

590
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,295
Hand me them clothes.

591
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,258
William Wharton?

592
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,887
Hey! You put on these clothes now,
you hear?

593
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,105
We're gonna have to do this.

594
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,941
Hellraiser, huh?

595
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,694
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

596
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,947
Hey. Hey.

597
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,410
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

598
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,830
Means you're gonna ride the lightning.
Yeah.

599
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,584
Percy, could you shut up,
give us a hand here?

600
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,128
Hellraiser.

601
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:54,619
You don't look so good.

602
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,539
Look like you're running you a fever.

603
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,922
Boss Edgecomb?

604
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,342
I needs to see you down here, boss.

605
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,431
I got things to tend to just now,
John Coffey. You just...

606
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:20,270
You just stay still in your cell.

607
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:33,074
E Block.

608
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,820
Come on, let's go.

609
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,157
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

610
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,089
Careful.

611
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,763
- Careful.
- Step up. Step up.

612
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,591
Where you going? Where you going?

613
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,805
Ain't this a party now?

614
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,306
-Is it or what?
-Let him go.

615
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,141
-Shoot him.
-See who you hit.

616
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,310
-Shoot the son of a bitch.
-Shoot me!

617
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,814
-Shoot him!
-Hit him, Percy! Goddamn it! Hit him.

618
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,482
Hit me, you limp noodle.

619
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,984
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it, hit him!

620
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,154
-Come on, Percy. Hit me.
-Wharton, I'm warning you.

621
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,199
-You warning me? Warn me now.
-I'm warning you!

622
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,451
- You're warning me?!
- Shoot him!

623
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,994
Well, come on--

624
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:50,503
You're a big fucker.

625
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,296
Where'd you come from?

626
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,393
Come on, Dean. Come on, boy, get up.

627
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,186
All right. Now, just breathe.

628
01:00:07,728 --> 01:00:09,856
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

629
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,443
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

630
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,654
- Didn't see it coming.
- Come on, boy, breathe.

631
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,865
Come on. Just breathe.

632
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,870
We thought he was doped.

633
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:28,374
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

634
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,334
You didn't ask?

635
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:33,546
Well, I guess that's not a mistake...

636
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,091
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

637
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,775
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

638
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,738
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

639
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,532
Say the situation's under control.
It's not a story.

640
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,410
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

641
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,829
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

642
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,416
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

643
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,127
Go on, now. Go.

644
01:01:20,801 --> 01:01:23,930
Come on, boy. Let's get you looked at.

645
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,959
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

646
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:59,757
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

647
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,926
...not a good time at all.

648
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:06,264
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

649
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,620
Closer.

650
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:32,206
Boss, you know you ain't
supposed to do that.

651
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,835
Mind your business, Del.

652
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:47,513
What do you want, John Coffey?

653
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,682
Just to help it.

654
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,770
Don't be afraid.

655
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,355
Help!

656
01:02:57,189 --> 01:02:59,984
Help! John Coffey's
killing Boss Edgecomb!

657
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,694
Help!

658
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,114
- What are you doing?
- Help!

659
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,535
Boss Howell! Help!

660
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,996
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

661
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,290
Help!

662
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,091
Aah!

663
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,933
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

664
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,103
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

665
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,939
-Del, for christ sakes, shut up!
-Hel--

666
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,780
What did you just do to me?

667
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,450
I helped it.

668
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,120
Didn't I help it?

669
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,456
I just took it back, is all.

670
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,751
Awful tired now, boss.

671
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:42,962
Dog-tired.

672
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:10,156
Boss, what that man do to you?

673
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,947
Ahh.

674
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:15,387
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

675
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,934
Oh, not too bad.

676
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,937
What did the doctor say?

677
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,899
Oh, you know doctors.

678
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,235
Gobbledygook, mostly.

679
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:31,737
Gobbledygook.

680
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,587
Having stew tonight.

681
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,599
What are you doing?

682
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,149
What does it feel like?

683
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:12,444
Well, I know what it feels like.

684
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,992
It feels great.

685
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,320
-Paul.
-Yeah?

686
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:57,489
-Not that I'm complaining...
-Uh-huh.

687
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:02,369
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

688
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,997
-Yeah, we did, at your mom's.
-Mm-hmm.

689
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:08,500
Wanna tell me what's going on?

690
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,672
Well...

691
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,967
...see, the thing is...

692
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:21,722
...never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

693
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,686
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

694
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:32,358
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

695
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,694
That's swell. Thanks.

696
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:38,530
Yeah, no, I'm sure I'll feel better.

697
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,367
Okay. Okay.

698
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,707
You're sure you ought to do this?

699
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,544
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

700
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,398
Burt, you got some company.

701
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,650
Can I offer you a cold drink?

702
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,987
Oh, yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

703
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,407
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

704
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:23,283
Hope I'm not troubling you.

705
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,078
Well, that depends, Mr...?

706
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,290
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

707
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,876
The Green Mile.

708
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:36,213
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

709
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,591
I'd like to ask you about one of them.

710
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,845
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

711
01:09:47,599 --> 01:09:49,351
Which client?

712
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,605
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

713
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,191
-John Coffey.
-Ah.

714
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,776
Coffey.

715
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,153
He causing you problems?

716
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:03,198
No. Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

717
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:05,284
...but other than that...

718
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,746
He cries, does he?
Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

719
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,497
You know what he did.

720
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,208
I read the court transcript.

721
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,879
-Thank you, missus.
-My pleasure.

722
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:21,050
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

723
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,593
Coming, Mama!

724
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,929
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

725
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,849
I've wondered if he did anything
like that before.

726
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,311
Why? Has he said anything?

727
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,647
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

728
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:39,777
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

729
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:43,864
...that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail. Find out.

730
01:10:44,656 --> 01:10:48,452
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

731
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,663
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

732
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,999
Believe me, we tried.

733
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:57,002
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

734
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,254
How can that be?

735
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:03,675
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

736
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:07,930
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

737
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,308
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

738
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,394
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

739
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,855
He is...

740
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,233
...strange, I admit.

741
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,904
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

742
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,782
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

743
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,868
I deal with them day in and day out.

744
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,330
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

745
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,458
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

746
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,545
Do you?

747
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,923
One seldom sees
a less ambiguous case.

748
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,217
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

749
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,219
And yet you defended him.

750
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,806
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

751
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,850
Kids! Lunch!

752
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,351
Y'all listen to your mama

753
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,566
I'll tell you something.

754
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:05,237
And you listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

755
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,780
I'm listening.

756
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,159
We had us a dog.

757
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:12,369
Just a sweet mongrel.

758
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,079
You know the kind.

759
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,876
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

760
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:21,503
You get to know it.

761
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:26,091
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

762
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:29,803
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

763
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:35,434
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

764
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,729
My wife and I were not so lucky.

765
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,232
Caleb, come here for a second.

766
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,818
Come here.

767
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:47,529
Please, son.

768
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,617
He still has the one good eye.

769
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:55,245
I suppose he's lucky...

770
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,789
...not to be completely blind.

771
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,296
We get down on our knees
and thank God for that much at least.

772
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,340
Right, Caleb?

773
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,135
Okay, go on in now.

774
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,475
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

775
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,311
Just got it in his mind one day.

776
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,521
The same with John Coffey.

777
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:25,984
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

778
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,487
But those little girls...

779
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:31,156
...Stayed raped and murdered.

780
01:13:31,823 --> 01:13:33,825
Maybe he'd never done it before.

781
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,746
My dog never bit before.

782
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,209
But I didn't concern myself with that.

783
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,172
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

784
01:13:48,548 --> 01:13:49,716
Is Coffey guilty?

785
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,388
Yes, he is.

786
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:56,682
Don't you doubt it.

787
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:59,518
And don't you turn your back on him.

788
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:04,523
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

789
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,025
...but in the end...

790
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,487
...you'll get bit.

791
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,585
Oh, me! Oh, my!

792
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:30,882
John. John.

793
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,678
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

794
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:37,014
It's from my missus.

795
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,061
She wanted to thank you.

796
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:45,856
Thank me for what?

797
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:47,566
Well, you know.

798
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,695
For helping me.

799
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,947
Helping you with what?

800
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:55,782
You know.

801
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,329
Oh.

802
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,291
Was your missus pleased?

803
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,794
Several times.

804
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,813
Oh, John, I can smell that
from over here. I surely can.

805
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,985
Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

806
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:36,156
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

807
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,704
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

808
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:47,125
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't I?

809
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,339
It's yours, John. As you please.

810
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:55,634
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

811
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,683
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

812
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:08,730
Oh, John, that's so very fine of you.

813
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:11,566
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.

814
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,610
My mama would thank you too,
but she dead.

815
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,445
Welcome.

816
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:20,992
Hey! What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

817
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:26,540
Ooh, here come the boss man.

818
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,876
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

819
01:16:41,304 --> 01:16:43,348
You get that one for free.

820
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,976
But that's the last one.

821
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:49,688
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

822
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,567
I guess I'm gonna have
to pay you out for the rest.

823
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:07,747
Yee-haw!

824
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,833
Good shot, weren't it?

825
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,336
The look on your face!

826
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:19,259
Do you believe this?

827
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,720
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

828
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:23,597
Did y'all like that?

829
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:26,892
I'm currently cooking up some turds
to go with it.

830
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,727
Nice soft ones.

831
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,147
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

832
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:36,693
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

833
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,069
Oh, yeah.

834
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:41,907
Hey! Hey!
Be careful with that. That's fragile.

835
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:46,578
Hey. Hey! What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

836
01:17:46,786 --> 01:17:48,914
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

837
01:17:49,372 --> 01:17:53,293
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

838
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:08,683
You can come in here on your legs...

839
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:11,269
...but you'll go out on your backs.

840
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:14,731
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

841
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:18,443
Come on, fuck-stick.
No sneaking up on me this time.

842
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,612
We'll go man-to-man.

843
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,158
Piss on me?

844
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:54,437
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

845
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:58,984
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

846
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:01,236
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

847
01:19:01,444 --> 01:19:04,364
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

848
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:07,158
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

849
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:11,663
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

850
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,458
Thank you, Wild Bill.

851
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,386
Not in there. Not in there.
I'll be good.

852
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,180
Honest injun, I will. I will.

853
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,981
-Christ, he's pitching a fit.
-He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this.

854
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,357
One, two, three.

855
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:42,986
Hey. Hey!

856
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:49,284
Hey, fellers.

857
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,162
Hey, it's not funny.

858
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:58,543
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

859
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,338
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

860
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:11,389
I learned my lesson.

861
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,183
I'll be good.

862
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:26,071
Psst.

863
01:20:26,237 --> 01:20:27,280
Hey, Toot.

864
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:31,451
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

865
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,989
Ooh, ooh.

866
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,409
Little Black Sambo!

867
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:17,288
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

868
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,917
Hope your bags are packed.

869
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:23,294
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

870
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,463
Where are we going? Let's go!

871
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,341
No! No! No!

872
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,643
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

873
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,981
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original. Gotta give him that.

874
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,484
Oh, yeah.

875
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,711
Del, grab up your things.
It's a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

876
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:06,296
What you talking about?

877
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:10,091
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

878
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:11,760
Not just prison guards either.

879
01:22:11,968 --> 01:22:15,180
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

880
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,767
You fellas coming?

881
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:22,479
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

882
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:26,024
But you knock them for a loop.

883
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,026
You knock them for a loop, Del.

884
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:30,653
Just like Mr. Harry says.

885
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:44,709
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

886
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,879
All right, rehearsing now!

887
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,548
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

888
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:54,219
I been fixing the plumbing here
for ten years.

889
01:22:54,385 --> 01:22:56,679
Ain't never had to wear
no damn tie before.

890
01:22:56,888 --> 01:23:00,141
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

891
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,687
All right, everybody have a seat.

892
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,205
This is great.

893
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:30,421
All right.

894
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:35,593
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

895
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,303
...until you are dead...

896
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,889
...in accordance with state law.

897
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:42,767
God have mercy on your soul.

898
01:23:51,442 --> 01:23:52,610
Roll on two.

899
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,449
That's that.

900
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:04,289
Very good. Very professional.

901
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,418
Let's do it again.

902
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,005
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

903
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:13,590
-Thank you.
-Yep.

904
01:24:13,756 --> 01:24:16,676
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

905
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:19,971
You got that chin strap tight
because his head will buck--

906
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:22,265
All right, break it up.

907
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:29,397
-So?
-Oh, they love Mr. Jingles.

908
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,607
They laugh over there.

909
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:35,153
They cheer. They clap their hands.

910
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,280
Well, that's just aces.

911
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:39,741
Isn't that something?

912
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:42,118
You done good, old-timer.

913
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,120
We're happy for you.

914
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,457
Yeah, we are.

915
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:01,012
-Boo!
-Aah!

916
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,350
Percy, you shit.

917
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,355
Come on. Del, get up.

918
01:25:10,521 --> 01:25:14,150
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

919
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:17,195
I was just playing. Come on, now.

920
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:19,489
I was just having-- Aah!

921
01:25:21,532 --> 01:25:23,368
- Ain't you sweet.
- Wharton.

922
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,204
-Soft like a girl.
-Let him go.

923
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,373
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

924
01:25:28,539 --> 01:25:30,583
...than your sister's pussy, I think.

925
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,168
Wharton!

926
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:41,469
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

927
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,097
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty little head.

928
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:47,642
Your noodle ain't limp at all,
lover boy.

929
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,561
I think you sweet on
old Billy the Kid.

930
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:55,066
Ooh, but smell you.

931
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:03,241
Look.

932
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:04,909
He done piss his pants.

933
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:08,913
Oh, my God.

934
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:12,166
Look what the big man done.

935
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:15,753
-He bust other people with a stick.
-Come on, get in.

936
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:22,135
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

937
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:26,431
Del! Learn when to shut up.

938
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,392
All right, now.

939
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,478
Don't touch me.

940
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,536
You...

941
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,414
You talk about this to anyone...

942
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,000
...I'll get you all fired.

943
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:58,379
I swear that to God.

944
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:03,509
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

945
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:14,145
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

946
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:16,856
You just keep on laughing!

947
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:22,278
Wetmore a good name for you!

948
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:26,449
Percy Wetmore do a dance

949
01:27:26,657 --> 01:27:29,535
Listen to him squishing in his pant

950
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,256
Well, what about Dean?

951
01:27:42,465 --> 01:27:44,008
He's got a little boy.

952
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:46,803
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

953
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:52,225
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

954
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,019
Maybe forget to feed him.

955
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:59,190
How he keep up with his training?
I mean, he just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

956
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,983
Mmm.

957
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:11,536
All right. I'll take him, then.

958
01:28:12,286 --> 01:28:13,913
Me.

959
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:17,166
Thank you kindly, but...

960
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,545
...you live out in the woods.

961
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:22,713
Mr. Jingle, he be...

962
01:28:23,422 --> 01:28:26,676
He be scared to live
out in the big woods.

963
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,224
How about Mouseville?

964
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:38,062
-Mouseville?
-Tourist attraction down in Florida.

965
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:40,565
Tallahassee, I think.

966
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,735
-Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
-Yeah. Tallahassee.

967
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:48,531
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

968
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:54,745
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

969
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:59,417
-You think he's got the stuff?
-Well, he is pretty smart.

970
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:02,378
What is Mouseville?

971
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,589
Tourist attraction, I said.

972
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:06,591
They got this big tent you go into.

973
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:09,927
-You have to pay?
-Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

974
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:13,931
-Dime apiece. Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

975
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,309
Inside the tent they got this...

976
01:29:17,476 --> 01:29:19,103
...mouse city...

977
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:20,771
...made out of...

978
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:25,651
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

979
01:29:26,068 --> 01:29:30,448
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

980
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,619
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

981
01:29:34,827 --> 01:29:38,331
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

982
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,544
Yeah, that's it.

983
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:47,006
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

984
01:29:52,094 --> 01:29:55,097
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

985
01:29:55,514 --> 01:29:59,435
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

986
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,899
There he goes.

987
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,116
No! Mr. Jingles!

988
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:17,203
No! No! No!

989
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:26,003
-You kill my mouse.
- I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

990
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:29,131
It was just a matter of time, really.

991
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,468
You fucking cruel bastard!

992
01:30:41,018 --> 01:30:42,561
Give him to me.

993
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,856
Give him to me. Might still be time.

994
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:00,079
What are you doing?

995
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:02,790
Paul?

996
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:05,334
What the hell--?

997
01:31:05,584 --> 01:31:07,336
Please, John.

998
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:09,714
Help him.

999
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:13,175
Please, Johnny, help him.

1000
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:19,640
Oh, dear Jesus.

1001
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:21,225
The tail.

1002
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:23,060
Look at the tail.

1003
01:32:53,567 --> 01:32:54,735
What did you do?

1004
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:57,988
I helped Del's mouse...

1005
01:32:58,322 --> 01:32:59,698
...he's a circus mouse.

1006
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:02,618
Gonna live in a mouse city...

1007
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:04,328
...down in...

1008
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:07,540
Florida.

1009
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,586
Boss Percy bad.

1010
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,841
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

1011
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,677
I took it back, though.

1012
01:33:27,017 --> 01:33:28,352
Brute...

1013
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,188
...you come along with me.

1014
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:34,567
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

1015
01:33:58,549 --> 01:34:01,010
Now, don't start in on me.

1016
01:34:01,343 --> 01:34:03,387
It was just a mouse.

1017
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:05,973
Never belonged here
in the first place.

1018
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:07,933
The mouse is fine.

1019
01:34:09,059 --> 01:34:12,688
Just fine. You're no better
at mouse-killing than you are...

1020
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:15,149
...at anything else around here.

1021
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,612
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?
Huh?

1022
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:24,033
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

1023
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:26,577
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

1024
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,914
After all those talks we had about...

1025
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,249
...keeping the prisoners calm?

1026
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,878
-Aren't you relieved?
-What kind of game is this?

1027
01:34:36,086 --> 01:34:37,713
It's no game.

1028
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,256
See for yourself.

1029
01:34:42,384 --> 01:34:43,594
Go on.

1030
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,984
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle.

1031
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:07,326
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

1032
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:12,289
I always keep a spare mouse
in my wallet for occasions such as this.

1033
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:15,209
Yeah, you playing with me, huh?
Both of you.

1034
01:35:15,417 --> 01:35:17,795
Just who the hell you think you are?

1035
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:20,422
Aah!

1036
01:35:20,714 --> 01:35:22,466
We're the people you work with.

1037
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,635
But not for long.

1038
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:27,638
Percy, I want your word.

1039
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:29,640
My word?

1040
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:32,309
I put you out front for Del...

1041
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:36,480
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the very next day.

1042
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:43,487
Well, what if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

1043
01:35:43,737 --> 01:35:45,990
-Bullying me.
-Go ahead.

1044
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:49,743
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

1045
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:52,621
-Over a mouse?
-No.

1046
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,666
But four men
will swear you stood by...

1047
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,793
...while Wild Bill
tried to strangle Dean to death.

1048
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:01,964
About that, people will care. Even your
uncle the governor will care about that.

1049
01:36:02,172 --> 01:36:04,717
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

1050
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:09,513
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

1051
01:36:09,763 --> 01:36:11,640
I put you out front...

1052
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:14,226
...you put in for that transfer.

1053
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:17,187
That's the deal.

1054
01:36:21,483 --> 01:36:23,027
All right.

1055
01:36:24,236 --> 01:36:25,738
All right.

1056
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:34,872
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1057
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:38,936
Hey, boys.

1058
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:43,565
No, now, say hey, Mr. Jingles.

1059
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:48,320
Eduard Delacroix, will you step forward?

1060
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:04,211
Boss Edgecomb.

1061
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:06,338
Yes, Del?

1062
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:09,133
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1063
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,470
Here. You take him.

1064
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:21,103
Del.

1065
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,315
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1066
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:28,569
...you know.

1067
01:38:29,903 --> 01:38:31,655
I'll take him, boss.

1068
01:38:32,322 --> 01:38:34,825
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1069
01:38:37,661 --> 01:38:39,163
Yeah.

1070
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:44,001
Yeah, you take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1071
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:07,858
You gonna take him to Florida,
to that Mouseville?

1072
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:10,194
We'll do it together, most likely.

1073
01:39:11,403 --> 01:39:14,865
-Maybe take a little vacation time.
-Yeah.

1074
01:39:15,157 --> 01:39:17,868
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1075
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:21,038
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1076
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,873
That's right, Del.

1077
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,710
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1078
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,882
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1079
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:39,431
I sure wish I could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1080
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:20,264
Hope he's good and scared.

1081
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:25,269
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1082
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,363
Del, it's all right.

1083
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,324
Roll on one.

1084
01:41:32,085 --> 01:41:34,922
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1085
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,760
You be so quiet and so still.

1086
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:44,848
Eduard Delacroix...

1087
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:48,685
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1088
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:52,689
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1089
01:41:53,106 --> 01:41:56,026
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1090
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:06,578
I sorry for what I--

1091
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:16,046
I sorry for what I do.

1092
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,799
I give anything to take it back.

1093
01:42:19,841 --> 01:42:21,510
But I can't.

1094
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,888
God have mercy on me.

1095
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:27,683
Amen.

1096
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:37,985
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1097
01:42:40,612 --> 01:42:42,114
Hey...

1098
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:44,616
...there's no such place.

1099
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:49,037
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1100
01:42:51,748 --> 01:42:54,251
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1101
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:58,231
Eduard Delacroix...

1102
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:01,985
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1103
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:04,696
...in accordance with state law.

1104
01:44:05,822 --> 01:44:08,408
God have mercy on your soul.

1105
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:48,824
Roll on two!

1106
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:06,758
The sponge is dry.

1107
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,844
What?

1108
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:17,144
-The goddamn sponge is dry!
-Well, don't you stop it!

1109
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:19,980
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1110
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:36,580
Is this normal?

1111
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:39,499
God, the smell.

1112
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:43,253
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1113
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:45,338
They're about done, I reckon!

1114
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:52,679
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1115
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,561
He's cooking now!

1116
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:01,938
He's cooking now!

1117
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:04,441
We gonna have a hoedown!

1118
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:07,694
'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1119
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:09,821
Give me some!

1120
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:12,032
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling--

1121
01:46:13,366 --> 01:46:15,452
I said, give me some!

1122
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:20,957
I smell it!

1123
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:23,960
-Aah!
-Smell it!

1124
01:46:31,801 --> 01:46:34,638
-Should I kill the juice?
-No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1125
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:01,498
He's frying now! He's frying now!
He's frying now!

1126
01:47:04,459 --> 01:47:05,835
Why don't you shut it down?

1127
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:09,422
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1128
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,431
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1129
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:22,519
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1130
01:47:23,019 --> 01:47:25,897
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1131
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:33,655
Kill it!

1132
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:42,956
You do it!
You're running this show, ain't you?

1133
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:13,445
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1134
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:15,739
Aah!

1135
01:48:15,905 --> 01:48:16,990
Brutal!

1136
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,742
Brutal, no!

1137
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:20,160
-No!
-What do you mean, no?

1138
01:48:20,368 --> 01:48:22,078
How can you say no?
You saw what he did!

1139
01:48:22,245 --> 01:48:23,079
Delacroix's dead!

1140
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,248
Nothing can change that.
Percy's not worth it!

1141
01:48:25,498 --> 01:48:27,959
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1142
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:39,679
What in the blue fuck was that?

1143
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,098
Jesus Christ.

1144
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:45,226
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1145
01:48:45,435 --> 01:48:47,187
And the smell.

1146
01:48:47,854 --> 01:48:51,775
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for five years.

1147
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:53,610
That's what I'm betting.

1148
01:48:54,527 --> 01:48:57,906
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1149
01:48:58,365 --> 01:48:59,783
You can hear him up there!

1150
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:01,868
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1151
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:15,882
Okay, boys, okay.

1152
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:19,427
Now, what in the hell happened?

1153
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:22,597
An execution. A successful one.

1154
01:49:23,014 --> 01:49:27,143
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1155
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,480
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1156
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:34,025
Isn't he?

1157
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:39,406
Percy...

1158
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:41,324
...something to say?

1159
01:49:45,328 --> 01:49:47,747
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1160
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:51,751
How many years you spend
pissing on a toilet seat...

1161
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:56,131
-...before someone told you to put it up?
-Percy fucked up, Hal.

1162
01:49:56,339 --> 01:49:57,924
Pure and simple.

1163
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:00,301
That's your official position?

1164
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:02,470
Don't you think it should be?

1165
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:06,850
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1166
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,561
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1167
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:11,354
Isn't that right, Percy?

1168
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,315
Yeah. Yeah.

1169
01:50:14,482 --> 01:50:16,192
Barbecue

1170
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:19,821
Me and you
Stinky, pinky

1171
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:23,950
Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1172
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:27,120
It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix

1173
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:28,955
Whoo

1174
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:32,167
Barbecue
Me and you

1175
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:35,712
Stinky, pinky
Phew phew phew

1176
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,380
Weren't Billy, Jilly--

1177
01:50:38,631 --> 01:50:42,886
You're ten seconds away from spending
the rest of your life in the padded room.

1178
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:02,113
Poor old Del.

1179
01:51:03,865 --> 01:51:05,408
Yeah.

1180
01:51:06,034 --> 01:51:07,702
Poor old Del.

1181
01:51:10,246 --> 01:51:11,915
John...

1182
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:15,126
...you okay?

1183
01:51:16,377 --> 01:51:18,630
I could feel it from here.

1184
01:51:19,255 --> 01:51:20,673
What do you mean?

1185
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:23,218
You could hear it.

1186
01:51:23,426 --> 01:51:25,678
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1187
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:27,847
He out of it now, though.

1188
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:30,517
He the lucky one.

1189
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:34,771
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1190
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:43,196
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1191
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,783
He run away under that door.

1192
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:50,537
Don't think he'll be back.

1193
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:54,457
He felt it too, through me.

1194
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:58,294
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1195
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:01,798
All that hurt just spill out.

1196
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,890
Awful tired now, boss.

1197
01:52:12,725 --> 01:52:14,435
Dog-tired.

1198
01:52:20,275 --> 01:52:21,901
Me too, John.

1199
01:52:24,654 --> 01:52:26,322
Me too.

1200
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,383
I hate this.

1201
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:29,510
I know.

1202
01:53:44,525 --> 01:53:47,320
Melinda, hi.

1203
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:52,909
I am so happy to see you.

1204
01:53:54,827 --> 01:53:56,663
Look at you.

1205
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:59,582
We missed you at church.

1206
01:54:03,419 --> 01:54:05,797
My hair--

1207
01:54:06,047 --> 01:54:08,883
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1208
01:54:14,263 --> 01:54:16,557
She's having one of her good days.

1209
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,018
I thank God for that.

1210
01:54:21,562 --> 01:54:23,272
What's a bad day?

1211
01:54:26,609 --> 01:54:28,528
Sometimes she's...

1212
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:31,364
She's not herself anymore.

1213
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:33,449
She swears.

1214
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,118
She swears?

1215
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:36,953
It just pops out.

1216
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,289
Most awful language you can imagine.

1217
01:54:40,456 --> 01:54:42,792
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1218
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:46,963
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1219
01:54:47,213 --> 01:54:50,383
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice...

1220
01:54:54,595 --> 01:54:57,098
I'm glad she's having
a good day, Paul.

1221
01:54:58,224 --> 01:55:00,643
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1222
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:18,161
Honey...

1223
01:55:18,369 --> 01:55:20,997
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1224
01:55:21,622 --> 01:55:24,834
...I'm afraid I'll have to smother you
with a pillow.

1225
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,803
I'm thinking I love you.

1226
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:41,184
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1227
01:55:43,102 --> 01:55:44,520
Oh.

1228
01:55:47,523 --> 01:55:50,943
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1229
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:57,658
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1230
01:55:57,825 --> 01:55:59,160
Well, thank you.

1231
01:55:59,410 --> 01:56:02,205
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1232
01:56:02,413 --> 01:56:03,873
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1233
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:06,542
Hey, Brutal, you gonna hog
all them taters?

1234
01:56:06,709 --> 01:56:09,337
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1235
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:11,714
-Come on, now.
-What?

1236
01:56:12,381 --> 01:56:14,717
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1237
01:56:14,926 --> 01:56:17,220
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1238
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:22,475
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1239
01:56:22,725 --> 01:56:24,477
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1240
01:56:24,936 --> 01:56:26,729
He did the same thing to me.

1241
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:29,232
He put his hands on me.

1242
01:56:29,982 --> 01:56:32,068
He took my bladder infection away.

1243
01:56:36,989 --> 01:56:40,535
It's true. When he came home that day,
he was...

1244
01:56:42,078 --> 01:56:43,454
...all better.

1245
01:56:44,956 --> 01:56:47,917
Oh, now, wait. You're talking about...

1246
01:56:48,084 --> 01:56:49,752
...an authentic healing?

1247
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:52,463
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1248
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:54,465
I am.

1249
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:56,926
Oh, yeah.

1250
01:56:57,093 --> 01:57:00,012
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1251
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:02,974
What's it got to do with us?

1252
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:06,435
-You're thinking about Melinda.
-Melinda?

1253
01:57:07,019 --> 01:57:09,772
-Melinda Moores?
-Yeah. So, Paul...

1254
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:12,275
...you really think you can help her?

1255
01:57:12,525 --> 01:57:16,779
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1256
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:20,616
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1257
01:57:20,783 --> 01:57:24,787
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1258
01:57:25,121 --> 01:57:27,957
Oh, no. No, no.
Hal would never stand for that.

1259
01:57:28,124 --> 01:57:30,960
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything if it fell on him.

1260
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:33,129
So you're talking about...

1261
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:35,298
...taking John Coffey to her.

1262
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,972
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1263
01:57:43,973 --> 01:57:46,642
-That's prison time, we get caught.
-You're dang right it is.

1264
01:57:46,809 --> 01:57:48,644
No, not for you, Dean.

1265
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:51,981
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1266
01:57:52,148 --> 01:57:53,816
That way, you can deny everything.

1267
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:56,152
Why do I have to stay behind?

1268
01:57:56,819 --> 01:58:00,156
Well, our boy's grown up...

1269
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:01,657
...gone off to school.

1270
01:58:01,824 --> 01:58:04,660
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1271
01:58:04,827 --> 01:58:06,078
Brutal's a single man.

1272
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:09,665
You're the only one here with
two children, another one on the way.

1273
01:58:10,041 --> 01:58:13,127
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1274
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:18,049
Brutal, help me out here.

1275
01:58:19,342 --> 01:58:22,845
-I'm sure she's a fine woman.
-The finest.

1276
01:58:23,012 --> 01:58:25,348
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1277
01:58:25,556 --> 01:58:28,017
...10 the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1278
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:30,353
I have no doubt.

1279
01:58:31,312 --> 01:58:33,356
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1280
01:58:33,564 --> 01:58:36,692
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1281
01:58:37,818 --> 01:58:40,029
Now, what if he escapes?

1282
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:43,366
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1283
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:46,869
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1284
01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:49,205
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1285
01:58:50,581 --> 01:58:51,958
In fact...

1286
01:58:54,585 --> 01:58:56,379
...I don't think he did it at all.

1287
01:58:59,548 --> 01:59:03,302
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1288
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:05,596
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1289
01:59:05,888 --> 01:59:10,226
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1290
01:59:12,061 --> 01:59:13,229
And plus...

1291
01:59:13,604 --> 01:59:15,690
...he's huge.

1292
01:59:15,856 --> 01:59:20,528
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1293
01:59:20,736 --> 01:59:24,907
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1294
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:26,617
I'd insist on that.

1295
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:30,663
If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1296
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:33,207
...we'd have to take him down.

1297
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:35,710
You understand?

1298
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:48,389
So...

1299
01:59:48,764 --> 01:59:50,933
...tell us what you had in mind.

1300
01:59:57,773 --> 02:00:00,568
- Oh, there it is.
- Oh, I see it.

1301
02:00:11,245 --> 02:00:13,247
You think this is enough?

1302
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:15,958
I don't know.

1303
02:00:52,703 --> 02:00:54,497
You fellas thirsty?

1304
02:00:54,705 --> 02:00:56,207
Fresh out of the icebox.

1305
02:00:56,415 --> 02:01:00,086
- You bet. That's swell, Brutal. Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.

1306
02:01:00,294 --> 02:01:02,505
Hot in here. Boy, howdy.

1307
02:01:02,713 --> 02:01:05,966
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't 1?

1308
02:01:06,175 --> 02:01:09,595
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1309
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:12,348
Because I got a big pecker.

1310
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:15,351
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1311
02:01:15,851 --> 02:01:17,645
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.

1312
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:20,272
Come on, now.
Don't be stingy hogs.

1313
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:24,860
Come on.

1314
02:01:26,028 --> 02:01:28,030
Come on now, fellers.

1315
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,449
Come on, boss.

1316
02:01:30,699 --> 02:01:32,535
I been good all day.

1317
02:01:35,746 --> 02:01:37,456
It's hot in here.

1318
02:01:37,706 --> 02:01:41,210
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1319
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,295
Why don't you give me some?

1320
02:01:50,052 --> 02:01:51,345
Come on.

1321
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:58,394
You gonna stay behaved?

1322
02:01:58,561 --> 02:02:01,897
-Come on, you clunk, give me that.
-You promise me...

1323
02:02:02,273 --> 02:02:04,483
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1324
02:02:04,733 --> 02:02:07,403
Don't-- Come on, now.
Don't be that way.

1325
02:02:07,903 --> 02:02:09,405
I'll be good.

1326
02:02:34,346 --> 02:02:35,723
Cup.

1327
02:03:26,148 --> 02:03:28,651
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1328
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,153
After this, there's no turning back.

1329
02:03:32,655 --> 02:03:33,864
So?

1330
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:36,283
We gonna do this?

1331
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:39,453
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1332
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,872
I'd like to take a ride.

1333
02:03:47,127 --> 02:03:49,171
Guess we're all in.

1334
02:04:00,182 --> 02:04:01,517
What is this?

1335
02:04:03,978 --> 02:04:06,689
- Payback.
- That's right.

1336
02:04:07,606 --> 02:04:08,440
No.

1337
02:04:11,402 --> 02:04:14,280
-No, you let me go! Let go of me!
-Settle down.

1338
02:04:14,488 --> 02:04:15,531
-Let go!
-Settle down.

1339
02:04:15,698 --> 02:04:18,033
-What are you doing?
-Settle down.

1340
02:04:24,456 --> 02:04:25,624
Ooh.

1341
02:04:26,208 --> 02:04:29,044
- "Miss Lotta Leadpipe."
- Oh, Percy.

1342
02:04:29,211 --> 02:04:32,464
-What would your mother say?
-You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1343
02:04:32,673 --> 02:04:35,426
I know people. Big people!

1344
02:04:35,801 --> 02:04:38,887
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1345
02:04:39,054 --> 02:04:41,056
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1346
02:04:41,223 --> 02:04:43,892
You're dead wrong about that,
you know.

1347
02:04:49,565 --> 02:04:51,900
You gonna put your arms up?

1348
02:04:52,735 --> 02:04:55,904
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1349
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:57,865
Aah!

1350
02:04:58,032 --> 02:04:59,700
There you go.

1351
02:05:07,916 --> 02:05:09,335
Please, Paul.

1352
02:05:09,543 --> 02:05:13,339
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1353
02:05:14,590 --> 02:05:16,508
You would think that.

1354
02:05:18,218 --> 02:05:20,596
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1355
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:23,265
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1356
02:05:23,474 --> 02:05:25,851
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Percy.

1357
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:29,188
We can and we are.

1358
02:05:35,944 --> 02:05:40,574
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1359
02:05:40,783 --> 02:05:44,453
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1360
02:05:53,295 --> 02:05:55,464
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1361
02:05:55,631 --> 02:05:57,800
What do you say
if somebody stops by?

1362
02:05:59,635 --> 02:06:01,470
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1363
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:04,932
...So we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1364
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:07,017
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1365
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:08,268
What about me?

1366
02:06:08,435 --> 02:06:11,313
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1367
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:14,400
...on account of how big a screwup
the execution was.

1368
02:06:16,652 --> 02:06:18,404
We going for the ride now?

1369
02:06:18,654 --> 02:06:21,281
That's right. We going for the ride.

1370
02:06:23,409 --> 02:06:24,827
What about us, Dean?

1371
02:06:25,035 --> 02:06:28,831
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1372
02:06:29,081 --> 02:06:31,667
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1373
02:06:35,045 --> 02:06:37,172
Where you think you going?

1374
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:45,180
You a bad man.

1375
02:06:45,347 --> 02:06:47,683
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1376
02:06:55,482 --> 02:06:57,359
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1377
02:06:57,693 --> 02:06:59,111
What's wrong?

1378
02:07:19,131 --> 02:07:21,550
Whoo!

1379
02:07:23,051 --> 02:07:26,221
Whole room...
Whole room's spinning.

1380
02:07:26,388 --> 02:07:28,682
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1381
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:31,226
Had me some shine or...

1382
02:07:31,977 --> 02:07:33,353
Or what?

1383
02:07:35,606 --> 02:07:38,358
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1384
02:07:38,567 --> 02:07:40,194
White man...

1385
02:07:40,402 --> 02:07:44,990
...ought not to have to sit in
no nigger electric chair. No, sir.

1386
02:07:52,122 --> 02:07:54,875
He a bad man.

1387
02:08:14,436 --> 02:08:15,646
Look, boss.

1388
02:08:20,234 --> 02:08:22,778
-It's Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair.
-Shh!

1389
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:25,364
John, we have to be quiet now.

1390
02:08:25,906 --> 02:08:28,283
You see her? You see the lady?

1391
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:30,619
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1392
02:08:41,964 --> 02:08:43,966
Let's go. Go, go!

1393
02:08:48,303 --> 02:08:49,471
Now!

1394
02:09:25,632 --> 02:09:28,635
All right, big boy. Let's get moving.
Come on.

1395
02:10:02,252 --> 02:10:03,670
Upsy-daisy.

1396
02:10:11,887 --> 02:10:15,557
John, do you know
where we're taking you tonight?

1397
02:10:18,894 --> 02:10:20,145
Help a lady?

1398
02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:23,565
That's right.

1399
02:10:24,399 --> 02:10:25,567
But how do you know?

1400
02:10:27,402 --> 02:10:28,779
Don't know.

1401
02:10:30,697 --> 02:10:35,285
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1402
02:10:36,578 --> 02:10:37,788
I never have.

1403
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:15,117
We can still turn back.

1404
02:11:17,035 --> 02:11:19,621
Boss, look. Someone's up.

1405
02:11:21,832 --> 02:11:23,625
This was a mistake.

1406
02:11:24,042 --> 02:11:29,339
-Oh, Christ, what were we thinking?
-It's too late now. John, you stay.

1407
02:11:33,802 --> 02:11:36,805
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1408
02:11:46,982 --> 02:11:49,234
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1409
02:11:49,401 --> 02:11:52,154
Hal, it's us. It's Paul and Brutal.

1410
02:11:52,404 --> 02:11:53,822
-It's us.
-Jesus.

1411
02:11:53,989 --> 02:11:56,158
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1412
02:11:56,408 --> 02:11:59,995
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1413
02:12:00,162 --> 02:12:01,997
Are you hostages?

1414
02:12:02,497 --> 02:12:03,874
Who's out there?

1415
02:12:04,249 --> 02:12:06,168
-Who's by that truck?
-Harry, the lights!

1416
02:12:10,672 --> 02:12:12,507
John Coffey.

1417
02:12:13,008 --> 02:12:14,176
- Halt!
- Hal.

1418
02:12:14,384 --> 02:12:16,636
-You stay where you are!
-Relax, now. Take it easy, now.

1419
02:12:16,887 --> 02:12:18,805
-Don't you move!
-Wait!

1420
02:12:19,014 --> 02:12:20,307
-I'm warning you.
-John, wait!

1421
02:12:20,515 --> 02:12:22,017
- Hal, listen!
- Halt or I'll shoot!

1422
02:12:22,267 --> 02:12:24,269
- I said, halt! Halt!
- Hal, put the gun down!

1423
02:12:24,519 --> 02:12:26,354
- Hal.
- Hal!

1424
02:12:28,398 --> 02:12:32,444
Hal, who you talking to down there?

1425
02:12:32,694 --> 02:12:37,032
- Goddamn it!
- Hal, now, nobody is hurt.

1426
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:38,325
And we are here to help.

1427
02:12:38,533 --> 02:12:41,703
Help what? I don't understand.

1428
02:12:41,953 --> 02:12:44,790
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1429
02:13:01,389 --> 02:13:04,434
- What do you want?
- Hal!

1430
02:13:05,477 --> 02:13:07,479
Make them go away!

1431
02:13:08,355 --> 02:13:10,357
I don't want no salesmen...

1432
02:13:10,565 --> 02:13:14,194
...in the middle of the night.

1433
02:13:14,736 --> 02:13:18,490
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling...

1434
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:20,075
Just to help.

1435
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:23,662
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1436
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:27,582
You can't. No one can.

1437
02:13:38,927 --> 02:13:41,346
- Stay out of here!
- Don't you go in there!

1438
02:13:41,596 --> 02:13:44,516
-Whoever you are, just stay out!
-Don't you do it!

1439
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:47,769
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1440
02:13:49,437 --> 02:13:51,982
You stop now. You hear me?

1441
02:13:52,607 --> 02:13:55,277
- Paul, I don't want him up there.
- Boss...

1442
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:57,779
...you just be quiet now.

1443
02:14:45,535 --> 02:14:47,913
It's all right, Hal. It's all right.

1444
02:14:48,163 --> 02:14:50,665
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1445
02:14:56,838 --> 02:14:59,424
Don't come near me, pig fucker.

1446
02:15:13,271 --> 02:15:15,565
Why do you have so many scars?

1447
02:15:18,443 --> 02:15:20,695
Who hurt you so badly?

1448
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:24,616
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1449
02:15:27,118 --> 02:15:28,954
What's your name?

1450
02:15:29,537 --> 02:15:32,707
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1451
02:15:33,041 --> 02:15:35,377
...only not spelt the same.

1452
02:15:42,050 --> 02:15:43,134
Ma'am?

1453
02:15:51,142 --> 02:15:53,103
Yes, John Coffey?

1454
02:15:54,813 --> 02:15:56,398
I see it.

1455
02:15:57,065 --> 02:15:58,233
I see it.

1456
02:16:05,407 --> 02:16:08,076
What's happening?

1457
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:13,581
Shh, you be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1458
02:17:40,251 --> 02:17:42,712
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1459
02:17:43,004 --> 02:17:45,256
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1460
02:17:46,841 --> 02:17:50,595
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1461
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:52,263
John.

1462
02:17:53,848 --> 02:17:56,434
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1463
02:18:10,198 --> 02:18:11,449
How did I get here?

1464
02:18:15,870 --> 02:18:18,957
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1465
02:18:19,249 --> 02:18:20,542
Remember?

1466
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:23,461
Shh, Melly...

1467
02:18:23,628 --> 02:18:25,463
...It doesn't matter.

1468
02:18:26,214 --> 02:18:27,715
It doesn't matter anymore.

1469
02:18:27,882 --> 02:18:30,552
Did I have the x-ray?

1470
02:18:31,219 --> 02:18:32,720
Did 1?

1471
02:18:35,390 --> 02:18:36,641
Yes.

1472
02:18:37,559 --> 02:18:41,563
Yes. It was clear.
There was no tumor.

1473
02:18:46,359 --> 02:18:47,527
Oh.

1474
02:18:57,579 --> 02:19:01,833
John, can you stand up?
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1475
02:19:15,263 --> 02:19:16,848
What's your name?

1476
02:19:18,099 --> 02:19:20,310
John Coffey, ma'am.

1477
02:19:21,769 --> 02:19:23,438
Like the drink.

1478
02:19:24,856 --> 02:19:26,941
Only not spelt the same.

1479
02:19:27,317 --> 02:19:31,029
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1480
02:19:33,907 --> 02:19:37,285
Melly... No, you can't.

1481
02:20:01,976 --> 02:20:04,062
I dreamed of you.

1482
02:20:06,856 --> 02:20:09,734
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1483
02:20:11,236 --> 02:20:13,154
And so was I.

1484
02:20:14,989 --> 02:20:17,158
And we found each other.

1485
02:20:18,076 --> 02:20:20,662
We found each other in the dark.

1486
02:20:40,181 --> 02:20:41,933
Take it, John. It's a present.

1487
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:44,435
It's St. Christopher.

1488
02:20:45,687 --> 02:20:47,897
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1489
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:51,192
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1490
02:20:51,609 --> 02:20:53,111
Please.

1491
02:20:53,528 --> 02:20:55,196
Wear it for me.

1492
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:11,546
Thank you, ma'am.

1493
02:21:13,631 --> 02:21:15,466
Thank you, John.

1494
02:21:22,265 --> 02:21:26,978
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1495
02:21:27,228 --> 02:21:30,982
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1496
02:21:46,664 --> 02:21:49,751
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1497
02:21:50,084 --> 02:21:52,253
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1498
02:21:53,087 --> 02:21:55,256
I give him a few days.

1499
02:21:55,506 --> 02:21:59,427
One of us will be doing a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1500
02:21:59,594 --> 02:22:01,888
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1501
02:22:02,096 --> 02:22:04,349
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1502
02:22:18,196 --> 02:22:20,782
Am I happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1503
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:23,076
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1504
02:22:23,284 --> 02:22:27,789
-What the hell happened to him?
-He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1505
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:34,462
Okay, John. We gonna...

1506
02:22:34,629 --> 02:22:38,299
...set you down on your bed now.
Here we go.

1507
02:22:56,317 --> 02:22:57,485
Well?

1508
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:01,155
What about Mrs. Moores?

1509
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:05,159
Was it like the mouse?

1510
02:23:06,494 --> 02:23:07,578
Was it...

1511
02:23:09,664 --> 02:23:14,168
-...you know, a miracle?
-Yes.

1512
02:23:15,336 --> 02:23:17,505
Yes, it was.

1513
02:23:18,047 --> 02:23:19,173
Damn.

1514
02:23:34,856 --> 02:23:36,524
Now...

1515
02:23:36,691 --> 02:23:39,360
...I want to talk, not shout.

1516
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:42,113
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1517
02:23:42,572 --> 02:23:44,157
Mm-hmm.

1518
02:23:45,116 --> 02:23:48,286
My mother always says you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1519
02:23:48,953 --> 02:23:51,706
Mmm! Mmm!

1520
02:23:52,081 --> 02:23:53,791
Guess she was wrong.

1521
02:23:57,044 --> 02:23:58,588
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1522
02:23:58,796 --> 02:24:00,131
-In a minute.
-Now!

1523
02:24:00,381 --> 02:24:02,175
Right now! I want out now--! Aah!

1524
02:24:06,637 --> 02:24:08,639
Shut up and listen.

1525
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:13,311
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1526
02:24:14,061 --> 02:24:17,690
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born. We'll tell people...

1527
02:24:17,857 --> 02:24:21,486
-...how you sabotaged Del's execution...
-Sabotaged?

1528
02:24:21,694 --> 02:24:25,907
...how you pissed yourself like
a frightened little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1529
02:24:27,074 --> 02:24:28,576
But, Percy...

1530
02:24:29,243 --> 02:24:31,245
...you mind me, now.

1531
02:24:31,662 --> 02:24:35,750
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1532
02:24:37,251 --> 02:24:38,503
We know people too.

1533
02:24:40,004 --> 02:24:42,256
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1534
02:24:44,842 --> 02:24:47,929
Let bygones be bygones, hmm?

1535
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:51,599
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1536
02:24:52,016 --> 02:24:56,187
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1537
02:24:56,604 --> 02:25:00,107
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1538
02:25:01,150 --> 02:25:02,527
Always has.

1539
02:25:06,864 --> 02:25:08,449
Hmm.

1540
02:25:11,702 --> 02:25:14,205
May I be let out of this coat now?

1541
02:25:34,141 --> 02:25:35,309
My things?

1542
02:25:38,396 --> 02:25:40,481
Think it over, Percy.

1543
02:25:41,232 --> 02:25:43,067
Oh, I intend to.

1544
02:25:43,985 --> 02:25:47,071
I intend to think it over very hard.

1545
02:25:48,823 --> 02:25:50,741
Starting right now.

1546
02:26:00,334 --> 02:26:03,713
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1547
02:26:18,102 --> 02:26:20,313
- Hey, let him go!
- John, let go!

1548
02:26:20,521 --> 02:26:23,649
- Let go, John!
- John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1549
02:26:23,858 --> 02:26:25,610
Let go, John! No!

1550
02:26:26,652 --> 02:26:28,195
- Aah!
- Back off!

1551
02:26:28,446 --> 02:26:32,116
- John, stop it! Stop it, John!
- Let him go! Back off!

1552
02:26:32,325 --> 02:26:33,367
John, let him go!

1553
02:26:49,383 --> 02:26:50,885
Oh, my God!

1554
02:27:34,345 --> 02:27:37,098
Easy, now. Easy.

1555
02:27:38,349 --> 02:27:39,767
Easy.

1556
02:27:41,018 --> 02:27:42,436
Hey.

1557
02:27:46,190 --> 02:27:47,233
Percy.

1558
02:27:50,236 --> 02:27:51,362
Are you all right?

1559
02:28:24,562 --> 02:28:26,647
Boy, what you looking at?

1560
02:28:34,488 --> 02:28:38,159
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1561
02:28:38,492 --> 02:28:42,663
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1562
02:28:55,426 --> 02:28:56,594
No!

1563
02:29:04,143 --> 02:29:06,353
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1564
02:29:12,610 --> 02:29:14,361
No, no.

1565
02:29:14,528 --> 02:29:16,530
No, no.

1566
02:29:17,156 --> 02:29:18,866
Oh, no.

1567
02:30:08,666 --> 02:30:11,252
I punished them bad men.

1568
02:30:11,752 --> 02:30:13,504
I punished them both.

1569
02:30:13,754 --> 02:30:15,005
Why?

1570
02:30:15,923 --> 02:30:17,174
Why Wild Bill?

1571
02:30:18,509 --> 02:30:22,763
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1572
02:30:23,764 --> 02:30:25,599
I saw what Wild Billy had done.

1573
02:30:26,267 --> 02:30:28,602
Saw it plain as day.

1574
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:32,606
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1575
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:34,108
What?

1576
02:30:35,943 --> 02:30:37,111
You saw what?

1577
02:30:40,990 --> 02:30:43,117
Take my hand, boss.

1578
02:30:46,245 --> 02:30:47,997
You see for yourself.

1579
02:30:49,999 --> 02:30:51,542
Paul...

1580
02:30:51,709 --> 02:30:52,793
...NO.

1581
02:30:56,797 --> 02:30:58,215
Please.

1582
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:08,309
No, no.

1583
02:31:09,602 --> 02:31:12,313
-Please.
- I gots to, boss.

1584
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:14,982
I gots to give you
a little bit of myself.

1585
02:31:16,650 --> 02:31:18,152
A gift.

1586
02:31:19,486 --> 02:31:23,657
A gift of what's inside of me
SO you can see for yourself.

1587
02:31:36,921 --> 02:31:38,964
Paul!

1588
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:19,588
Klaus!

1589
02:32:21,548 --> 02:32:23,050
Suppertime!

1590
02:32:23,217 --> 02:32:25,135
Bring the girls.

1591
02:32:28,597 --> 02:32:31,558
Girls! You heard your mama!

1592
02:32:32,393 --> 02:32:35,145
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1593
02:32:53,497 --> 02:32:57,251
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1594
02:32:57,418 --> 02:32:59,128
Come get you some supper.

1595
02:33:02,089 --> 02:33:06,260
God is great, God is good,
and we thank you...

1596
02:33:30,659 --> 02:33:32,369
You love your sister?

1597
02:33:32,536 --> 02:33:35,414
You make any noise,
you know what happens?

1598
02:33:35,622 --> 02:33:37,708
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1599
02:33:37,958 --> 02:33:41,462
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1600
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:43,297
You understand?

1601
02:33:43,881 --> 02:33:45,591
Shh.

1602
02:34:01,815 --> 02:34:05,819
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1603
02:34:06,987 --> 02:34:09,323
Now you see how it is.

1604
02:34:10,699 --> 02:34:13,577
That's the way it is every day.

1605
02:34:13,827 --> 02:34:17,998
That's the way it is
all over the world.

1606
02:34:28,217 --> 02:34:29,343
Percy.

1607
02:34:29,510 --> 02:34:30,719
Percy Wetmore.

1608
02:34:31,678 --> 02:34:35,015
- Son?
- Percy. Percy Wetmore.

1609
02:34:35,724 --> 02:34:37,017
Son?

1610
02:34:37,684 --> 02:34:40,687
-Son, can you hear me?
-Speak up if you can hear us.

1611
02:34:41,688 --> 02:34:44,733
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1612
02:34:46,527 --> 02:34:49,446
Percy, I got to ask you
a few questions.

1613
02:34:49,696 --> 02:34:52,950
That's right. One minute,
he was fine, and the next, blammo.

1614
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:55,536
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1615
02:34:55,786 --> 02:34:58,372
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1616
02:34:59,373 --> 02:35:02,251
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1617
02:35:06,213 --> 02:35:09,550
I'll cover for you as much as I can...

1618
02:35:09,758 --> 02:35:12,052
...even if it means my job.

1619
02:35:12,719 --> 02:35:14,721
But I have to know...

1620
02:35:14,888 --> 02:35:18,517
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1621
02:35:21,061 --> 02:35:22,563
Does it, Paul?

1622
02:35:24,565 --> 02:35:25,774
No.

1623
02:36:53,153 --> 02:36:56,990
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1624
02:36:58,242 --> 02:36:59,993
Well, can he help?

1625
02:37:00,494 --> 02:37:03,330
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1626
02:37:03,497 --> 02:37:06,333
-Stop the execution?
-No.

1627
02:37:09,503 --> 02:37:11,004
Then don't tell him.

1628
02:37:11,672 --> 02:37:13,924
If it can't help, don't tell him.

1629
02:37:14,258 --> 02:37:15,509
Ever.

1630
02:37:17,886 --> 02:37:19,346
I won't.

1631
02:37:31,024 --> 02:37:33,402
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1632
02:37:34,903 --> 02:37:36,196
No.

1633
02:37:37,281 --> 02:37:39,866
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1634
02:37:40,033 --> 02:37:44,705
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways. No.

1635
02:37:45,789 --> 02:37:47,916
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1636
02:37:49,459 --> 02:37:54,298
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of...

1637
02:37:54,881 --> 02:37:59,720
...but this is the first time
I've ever felt real danger of hell.

1638
02:38:00,721 --> 02:38:02,055
Hell?

1639
02:38:03,807 --> 02:38:05,642
Oh, Paul.

1640
02:38:07,978 --> 02:38:09,563
Talk to him.

1641
02:38:10,731 --> 02:38:12,566
Talk to John.

1642
02:38:14,401 --> 02:38:16,445
Find out what he wants.

1643
02:38:33,337 --> 02:38:34,588
Hello, boss.

1644
02:38:35,589 --> 02:38:36,923
Hello, John.

1645
02:38:38,342 --> 02:38:41,219
I guess you know
we're coming down to it now.

1646
02:38:41,511 --> 02:38:43,263
Another couple of days.

1647
02:38:56,777 --> 02:38:59,613
Is there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1648
02:38:59,988 --> 02:39:02,282
We can rustle you up most anything.

1649
02:39:12,626 --> 02:39:17,297
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1650
02:39:17,547 --> 02:39:18,965
Okra.

1651
02:39:20,050 --> 02:39:22,886
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1652
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:25,806
...if she don't mind.

1653
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:29,518
Now...

1654
02:39:30,018 --> 02:39:34,940
...what about a preacher?
Someone to say a little prayer with.

1655
02:39:35,148 --> 02:39:37,317
Don't want no preacher.

1656
02:39:38,318 --> 02:39:40,821
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1657
02:39:41,530 --> 02:39:42,823
Me?

1658
02:39:45,659 --> 02:39:48,495
Suppose I could, if it came to that.

1659
02:39:52,582 --> 02:39:54,126
John...

1660
02:39:56,670 --> 02:39:59,506
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1661
02:40:01,174 --> 02:40:03,343
I know what you gonna say.

1662
02:40:03,844 --> 02:40:05,345
You don't have to say it.

1663
02:40:05,679 --> 02:40:09,015
No, I do. I do. I have to say it.

1664
02:40:10,058 --> 02:40:11,476
John...

1665
02:40:12,936 --> 02:40:15,272
...tell me what you want me to do.

1666
02:40:16,189 --> 02:40:18,191
You want me to take you out of here?

1667
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:23,363
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1668
02:40:24,865 --> 02:40:27,576
Why would you do
such a foolish thing?

1669
02:40:29,578 --> 02:40:32,205
On the day of my judgment...

1670
02:40:32,539 --> 02:40:34,708
...when I stand before God...

1671
02:40:34,875 --> 02:40:38,712
...and he asks me why did I...

1672
02:40:38,962 --> 02:40:41,590
Did I kill one of his true...

1673
02:40:42,466 --> 02:40:44,050
...miracles...

1674
02:40:45,218 --> 02:40:47,387
...what am I going to say?

1675
02:40:48,305 --> 02:40:50,056
That it was my job?

1676
02:40:52,225 --> 02:40:54,227
It's my job.

1677
02:40:54,519 --> 02:40:59,149
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1678
02:41:02,235 --> 02:41:04,905
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1679
02:41:05,572 --> 02:41:09,242
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1680
02:41:10,410 --> 02:41:13,413
I want it to be over and done with.

1681
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,582
I do.

1682
02:41:20,003 --> 02:41:22,005
I'm tired, boss.

1683
02:41:23,423 --> 02:41:27,761
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1684
02:41:28,929 --> 02:41:31,765
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1685
02:41:32,265 --> 02:41:36,937
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1686
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:41,942
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1687
02:41:43,109 --> 02:41:47,072
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1688
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:48,949
...every day.

1689
02:41:49,282 --> 02:41:51,284
There's too much of it.

1690
02:41:51,618 --> 02:41:55,455
It's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1691
02:41:55,664 --> 02:41:57,958
...all the time.

1692
02:41:59,459 --> 02:42:01,461
Can you understand?

1693
02:42:04,464 --> 02:42:07,425
Yes, John, I think I can.

1694
02:42:09,803 --> 02:42:13,181
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1695
02:42:15,308 --> 02:42:17,394
There must be something
that you want.

1696
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:31,324
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1697
02:42:31,825 --> 02:42:33,952
Heaven

1698
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:36,329
I'm in heaven

1699
02:42:37,205 --> 02:42:42,836
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

1700
02:42:43,837 --> 02:42:49,843
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek

1701
02:42:50,343 --> 02:42:56,224
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1702
02:43:57,243 --> 02:43:59,663
Why, they's angels.

1703
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:03,249
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1704
02:45:03,893 --> 02:45:05,895
I'll be all right, fellas.

1705
02:45:07,313 --> 02:45:09,566
This here's the hard part.

1706
02:45:10,859 --> 02:45:12,402
I'll be all right in a while.

1707
02:45:13,486 --> 02:45:18,074
John, I should have this just for now.

1708
02:45:22,078 --> 02:45:24,497
I'll give it back after.

1709
02:45:27,667 --> 02:45:32,172
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1710
02:45:33,381 --> 02:45:35,508
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1711
02:45:36,676 --> 02:45:37,886
Did you, John?

1712
02:45:38,678 --> 02:45:43,016
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1713
02:45:43,266 --> 02:45:45,518
That Mouseville place.

1714
02:45:45,852 --> 02:45:48,188
I dreamed there's kids.

1715
02:45:48,688 --> 02:45:52,192
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1716
02:45:54,694 --> 02:45:58,490
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1717
02:45:58,698 --> 02:46:00,533
They's laughing too.

1718
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:03,703
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1719
02:46:03,912 --> 02:46:07,957
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1720
02:46:08,208 --> 02:46:11,544
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1721
02:46:13,046 --> 02:46:16,466
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1722
02:46:32,232 --> 02:46:34,067
John.

1723
02:46:34,734 --> 02:46:39,739
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1724
02:46:40,740 --> 02:46:42,742
I can feel it.

1725
02:46:42,992 --> 02:46:44,744
It's like bees stinging me.

1726
02:46:45,078 --> 02:46:47,455
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1727
02:46:48,748 --> 02:46:49,958
We don't hate you.

1728
02:46:51,334 --> 02:46:52,919
Can you feel that?

1729
02:46:55,088 --> 02:46:57,257
Kill him twice, you boys!

1730
02:46:58,091 --> 02:47:02,095
You go on and kill that raping
baby killer twice!

1731
02:47:02,262 --> 02:47:04,097
That'd be fine!

1732
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:23,283
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1733
02:47:23,491 --> 02:47:24,784
Yes, sir.

1734
02:47:37,046 --> 02:47:38,131
Roll on one.

1735
02:47:46,139 --> 02:47:49,642
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1736
02:47:50,476 --> 02:47:52,729
I hope it hurts like hell.

1737
02:47:54,647 --> 02:47:58,735
John Coffey, you've been condemned to
die in the chair by a jury of your peers.

1738
02:47:58,985 --> 02:48:02,530
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1739
02:48:02,822 --> 02:48:06,075
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1740
02:48:07,827 --> 02:48:10,330
I'm sorry for what I am.

1741
02:48:22,342 --> 02:48:24,093
Please, boss...

1742
02:48:25,511 --> 02:48:28,181
...don't put that thing over my face.

1743
02:48:29,349 --> 02:48:31,684
Don't put me in the dark.

1744
02:48:32,518 --> 02:48:34,854
I's afraid of the dark.

1745
02:48:44,530 --> 02:48:46,199
All right, John.

1746
02:49:06,386 --> 02:49:09,389
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1747
02:49:09,597 --> 02:49:12,392
Heaven, heaven

1748
02:49:12,642 --> 02:49:14,477
I'm in heaven

1749
02:49:15,061 --> 02:49:17,647
Heaven, heaven

1750
02:49:17,897 --> 02:49:19,607
I'm in heaven

1751
02:49:20,108 --> 02:49:23,486
Heaven, heaven

1752
02:49:23,569 --> 02:49:25,571
I'm in heaven

1753
02:49:25,655 --> 02:49:27,573
I'm in heaven

1754
02:49:27,657 --> 02:49:29,659
I'm in heaven

1755
02:49:29,742 --> 02:49:33,621
Heaven, heaven

1756
02:49:40,503 --> 02:49:42,130
John Coffey...

1757
02:49:43,131 --> 02:49:46,259
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1758
02:49:46,426 --> 02:49:48,636
...in accordance with state law.

1759
02:49:51,014 --> 02:49:54,767
May God have mercy on your soul.

1760
02:50:29,093 --> 02:50:30,303
Paul.

1761
02:50:33,473 --> 02:50:35,391
You have to say it.

1762
02:50:37,060 --> 02:50:39,312
You have to give the order.

1763
02:50:57,330 --> 02:50:59,665
He killed them with they love.

1764
02:50:59,832 --> 02:51:04,712
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1765
02:51:18,518 --> 02:51:19,936
Roll on two.

1766
02:53:04,624 --> 02:53:07,960
It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1767
02:53:08,294 --> 02:53:11,964
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1768
02:53:13,132 --> 02:53:17,887
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1769
02:53:18,137 --> 02:53:19,889
It was all right.

1770
02:53:20,473 --> 02:53:23,476
"Catch them young"
became my motto.

1771
02:53:26,646 --> 02:53:27,855
You don't believe me.

1772
02:53:28,648 --> 02:53:31,234
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1773
02:53:31,984 --> 02:53:34,153
-It's just that--
-It's quite a story.

1774
02:53:34,403 --> 02:53:36,656
It's quite a story.

1775
02:53:36,989 --> 02:53:39,408
One thing I don't understand.

1776
02:53:39,659 --> 02:53:41,410
You said you and Jan...

1777
02:53:41,661 --> 02:53:45,164
...had a grown son in 1935.

1778
02:53:45,498 --> 02:53:46,999
Is that right?

1779
02:53:47,375 --> 02:53:49,335
The math doesn't work, does it?

1780
02:53:54,840 --> 02:53:57,593
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1781
02:54:18,322 --> 02:54:19,699
Watch your step.

1782
02:54:20,199 --> 02:54:22,535
Now let your eyes adjust.

1783
02:54:34,213 --> 02:54:35,423
There.

1784
02:54:38,050 --> 02:54:40,928
Hey. Wake up, old fella.

1785
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:42,471
Wake up.

1786
02:54:46,058 --> 02:54:49,937
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1787
02:54:54,066 --> 02:54:55,443
Come over here, boy.

1788
02:54:55,943 --> 02:54:58,321
Come on over here and see this lady.

1789
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:04,243
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1790
02:55:26,932 --> 02:55:29,518
Go on, you can do it.

1791
02:55:36,609 --> 02:55:41,113
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1792
02:55:41,864 --> 02:55:45,785
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1793
02:55:52,291 --> 02:55:55,961
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1794
02:55:56,379 --> 02:56:01,258
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1795
02:56:01,467 --> 02:56:03,803
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1796
02:56:04,053 --> 02:56:07,473
And I think a part of...

1797
02:56:07,640 --> 02:56:10,476
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1798
02:56:10,643 --> 02:56:13,979
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1799
02:56:15,147 --> 02:56:17,149
As for me...

1800
02:56:18,317 --> 02:56:20,820
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1801
02:56:21,153 --> 02:56:23,322
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1802
02:56:23,656 --> 02:56:27,076
...So that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1803
02:56:29,495 --> 02:56:31,664
When John did that...

1804
02:56:33,165 --> 02:56:35,501
...when he took my hand...

1805
02:56:36,502 --> 02:56:40,339
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1806
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:43,175
...Spilled into me.

1807
02:56:43,551 --> 02:56:45,344
He what?

1808
02:56:45,845 --> 02:56:49,348
He infected you with life?

1809
02:56:50,933 --> 02:56:53,269
It's as good a word as any.

1810
02:56:54,770 --> 02:56:57,690
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1811
02:56:57,857 --> 02:56:59,358
With life.

1812
02:57:03,362 --> 02:57:06,532
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

1813
02:57:06,699 --> 02:57:11,120
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1814
02:57:14,039 --> 02:57:17,793
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1815
02:57:18,043 --> 02:57:22,590
He was just a force of nature.

1816
02:57:23,048 --> 02:57:27,219
Oh, I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1817
02:57:28,220 --> 02:57:31,223
Another century come to pass.

1818
02:57:31,474 --> 02:57:33,350
But I've...

1819
02:57:33,976 --> 02:57:38,397
I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1820
02:57:38,814 --> 02:57:40,900
Hal and Melinda...

1821
02:57:41,317 --> 02:57:42,735
...Brutus Howell...

1822
02:57:42,902 --> 02:57:45,613
...my wife, my boy.

1823
02:57:48,574 --> 02:57:50,409
And you, Elaine.

1824
02:57:51,410 --> 02:57:53,245
You'll die too.

1825
02:57:54,747 --> 02:57:59,126
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1826
02:58:00,586 --> 02:58:03,005
It's my atonement, you see.

1827
02:58:03,589 --> 02:58:05,257
It's my punishment...

1828
02:58:05,508 --> 02:58:08,135
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1829
02:58:09,845 --> 02:58:12,640
For killing a miracle of God.

1830
02:58:14,141 --> 02:58:16,936
Almighty, everlasting God...

1831
02:58:17,228 --> 02:58:19,605
...the source of all being and life...

1832
02:58:19,772 --> 02:58:22,191
You'll be gone like all the others.

1833
02:58:22,358 --> 02:58:24,151
I'll have to stay.

1834
02:58:26,153 --> 02:58:30,366
Oh, I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1835
02:58:31,116 --> 02:58:35,120
I have no illusions of immortality.

1836
02:58:35,454 --> 02:58:38,082
But I will have wished for death...

1837
02:58:38,249 --> 02:58:40,876
...long before death finds me.

1838
02:58:41,961 --> 02:58:45,798
In truth, I wish for it already.

1839
02:58:57,893 --> 02:58:59,895
Mr. Jingles?

1840
02:59:08,821 --> 02:59:10,990
Where you been?

1841
02:59:11,323 --> 02:59:14,743
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1842
02:59:15,578 --> 02:59:17,997
Let's go see if we can't find you
something to eat.

1843
02:59:19,164 --> 02:59:22,835
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1844
02:59:24,336 --> 02:59:25,671
Look at you.

1845
02:59:27,339 --> 02:59:31,260
I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1846
02:59:31,468 --> 02:59:33,512
And I wait.

1847
02:59:34,221 --> 02:59:37,141
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1848
02:59:37,349 --> 02:59:39,518
...now long gone.

1849
02:59:40,019 --> 02:59:42,688
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1850
02:59:42,855 --> 02:59:45,858
...how [ lost her so many years ago.

1851
02:59:47,276 --> 02:59:51,864
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1852
02:59:52,114 --> 02:59:54,783
...each in our own time.

1853
02:59:55,868 --> 02:59:59,038
But one thought
more than any other...

1854
02:59:59,246 --> 03:00:01,874
...keeps me awake most nights:

1855
03:00:03,042 --> 03:00:07,046
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1856
03:00:07,379 --> 03:00:10,549
...how much longer do I have?

1857
03:00:13,886 --> 03:00:16,680
We each owe a death.

1858
03:00:16,889 --> 03:00:19,391
There are no exceptions.

1859
03:00:20,142 --> 03:00:22,144
But, oh, God...

1860
03:00:23,062 --> 03:00:24,855
...sometimes...

1861
03:00:25,397 --> 03:00:29,068
...the Green Mile seems so long.
