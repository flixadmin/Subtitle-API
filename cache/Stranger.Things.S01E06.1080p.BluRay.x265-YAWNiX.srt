1
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,753
Nancy!

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,297
Nancy!

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,753
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,429
Nancy!

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,640
Where are you?

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,765
Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,938
Jonathan!

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,358
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,189
Nancy!

10
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,527
Nancy! Come on!

11
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,404
Jonathan, where are you?

12
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,111
- Jonathan!
- Nancy!

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,912
Jonathan!

14
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,115
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,041
Where are you?

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,743
- I'm right here!
- Jonathan!

17
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,204
I'm right here! Nancy!

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,508
- Just follow my voice!
- Jonathan!

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,837
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

20
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,172
Nancy!

21
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,179
Nancy!

22
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,127
Nancy?

23
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,714
Nancy.

24
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,841
Nancy!
Follow my voice!

25
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,764
Nancy?

26
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,277
- Jonathan!
- Nancy!

27
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,503
I got you.

28
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,749
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

29
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,087
- She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
- That's... that's not it.

30
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,844
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

31
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,597
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

32
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,599
So what?
Like, you're worried about her?

33
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,103
- What?
- Aw, you are.

34
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,900
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Will you just move your hands off me?

35
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,569
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Will you just shut up?

36
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,987
- Who knew?
- Shut up!

37
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,405
Jeez.

38
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,406
Damn. Sorry.

39
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,209
So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

40
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,958
I'll just be a minute.

41
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,324
Look, we gotta
go through this again.

42
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,202
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

43
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,625
- Upstairs or downstairs?
- Upstairs.

44
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,827
There was a laboratory.

45
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,504
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

46
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,127
There was this kid's room.

47
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,882
- How do you know it was a kid's room?
- More like a prison.

48
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,384
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

49
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,840
Because, I told you,

50
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,642
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal...

51
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,344
You didn't say
there was a drawing.

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,270
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

53
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,690
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good?

54
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,018
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

55
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,783
Wasn't Will.

56
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,960
Earl...

57
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,830
The night that Benny died,

58
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:46,215
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

59
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,048
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

60
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,928
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

61
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,385
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

62
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,516
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

63
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,019
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

64
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,476
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

65
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,696
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

66
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,444
I've been looking for Will...

67
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,488
I've been chasing after some other kid?

68
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,254
Nancy!

69
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,233
Better?

70
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,194
Yeah.

71
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,079
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

72
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,702
- I can go home.
- I just figured...

73
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,753
- Yeah, no.
- I...

74
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,134
I don't wanna be alone.

75
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,263
- Do you?
- No. Uh... no.

76
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,209
Can you just come up here?

77
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,799
Yeah.

78
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,646
- Do you want the lights off, or...
- On.

79
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,151
Yeah.

80
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,362
You know, it...

81
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,205
it can't get us in here.

82
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,170
We don't know that.

83
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,691
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

84
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,697
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

85
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,655
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,328
Mmm-hmm.

87
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,582
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

88
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,663
Say hi to the boys for me, too, will you?

89
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,718
Did you get it?

90
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,765
- I got it.
- Okay.

91
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,696
Oh...

92
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,788
Hey.

93
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,284
Hey.

94
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,503
Couldn't sleep?

95
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,926
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

96
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,556
keep seeing that... thing.

97
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,057
Wherever I was, that place...

98
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,731
I think that it lives there.

99
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,649
It was feeding there.

100
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,774
Feeding on that deer.

101
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,232
That means that if...

102
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,738
Ä°f Will and Barbara...

103
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,826
Hey.

104
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,575
My mom said she talked to Will.

105
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,999
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

106
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,081
That means that she's trapped...

107
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,504
in that place.

108
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,259
We have to find it again.

109
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,306
You wanna go back out there?

110
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,184
Maybe we don't have to.

111
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,559
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

112
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,766
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
- Right.

113
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,945
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

114
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,738
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

115
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,991
It's always alone, like...

116
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,114
like a bear.

117
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,539
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

118
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,209
- And then, last night, the deer...
- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

119
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,502
One sec.

120
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,956
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

121
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,007
That's one drop of blood in a million,

122
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,335
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

123
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,092
So you're saying it can detect blood?

124
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,182
It's just a theory.

125
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,177
We could test it.

126
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,389
But if it works...

127
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,275
At least we'll know it's coming.

128
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,065
Honey, are you up?

129
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,651
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

130
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,283
I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

131
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,035
I'll be down in a second.

132
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,593
Your mom doesn't knock?

133
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,109
- Hi. Scott Clarke?
- Uh, yes.

134
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,232
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

135
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,483
- at Hawkins Middle?
- The very same.

136
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,814
Oh, wonderful.

137
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,401
And we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

138
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,407
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

139
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,410
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

140
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,911
Oh, that's neat.

141
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,584
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke...

142
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,286
Uh, please, call me Scott.

143
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,916
Scott.

144
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,921
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

145
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,003
and give them
the support and encouragement

146
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,088
to pursue careers in technology.

147
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,889
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

148
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,559
I agree, yes.
Completely.

149
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,604
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

150
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,398
Oh, I have a few in mind.

151
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,866
I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

152
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,948
- She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

153
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,580
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

154
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,831
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.

155
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,163
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

156
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,840
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

157
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,007
It wasn't his fault, either.

158
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,216
- It wasn't his fault?
- No.

159
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,013
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

160
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,635
- Totally, but so were you!
- What?

161
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,388
- And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break!

162
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,685
No, Mike, you give me a break!

163
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,184
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

164
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,809
I was the only reasonable one.

165
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,563
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

166
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,518
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

167
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,354
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

168
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,984
- You're shaking his hand!
- No, I'm not.

169
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,113
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

170
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,992
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

171
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,956
- No.
- Good.

172
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,585
Where are we going?

173
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,957
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

174
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,960
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

175
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,649
Today is a very special day.

176
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,436
Do you know why?

177
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,196
Because today, we make history.

178
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,283
Today, we make contact.

179
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,962
Here you go.

180
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,088
Ah... yum.

181
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,505
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

182
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,641
Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

183
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,969
She is.

184
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,055
Uh, she was.
I don't know.

185
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,516
Nancy, what's taking so long?

186
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,226
Nancy?

187
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,983
Nancy, come on.

188
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,163
Nan...

189
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,148
What do you want?

190
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,281
I drew first blood, so...

191
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,378
Okay, I'll shake.

192
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,304
On one condition.

193
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,427
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

194
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,928
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine!

195
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,759
- Fine!
- No, no, not fine!

196
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,094
Guys, seriously?

197
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,435
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

198
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,355
We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

199
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,360
and those trolls took us out one by one.

200
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,158
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

201
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,113
So we stick together, no matter what!

202
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:07,122
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

203
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:11,125
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

204
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,457
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor...

205
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,338
She was just trying to keep us safe!

206
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,964
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

207
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,261
An accident?

208
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,304
All right, accident or not...

209
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,428
- admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome?

210
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,475
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

211
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,224
I could have been killed!

212
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,102
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

213
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,353
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

214
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,731
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

215
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,687
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

216
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,866
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

217
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,241
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

218
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

219
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,490
<i>It's okay, Eleven.</i>

220
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,039
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

221
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,209
They're just here to watch.

222
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,084
Don't focus on them.

223
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,712
Stay in here, like before.

224
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,385
Yes, Papa.

225
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,886
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

226
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,518
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

227
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,729
It's reaching out to you...

228
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,646
'cause it wants you.

229
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,355
Hmm?

230
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,656
It's calling you...

231
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,488
so don't turn away from it this time.

232
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,904
I want you to find it.

233
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,073
Understand?

234
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,081
Yes.

235
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,735
<i>Are you lost?</i>

236
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,539
Is your mom here?

237
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,210
Your dad?

238
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,167
Mouth breather.

239
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,308
- What should we do?
- Uh...

240
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,773
Call the police.

241
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,822
Excuse me. Young lady!
You know you have to pay for those!

242
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,615
Hey, hey! Stop right...

243
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,112
Please.

244
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,286
You have to pay for those!

245
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,954
Stop right there!
Thief! Thief!

246
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,478
Can I help you?

247
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,605
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here?

248
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,654
- Who's asking?
- The Hawkins chief of police.

249
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,370
And you want to talk to my sister?

250
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,289
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

251
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,955
Okay, well, you can come in,

252
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,162
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

253
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,339
you're about five years too late.

254
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,793
Terry, you have some visitors.

255
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,431
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.

256
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,601
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

257
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:38,021
Um, you see, uh, my son...

258
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,350
he's been missing for almost a week now,

259
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,607
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

260
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,313
about your daughter, Jane?

261
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:50,401
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

262
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,202
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

263
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,492
You guys keep in touch?

264
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,210
This is, uh... this is him.

265
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,754
This is Will.

266
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,583
Uh, you may have seen him on...
on the news.

267
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,918
- Uh...
- What's wrong with her?

268
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,720
I told you, you're wasting your time.

269
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,917
This is weird without Lucas.

270
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,879
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.

271
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,925
What are you talking about?

272
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,598
Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

273
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,431
He's your best friend, right?

274
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:06,518
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine. I get it.

275
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,105
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

276
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,531
But none of that matters.

277
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,280
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

278
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,703
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

279
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,655
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

280
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,241
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. And you know it.

281
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,918
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

282
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,462
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

283
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,006
like goblins
with intelligence scores of zero.

284
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,756
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.

285
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,509
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, he is, but so are you.

286
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,012
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.

287
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,843
- Says who?
- Says logic.

288
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,476
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

289
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,519
Okay.

290
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,145
Whoa.

291
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,527
You don't think...

292
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,030
Uh... definitely.

293
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,215
<i>Are you ready?</i>

294
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,044
She was a part of some study
in college.

295
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,505
- MK Ultra?
- Yeah, that's the one.

296
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,342
Was, uh, started in the '50s.

297
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,893
By the time Terry got involved,

298
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,143
it was supposed to be ramping down,
but the drugs just got crazier.

299
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,768
Messed her up good.

300
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,192
This was the CIA that ran this?

301
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,906
You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

302
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,449
They'd pay... you know,

303
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,494
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

304
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,244
give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.

305
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,122
And then they'd strip her naked
and put her in these isolation tanks.

306
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,044
- Isolation tanks?
- Yeah.

307
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,168
These big bathtubs, basically,

308
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,875
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

309
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,632
You lose any sense of, uh...

310
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,511
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

311
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,935
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

312
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,353
Real hippie crap.

313
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,022
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

314
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,349
The thing is, though, is that

315
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,526
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

316
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,103
Jane.

317
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,987
Do you have any pictures of her?

318
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,076
I don't think you guys understand.

319
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,367
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

320
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,587
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

321
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,681
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

322
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,601
like she's gonna come home someday.

323
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:49,101
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

324
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,978
Abilities?

325
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,654
You read any Stephen King?

326
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,287
You guys look scared, actually.

327
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,207
I mean, it's all make-believe.

328
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,122
What... what kind of abilities?

329
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,920
Telepathy, telekinesis...

330
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,799
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

331
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,845
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

332
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,388
Papa!

333
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,512
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

334
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,721
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

335
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,522
You know, to deal with the guilt.

336
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,567
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

337
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,938
About having had the kid.

338
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,819
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

339
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,993
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

340
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,243
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

341
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,247
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

342
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,358
Oh, man.

343
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,119
And I'll have four boxes of the.38s.

344
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,003
What you kids doin' with all this?

345
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,422
Um...

346
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,303
- Monster hunting.
- Huh.

347
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,674
"Monster hunting"?

348
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,061
You know, last week...

349
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,979
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

350
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,900
It took me and Barb all weekend.

351
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,856
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now...

352
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,487
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

353
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,527
Yeah.

354
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,032
What's the weirdest part?

355
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,368
Me or the bear trap?

356
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,626
You.
It's definitely you.

357
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,954
Hey, Nance!

358
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,549
Can't wait to see your movie.

359
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,001
What the hell was that?

360
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,803
I don't know.

361
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,551
What?

362
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,763
What?

363
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,439
Hey! Where are you going?

364
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,773
Nancy, wait!

365
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,652
Nancy!

366
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,204
- I can't believe it.
- These kids!

367
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,619
Jesus.

368
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,048
Wow.

369
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,342
Wait!

370
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,014
Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

371
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,057
- Shut up!
- I didn't know you could spell.

372
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,100
Aw, hey there, princess!

373
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,770
Uh-oh! She looks upset.

374
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,322
- Oh!
- Damn!

375
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,741
What is wrong with you?

376
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,113
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

377
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,740
I was worried about you.

378
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,913
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you.

379
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,242
- What are you talking about?
- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

380
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,500
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

381
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,796
Speak of the devil.

382
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,128
Hi.

383
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,964
You came by last night?

384
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,555
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

385
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,384
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

386
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,845
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

387
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,522
Or for another
pervy photo session?

388
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,144
- We were just...
- You were just what?

389
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,817
Finish that sentence.

390
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,781
Finish the sentence.

391
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,282
Go to hell, Nancy.

392
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,499
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

393
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,121
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

394
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,748
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

395
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,831
a little screw-up like your father.

396
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,587
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

397
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,168
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

398
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,469
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

399
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,716
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom...

400
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,638
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

401
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,760
Steve, shut up!

402
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,841
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

403
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,767
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire...

404
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,273
Steve!

405
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,021
Oh!

406
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,693
Steve.

407
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,525
Stop! Steve!
Knock it off, you guys!

408
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,698
- Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

409
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,150
Get off! Stop!

410
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,494
- Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
- Easy, easy!

411
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,324
Hey. Hey! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

412
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,754
Jonathan, stop!
Stop! You're going to hurt him!

413
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,797
Jonathan, stop!

414
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,001
- Cops!
- Guys... Jonathan, get off of him!

415
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,256
- Stop it!
- Cops! Come on!

416
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,258
- Stop it! Come on!
- Cops!

417
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,510
- You have to stop!
- Just go, Carol!

418
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,058
Stop it!

419
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,806
Hey, he's had enough, man!
I said he's had enough!

420
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,603
- Kids! All right!
- Stop it!

421
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,689
Oh! My nose!

422
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,562
Calm him down!

423
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,235
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

424
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:14,191
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Come here, little guys! Come here!

425
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,866
- Get off!
- I got this one!

426
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,865
Get back here!
Get back here, you little punks!

427
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,917
<i>Good gift for a college student...</i>

428
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,045
Well, thank you for your time.
We appreciate it.

429
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,256
Hmm, yeah,
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

430
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,473
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

431
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,277
Hey...

432
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,901
What?

433
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,032
We're gonna find him.

434
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,246
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

435
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,119
We're close.

436
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,205
Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her...

437
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,960
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

438
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,257
which means we've got a chance.

439
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,050
You know what I would give?

440
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,338
For a chance?

441
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,138
You know what I would give?

442
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,595
<i>Hey, Chief, you there?</i>

443
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,894
<i>- Hey, Chief?
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

444
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,721
<i>Yeah, a fight broke out here and...</i>

445
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,024
<i>- Cal, I don't have time for this.
- It's Jonathan Byers.</i>

446
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,147
<i>Uh, you haven't seen Joyce, have you?</i>

447
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,953
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

448
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,160
You, yes. Him, no.

449
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,496
He assaulted a police officer.

450
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,832
Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

451
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,087
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

452
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,385
He's not my boyfriend.

453
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,963
I think you better tell him that.

454
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,719
What?

455
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,597
Only love makes you that crazy,
sweetheart.

456
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,478
And that damn stupid.

457
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,322
Found some ice.

458
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,863
Thanks.

459
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,966
Everything okay?

460
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,836
Yeah.

461
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,554
Everything's fine.

Eleven!

466
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,790
- Hey, stop. Do you hear that?

El!

468

El?

469
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,802
Hey, there, Frogface.

Toothless.

Shit! Run, Mike!

472
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,846
- What?
- Run! Come on!

473
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,102
You're dead, Wheeler.

474
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,899
Move, Mike!

475
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,567

00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,409
Nice throw, numbnuts.

483
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,418
Get off! Get off me!

484
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,374
Let him go! Let him go!

485
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,427
- Stay back, or I cut him!
- What do you want?

486
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,720
I want to know how you did it!

487
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,092
How I did what?

488
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,468
I know you did something to me.

489
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,515
Some nerdy science shit
to make me do that.

490
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:33,809
You mean piss your pants?

491
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,432
Our friend has superpowers,

492
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,936
and she squeezed your tiny bladder
with her mind.

493
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,391
Shut up!

494
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,818
I think I should save Toothless here
a trip to the dentist.

495
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,611
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.

496
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,529
Let him go.
Let him go!

497
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,824
I'll let him go, sure.

498
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,197
But first... it's your turn.

499
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,403
My turn for what?

500
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,113
Wet yourself.

501
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,950
- What?
- Jump...

502
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,501
or Toothless here
gets an early trip to the dentist.

503
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,919
Stop! No!

504
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,713
I'll cut him right now!

505
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,680
All right, just hold on!
Hold on!

506
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,133
Mike, don't do it.
I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!

507
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,093
Mike, seriously, don't!

508
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,821
Mike, don't do it!

509
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,749
Seriously, don't do it, man!
Seriously, don't!

510
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,701
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

511
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,170
Mike, don't!

512
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,875
Dentist's office opens in five...

513
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,381
Four! Three!

514
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,256
- Two!
- Mike!

515
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,339
One!

516
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,109
Holy shit.

517
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,076
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

518
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,853
She broke my arm! My arm!

519
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:49,983
Go.

520
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,907
- Let's get out of here! Let's go!
- Go!

521
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,905
Yeah, that's right!
You better run!

522
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,121
She's our friend and she's crazy!

523
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,574
You come back here and she'll kill you!

524
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,628
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches.

525
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,750
She'll kill you, you hear me?

526
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,165
<i>El, are you okay?</i>

527
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,833
El?

528
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,667
Mike... I'm sorry.

529
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,215
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

530
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,671
The gate...

531
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,968
I opened it.

532
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,053
I'm the monster.

533
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,145
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

534
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,816
You saved me.

535
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,771
Do you understand?
You saved me.

536
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:38,318
I have eyes on 'em now.
They're heading home.

537
00:43:38,342 --> 00:43:46,342
