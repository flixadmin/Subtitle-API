00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,698
Get back to work.

4
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,367
No. I've been here for weeks.

5
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,621
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

6
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,749
You will know why.

7
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,043
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

8
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,254
Get back to work.

9
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,215
- When do I get to play the game?
- Game?

10
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,093
The game. The Game of Faces.

11
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,472
You tried already. You failed.

12
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,681
I didn't even know I was playing.

13

Who are you?

17
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,193
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

18
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,781
I'm from Westeros, just like you.

19
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,451
Daughter of a lord, just like you.

20
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,370
Except I was an only child.

21
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,790
Heir to his fortune.

22
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,459
My mother died.

23
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,297
My father remarried,
and his new wife gave birth to a girl.

24
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,803
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

25
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,180
so she tried to kill me with poison.

26
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,307
I found out.

27
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,601
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

28
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,773
And my father was widowed again.

29
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,652
I've been serving them ever since.

30
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,124
Was that true or a lie?

00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,214

Arya.

38
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,592
And where did you come from?

39
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,843
Westeros.

40
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,182
My family home is Winterfell.

41
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,936
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,
Eddard Stark.

42
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,479
He died in battle.

(GASPS)

44
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,232
A lie.

45
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,360
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

46
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,614
Had to kill a stable boy.

(GASPS)

49

A lie.

50
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,495
I stabbed him in the gut.

51
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,625
I tried to find my mother and brother,
but I never did.

52
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,044
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

53
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,797
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

56
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,597
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

57
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,184
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
I left him in the mountains to die.

58
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,811
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

59
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,565
I hated him.

60
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,860
That's not a lie!

61
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,239

62
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,701
to the Many-Faced God, to herself.

63
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,954
Does she truly want to be no one?

64
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
Yes.

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,117
So, those villages we were supposed to find?

69
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,994
We can't live on berries and roots.

70
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,078
I can.

71
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,206

72
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,417
Of course I'm hungry.

You're an awful traveling companion,
do you know that?

Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.

75
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,132
I'm not your traveling companion.

We are traveling together
in each other's company, therefore...

Do you ever shut up?

78
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,890
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos
in a crate

79
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,852

Why?

81
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,276
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

82
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,949
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

83
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,327
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

84
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,914
I killed my father.

85
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,046
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

86
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,675
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,731
As miserable as you are, Mormont,
at least your father was a good man.

JORAH: What do you know about my father?

00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,985
TYRION: I met him. I visited the Wall.

90
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,072
When I asked him about his men,

91
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,450
he knew all their stories, every one of them.

92
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,953
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

How do they put it in the Watch?

I'm sorry. I am.

00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,401
How?

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,905
I only know what I heard.

99
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
How?

100
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,617
He was leading
an expedition beyond the Wall.

101
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,537
There was a mutiny.

102
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,456
He was murdered by his own men.

103
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,803

But my father never gave up on me.

He loved me

more than anything in the world,
just like your father loves you.

So he brought me here.

My father prayed to the Many-Faced God,

and I drank the water from his fountain.

No.

137
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,916
A girl is not ready to become no one.

138
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,090
But she is ready to become someone else.

139

Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

140
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,818
As I recall,

141
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,197
the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens
during Robert's Rebellion.

142

Do you believe in anything?

I believe in lots of things.

- No.
- Neither did I.

148
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,548
I was a cynic, just like you.

149
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:33,094
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
with three stone eggs.

150
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,806
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

151
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,851
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

152
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,897
alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

153
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,944
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

154
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,612
No.

155
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,990
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

156
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,286
Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

No, it doesn't.

158
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,790
The Targaryens are famously insane.

159
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,585
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

160
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,045
A thousand years of peace and prosperity?

161
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,256
First we have to conquer the world.

162

She's ecstatic when
you bring her this enemy dwarf.

165
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,600
She hacks off my head
and restores your position.

166
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,353
You command her army, sail to Westeros,
defeat all your enemies,

167
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,273
and watch her climb those steps
and sit on the Iron Throne.

168
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,775
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

169
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
Then she rules.

170
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,156
So, a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life in Westeros

171
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,366
becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

172
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,994
- JORAH: She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

173
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,748
Because her father, who burned
living men for amusement, was the king?

174
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,462
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

175
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,339
They probably came ashore for...

176
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,798

00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,822
Salt mines?

182
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,701
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

183
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,787
He looks strong enough.

184
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,747
What about the dwarf?

185
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,457
Worthless.

186
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,044
Cut his throat.

187
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,630
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.

188
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,173
And then chop off his cock.

189
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,300
We'll sell it for a fortune.

190
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,427
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

191
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,847
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

192
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:46,435
You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant
and expect him to pay for it.

193
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,354
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

194
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,774
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

195
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,609
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

196
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,611
Guess again.

197
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,869
The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.

198
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,705
(EXHALES)

199
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,588
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

200
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,758
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

201
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,303
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

202
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,140
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

203
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,559
TYRION: The fighting pits in Meereen?

204
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,061
You're in luck, then. You're about to be rich.

205
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,940
You are looking at one of the great warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms.

206
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,109
(LAUGHS)

207
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,193
Him.

208
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,028
Him?

209
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,823
He's got to be 60 years old.

210
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,911
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

211
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,874
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

212
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,126
They wrote songs about him.

213
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,884
That true?

214
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,186
He won the tournament at Lannisport,
unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

215
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
(LAUGHS)

216
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,441
The Kingslayer.

217
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,694
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

218
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,280
A fancy game for fancy lads.

219
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,908
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

220
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,577
JORAH: I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

221
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,839
Liar.

222
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,634
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

223
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,053
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

224
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,599
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

225
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,892
I'll prove my worth.

226
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,275
(LAUGHING)

Lord Baelish.

230
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,872
Yes?

231
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,418
Lancel Lannister.

232
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,506
Brother Lancel.

233
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,007
We abandon our family names.

234
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,843
That's quite a family to abandon.

235
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,096
The city has changed
since you were here last.

236
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,931
We flooded the gutters with wine,

237
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,684
smashed the false idols,

238
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,561
and set the godless on the run.

239
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,437
Well done.

240
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

241
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,991
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

242
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,705
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

243
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,667
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

244
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,712
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

245
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,256
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

246
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,310
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

247
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,562
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

248
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,398
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

249
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,526
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

250
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,278
The king's orders.

251
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,488
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras' perversion?

252
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,490
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

253
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,784
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

254
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,704
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

255
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,333
Ser Loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

256
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,668
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

257
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,006
Most curious.

258
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,594
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

259
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,429
A thoroughly repellant woman.

260
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,307
Forgive me.

261
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,768
I know you're still in mourning.

262
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,564
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

263
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,275
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

264
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,152
Still, I pity her son.

265
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:10,199
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

266
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,534
I know how hard it can be

267
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,954
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

268
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,998
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

269
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,585
Young Lord Robin heeds my advice,

270
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,547
and I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

271
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,216
Good.

272
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,514
If there's nothing else.

273
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,684
There is another matter, Your Grace.

274
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,269
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

275
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,231
You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.

276
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,358
To my shame, I failed you.

277
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,403
But I have found Sansa Stark.

278
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,825
Alive and well and home again

279
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,993
living at Winterfell.

280
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,286
That's not possible.

281
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,622
My sources are well placed.

282
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:04,461
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay,

283
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,047
a bastard recently legitimized
by King Tommen.

284
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,843
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

285
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,888
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

286
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,475
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

287
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,521
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

288
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,773
than an alliance with a hated southern house.

289
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:30,154
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

290
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,864
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

291
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,490
Patience?

292
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,660
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

293
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,622
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

294
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,625
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

295
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,544
Let the enemies of the throne
slaughter each other.

296
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,339
And when they're done,
seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

297
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:54,011
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

298
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:58,515
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the victor still licks his wounds.

299
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,395
Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

300
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,732
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

301
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,150
Ser Jaime, then.

302
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,070
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

303
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,906
I have no idea when he'll be back.

304
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,657
Perhaps I can help.

305
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,870
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

306
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,914
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

307
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,957
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

308
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,630
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

309
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:34,218
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

310
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,261
What do you have to lose?

311
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,680
A brothel keeper?

312
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,265
And if you succeed?

313
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,392
Name me Warden of the North.

314
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,316
I'll speak to the king this evening,

315
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,569
have him issue a royal decree.

316
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,614
I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.

317
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,866
I'll know you're a man of your word

318
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,786
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

319
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,912
As I said,

320
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,832
I live to serve.

321
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,507
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

322
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,844
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

323
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,762
We've waited long enough.

324
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,807
I want you to be my wife.

325
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,267
Now.

from testimony at a holy inquest.

488
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,207
How do you respond to
these charges against your brother?

489
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,167
They are lies.

490
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,585
- All of them?
- All of them.

491
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,921
HIGH SPARROW: Queen Margaery,

492
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,509
in the presence of the gods,
do you swear that your brother is innocent

493
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,637
of these charges against him,
to the best of your knowledge?

494
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,681
MARGAERY: Yes, I swear it.

495
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,977
Thank you, Your Grace.

496
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,920
Do you know this man?

497
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,797
Yes.

498
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,632
Very well.

499
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,760
He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

500
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,721
How did you come to meet?

501
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,473
OLYVAR: I squired for him.

502
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,434
He took a liking to me.

503
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,811
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

504
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,066
And what occurred in his chamber?

505
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,654
We engaged in intimate relations.

506
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,990
You lay with him?

507
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,366
That night and many others.

508
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,827
Liar. He's a liar.

509
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,247
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

510
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,625
Yes.

511
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,335
Yes, Queen Margaery.

512
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,964
She walked in on us once, not long ago.

513
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,050
She didn't seem surprised.

514
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,887
This testimony is an insult to a great house.

515
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,014
Why should the Faith or anyone else

516
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,267
take the word of a squire
over the heir to Highgarden?

517
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,478
OLYVAR: He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

518
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,980
Quite high on his thigh.

519
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,525
Wine-colored
and roughly the shape of Dorne.

520
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,486

The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

524
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,246
to bring a formal trial

525
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,457
for Ser Loras

526
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,376
and Queen Margaery.

527
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,752
What?

528
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:07,382
Bearing false witness before the gods
is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

529
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,883
Take her.

530
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,677
MARGAERY: No.

531
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,136
Tommen.

532
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,346
Tommen!

533
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,100
You can't do this. I am the queen.

534
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,811
Tommen! Tommen!

535
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,898
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

541
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,934
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

542
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,327
You're so beautiful,

543

but you need to keep him happy.

You don't want to end up like...

546
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,967
Well, like the others.

547
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,470
What others?

548
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,971
I shouldn't gossip.

549
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,474
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

550
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,226
No point hiding anymore.

What others?

552
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:48,691
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

553
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,277
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

554
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,782
But she talked and talked and talked,

555
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,077
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

556
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,412
Then there was Violet.

557
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,123
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

558
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,085
But she got pregnant.

559
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,004
And, well, that was boring.

560
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,758
Then Tansy.

561
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,635
Such a sweet girl.

562
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:20,681
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

563
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,725
after a while, don't they?

564
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,186
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

565
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,479
Hunt?

566
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,730
Mmm.

567
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,861

after the dogs have been at it?

Not so pretty.

569
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,202
But, well, it's your wedding day.

570
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,330
Why am I talking about such things?

571
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,292
What was your name again?

572
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,877
Myranda.

573
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,882
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

574

Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

No.

Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

586
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,176
I'm not touching you.

587

Please.

Lying to your husband on his wedding night,
