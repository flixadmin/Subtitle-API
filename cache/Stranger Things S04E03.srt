
419
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,729
What is this, American?

420
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,816
What is taking you this long?
Are you tired today?

421
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,901
Pig.

422
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,070
What do you say?

423
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,488
Asshole!

464
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,378
Antonov!

465
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,341
Finish with your American toy,
we need him on the tracks.

466
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,469
Yes, yes.
I am just putting him in his place.

468
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,435
Nosy bastard.

657
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,934
One person, one piece.
Don't you understand?!

658
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,980
I said one piece per person!

663
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,668
I am no fairy.

664
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,878
No, no.

665
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,463
You…

666
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,633
...hit.

667
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,927
You…

668
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,720
...hit.

669
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,432
I give bread.

670
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,189
I will break your leg.

672
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,069
You…

673
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,570
...hit.

674
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,366
I give bread.

676
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,452
And soup.

679
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,550
Crazy American.

682
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,316
Now.

686
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,207
Again.

881
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,368
Next!

882
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,043
Next prisoner!
