00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,069
Um, you see this?

161
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,679
This is her prefrontal cortex,

162
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,638
and it houses
all of her short-term memories,

163
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:48,729
and as you can see, hers has
been completely wiped.

164
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:51,732
And this is the subconscious.
That's where we are.

165
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,516
It's kind of like a stronghold.

166
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,126
It's buried so deep it was able

167
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,694
to be protected
when she melted down.

168
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,740
- What's--what's going on here?

169
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,916
- That is Gideon's
long-term memories.

170
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,657
Now, while everything else
was being erased,

171
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,311
she was able to hold on
to a few moments.

172
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:09,445
Problem is, she can't
access them on her own.

173
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,580
- All right, well, what happens
if you just wake her up?

174
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:16,234
- Without her memories. Heh.

175
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,193
Well, it would be
like a factory reset.

176
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:21,109
She'd be back to who she was
before she knew any of us.

177
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,719
- But she'd still be
a supercomputer.

178
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,895
- Well, sure, she'd have
her basic functions

179
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,984
and her knowledge
of the timeline,

180
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,899
and that's all built-in,
but her personality--

181
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,553
- So she'd have all
the information,

182
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,033
but none of
the annoying human bits?

183
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,600
That's perfect. Let's do it.

184
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,166
- No. No. Don't do it.

185
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,603
- We have to get out of here,
Spooner.

186
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:37,995
We have to save the team.

187
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,781
- Not without Gideon.
Our Gideon.

188
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,959
How do we bring her back?

189
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,743
- Well, these key memories
are all we've got.

190
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:50,225
So I guess the only place
to start is helping her

191
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:54,055
access those
by visiting them with her.

192
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:56,536
- So you're gonna send us
inside Gideon's head,

193
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,886
even though we're already
inside Gideon's head.

194
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,235
- Yeah.
- There's a reason

195
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:01,758
why I skip
Christopher Nolan movies.

196
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:02,759
Let's just not
overthink things.

197
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,021
- Yeah, okay.

198
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,632
Just tell us
what you need us to do.

199
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:10,071
- Well, I would suggest that
we start with a recent memory.

200
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,290
This one is from a year ago.

201
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,249
Right, I'd suggest that
you hold on to something.

202
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:18,166
- Wait!

203
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,560
- What?

204
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,605
Is that me? What?

205
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,999
What the hell?
Now I'm in a coma?

206
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,827
- No, you're
in Gideon's memory.

207
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,698
I thought I explained that.

208
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:32,833
- This must be the night that
we kidnapped--recruited you.

209
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,705
- Why don't I remember this?

210
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:39,622
- Gideon.
- Who are you?

211
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,841
- She doesn't remember us, Jax.

212
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,451
<i>- Are you always
this impatient?</i>

213
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:45,236
<i>She has to experience
the key memory first.</i>

214
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,196
- Ava. Oh, so good to see you.

215
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,372
- She can't see us, obviously.

216
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:51,982
- How's our patient
doing today, Gideon?

217
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,810
<i>- The dart that Mr. Rory
shot her with</i>

218
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,682
<i>should wear off at any moment.</i>

219
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,161
- Come on, Gideon.

220
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,555
There must be a reason
you held on to this one.

221
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,861
Remember.

222
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,388
- I remember what happened now.

223
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,610
Would you like me to administer
additional sedation?

224
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,046
-
I don't know.

225
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,656
Honestly, Gideon,
I don't know what I'm doing.

226
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,266
Kidnapping people from history,

227
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,269
it goes against everything
I was ever taught.

228
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,228
- It's working.

229
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,708
- Ever since Sara
was kidnapped,

230
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,797
I feel like
I'm just grasping at straws,

231
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,017
but this might be
the last straw.

232
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,584
- And I didn't want to say
anything,

233
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,804
but the odds that
a paranoid alien enthusiast

234
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,327
with a love of firearms...

235
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,894
- Yes, I know
what the odds are, Gideon.

236
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:36,244
But if there's a one
in a billion chance

237
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,724
that this person
can help me find Sara,

238
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,203
I have to take it.

239
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,552
And I know it doesn't
make any sense,

240
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:43,120
but love isn't logical.

241
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:49,083
- I actually understand.

242
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,693
- You do?

243
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,695
- I really miss Sara too.

244
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:58,832
- Stop it, Gideon.
You're gonna make me cry.

245
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,442
Thanks, Gideon.

246
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,662
Let's wake her up, huh?

247
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,842
- Gideon.

248
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,801
- Ms. Cruz. Ms. Logue.
You're here.

249
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:12,759
- You remember us.

250
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,325
- I safeguarded that memory

251
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,110
because it's when
Captain Sharpe convinced me

252
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:19,156
to prioritize love over logic,
which is how I met you.

253
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,464
- Hey, guys, when you accessed
her key memory,

254
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:25,510
the other memories
around it started repopulating.

255
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,773
-
Oh!

256
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,426
- Hey, Jax. You fancy a cuppa?

257
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,037
- Always time for a cuppa,
Gideon.

258
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,735
- Now is clearly not
the time for tea.

259
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,825
Can we get out of here?
- Well, not yet. Not exactly.

260
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,609
You only got one key memory.

261
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:40,090
You still have
to recover the others.

262
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:43,006
- The others. Right.

263
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,965
I held onto these memories
because of the moments

264
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,880
that made me who I am.

265
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,577
I still can't recall
what's in them.

266
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,970
- Well, if you do want
to restore them,

267
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,406
you're gonna have to go back.

268
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,931
You're all going to have
to go way back.

269
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,759
Get ready to meet the OGs.

270
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:00,763
<i>♪</i>

271
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,810
- Oh, breakfast.

272
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,334
The most important meal
of the day.

273
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:13,341
- Mmm, just how I like 'em.
Poached.

274
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,777
- Those are mine.

275
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,868
- Did I mention I'm a thief?
- No time for breakfast.

276
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,261
- What the hell?

277
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:24,265
- We must avenge the death
of my son and Rip's son.

278
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,440
I think.

279
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:28,791
- Which one of you threw that?
Huh? You?

280
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:29,792
- Who are these guys?

281
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,185
- Wish I knew.

282
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:32,621
- And what is Sara wearing?

283
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,449
- Oh, you got some egg
on your suit.

284
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,451
- White suede?
That's gonna stain.

285
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,192
- Let me just dab
some soda water.

286
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,890
- If you dab me,
I will break your arm.

287
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,197
- Captain had a real attitude
back in the day.

288
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,808
- Go easy on the Ken doll.

289
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:49,769
- It's Big Bird's fault.

290
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:50,813
- Big Bird?

291
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,510
- Sticks and stones.

292
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,863
- You're almost
at the key memory.

293
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,603
Time to do your thing, Gideon.

294
00:12:58,647 --> 00:12:59,953
- Seriously, guys.

295
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,693
How are we ever gonna
defeat Vandal Savage

296
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,130
if we can't even get
through breakfast

297
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,696
without killing each other?

298
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,829
- Hey, come on, let them fight,
boy scout.

299
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,963
- Boy scout?

300
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,051
Don't make me shrink you.

301
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,314
- Come on, Raymond!

302
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,533
- I remember these nutters now.

303
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,363
Put your weapons down
or I'll open an airlock

304
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:22,149
and blast you all into
the Temporal Zone, understood?

305
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,370
- Yes, ma'am.
- Won't happen again.

306
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:31,071
- I got to say, Gideon,
you run a tight ship.

307
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,855
- Oh, that's
Captain Hunter's job.

308
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,074
I'm not in charge here.

309
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:36,598
- Guy's got his work
cut out for him.

310
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,427
I don't know why you choose
to captain a team like this.

311
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,999
- Ah.
- I remember them all now.

312
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:49,350
Hawkman. Vandal Savage.

313
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,526
- You sure that's a good thing?

314
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:53,658
- I know the Legends
can be a batty bunch,

315
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:57,184
but they're my friends.

316
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:58,925
And I wouldn't be me

317
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,754
Jax, can we see another?

318
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,104

00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:05,888
Oh, you're gonna enjoy this.

320
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,890
Time to see an old friend.

321
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,293

kind of just, you know,

00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,529
cool it with the show tunes?

327
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,531
The ship hasn't been the same
since Gorilla Grodd

328
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,751
tried to dry hump it in 'Nam.

but I just can't.

the whole granddad thing, huh?

333
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:55,155
- Yeah.
I suppose I am tripping.

334
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:57,984
I had Gideon fabricate this.

Guys, I think I know

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,828

366
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,221
Can you read us, Jax?

367
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,270
Know what?
The Legends are lucky.

368
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,923
At least they're gonna die.

369
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,317
We are stuck in your stupid
brain forever.

370
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,319
- Look, it ain't
Gideon's fault.

371
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:59,148
Okay, not this Gideon.
Blue Gideon's a big old bitch.

372
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,671
- I remember what happened now.

373
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,151
The countryside,
the sun in my eyes,

374
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,674
the smell of rhubarb.

375
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,459
You told me to decide,
but there was no right answer,

376
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,809
and it was like I was being
pulled in every direction.

377
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:10,855
That's when I blacked out.
When she attacked.

378
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,074
- What are you doing?

379
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,423
- Just because we are stuck
in her brain

380
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,121
doesn't mean
I can't pickle mine.

381
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,256
- I recall during this memory
that Dr. Palmer

382
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,302
had replaced all the ship's
alcohol with kombucha.

383
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:28,917
- Astra, I am not dying
in Gideon's brain!

384
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,180
- Wait!

385
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,008
I know how to get us
out of here.

386
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,618
- How?
- It's easy.

387
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:38,144
What we need is to summon a bit
of Dr. Palmer's ingenuity,

388
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,580
a touch of Captain Lance's
bravery,

389
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:42,104
and what would
any good Legends' plan be

390
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,845
without a dash of insanity?

391
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,805
Thanks to you two,
I've now remembered

392
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:48,980
all of those things.

393
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,113
- Are you sure
you can fly the ship?

394
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,810
- Don't be daft, darling.

395
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,769
Now that I've circumvented
that computer,

396
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,336
I've got no choice
but to pilot us back

397
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,207
to my subconscious manually.

398
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,122
Strap in.

You guys all right?

- No, we're still on the ship.

But, uh, nice flying, Gideon.

408

What does it want?

409
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,067
What did it mean
it wanted to protect me?

410
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,591
- Look, all I know is that
it wants to take you from us,

411
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,289
but we ain't
letting that happen.

412
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,812
You sure this can
kill the virus?

413
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,206
- Yeah, but now that it knows
that we're hunting it,

414
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,773
it's going to do its utmost
to stay hidden

415
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,514
and try and get the drop
on y'all.

416
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:30,343
So if anything or anyone
in those memories

417
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,432
feels different, you blast it.

418
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:34,216
- What happens if we blast
the wrong Legend?

419
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,609
- Well, Gideon
may lose a memory

420
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,785
that she can never get back.

421
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:40,440
- Uh, Gideon, kill the virus,
reboot Gideon,

422
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:42,442
get back on the road,
save the Legends.

423
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,270
- What could be more simple?

424
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,706
- Always hoped I'd get to go

425
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,577
on a Legends mission
in real life.

426
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,318
Always hoped it'd be
one of the westerns,

427
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:51,973
but this is fun too.

428
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:56,412
- This virus is digging deep.
Real deep.

429

Give my best to Rip, will you?

430
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:04,812
- Good morning, Legends.

431
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:08,119
- Rip Hunter. My first captain.

432
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:09,686
- Another Brit?

433
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,648
- Wakey, wakey, Legends.

434
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:17,259
- Don't you look chipper.

435
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,696
- I trust you all slept well.

436
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,873
- Slept like a bug in a rug.

437
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,919
Except my allergies
seem to be acting up.

438
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,486
- Yes, probably
the bird dander.

439
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:27,530
- I don't have dander.

440
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:28,879
- Where would one
brush his teeth?

441
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,359
- Yeah, I could use a shower.

442
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:31,926
- Uh, I believe
my partner in crime

443
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,276
was using your decorative urn
as a bedpan

444
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,975
before passing out, just FYI.

445
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,716
- Okay, gang,
important announcement.

446
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,283
-
Oh, man.

447
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:44,895
The OGs are going to freak
when they hear this next part.

448
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,985
- You're not gonna like this,
but remember, you are Legends.

449
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,205
You were chosen because
you are each uniquely suited

450
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:55,210
to the most important mission
time has ever known.

451
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,299
- The announcement, Captain.

452
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:01,390
- There is only one lavatory
on the ship.

453
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:04,437
- What?
- One bathroom?

454
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,960
- Whoa!
- It's the virus!

455
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:07,788
- That's just Hawkman
being Hawkman.

456
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:11,661
- Hey, stop flapping
around, man.

457
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,315
Hey, you said we're Legends.

458
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,709
But right now, it just feels
like we're your prisoners, man.

459
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,320
- It's a flying
Stanford Prison Experiment.

460
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:19,930
- I apologize, but the ship

461
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:21,889
was only built
for Gideon and myself.

462
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:24,065
- I don't give a damn
about your bathroom.

463
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,154
Oh, but I do care
that you kidnapped me.

464
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,851
I never asked to be
more than a thief.

465
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,810
Never wanted a team.
- Okay. Okay.

466
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,507
Uh, what we need right now

467
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,379
are some
team-building exercises.

468
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:35,206
And a bathroom sign-up sheet.

469
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,820
- Don't shoot.
That's just Captain Cold.

470
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,430
- I do not appreciate
being shot at.

471
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:44,825
I'll have you know I was a CEO
of a billion-dollar company.

472
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:45,913
- You think that's
supposed to make us

473
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,524
