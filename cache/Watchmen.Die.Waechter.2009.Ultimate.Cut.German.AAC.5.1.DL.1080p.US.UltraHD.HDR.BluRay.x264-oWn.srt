1
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,941
Wrong, as usual.

2
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,236
The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe...

3
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:31,824
...proves that the Soviet Union's aggression
at the Afghan border...

4
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:35,161
...will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.

5
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:42,543
The Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises...

6
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,963
...conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering Sea...

7
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,051
...just 1500 miles
off the southern coast of Alaska.

8
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:54,597
President Richard Nixon
issued this warning to the Soviets:

9
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:58,267
The United States does not start fights.

10
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:02,104
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

11
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:05,066
...in order to maintain peace...

12
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:08,986
...so any adversary
should ask themselves:

13
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:12,198
"Do the consequences
of attacking America...

14
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,992
...outweigh the potential benefits?"

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,828
As a result of the Soviet activity...

16
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,790
...the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists...

17
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:26,337
...moved the Doomsday Clock
up to five minutes until midnight:

18
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:30,841
destruction by nuclear war.

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,219
Question:

20
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:36,013
On a scale of zero to 10,
zero meaning impossibility...

21
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:38,516
...10 meaning
complete metaphysical certitude...

22
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:43,187
...what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

23
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:44,688
Pat Buchanan.

24
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,190
Zero.

25
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,984
The Soviets
would never risk going to war...

26
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:52,988
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent
on our side.

27
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,616
You're referring, of course,
to Dr. Manhattan...

28
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:59,870
...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.

29
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,790
Well, it hasn't
stopped the Soviet Union...

30
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:07,628
...from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.

31
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:09,505
You don't think it's just posturing?

32
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,257
Maybe the reason
why the Soviets...

33
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,968
...are doing these bomb tests...

34
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:18,514
...is because they feel threatened
by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.

35
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,226
Maybe the whole world feels like that.

36
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,689
Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters-

37
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:05,769
Just a matter of time, I suppose.

38
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:40,030
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

39
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,950
Mother, forgive me.

40
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,693
I was a hero, goddamn it!

41
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:52,282
- an act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon...

42
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,787
...that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace.

43
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:36,618
Fuck you, pigs!

44
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,860
Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.

45
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,825
Get out of here, vigilantes!

46
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,710
No!

47
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:38,870
Edward Blake. Sixty-seven years old.

48
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,580
Six-two, a solid 225.

49
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,162
Guy was built like a linebacker.

50
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,248
Yeah, I saw the body.

51
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,458
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

52
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:51,294
You mean apart from being dead?

53
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,047
That's plate glass.

54
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:57,134
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

55
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,344
Had to have been thrown.

56
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:00,721
Check the bedroom?

57
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,807
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

58
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:07,060
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

59
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,687
Or made to look like one.

60
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,647
See this?

61
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,151
- Shaking hands with the president.
Whoa.

62
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,570
Think Blake was a spook?

63
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:20,407
Government or black ops?

64
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,617
I think...

65
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,204
...this is way bigger than both of us.

66
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:34,629
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

67
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:39,885
Dog carcass in alley this morning.
Tire tread on burst stomach.

68
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,387
This city's afraid of me.

69
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:46,516
I've seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters...

70
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,561
...and the gutters are full of blood.

71
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:52,189
And when the drains finally scab over...

72
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,525
...all the vermin will drown.

73
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,528
The accumulated filth of all their sex
and murder...

74
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,031
...will foam up around their waists...

75
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,661
...and all the whores and politicians
will look up and shout, "Save us."

76
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:11,249
And I'll whisper, "No."

77
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:15,629
Now the whole world
stands on the brink...

78
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:18,298
...staring down into bloody hell.

79
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:22,010
All those liberals and intellectuals...

80
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,179
...and smooth talkers...

81
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:27,808
...and all of a sudden,
nobody can think of anything to say.

82
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,144
Beneath me, this awful city.

83
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:35,065
It screams like an abattoir
full of retarded children...

84
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:39,903
...and the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.

85
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,934
Huh.

86
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,613
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.

87
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,156
Somebody knows why.

88
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,700
Somebody knows.

89
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,499
No, I definitely heard something.

90
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,129
Watch the door.

91
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:47,989
Shh.

92
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,409
Must've been the wind. Next time you-

93
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,750
It all started with the gangs.

94
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,350
You know, people tend to forget that.

95
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,933
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

96
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,727
dress up and pull heists.

97
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:22,107
As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

98
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:26,111
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

99
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,571
So a few of us cops, we get together...

100
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,075
...and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

101
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,953
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

102
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,791
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it...

103
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,628
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

104
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:47,298
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...

105
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:50,844
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...

106
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:54,222
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.

107
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,934
Oh, don't get me started on him.

108
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:04,107
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

109
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,151
I think you were trying to make a point.

110
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,890
Well, my point is

111
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,140
that we had it too easy.

112
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,290
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys

113
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:17,537
You guys who picked up where we left off.
- with Nixon forcing you out.

114
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:23,043
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

115
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,962
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

116
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:32,552
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

117
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,722
Truth?

118
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,143
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

119
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:44,022
- Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
- Hey.

120
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,482
Watch it with the language.

121
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,276
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis, remember?

122
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,905
The masked vigilante
known as Rorschach...

123
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:54,908
...has assaulted a police officer
in the early-morning hours.

124
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,787
Rorschach is on the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list...

125
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,749
...for violation of the Keene Act,
which banned masked heroes six years ago.

126
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,168
Rorschach reportedly incapacitated...

127
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,129
Forced everyone out except him.

128
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:09,839
Oh, he'll quit.

129
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,341
When he's dead.

130
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,052
Next week?
Well...

131
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,848
...you know, you don't have to
keep humoring me like this.

132
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,184
If you got a hot date or something...

133
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:24,145
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

134
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,774
You ever miss it?

135
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,069
No. You?

136
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:33,446
Oh, heck, no.

137
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,533
Be seeing you.

138
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,608
Hello, Daniel.

139
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:53,443
Rorschach.

140
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,781
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

141
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,409
No, no. Course not.

142
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,580
You want me to heat those up for you?

143
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,290
Fine like this.

144
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,043
How have you been keeping?

145
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,216
Out of prison.

146
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,136
Heard about you on the news.

147
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,972
Say you attacked a cop.

148
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,934
Minor wound.
Won't need hospitalization.

149
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,977
Daniel...

150
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,437
...look at this.

151
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,820
Is this bean juice?
Human bean juice.

152
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:43,034
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

153
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,496
Let's talk downstairs.

154
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,173
It could have been a burglary.

155
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,051
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

156
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:04,973
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

157
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,978
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

158
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,314
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

159
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:16,401
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

160
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,860
Maybe.

161
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,281
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

162
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,533
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

163
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,286
That what they say about me now?

164
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:27,787
Paranoid?

165
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,790
Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

166
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,458
...even among his friends.

167
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,794
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

168
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,632
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

169
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,886
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

170
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:48,891
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

171
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,730
- You were never that sentimental.
- Attack on one is attack on all of us.

172
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:56,566
What do you suggest we do about it?

173
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,651
Retribution.

174
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,364
- Watchmen are over.
- Says Tricky Dick.

175
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,283
Says me.

176
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,537
Nobody knows who you are.

177
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,665
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

178
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,753
That what you have now?
A normal life?

179
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:21,090
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

180
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,759
...past the human cockroaches...

181
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,678
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

182
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,388
...do you really feel normal?

183
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,267
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

184
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,437
No.

185
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,232
You're hiding in plain sight.

186
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,778
Be seeing you, Dan.

187
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,739
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

188
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,616
Yeah, I remember.

189
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,870
Came here often,
when we were partners.

190
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,955
Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

191
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,667
- What happened?
- You quit.

192
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,317
Rorschach's journal.

193
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,820
First visit of evening fruitless.

194
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,114
Feel slightly depressed.

195
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,533
Soon there will be war.

196
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,286
Millions will perish
in sickness and misery.

197
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,997
Why does one death matter
against so many?

198
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:40,503
Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.

199
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,506
Even in the face of armageddon...

200
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:46,509
...I will not compromise in this.

201
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:50,555
But there are so many
deserving of retribution...

202
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,015
...and so little time.

203
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,217
Captain.

204
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,845
- Captain.
- Ridley.

205
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:34,015
Ridley, have you seen
any other survivors?

206
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,224
No, sir.

207
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:39,854
Captain, my foot is caught
in some of the wreckage.

208
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:43,399
- It's pulling me under.
- Hold on.

209
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,570
Ridley.

210
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:01,125
Ridley. Ridley.

211
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,085
No.

212
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,754
No.

213
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,381
More blood, more blood, more blood.

214
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,051
Delirious from nearly drowning, I saw it.

215
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,596
The Black Freighter.

216
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:19,185
The hell-bound ship's black sails
against the yellow Indies sky.

217
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:25,691
I knew again the stench of powder
and men's brains and war.

218
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,613
More blood, more blood, more blood.

219
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,748
More blood, more blood, more blood.

220
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:48,673
The waves about me were scarlet...

221
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,842
...foaming, horribly warm
in the Freighter's wake.

222
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,179
In despair, I offered my weathered soul
to almighty God...

223
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,849
...his mercy and his judgment.

224
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,978
Heh. What do you think, kid?

225
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,273
We ought to nuke Russia
and let God sort it out.

226
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,484
Or at the very least,
send Dr. Manhattan over for a visit.

227
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,152
You know what I'm saying?

228
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,239
I mean, I ain't trying to be an asshole
or anything, but they're the ones...

229
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,908
...who are agitating us.
Now this is just my opinion.

230
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,495
But I'm a news vendor, you know,
so I am informed.

231
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,666
Yeah, I know. The New Frontiersman.
Well, it's not here yet.

232
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,668
I'd appreciate if you didn't
stand around waiting...

233
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,337
...because I don't know when
it's going to be here.

234
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,506
I thought you said you was informed.

235
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,636
- Are you gonna buy that?
- No.

236
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:41,350
Oh, Jesus.
Just try again tomorrow, okay?

237
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:52,820
Mr. Veidt...

238
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,114
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

239
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,700
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

240
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,702
...the first being Hollis Mason.

241
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,872
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

242
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,294
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

243
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,547
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

244
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,758
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

245
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:18,137
- I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
I'm sorry. Do you think-

246
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,890
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

247
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,768
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

248
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,979
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

249
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,149
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

250
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,902
...sells more magazines.

251
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:38,199
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

252
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,285
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

253
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,705
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

254
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:47,875
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

255
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,461
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

256
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:54,048
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

257
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,718
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

258
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:01,764
But if we make resources infinite...

259
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,058
...ah...

260
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,310
...we make war obsolete.

261
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:10,981
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

262
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,859
...wherever they may be.

263
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,321
Thanks for your time.

264
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,247
- You look good, Adrian.
- Dan.

265
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:28,624
It's been too long.

266
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:34,463
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

267
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,966
You think it's possible?

268
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:39,885
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

269
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,972
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

270
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,976
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

271
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,854
You know that better than anyone.

272
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:52,231
I'm not here because I miss him.

273
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,733
It's occurred to Rorschach...

274
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,861
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

275
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,488
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

276
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,700
That's why I'm warning you first.

277
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:08,330
Thank you, Dan...

278
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,711
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

279
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,505
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

280
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:22,511
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

281
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,348
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

282
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,685
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

283
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:34,064
...the 1 percent that get through could
still kill every living thing on Earth.

284
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,195
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

285
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:59,048
Rorschach's journal,
October 13th, 1985...

286
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:01,550
...8:30 p.m.

287
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,180
Meeting with Dreiberg
left bad taste in mouth.

288
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:10,434
A flabby failure who sits
whimpering in his basement.

289
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,563
Why are so few of us left active...

290
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:19,610
...healthy and without
personality disorders?

291
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:23,030
The first Nite Owl
runs an auto-repair shop.

292
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,575
The first Silk Spectre
is a bloated, aging whore...

293
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:29,620
...dying in a California rest resort.

294
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:32,414
Dollar Bill got his cape stuck
in a revolving door...

295
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,083
...where he got gunned down.

296
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:37,127
Silhouette, murdered...

297
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,422
...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.

298
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,968
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.

299
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:52,184
Even Adrian Veidt, possible homosexual.

300
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,854
Must investigate further.

301
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,773
Only two names remain on my list.

302
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:03,445
Both share private quarters
at Rockefeller Military Research Center.

303
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,948
I shall go to them.

304
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:11,620
I shall go tell the indestructible man
that someone plans to murder him.

305
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,248
Good evening, Rorschach.

306
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,918
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

307
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,503
Yes...

308
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,756
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

309
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:26,635
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

310
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,013
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

311
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,265
I have a real name I've been using.

312
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,474
Try it.

313
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,727
Whatever you say, Laurie.

314
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,145
What are you doing here?

315
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,647
The Comedian is dead.

316
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,900
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

317
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,694
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

318
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,989
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

319
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,036
Even if I wanted to help...

320
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,540
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

321
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:01,003
- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference? Caused by what?

322
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,590
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

323
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:09,428
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

324
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:13,599
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

325
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:18,729
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

326
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,691
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

327
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,902
I must return to my work.

328
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,195
Wait a minute.

329
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,864
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

330
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,283
So we can't do anything to stop it?

331
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,285
Goodbye, Rorschach.

332
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,704
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

333
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,206
I'm not leaving-

334
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,834
till I've had my say.

335
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:51,261
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

336
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,139
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

337
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,727
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

338
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,980
But you always say time is simultaneous.

339
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,566
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

340
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:09,738
If only you could perceive time as I do.

341
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,156
Please let me show you.

342
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:22,084
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

343
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:25,295
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

344
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,923
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

345
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,843
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

346
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:35,180
- It was a mistake. One time.
- Man tries to rape you-

347
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,849
Stop!

348
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,101
Your mind goes to dark places...

349
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,603
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

350
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:48,944
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

351
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,532
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

352
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,411
...like we used to...

353
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,955
...but you won't.

354
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:03,000
You know I can't.

355
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,921
So you'll call Dan...

356
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,549
...which is only natural.

357
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:13,469
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

358
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,338
Dan Dreiberg's table.

359
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:14,238
Did you know that
he and H.J. were-? I had no idea.

360
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,825
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

361
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,493
Captain Carnage.

362
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,871
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

363
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,415
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

364
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,627
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

365
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,588
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

366
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,383
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

367
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,970
God, whatever happened to him?

368
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,305
Oh. Um...
He pulled that on Rorschach...

369
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,891
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

370
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:51,733
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

371
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,945
- It's a little funny.
- Yep.

372
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,824
I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

373
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,951
It's really good to see you again.

374
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,745
It's great seeing you too.

375
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:07,082
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

376
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:11,545
- No one else would.
- Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

377
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,798
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

378
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,926
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

379
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:20,554
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

380
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,725
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

381
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:28,979
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

382
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,441
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

383
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,279
What?

384
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,743
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

385
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,621
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

386
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,581
Soon.

387
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,793
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

388
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:55,005
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

389
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:57,966
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

390
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,387
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

391
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,765
Everyone.

392
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,518
I can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

393
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,729
...or if he's just pretending.

394
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:14,358
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

395
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,114
Hold on, I'll get the door.

396
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,243
Thanks, Dan.

397
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,662
- Got it?
- Yeah.

398
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:35,045
You always get
a government escort to dinner?

399
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:39,841
They're making sure I don't do anything to
upset the country's most powerful weapon.

400
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:42,844
I'm sorry.

401
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:46,890
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

402
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,644
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

403
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:54,606
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

404
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:41,713
Laurie? Is that you?

405
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,386
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

406
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:52,057
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

407
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:55,102
Well, it beats flying coach.

408
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,479
Margarita?

409
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:59,856
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

410
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,027
Mm.

411
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,988
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

412
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:10,659
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana bible.

413
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:14,996
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

414
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:19,209
- He sent you this?
- Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

415
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,711
Mother, this is gross.

416
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:24,172
I think it's kind of flattering.

417
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,591
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

418
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:32,013
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

419
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:35,016
I saw it in the paper.

420
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:38,603
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

421
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:43,400
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

422
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,695
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

423
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:48,947
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

424
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:51,658
You don't know.

425
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,577
Things change.

426
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:57,205
What happened happened 40 years ago.

427
00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:00,625
I'm 67 years old.

428
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:05,005
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

429
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,008
But the past...

430
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,511
...even the grimy parts of it...

431
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:14,681
...keep on getting brighter.

432
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:23,023
I've got spots in my eyes.

433
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:29,154
Stop it, Eddie.

434
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:33,492
- Thank you, Weegee.
- Thank you, Mr. Owl.

435
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:37,913
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

436
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,249
- Little place on 21st.
- Sounds good.

437
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:46,004
Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

438
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:51,510
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

439
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,027
Eddie.

440
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:14,157
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

441
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:15,951
Sure I did.

442
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:19,162
Come on, baby.

443
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,623
I know what you need.

444
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:25,835
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

445
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:28,296
I said no, Eddie.

446
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:33,843
- No spelled Y-E-S.
- No spelled N-O.

447
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:37,472
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.

448
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:42,978
Eddie...

449
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:26,563
You little bastard.

450
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,195
This what you like?

451
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:36,865
- This what makes you hot?
- What?

452
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:50,545
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

453
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:54,841
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

454
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:58,845
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

455
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:03,683
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

456
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:07,270
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

457
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:11,232
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

458
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,987
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty...

459
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:19,240
...O holy and merciful savior.

460
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:22,619
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

461
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:26,122
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any-

462
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:55,503
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

463
00:45:55,671 --> 00:46:00,425
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

464
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:03,928
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

465
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:09,058
...I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.

466
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:13,521
But we didn't, thanks to you.

467
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:17,442
You sound bitter.

468
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,277
Me? Bitter?

469
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:22,530
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

470
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:30,705
Oh, Jesus Christ.

471
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:33,875
- Mr. Eddie?
- Just what I fucking needed.

472
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:39,088
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

473
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:43,384
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

474
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,886
I'm gonna forget about you...

475
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:47,889
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

476
00:46:48,474 --> 00:46:49,641
Get the fuck out of here.

477
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:53,228
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here.

478
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,771
You will remember.

479
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:59,275
You will remember me and my country...

480
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:01,778
...forever!

481
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:06,241
My face!

482
00:47:08,452 --> 00:47:09,619
Blake. Don't.

483
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:11,746
Blake!

484
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:21,089
She was pregnant...

485
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:24,092
...and you gunned her down.

486
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,552
That's right...

487
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:27,637
...and you know what? You watched me.

488
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:30,807
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

489
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:34,602
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

490
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:39,357
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

491
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:43,361
You're drifting out of touch, doc.

492
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:47,115
God help us all.

493
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:50,451
Medic!

494
00:47:57,293 --> 00:48:00,461
Most holy and merciful savior.

495
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,301
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

496
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:10,638
In the midst of life, we are in death.

497
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:15,143
Of whom may we seek succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

498
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:22,609
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

499
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:24,861
We're waiting for one more.

500
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:39,000
I told you, you wouldn't be
the only one dressed up.

501
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:42,003
Welcome, doctor.

502
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:44,088
Now we can start.

503
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:48,092
Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves
with this map of high-crime areas.

504
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,595
This is all bullshit.

505
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:55,767
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.

506
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:59,354
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

507
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,315
It didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

508
00:49:02,483 --> 00:49:04,609
...because you wanna play
cowboys and Indians.

509
00:49:04,777 --> 00:49:07,153
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

510
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:12,700
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

511
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:17,205
A group this size seems like a publicity
stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

512
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:19,165
We can do so much more.

513
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,542
We can save this world...

514
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:26,297
- ...with the right leadership.
- Yeah.

515
00:49:28,676 --> 00:49:30,426
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

516
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:33,388
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

517
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:36,224
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

518
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:40,228
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

519
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:41,896
You people.

520
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:45,566
You hear Moloch's back in town,
get your panties all in a bunch.

521
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,569
- You think catching him matters?
- Justice matters.

522
00:49:50,114 --> 00:49:51,948
Justice.

523
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,575
Justice is coming to all of us.

524
00:49:54,743 --> 00:49:56,244
No matter what the fuck we do.

525
00:49:56,954 --> 00:50:00,915
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

526
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:05,920
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

527
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:09,757
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

528
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:14,929
Then Ozymandias here...

529
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:18,224
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

530
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:29,193
For as much as it hath pleased...

531
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:34,323
...almighty God to take onto himself
the soul of our dear departed brother...

532
00:50:35,743 --> 00:50:39,787
...let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

533
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:43,458
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

534
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,670
Watchmen! Police!
Police to protect the people!

535
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:22,038
Attention, citizens.
We are trying to maintain order.

536
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:26,667
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

537
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:30,004
If you could-
Please, there's no need for violence.

538
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:35,051
We are trying to retain order on the streets
until the police strike is over.

539
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:37,428
Crawl back in your holes
before you get hurt.

540
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:39,764
- I got rubber bullets.
I want my rights!

541
00:51:39,932 --> 00:51:42,558
- You are not the law!
We want regular cops!

542
00:51:42,726 --> 00:51:44,018
No more vigilantes!

543
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:47,730
My son's a police officer,
you fucking faggots!

544
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,151
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

545
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:05,540
There's no need for violence.

546
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,876
Fuck you. Fuck you!

547
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:16,843
Oh, this is getting heavy.

548
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:44,662
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

549
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,248
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

550
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,083
How long can we keep this up?

551
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:52,837
Congress is pushing through some new bill
that's gonna outlaw masks.

552
00:52:53,005 --> 00:52:54,255
Our days are numbered.

553
00:52:54,423 --> 00:52:58,718
We're society's only protection.

554
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:03,431
- From what?
- Are you kidding me? From themselves.

555
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,808
- Son of a bitch.
No, Comedian, wait!

556
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:09,270
Get your stinking hands off me.

557
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,900
What the hell happened to us?

558
00:53:18,197 --> 00:53:20,531
What happened to the American dream?

559
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:24,202
What happened to the American dream?

560
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,495
It came true!

561
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,706
You're looking at it.

562
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:32,621
Edgar William Jacobi.

563
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:36,625
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.
Also known as Moloch.

564
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,923
What are you talking about?

565
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:45,301
I'm a retired businessman-

566
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:50,431
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

567
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:52,641
I did my time.

568
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:55,603
I'm not Moloch anymore.

569
00:55:56,229 --> 00:56:00,649
- What do you want from me?
- Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

570
00:56:00,817 --> 00:56:04,278
I just felt I should...

571
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:08,366
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

572
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:15,581
- How'd you know he was the Comedian?
- He broke in here. A week ago.

573
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:18,084
He had his mask off.

574
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:22,046
- He was drunk.
- Enemies. For decades.

575
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:25,257
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.

576
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:28,344
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

577
00:56:28,512 --> 00:56:30,471
He was upset.

578
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:32,598
He was crying.

579
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,393
Crying? The Comedian?

580
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,562
He was babbling, not making any sense.

581
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,732
I was pissing in my pants.

582
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,193
I thought he was gonna kill me.

583
00:56:44,361 --> 00:56:46,654
What did he say?

584
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:49,615
It's a joke.

585
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:52,910
It's all a fucking joke.

586
00:56:54,955 --> 00:56:57,331
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

587
00:56:57,499 --> 00:57:00,543
I thought I knew how the world was.

588
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,338
I've done some bad things.

589
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:08,634
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

590
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:11,053
In 'Nam, you know.

591
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:13,055
But that was fucking war.

592
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:15,349
This...

593
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:18,686
I never done anything like this.

594
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:24,316
God, here I am...

595
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,569
...spilling my guts...

596
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,529
...to one of my archenemies.

597
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:33,033
But the truth is...

598
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,247
...you're the closest thing to a friend
I got. What the fuck does that say?

599
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:44,378
Shit.

600
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:47,548
And your name...

601
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:50,259
...your name was on the list...

602
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:54,763
...along with Janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

603
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:57,391
Manhattan's old girl.

604
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:03,731
Mother, forgive me.

605
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,567
And then he left.

606
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:12,198
I swear I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.

607
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:20,915
Funny story.

608
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,709
Sounds unbelievable.

609
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:26,420
Probably true.

610
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:29,256
So that's it?

611
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:33,594
- I'm clean?
- You?

612
00:58:34,763 --> 00:58:36,096
Clean?

613
00:58:41,061 --> 00:58:42,144
Amygdalin.

614
00:58:42,312 --> 00:58:45,022
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

615
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,442
- It's illegal.
- Come on.

616
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:52,613
Please don't confiscate that.

617
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:56,283
I'm trying anything.

618
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:59,245
I have cancer.

619
00:59:00,247 --> 00:59:01,580
What kind of cancer?

620
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,502
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

621
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:10,422
That ain't the kind I got.

622
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:17,638
Rorschach's journal. October 16th.

623
00:59:17,806 --> 00:59:20,641
Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.

624
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:23,602
- Thought about Moloch's story.
- Come on.

625
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,688
Could all be lies.

626
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:30,150
A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.

627
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:35,447
Fuck you. I make more in a week
than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

628
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:37,199
But if it's true...

629
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:39,660
...what could have possibly
scared the Comedian...

630
00:59:39,828 --> 00:59:41,662
...enough to cry in front of Moloch?

631
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,081
What was it he saw?

632
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:47,501
And that list he mentioned.

633
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:55,092
Edward Blake. The Comedian.

634
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,678
Born 1918.

635
00:59:57,846 --> 00:59:59,847
Buried in the rain.

636
01:00:00,015 --> 01:00:01,890
Murdered.

637
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:06,103
Is that what happens to us?
No time for friends?

638
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:10,190
Only our enemies leave roses.

639
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:13,402
Violent lives ending violently.

640
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:20,451
Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.

641
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:23,329
No matter how much you try
to dress it up...

642
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:25,623
...to disguise it...

643
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,917
...Blake saw society's true face.

644
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:33,714
Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.

645
01:00:33,882 --> 01:00:35,549
I heard joke once.

646
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:40,554
Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.

647
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:44,558
Life seems harsh and cruel.

648
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:48,604
Says he feels all alone
in threatening world.

649
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:51,565
Doctor says treatment is simple.

650
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:56,403
"The great clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him.

651
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,572
That should pick you up."

652
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:02,034
Man bursts into tears.

653
01:01:02,202 --> 01:01:06,538
"But doctor," he says. "I am Pagliacci."

654
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,250
Good joke.

655
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:12,419
Everybody laugh.

656
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:14,755
Roll on snare drum.

657
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:16,757
Curtains.

658
01:01:19,094 --> 01:01:20,511
Hey, Bernie.
Yeah?

659
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:22,763
Can I get a Time magazine
from you there?

660
01:01:22,931 --> 01:01:25,099
Sure.
- How much you want for it now?

661
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:26,517
For you, 2 bucks.

662
01:01:26,685 --> 01:01:29,269
Two bucks. Going up, huh?

663
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,939
There you go. Thanks.

664
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:33,732
Hey, I like your book.

665
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:37,653
Hey, thanks, Bernie. I appreciate it.

666
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:33,000
When I awoke,
I found myself upon a dismal beachhead...

667
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:34,543
...with my men.

668
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:38,046
Pieces of my men.

669
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:47,306
It was all I could do for her...

670
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:50,809
...though she had borne me
through seas of blood.

671
01:02:51,019 --> 01:02:55,355
Her damp embrace had prevented me
from drifting beyond reach.

672
01:02:55,523 --> 01:03:00,360
Yet this small comfort
was all I could offer.

673
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:12,331
One of my crew lay ahead.

674
01:03:12,499 --> 01:03:15,501
Birds were eating
his thoughts and memories.

675
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:16,919
Away. Yah!

676
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:18,712
Yah! Get away.

677
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:24,343
In hell, at least the gulls are contented.

678
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:30,015
For my part,
I begged that they should take my eyes.

679
01:03:30,183 --> 01:03:33,310
Thus sparing me future horrors.

680
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,233
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

681
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,026
Don't worry.

682
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:44,154
We've got plenty of time.

683
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:53,413
Your finger's like licking a battery.

684
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:16,478
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

685
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:17,980
Please don't be upset.

686
01:04:18,147 --> 01:04:21,817
I always thought you liked this.

687
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:23,402
No.

688
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:27,865
I don't- No.

689
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,535
I don't want that.

690
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:34,955
I don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

691
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:40,752
Look, I know you were just trying-

692
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:45,007
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

693
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:48,635
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

694
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:52,264
- I didn't think it was necessary to-
- To what?

695
01:04:52,432 --> 01:04:55,976
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

696
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:07,529
My attention was completely focused
on you.

697
01:05:08,156 --> 01:05:10,407
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

698
01:05:10,575 --> 01:05:12,826
...I am prepared to discuss it.

699
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:18,332
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

700
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:22,961
What am I to you?
Another puzzle to be solved?

701
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:26,840
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

702
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:30,594
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

703
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:40,979
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

704
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:48,987
He's all yours.

705
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:57,371
Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.

706
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:01,041
No, she won't.

707
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:19,726
He's been called
Hero, weapon...

708
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:22,688
...linchpin of our national security...

709
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:27,401
...deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.

710
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:30,278
Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...

711
01:06:30,446 --> 01:06:35,409
...will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview...

712
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:40,455
...brought to you commercial-free
by Veidt Enterprises.

713
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:56,596
Who is it?

714
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:58,724
It's Laurie.

715
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,863
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

716
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:15,490
I didn't know where else to go.

717
01:07:15,658 --> 01:07:18,827
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

718
01:07:26,294 --> 01:07:27,294
What's wrong?

719
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:30,255
I left Jon.

720
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:33,258
Oh, God.

721
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:35,469
I'm so sorry.

722
01:07:35,636 --> 01:07:38,472
I don't know why I'm here. I just...

723
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:42,476
I don't know anybody else.

724
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:46,605
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

725
01:07:47,148 --> 01:07:48,815
That's okay.

726
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,276
You probably just had an argument
or something.

727
01:07:51,444 --> 01:07:52,819
No, Dan.

728
01:07:53,321 --> 01:07:56,031
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

729
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:59,326
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

730
01:07:59,494 --> 01:08:01,995
...remember what they are.

731
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:04,498
It's like this world, this real world...

732
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:08,460
...to him,
it's like walking through mist.

733
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:12,172
And people are just shadows.

734
01:08:13,758 --> 01:08:16,259
Shadows in a fog.

735
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:20,722
God, how did everything
get so tangled up?

736
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:24,351
I'm sorry, Dan.

737
01:08:25,061 --> 01:08:28,063
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

738
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:31,525
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

739
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:35,195
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

740
01:08:35,363 --> 01:08:37,364
You're more than welcome to join.

741
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:41,868
In fact, I insist.

742
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,154
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

743
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:19,239
He just-
- We don't have time for makeup.

744
01:09:19,407 --> 01:09:21,700
That blue is too light for television.

745
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:26,454
Is that dark enough?

746
01:09:28,249 --> 01:09:31,168
Yeah, that's dark enough.

747
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:35,005
The weight of the world's on him,
but does he quit? No.

748
01:09:35,173 --> 01:09:37,424
News vendors always cope. They're the-

749
01:09:37,592 --> 01:09:41,178
Oh, God, here comes
that homeless guy again.

750
01:09:41,596 --> 01:09:44,431
I told you, this month's issue
still hasn't arrived yet.

751
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:48,268
Why do you care about that right-wing rag?
Those bastards don't give a damn.

752
01:09:49,604 --> 01:09:51,938
Hold up. Here they come.

753
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:58,236
- Seymour.
- Bernie, how's tricks?

754
01:09:58,404 --> 01:09:59,446
Fine, fine.

755
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:02,908
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

756
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:09,998
Maybe we should get a cab.
These are bad neighborhoods.

757
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:13,793
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

758
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,642
Girl.
What we got here?

759
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:31,686
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

760
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:34,648
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

761
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:37,192
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

762
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,071
- a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

763
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:46,993
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

764
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:51,456
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

765
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:52,958
Welcome.

766
01:10:57,964 --> 01:10:59,172
Thank you.

767
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,299
That's right.

768
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:10,642
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

769
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,227
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

770
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:15,105
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

771
01:11:15,273 --> 01:11:18,858
...analogizing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

772
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:22,195
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

773
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:25,532
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

774
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:28,618
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

775
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:31,371
My father was a watchmaker.

776
01:11:32,206 --> 01:11:36,543
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

777
01:11:37,712 --> 01:11:39,713
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

778
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,881
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

779
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:45,302
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

780
01:11:47,638 --> 01:11:49,389
So you're saying there is no danger.

781
01:11:49,557 --> 01:11:53,560
Even in a world without nuclear
weapons, there would still be danger.

782
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:01,401
And would you say, as so many claim...

783
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:03,320
...that you are, in fact, a god...

784
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:06,323
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

785
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,783
I can only see my own past...

786
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:13,121
...my own future. I am not omniscient.

787
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:15,081
Doug Roth, your question?

788
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:18,001
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

789
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:20,920
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

790
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:26,259
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

791
01:12:26,761 --> 01:12:28,303
He died of cancer.

792
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,431
- He was a good man.
How about Edgar Jacobi...

793
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:34,517
...also known as the supervillain Moloch?

794
01:12:35,478 --> 01:12:39,606
You encountered him several times
battles, conflicts.

795
01:12:39,774 --> 01:12:42,275
Did you know that he has cancer as well?

796
01:12:43,194 --> 01:12:44,444
I wasn't told.

797
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:46,821
And what about
General Anthony Randolph?

798
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:50,450
He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.

799
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:51,868
Cancer.

800
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:54,704
You're suggesting I was the cause.

801
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:58,124
From where I'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.

802
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,293
Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.

803
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:03,296
A live human body
and a deceased human body...

804
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:05,548
...have the same number of particles.

805
01:13:08,302 --> 01:13:10,178
Structurally, there's no difference.

806
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:13,598
All right. Let's settle down, please.

807
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,688
What about Janey Slater?

808
01:13:21,482 --> 01:13:23,817
You think it makes a difference to her?

809
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,194
Janey?

810
01:13:26,529 --> 01:13:28,113
Your ex-girlfriend?

811
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,908
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

812
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:33,618
Doug, one question at a time.

813
01:13:33,786 --> 01:13:37,163
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

814
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:39,165
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

815
01:13:54,682 --> 01:13:56,474
You were the world to me, Jon.

816
01:13:57,059 --> 01:13:59,310
You were my whole life.

817
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:02,856
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

818
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:04,691
Janey, I wasn't told.

819
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:10,530
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything.

820
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:17,245
This is how you repay me?

821
01:14:17,705 --> 01:14:22,584
- Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
- Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

822
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,752
Janey, wait.

823
01:14:26,172 --> 01:14:28,590
- That's it. This interview is over.
Get up there.

824
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:31,134
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

825
01:14:31,302 --> 01:14:35,013
Everybody back off.
I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

826
01:14:35,181 --> 01:14:35,930
Please,

827
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,580
if everyone would
just go away...

828
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,355
...and leave me alone...

829
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:45,899
Do you care to comment?

830
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:49,110
I said, leave me alone!

831
01:15:14,762 --> 01:15:16,638
Jesus.

832
01:15:17,765 --> 01:15:19,349
Us...

833
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:22,101
...getting mugged.

834
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:26,022
Let's go.

835
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:33,571
I'm shaking.

836
01:15:37,785 --> 01:15:39,536
You know what?

837
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:43,414
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.

838
01:15:43,582 --> 01:15:46,793
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna
come by Hollis' with me...

839
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:49,212
...and shake off the adrenaline?

840
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:53,132
I think I've had enough hero stuff
for one night.

841
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:56,636
It helped having you listen.

842
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:58,680
Any time.

843
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,307
Take care, Dan.

844
01:16:02,101 --> 01:16:04,394
It's a rough world out there.

845
01:16:05,854 --> 01:16:07,063
Be seeing you.

846
01:16:13,404 --> 01:16:14,737
I thought of my family...

847
01:16:15,656 --> 01:16:17,949
...my wife, my daughters.

848
01:16:18,117 --> 01:16:20,118
Vulnerable, unsuspecting.

849
01:16:20,828 --> 01:16:24,247
Awaiting my return,
only to be met by damnation...

850
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:26,833
...bearing down upon them.

851
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,424
Hey!

852
01:16:34,592 --> 01:16:36,050
Over here!

853
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:38,177
Here!

854
01:16:44,018 --> 01:16:45,435
Ridley.

855
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:03,077
A sail.

856
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:06,039
Ridley had brought me a sail.

857
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:09,459
Perhaps this could be my route
back to Davidstown.

858
01:17:10,836 --> 01:17:15,048
Everything I loved, everything I lived for,
depended on my reaching home...

859
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:18,551
...in advance of that terrible Freighter.

860
01:17:28,103 --> 01:17:30,647
The morning sun found me
no less troubled.

861
01:17:32,316 --> 01:17:33,483
Further down the shore...

862
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:37,153
...some of my crew
had become inflated with gas.

863
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:39,030
Ugh!

864
01:17:42,618 --> 01:17:48,206
I shuddered at my own idea,
attempting to banish this repulsive notion.

865
01:17:55,589 --> 01:17:59,926
Even in death,
they sought to fulfill their duty...

866
01:18:00,094 --> 01:18:02,679
...making our vessel more buoyant.

867
01:18:03,097 --> 01:18:06,182
And I would do my duty to them
in returning them home.

868
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:13,147
Rudely jarring my men from eternal rest,
and laying them in the bed I prepared...

869
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:17,777
...I hoped my wife and daughters
might be tucked in by gentler hands...

870
01:18:17,945 --> 01:18:19,654
...when their turn came.

871
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:39,382
We shall get home together, my friend.

872
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:43,803
I waited for the tide.

873
01:18:44,638 --> 01:18:48,641
Then, embarking, headed east.

874
01:18:49,143 --> 01:18:51,811
East, across the night seas.

875
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:56,441
East, borne on the bodies
of murdered men.

876
01:18:57,359 --> 01:18:59,861
Hope can be a horrible thing.

877
01:20:04,635 --> 01:20:08,930
With the dawn came the gulls
looking for breakfast.

878
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:10,223
Ridley.

879
01:20:13,435 --> 01:20:14,477
Get out.

880
01:20:20,651 --> 01:20:23,945
I was reminded
that I, myself, had not eaten.

881
01:20:25,906 --> 01:20:30,034
I know it is unappetizing,
but it is all we have.

882
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:37,375
He's gone.

883
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:39,335
- He's gone!
Who's gone?

884
01:20:39,503 --> 01:20:41,587
- Dr. Manhattan.
What? What'd you say?

885
01:20:41,755 --> 01:20:45,007
Dr. Manhattan's gone. He's left us.

886
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:47,718
What? Gone where?

887
01:20:53,809 --> 01:20:54,934
You're late.

888
01:20:55,102 --> 01:20:58,229
Ah, I know. I know.
You won't believe what happened.

889
01:20:58,397 --> 01:21:01,190
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

890
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:03,067
Wait, what?

891
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:10,575
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

892
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:14,954
She's gonna know soon enough.
The whole world will know.

893
01:21:15,122 --> 01:21:17,874
I said, leave me alone!

894
01:21:27,718 --> 01:21:29,927
I am looking at the stars.

895
01:21:30,429 --> 01:21:32,430
They're so far away...

896
01:21:32,848 --> 01:21:35,516
...and their light takes so long
to reach us...

897
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:42,481
...all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.

898
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:49,906
It is July, 1959, and I am in love.

899
01:21:50,741 --> 01:21:52,408
That's great.

900
01:21:52,576 --> 01:21:54,201
- You can pick it up tomorrow.
- Okay.

901
01:21:54,369 --> 01:21:56,120
- Seventy-five cents.
- Okay, thank you.

902
01:21:56,288 --> 01:21:57,330
Thank you.

903
01:21:57,497 --> 01:21:59,440
Gosh, Jon, I wish he
gave us a little notice.

904
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:01,460
I'm sure I made a face.

905
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:06,839
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

906
01:22:10,761 --> 01:22:13,095
Her name is Janey Slater.

907
01:22:13,931 --> 01:22:16,599
She is a physicist, like me.

908
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:19,644
I am 30 years old.

909
01:22:24,358 --> 01:22:28,277
We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.

910
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:35,034
It is February 12th, 1981.

911
01:22:35,202 --> 01:22:38,955
Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.

912
01:22:55,931 --> 01:22:59,350
That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.

913
01:23:07,192 --> 01:23:10,194
A month from now,
the accident awaits me.

914
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:21,163
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

915
01:23:21,832 --> 01:23:24,083
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

916
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:31,882
I cross the room to the
Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.

917
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:39,765
When I get to the door...

918
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:42,727
...Wally is turning white.

919
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:46,939
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

920
01:23:48,316 --> 01:23:50,276
I am terrified.

921
01:23:50,444 --> 01:23:51,569
Jon?

922
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,576
I'm sorry, Jon...

923
01:24:00,495 --> 01:24:02,079
...but I can't-

924
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:05,875
Janey, don't leave me!

925
01:24:06,418 --> 01:24:08,419
Don't leave me!

926
01:24:40,452 --> 01:24:45,206
It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.

927
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:47,833
She buys me a beer...

928
01:24:48,043 --> 01:24:50,878
...the first time a woman
has done this for me.

929
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:56,092
As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...

930
01:24:56,718 --> 01:24:57,968
...our fingers touch.

931
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:13,025
Yes, Jon, good.

932
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:18,697
Now it's just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

933
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:23,619
I feel fear...

934
01:25:24,871 --> 01:25:26,997
...for the last time.

935
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:46,225
A token funeral is held.

936
01:25:46,393 --> 01:25:48,561
There is nothing to bury.

937
01:25:48,728 --> 01:25:51,355
Janey frames the snapshot.

938
01:25:51,565 --> 01:25:54,692
It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.

939
01:25:55,986 --> 01:26:00,865
A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.

940
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:02,741
A few days later...

941
01:26:02,909 --> 01:26:06,120
...a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...

942
01:26:06,288 --> 01:26:10,124
...and screams for a moment
before vanishing.

943
01:26:35,483 --> 01:26:37,526
Oh, God.

944
01:26:37,694 --> 01:26:39,236
Jon?

945
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,114
Is that you?

946
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:45,784
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

947
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:48,621
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

948
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:52,833
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

949
01:26:59,216 --> 01:27:01,800
They call me Dr. Manhattan.

950
01:27:04,137 --> 01:27:06,096
They explain the name
has been chosen...

951
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:10,476
...for the ominous associations
it will raise in America's enemies.

952
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:18,442
The marketing boys say I need a logo.

953
01:27:27,244 --> 01:27:29,620
If I'm to have a symbol...

954
01:27:31,581 --> 01:27:34,208
...it shall be one I respect.

955
01:27:44,261 --> 01:27:47,304
They are shaping me
into something gaudy...

956
01:27:48,348 --> 01:27:50,516
...something lethal.

957
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:57,856
In January, 1971...

958
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:01,986
...President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...

959
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:04,905
...something that his predecessors
would not ask.

960
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:09,034
A week later, the conflict ends.

961
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:13,664
Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.

962
01:28:17,085 --> 01:28:20,713
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.

963
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,718
In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.

964
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:29,263
I am not sure if I know what that means.

965
01:28:45,739 --> 01:28:48,866
You see, at the time, I was misquoted.

966
01:28:49,117 --> 01:28:52,202
I never said, "The superman exists
and he is American."

967
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:58,334
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American."

968
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:01,295
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

969
01:29:01,463 --> 01:29:05,382
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

970
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,843
...don't be alarmed.

971
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:12,514
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

972
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:18,103
It is Christmas, 1963.

973
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:22,149
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.

974
01:29:22,776 --> 01:29:25,611
She says I am like a god now.

975
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:28,447
I tell her I don't think there is a God.

976
01:29:28,615 --> 01:29:31,283
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

977
01:29:36,039 --> 01:29:38,457
I tell her I still want her...

978
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,251
...and that I always will.

979
01:29:44,297 --> 01:29:48,967
As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.

980
01:29:49,803 --> 01:29:52,679
I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.

981
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:58,435
A very young girl looks at me and smiles.

982
01:30:00,313 --> 01:30:02,314
She's beautiful.

983
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:11,740
After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...

984
01:30:11,908 --> 01:30:13,492
...like a signature.

985
01:30:14,828 --> 01:30:17,996
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.

986
01:30:18,498 --> 01:30:23,794
She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.

987
01:30:23,962 --> 01:30:25,796
It's true.

988
01:30:27,841 --> 01:30:30,884
She's aging more noticeably every day...

989
01:30:37,475 --> 01:30:40,310
...while I am standing still.

990
01:30:41,229 --> 01:30:43,897
I prefer the stillness here.

991
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:46,984
I am tired of Earth.

992
01:30:47,152 --> 01:30:48,819
These people.

993
01:30:49,362 --> 01:30:53,073
I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.

994
01:31:15,889 --> 01:31:19,224
They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...

995
01:31:19,809 --> 01:31:23,270
...yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.

996
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:26,398
Perhaps the world is not made.

997
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,401
Perhaps nothing is made.

998
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:33,822
A clock without a craftsman.

999
01:31:34,741 --> 01:31:36,742
It's too late.

1000
01:31:37,202 --> 01:31:39,077
Always has been...

1001
01:31:39,746 --> 01:31:43,165
...always will be too late.

1002
01:31:45,585 --> 01:31:48,295
And you have no idea
where he would've gone.

1003
01:31:48,463 --> 01:31:49,755
How would I know?

1004
01:31:49,923 --> 01:31:52,674
Probably on the other side
of the world studying molecules.

1005
01:31:52,842 --> 01:31:55,385
Our satellites have done
a sweep of the planet.

1006
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:57,846
There's no trace of his
energy signature anywhere.

1007
01:31:58,014 --> 01:31:59,306
Really?

1008
01:31:59,474 --> 01:32:02,893
Miss Jupiter, did you and
Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?

1009
01:32:03,061 --> 01:32:04,561
None of your fucking business.

1010
01:32:04,729 --> 01:32:08,065
It is when you're on government payroll
and you're not doing your job.

1011
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:12,694
That's as close to the word "whore"
as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.

1012
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,329
Smoke?

1013
01:32:22,872 --> 01:32:25,123
My apologies, Miss Jupiter.

1014
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:28,627
You know how important Dr. Manhattan
is to our national security.

1015
01:32:29,546 --> 01:32:31,463
You can imagine our concern.

1016
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:33,173
I can only imagine.

1017
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:43,433
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

1018
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:46,436
Then Ozymandias here...

1019
01:32:46,854 --> 01:32:49,648
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

1020
01:33:07,834 --> 01:33:10,919
Laurel? Laurel Jane?

1021
01:33:12,463 --> 01:33:14,256
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

1022
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:17,384
You're the Comedian, right?

1023
01:33:17,594 --> 01:33:19,052
You were pretty cool in there.

1024
01:33:19,846 --> 01:33:23,599
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1025
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:29,104
You got her eyes, you know.
You even have that same funny little mole.

1026
01:33:29,564 --> 01:33:31,481
Take your hands off her.

1027
01:33:31,649 --> 01:33:33,734
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1028
01:33:33,901 --> 01:33:37,529
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1029
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:41,074
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1030
01:33:41,242 --> 01:33:45,078
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1031
01:33:45,788 --> 01:33:47,497
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1032
01:33:47,665 --> 01:33:49,791
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?

1033
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:51,627
We found him!

1034
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:56,757
- We found him.
Where is he?

1035
01:34:00,178 --> 01:34:01,511
Mars.

1036
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,561
Mr. President...

1037
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:14,358
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

1038
01:34:15,902 --> 01:34:17,152
They are testing us...

1039
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:21,740
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

1040
01:34:21,908 --> 01:34:24,993
...to coax a move out of them.

1041
01:34:25,161 --> 01:34:29,122
If they realize it's not a hoax,
they'll probably start with air strikes.

1042
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:33,377
If they do, they'll have Afghanistan
under control in a matter of days.

1043
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:38,465
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists
has moved the Doomsday Clock...

1044
01:34:38,633 --> 01:34:40,884
...to two minutes until midnight.

1045
01:34:41,052 --> 01:34:44,221
Get this shit off the screen.

1046
01:34:44,389 --> 01:34:47,432
Who are these assholes to say
when doomsday approaches?

1047
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,060
I say when doomsday is approaching.

1048
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,317
Now, then.

1049
01:34:58,361 --> 01:35:00,862
What about the rest
of the Warsaw Pact countries?

1050
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:05,242
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany
have mobilized their forces.

1051
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:08,578
But no movement yet.
They're playing a wait-and-see.

1052
01:35:08,746 --> 01:35:10,372
Letting the Russians take the lead.

1053
01:35:14,711 --> 01:35:17,921
Bold moves, Henry.
That's what's needed right now.

1054
01:35:18,089 --> 01:35:20,841
We can't let these fuckers
think we're weak.

1055
01:35:21,008 --> 01:35:25,303
Yes. They must fear the madman
Richard Nixon.

1056
01:35:30,351 --> 01:35:33,812
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

1057
01:35:34,981 --> 01:35:36,022
Two days.

1058
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:40,318
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R...

1059
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:42,529
...before they get their missiles airborne.

1060
01:35:44,157 --> 01:35:45,741
What would our losses be?

1061
01:35:45,908 --> 01:35:47,784
Assuming conservative projections...

1062
01:35:47,952 --> 01:35:51,329
...of how many Soviet warheads
are destroyed beforehand...

1063
01:35:51,497 --> 01:35:53,331
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

1064
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,333
The last gasp...

1065
01:35:56,169 --> 01:35:58,670
...of the Harvard establishment.

1066
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:02,340
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

1067
01:36:02,508 --> 01:36:06,136
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

1068
01:36:06,304 --> 01:36:08,513
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

1069
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:10,766
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

1070
01:36:10,933 --> 01:36:12,642
Not so bad...

1071
01:36:13,436 --> 01:36:15,562
...all things considered.

1072
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:19,983
Mr. President...

1073
01:36:20,151 --> 01:36:21,777
...what would you like to do?

1074
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:32,412
Take us to DEFCON two.

1075
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:34,581
Begin fueling the bombers.

1076
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:38,084
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

1077
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:40,337
After that...

1078
01:36:40,505 --> 01:36:44,132
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

1079
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:47,719
Let's just hope he's on our side.

1080
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,056
There must be a way to reach him.
Excuse me.

1081
01:36:51,224 --> 01:36:52,891
Radio transmission, space shuttles-

1082
01:36:53,059 --> 01:36:54,267
Excuse me.
What?

1083
01:36:54,435 --> 01:36:56,728
I need to use the restroom.

1084
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:19,918
Don't you understand?

1085
01:37:20,086 --> 01:37:22,754
The only thing that can
bring Jon back is Jon.

1086
01:37:22,922 --> 01:37:24,881
If he wants to find me, he will.

1087
01:37:25,049 --> 01:37:27,509
I've been a prisoner in my life
long enough.

1088
01:37:27,885 --> 01:37:29,594
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

1089
01:37:29,762 --> 01:37:32,639
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

1090
01:37:32,807 --> 01:37:37,227
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

1091
01:37:37,395 --> 01:37:39,062
You can understand.

1092
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:44,317
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

1093
01:37:44,485 --> 01:37:46,736
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

1094
01:37:46,904 --> 01:37:49,656
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

1095
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,742
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

1096
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,870
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

1097
01:37:55,037 --> 01:37:58,290
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

1098
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:01,585
Mr. Iacocca, gentlemen...

1099
01:38:02,753 --> 01:38:04,963
...I respect your position...

1100
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:09,050
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

1101
01:38:09,468 --> 01:38:11,970
You wanna know my past? Hm?

1102
01:38:12,763 --> 01:38:15,473
Okay. Happily.

1103
01:38:15,641 --> 01:38:19,144
It's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

1104
01:38:19,312 --> 01:38:21,146
...leaving me alone.

1105
01:38:22,148 --> 01:38:25,483
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

1106
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:30,572
They say I'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

1107
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:34,242
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

1108
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:37,829
Well, anyone living, that is.

1109
01:38:37,997 --> 01:38:39,956
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

1110
01:38:40,124 --> 01:38:43,251
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

1111
01:38:43,419 --> 01:38:48,798
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

1112
01:38:48,966 --> 01:38:52,010
His vision of a united world was...

1113
01:38:55,306 --> 01:38:57,015
Well, it was unprecedented.

1114
01:38:57,183 --> 01:38:58,850
I wanted...

1115
01:38:59,018 --> 01:39:01,353
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

1116
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,689
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

1117
01:39:04,857 --> 01:39:08,360
And so began my path to conquest.

1118
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:11,780
Conquest not of men...

1119
01:39:11,948 --> 01:39:14,783
...but of the evils that beset them.

1120
01:39:15,034 --> 01:39:19,913
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

1121
01:39:20,081 --> 01:39:22,916
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

1122
01:39:23,084 --> 01:39:24,709
- ...are the pushers.
- Now, listen.

1123
01:39:25,294 --> 01:39:26,920
No.

1124
01:39:29,256 --> 01:39:31,049
You listen.

1125
01:39:32,301 --> 01:39:34,803
The world will survive...

1126
01:39:35,012 --> 01:39:38,431
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

1127
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:41,226
So let's cut to it, shall we?

1128
01:39:41,477 --> 01:39:43,937
I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

1129
01:39:44,105 --> 01:39:47,732
I could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

1130
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,520
...should you choose
to make our...

1131
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,760
disagreement...

1132
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:53,355
public.

1133
01:39:55,658 --> 01:39:58,076
I think you know the way out.

1134
01:39:59,829 --> 01:40:01,579
Gentlemen.

1135
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:07,585
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the Ozymandias line.

1136
01:40:07,753 --> 01:40:11,214
- Seems all the old villains are dead.
- Mr. Veidt?

1137
01:40:11,382 --> 01:40:14,926
- I think I have some ideas.
- Mr. Veidt?

1138
01:40:15,094 --> 01:40:17,929
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1139
01:40:56,927 --> 01:40:58,636
He's got a poison capsule.

1140
01:40:59,305 --> 01:41:03,767
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

1141
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:05,018
Give me a name!

1142
01:41:17,156 --> 01:41:18,448
Suicide pill.

1143
01:41:19,533 --> 01:41:22,494
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

1144
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:24,496
Thanks, hon.

1145
01:41:24,997 --> 01:41:26,998
Then Rorschach was right.

1146
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:29,334
This wasn't some lone nut.

1147
01:41:29,502 --> 01:41:33,671
well-funded, well-equipped.

1148
01:41:34,632 --> 01:41:36,549
But who'd wanna kill us now?

1149
01:41:37,843 --> 01:41:41,012
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

1150
01:41:46,519 --> 01:41:48,520
So no word from Jon?

1151
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,106
No.

1152
01:41:51,482 --> 01:41:53,358
Well, listen...

1153
01:41:53,859 --> 01:41:55,568
...why don't you come stay with me?

1154
01:41:56,904 --> 01:41:59,906
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

1155
01:42:00,366 --> 01:42:03,743
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

1156
01:42:05,579 --> 01:42:07,914
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

1157
01:42:11,335 --> 01:42:12,544
Okay.

1158
01:42:15,631 --> 01:42:21,052
Rorschach's journal, October 21st, 1985.

1159
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:25,348
On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.

1160
01:42:26,016 --> 01:42:28,685
They didn't know me without my mask.

1161
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,187
An affair?

1162
01:42:31,355 --> 01:42:34,232
Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile...

1163
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,402
...to make room for Dreiberg?

1164
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:41,030
Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?

1165
01:42:42,241 --> 01:42:45,076
The alley was cold, deserted.

1166
01:42:45,244 --> 01:42:49,831
My things were where I left them,
waiting for me.

1167
01:42:49,999 --> 01:42:54,377
My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.

1168
01:42:55,921 --> 01:42:57,839
My face.

1169
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:02,010
Putting them on,
I abandoned my disguise...

1170
01:43:02,178 --> 01:43:04,304
...became myself.

1171
01:43:04,805 --> 01:43:07,932
Free from fear or weakness...

1172
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,184
...or lust.

1173
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:12,604
Down alley...

1174
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:14,647
...heard woman scream.

1175
01:43:14,815 --> 01:43:18,818
First bubbling note
of city's evening chorus.

1176
01:43:18,986 --> 01:43:20,778
Attempted rape.

1177
01:43:20,946 --> 01:43:22,113
Mugging.

1178
01:43:22,281 --> 01:43:23,781
Both.

1179
01:43:25,284 --> 01:43:26,951
The man turned...

1180
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:30,288
...and there was something
rewarding in his eyes.

1181
01:43:31,248 --> 01:43:33,708
Sometimes the night is generous to me.

1182
01:43:39,798 --> 01:43:44,135
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.

1183
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:47,472
At his apartment, I found clues.

1184
01:43:48,682 --> 01:43:51,768
Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.

1185
01:43:51,936 --> 01:43:54,479
I've seen the logo before...

1186
01:43:54,897 --> 01:43:56,981
...at Moloch's.

1187
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:30,265
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

1188
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:33,893
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

1189
01:44:34,061 --> 01:44:36,187
More than a just delivery service,
I take it.

1190
01:44:36,355 --> 01:44:40,316
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check
written from the same company.

1191
01:44:40,484 --> 01:44:43,987
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

1192
01:44:44,154 --> 01:44:47,740
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

1193
01:44:52,621 --> 01:44:54,247
Rorschach.

1194
01:44:54,415 --> 01:44:56,791
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

1195
01:44:56,959 --> 01:44:58,835
No. No!

1196
01:44:59,003 --> 01:45:02,130
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

1197
01:45:02,298 --> 01:45:05,216
No. No, no, no!

1198
01:45:05,384 --> 01:45:09,804
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1199
01:45:09,972 --> 01:45:11,597
Never, never surrender.

1200
01:45:11,765 --> 01:45:14,767
All right.
I hope you're ready, hero.

1201
01:45:14,935 --> 01:45:15,977
When you are.

1202
01:45:38,667 --> 01:45:39,709
One...

1203
01:45:44,715 --> 01:45:45,757
...two...

1204
01:45:49,762 --> 01:45:50,845
...three.

1205
01:46:42,815 --> 01:46:44,607
Come on.

1206
01:46:55,411 --> 01:46:56,828
Son of a bitch.

1207
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:00,206
- Christ, he stinks.
- Get that mask off him.

1208
01:47:00,374 --> 01:47:03,209
- I got it.
- No. No!

1209
01:47:03,377 --> 01:47:06,087
My face! Give me back my face!

1210
01:47:06,922 --> 01:47:09,549
The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...

1211
01:47:09,716 --> 01:47:13,553
...and identified
as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.

1212
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,806
Little's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...

1213
01:47:16,974 --> 01:47:20,810
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.

1214
01:47:20,978 --> 01:47:24,021
Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...

1215
01:47:24,189 --> 01:47:26,732
...during the violent course
of the capture.

1216
01:47:30,529 --> 01:47:31,863
Rorschach!

1217
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:35,741
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

1218
01:47:42,374 --> 01:47:45,334
Come on out, Rorschach!

1219
01:47:48,213 --> 01:47:50,882
I knew this guy was a kook.

1220
01:47:51,425 --> 01:47:52,842
But Rorschach...

1221
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:55,761
Usually I got an intuition
about these kind of things.

1222
01:47:55,929 --> 01:47:58,347
- Thought the dude would be bigger.
- It goes to show you, kid...

1223
01:47:58,515 --> 01:48:00,349
- ...you never know.
- Hey, let me get a Gazette.

1224
01:48:00,517 --> 01:48:04,353
Yeah. Hey, you see this?
He was a customer of mine.

1225
01:48:04,521 --> 01:48:07,482
- Used to come here all the time.
- No shit?

1226
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:12,069
Hey, Bernie. Any good news?

1227
01:48:21,872 --> 01:48:25,249
Whoever we are, wherever we reside...

1228
01:48:25,417 --> 01:48:28,252
...we exist on the whim of murderers.

1229
01:48:32,925 --> 01:48:35,885
I hardly recognized my old friend Ridley.

1230
01:48:36,053 --> 01:48:39,180
I could not bring myself to tell him
he was a horrible reflection...

1231
01:48:39,348 --> 01:48:41,265
...of his former self.

1232
01:48:41,558 --> 01:48:46,103
I really must get him home before...
Before he gets any worse.

1233
01:48:46,271 --> 01:48:48,397
Before he succumbs.

1234
01:48:48,857 --> 01:48:54,362
I've heard that on less than a pint daily,
a man might survive drinking saltwater.

1235
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:55,863
Captain?

1236
01:48:56,031 --> 01:48:57,490
What are you doing, captain?

1237
01:49:00,035 --> 01:49:02,870
I'm headed for Davidstown. That's what.

1238
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:06,040
I need to warn everyone.

1239
01:49:08,502 --> 01:49:12,046
You think you'll reach Davidstown
in advance of the Black Freighter?

1240
01:49:12,422 --> 01:49:16,592
Isolation has made you mad, captain.
Mad, indeed.

1241
01:49:17,594 --> 01:49:18,928
But we must try.

1242
01:49:19,096 --> 01:49:20,304
You are a fool.

1243
01:49:20,472 --> 01:49:22,974
You alone survived the Freighter's attack.

1244
01:49:23,141 --> 01:49:27,353
Fortune has smiled upon you,
and you spit in its face.

1245
01:49:27,521 --> 01:49:32,900
Turn your wretched craft around
and go far away, as far away as you can.

1246
01:49:34,987 --> 01:49:38,948
No. No, my family. I must protect them.

1247
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,993
The Black Freighter is already there.

1248
01:49:42,786 --> 01:49:44,412
Your wife, dead.

1249
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:47,206
- Your children, dead.
- Shut your mouth.

1250
01:49:47,374 --> 01:49:51,711
You have failed your family,
like you have failed your crew.

1251
01:50:13,066 --> 01:50:16,527
You'll end up dead like them.
You give your life in vain.

1252
01:50:16,695 --> 01:50:18,904
I give my life in nobility.

1253
01:50:21,783 --> 01:50:24,869
Even if I fail in my attempt,
I take solace in the fact that I will see...

1254
01:50:25,037 --> 01:50:26,579
...my family again in heaven.

1255
01:50:26,747 --> 01:50:28,080
Heaven?

1256
01:50:28,248 --> 01:50:30,333
Oh, there is no heaven, captain.

1257
01:50:30,876 --> 01:50:32,960
Believe me, sir.

1258
01:50:33,128 --> 01:50:35,296
I would know by now.

1259
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,679
Walter Kovacs.

1260
01:50:43,847 --> 01:50:46,557
Is that your name? Walter?

1261
01:50:46,725 --> 01:50:50,770
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

1262
01:50:50,937 --> 01:50:52,521
You cooperate with me...

1263
01:50:52,689 --> 01:50:57,193
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

1264
01:50:57,361 --> 01:51:00,905
In a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

1265
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:02,880
But the authorities...

1266
01:51:03,450 --> 01:51:04,340
wanna put you...

1267
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:07,250
with the general population.

1268
01:51:07,996 --> 01:51:11,082
- Prison's a prison.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

1269
01:51:11,667 --> 01:51:15,086
But the difference is, down there...

1270
01:51:15,671 --> 01:51:17,046
...you'd be eaten alive.

1271
01:51:18,006 --> 01:51:22,259
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

1272
01:51:25,305 --> 01:51:26,764
Tell me what you see.

1273
01:51:31,937 --> 01:51:33,604
A pretty butterfly.

1274
01:51:37,442 --> 01:51:39,276
What about now? What do you see here?

1275
01:51:44,366 --> 01:51:45,449
Mom?

1276
01:51:45,784 --> 01:51:47,159
Is he hurting you?

1277
01:51:47,327 --> 01:51:50,204
You got a fucking kid in here.
I get that at home.

1278
01:51:50,372 --> 01:51:53,916
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

1279
01:52:03,552 --> 01:52:05,469
Some nice flowers.

1280
01:52:11,184 --> 01:52:12,852
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.

1281
01:52:15,147 --> 01:52:17,898
Did you catch any diseases from her?

1282
01:52:18,066 --> 01:52:22,862
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

1283
01:52:24,156 --> 01:52:27,408
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

1284
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:47,178
Clouds.

1285
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,852
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

1286
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:58,522
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

1287
01:52:59,608 --> 01:53:03,819
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

1288
01:53:03,987 --> 01:53:05,362
You're fat.

1289
01:53:05,947 --> 01:53:09,074
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

1290
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:11,243
What you call compassion.

1291
01:53:11,411 --> 01:53:13,704
Wanting to protect
and understand the guilty.

1292
01:53:13,872 --> 01:53:17,792
This rotting society,
what it calls rehabilitation.

1293
01:53:17,959 --> 01:53:19,418
Nothing short of compromise.

1294
01:53:19,586 --> 01:53:22,171
Is it a compromise
to want to make you well?

1295
01:53:22,339 --> 01:53:26,550
There are other men in here with behavior
more extreme than mine, doctor.

1296
01:53:27,219 --> 01:53:30,221
Of course, they're not famous, are they?

1297
01:53:30,597 --> 01:53:33,307
You wanna know about Rorschach?

1298
01:53:34,768 --> 01:53:36,560
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

1299
01:53:37,854 --> 01:53:40,356
Once a man has seen society's
black underbelly...

1300
01:53:40,524 --> 01:53:43,150
...he can never turn his back on it.

1301
01:53:43,318 --> 01:53:45,903
Never pretend, like you do...

1302
01:53:46,196 --> 01:53:50,407
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who
orders him to look the other way.

1303
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:54,245
We don't do this thing...

1304
01:53:54,412 --> 01:53:56,539
...because it's permitted.

1305
01:53:57,165 --> 01:53:59,750
We do it because we have to.

1306
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:02,753
We do it because we're compelled.

1307
01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:07,007
I was investigating a kidnap case.

1308
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,594
Blaire Roche.

1309
01:54:10,762 --> 01:54:14,223
Six-year-old girl. I was young then.

1310
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:17,434
Too soft on criminals.

1311
01:54:18,353 --> 01:54:19,979
I let them live.

1312
01:54:21,273 --> 01:54:26,986
Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.

1313
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:37,037
I knew the girl was here...

1314
01:54:37,205 --> 01:54:40,749
...but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.

1315
01:54:41,626 --> 01:54:44,044
And then I found her.

1316
01:55:33,386 --> 01:55:35,262
Fred.

1317
01:55:36,139 --> 01:55:37,973
Barney.

1318
01:55:38,141 --> 01:55:40,851
Who's gonna bark for Daddy?

1319
01:55:46,316 --> 01:55:49,568
It was dark when the murderer got back.

1320
01:55:51,321 --> 01:55:52,905
As dark as it gets.

1321
01:56:31,569 --> 01:56:36,407
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

1322
01:56:38,243 --> 01:56:39,368
Who is it?

1323
01:56:50,088 --> 01:56:53,507
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

1324
01:56:53,675 --> 01:56:58,178
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

1325
01:57:03,184 --> 01:57:07,730
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

1326
01:57:07,897 --> 01:57:10,357
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

1327
01:57:18,283 --> 01:57:21,076
Okay. I confess.

1328
01:57:22,287 --> 01:57:24,955
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

1329
01:57:25,749 --> 01:57:27,124
Arrest me.

1330
01:57:27,959 --> 01:57:29,668
What? Arrest me!

1331
01:57:31,296 --> 01:57:33,255
I did it! I said I did it!

1332
01:57:33,423 --> 01:57:34,840
Christ.

1333
01:57:35,008 --> 01:57:39,303
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

1334
01:57:40,138 --> 01:57:42,670
No, don't. Don't do that.

1335
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:44,340
Take me in.

1336
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:46,430
Don't! No!

1337
01:57:51,816 --> 01:57:55,319
Men get arrested.

1338
01:57:56,738 --> 01:57:58,781
Dogs get put down.

1339
01:58:06,873 --> 01:58:09,041
Tremors of impact shook my arm.

1340
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:12,795
Warm blood splashed my face.

1341
01:58:14,005 --> 01:58:18,133
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

1342
01:58:19,135 --> 01:58:21,345
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

1343
01:58:22,889 --> 01:58:25,682
See, doctor, God didn't
kill that little girl.

1344
01:58:26,142 --> 01:58:30,312
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

1345
01:58:31,481 --> 01:58:34,900
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

1346
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:38,654
From then on, I knew:

1347
01:58:39,989 --> 01:58:42,324
God doesn't make the world this way.

1348
01:58:44,327 --> 01:58:45,828
We do.

1349
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:54,545
I can't help him.

1350
01:59:06,641 --> 01:59:08,433
Hey, Rorschach.

1351
01:59:09,435 --> 01:59:11,436
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1352
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:14,064
Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

1353
01:59:14,232 --> 01:59:17,818
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

1354
01:59:17,986 --> 01:59:20,529
- Ain't that right? That's right.
That's right.

1355
01:59:22,157 --> 01:59:25,409
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

1356
01:59:40,592 --> 01:59:44,178
None of you seem to understand.
I'm not locked in here with you.

1357
01:59:44,345 --> 01:59:46,430
All right, that's it!

1358
01:59:47,265 --> 01:59:49,725
You're locked in here with me.

1359
02:01:08,471 --> 02:01:09,513
Laurie!

1360
02:01:10,723 --> 02:01:12,057
Shit.

1361
02:01:13,059 --> 02:01:14,977
Hold on.
- Fuck.

1362
02:01:18,231 --> 02:01:19,731
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1363
02:01:24,404 --> 02:01:27,823
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

1364
02:01:27,991 --> 02:01:29,408
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

1365
02:01:29,575 --> 02:01:32,703
- Okay.
- I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

1366
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:34,871
No, don't worry.

1367
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:38,333
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1368
02:01:39,419 --> 02:01:41,253
Archie survived that.

1369
02:01:41,713 --> 02:01:43,046
Archie?

1370
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:47,217
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

1371
02:01:47,385 --> 02:01:48,927
...Merlin's pet owl.

1372
02:01:50,054 --> 02:01:51,722
Stupid nickname.

1373
02:01:52,765 --> 02:01:55,517
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1374
02:01:55,685 --> 02:02:01,231
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

1375
02:02:01,941 --> 02:02:05,277
...which always surprised me.
I mean, he was...

1376
02:02:05,945 --> 02:02:08,572
I think he was disappointed
I went into crime fighting...

1377
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:10,449
...instead of following him.

1378
02:02:11,242 --> 02:02:13,020
Guess I was just more interested in

1379
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:14,990
birds and

1380
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:17,780
airplanes, mythology and...

1381
02:02:18,666 --> 02:02:22,669
Plus, there were enough other guys
doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.

1382
02:02:23,588 --> 02:02:24,796
Like Hollis.

1383
02:02:24,964 --> 02:02:26,465
Yeah.

1384
02:02:27,258 --> 02:02:30,010
Yeah, he was my hero.

1385
02:02:31,054 --> 02:02:34,431
Man, I remember the first time
that I met him...

1386
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:38,268
...I just felt so connected, you know?

1387
02:02:38,436 --> 02:02:40,771
To something that mattered.

1388
02:02:43,608 --> 02:02:46,276
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1389
02:02:46,944 --> 02:02:49,112
A secret place that nobody knows about.

1390
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:54,284
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

1391
02:02:55,745 --> 02:02:58,080
Nobody watching you.

1392
02:03:01,417 --> 02:03:02,459
Wanna try those on?

1393
02:03:13,262 --> 02:03:14,930
There we go.

1394
02:03:18,101 --> 02:03:20,102
Wow, these rock.

1395
02:03:22,939 --> 02:03:25,232
They amplify the spectral range.

1396
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:27,526
Thermal imaging.

1397
02:03:29,195 --> 02:03:31,196
They work even better in the dark.

1398
02:03:36,119 --> 02:03:37,869
You can see me, right?

1399
02:03:40,039 --> 02:03:42,707
I can see everything.

1400
02:03:45,461 --> 02:03:48,964
I remember, no matter how black it got...

1401
02:03:49,298 --> 02:03:53,427
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

1402
02:03:55,721 --> 02:03:58,056
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

1403
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:03,395
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1404
02:04:03,646 --> 02:04:05,730
Put those away when you're done.

1405
02:04:14,699 --> 02:04:17,033
Soviet ambassador
to the U.N. had no comment...

1406
02:04:17,201 --> 02:04:19,494
...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's
disappearance...

1407
02:04:19,662 --> 02:04:21,997
...has fueled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.

1408
02:04:22,165 --> 02:04:23,874
Dan.

1409
02:04:24,584 --> 02:04:26,334
Jon sees a lot of things...

1410
02:04:28,713 --> 02:04:31,047
...but he doesn't see me.

1411
02:04:38,181 --> 02:04:39,723
Well, uh...

1412
02:04:57,909 --> 02:04:59,493
Oh.

1413
02:05:33,319 --> 02:05:34,653
Sorry.

1414
02:05:36,656 --> 02:05:37,989
Come here.

1415
02:05:43,955 --> 02:05:45,205
What's the matter?

1416
02:05:45,373 --> 02:05:47,791
- If you could just move a little...
- Okay.

1417
02:05:47,959 --> 02:05:50,210
Yeah. There you go.

1418
02:05:56,717 --> 02:05:59,344
Dan, what's wrong?

1419
02:06:01,013 --> 02:06:02,138
Sorry, I...

1420
02:06:04,308 --> 02:06:06,518
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1421
02:06:08,688 --> 02:06:10,647
Oh, hell.

1422
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,234
It's okay.

1423
02:06:15,653 --> 02:06:20,073
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

1424
02:06:23,661 --> 02:06:26,288
We've got all the time in the world.

1425
02:06:27,790 --> 02:06:29,791
We'll take it slow.

1426
02:06:43,764 --> 02:06:46,099
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

1427
02:06:46,767 --> 02:06:48,268
Big Figure.

1428
02:06:48,603 --> 02:06:50,437
Small world.

1429
02:06:51,772 --> 02:06:53,273
I like that.

1430
02:06:54,025 --> 02:06:56,443
But you know, it is a small world in here.

1431
02:06:56,861 --> 02:06:59,654
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

1432
02:06:59,822 --> 02:07:01,948
Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

1433
02:07:02,283 --> 02:07:03,617
That's right.

1434
02:07:04,619 --> 02:07:08,121
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

1435
02:07:11,125 --> 02:07:12,292
So...

1436
02:07:12,793 --> 02:07:17,547
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

1437
02:07:17,715 --> 02:07:22,927
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

1438
02:07:23,095 --> 02:07:27,432
I been talking to every one of them
and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

1439
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:30,894
This place is gonna explode!

1440
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:35,148
Then, you die by inches.

1441
02:07:36,067 --> 02:07:37,734
Tall order.

1442
02:07:37,985 --> 02:07:40,487
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1443
02:07:41,155 --> 02:07:44,157
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1444
02:07:44,992 --> 02:07:46,326
Come on.

1445
02:09:20,212 --> 02:09:22,297
Know this, my friends.

1446
02:09:22,465 --> 02:09:23,548
Hades is wet.

1447
02:09:24,884 --> 02:09:26,468
Hades is lonely.

1448
02:09:42,318 --> 02:09:46,070
And in that instant, we knew each other.

1449
02:10:22,483 --> 02:10:24,734
I'm sorry, my friend.

1450
02:10:44,964 --> 02:10:47,882
My raft had grown
increasingly grotesque...

1451
02:10:48,467 --> 02:10:51,511
...reflecting my own transformation.

1452
02:11:05,109 --> 02:11:09,153
Adrift, my darkest imaginings
welled up unchecked...

1453
02:11:09,321 --> 02:11:12,448
...spilling from brain to heart
like black ink...

1454
02:11:12,616 --> 02:11:15,076
...impossible to remove.

1455
02:11:23,919 --> 02:11:26,921
The vessel had surely reached
Davidstown already.

1456
02:11:27,756 --> 02:11:32,135
I pictured quiet streets overrun
by the fiends from the Black Freighter.

1457
02:11:32,303 --> 02:11:35,555
My wife, my children,
most certainly dead.

1458
02:11:35,723 --> 02:11:37,724
My crew, dead.

1459
02:11:37,892 --> 02:11:41,561
The beast I ride on, dead.

1460
02:11:50,487 --> 02:11:53,448
More blood, more blood, more blood.

1461
02:12:07,755 --> 02:12:09,088
Father?

1462
02:12:09,256 --> 02:12:11,716
It can't be. Oh, Lord, it can't be.

1463
02:12:11,884 --> 02:12:15,136
Father, help us. Please.

1464
02:12:15,304 --> 02:12:16,346
Wait.

1465
02:12:18,015 --> 02:12:19,057
I'm coming.

1466
02:12:19,850 --> 02:12:21,184
Hurry, my dear.

1467
02:12:21,936 --> 02:12:24,854
Wait. Anyone but them.

1468
02:12:25,022 --> 02:12:26,648
Anyone.

1469
02:12:26,899 --> 02:12:28,483
Anyone.

1470
02:12:32,738 --> 02:12:34,989
I'd swallowed too much seawater.

1471
02:12:35,157 --> 02:12:37,992
I'd swallowed too much horror.

1472
02:12:41,455 --> 02:12:42,705
God has damned me.

1473
02:12:43,874 --> 02:12:46,501
God has damned us all.

1474
02:12:46,669 --> 02:12:52,590
Truly, life is hell, and death's rough hand
our only deliverance.

1475
02:12:53,342 --> 02:12:55,468
I can endure no more.

1476
02:12:55,636 --> 02:12:59,555
I want to join my family desperately.

1477
02:13:07,356 --> 02:13:09,190
Yo, man.

1478
02:13:09,733 --> 02:13:11,567
What you reading?

1479
02:13:12,736 --> 02:13:14,237
Nothing, man.

1480
02:13:15,614 --> 02:13:18,199
- Nothing, huh?
- Hey, hey! You leave that kid alone!

1481
02:13:18,367 --> 02:13:20,076
Shut up, old man!

1482
02:13:28,877 --> 02:13:31,587
You're reading a comic book?
What are you, retarded?

1483
02:13:38,887 --> 02:13:41,931
Aw, hey, where you going, short bus?

1484
02:13:52,192 --> 02:13:53,526
Dan?

1485
02:14:00,367 --> 02:14:02,035
Is everything all right?

1486
02:14:04,371 --> 02:14:07,290
I'm tired of being afraid.

1487
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:10,752
Afraid of war...

1488
02:14:11,545 --> 02:14:15,131
...afraid of the mask killer...

1489
02:14:16,717 --> 02:14:19,927
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

1490
02:14:20,095 --> 02:14:22,055
...and how much I need it.

1491
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:24,557
Me too.

1492
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:27,351
So to hell with it.

1493
02:14:28,228 --> 02:14:29,562
Let's take Archie out.

1494
02:14:35,486 --> 02:14:36,652
You're serious.

1495
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:39,322
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

1496
02:14:39,490 --> 02:14:42,742
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

1497
02:15:44,471 --> 02:15:46,556
Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.

1498
02:15:46,723 --> 02:15:49,308
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.

1499
02:15:49,476 --> 02:15:50,810
Let's go.

1500
02:15:55,566 --> 02:15:57,942
I can see it.
All right, hold on.

1501
02:16:08,787 --> 02:16:10,246
Dan, there are kids in there.

1502
02:16:10,414 --> 02:16:12,582
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

1503
02:16:12,749 --> 02:16:14,917
We're gonna get you out of there.

1504
02:16:15,085 --> 02:16:17,253
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1505
02:16:17,421 --> 02:16:18,921
I'm gonna get you close.

1506
02:17:17,648 --> 02:17:19,023
Let's go.

1507
02:17:19,191 --> 02:17:20,358
Come on.

1508
02:17:20,525 --> 02:17:22,151
All right, let's move it, people.

1509
02:17:28,867 --> 02:17:33,663
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket...?

1510
02:17:34,122 --> 02:17:36,332
Is that Jesus?

1511
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,334
No, baby.

1512
02:17:39,253 --> 02:17:41,379
Watch your step.
All right.

1513
02:17:43,715 --> 02:17:44,757
We're all set.

1514
02:17:45,801 --> 02:17:47,468
Is that everyone?

1515
02:18:11,535 --> 02:18:13,828
Bye.
Bye!

1516
02:18:17,416 --> 02:18:19,000
I can't believe we did that.

1517
02:18:20,961 --> 02:18:23,421
- They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
- Who cares?

1518
02:18:23,588 --> 02:18:25,548
World War III could start tomorrow.

1519
02:18:27,676 --> 02:18:29,010
Right?

1520
02:18:30,679 --> 02:18:32,013
Right.

1521
02:20:57,117 --> 02:20:59,034
Come back here!

1522
02:21:01,621 --> 02:21:03,330
He's dead, Rorschach.

1523
02:21:03,498 --> 02:21:07,710
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

1524
02:21:07,878 --> 02:21:10,045
Something from the machine shop.

1525
02:21:11,673 --> 02:21:13,299
Hey, boss, you notice?

1526
02:21:13,467 --> 02:21:16,510
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

1527
02:21:16,678 --> 02:21:19,889
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

1528
02:21:20,348 --> 02:21:21,474
Fat chance.

1529
02:21:22,184 --> 02:21:23,309
You're dead, Rorschach!

1530
02:21:23,477 --> 02:21:27,146
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

1531
02:21:30,066 --> 02:21:32,526
Your hands, my pleasure.

1532
02:21:34,529 --> 02:21:36,530
Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

1533
02:21:36,698 --> 02:21:39,992
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 15 years for this.

1534
02:21:41,119 --> 02:21:44,497
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

1535
02:21:48,210 --> 02:21:49,919
Nothing personal, big guy.

1536
02:21:51,379 --> 02:21:53,380
Boss! Wait!

1537
02:22:07,521 --> 02:22:09,313
Now you find out what the score is.

1538
02:22:09,773 --> 02:22:12,900
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1539
02:22:18,949 --> 02:22:20,616
Come on.

1540
02:22:20,784 --> 02:22:22,409
So I've been thinking.

1541
02:22:23,328 --> 02:22:27,498
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1542
02:22:28,333 --> 02:22:31,418
- I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
What?

1543
02:22:31,586 --> 02:22:33,337
Someone set him up.

1544
02:22:34,172 --> 02:22:37,800
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

1545
02:22:37,968 --> 02:22:39,885
You didn't get it.

1546
02:22:40,178 --> 02:22:42,638
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

1547
02:22:42,806 --> 02:22:45,600
- ...is a little different than putting out a fire.
- Yeah, you're right.

1548
02:22:47,352 --> 02:22:49,186
It'll be more fun.

1549
02:22:53,358 --> 02:22:56,360
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1550
02:23:01,658 --> 02:23:03,367
Yes.

1551
02:23:08,123 --> 02:23:09,164
No.

1552
02:23:23,054 --> 02:23:27,891
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

1553
02:23:28,727 --> 02:23:32,021
Two-nothing. Your move.

1554
02:23:35,358 --> 02:23:37,026
Get out of the way!

1555
02:24:03,928 --> 02:24:05,804
How do we know he's still alive?

1556
02:24:08,058 --> 02:24:09,266
He's alive.

1557
02:24:21,029 --> 02:24:22,571
No. No.

1558
02:24:23,239 --> 02:24:24,615
Where's my face?

1559
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:28,911
Don't kill me.

1560
02:24:32,582 --> 02:24:33,957
Your turn, doctor.

1561
02:24:34,125 --> 02:24:37,336
Tell me, what do you see?

1562
02:26:03,506 --> 02:26:05,215
Don't move!

1563
02:26:13,516 --> 02:26:15,267
Rorschach.

1564
02:26:15,769 --> 02:26:18,562
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1565
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:22,149
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1566
02:26:22,692 --> 02:26:24,651
Oh, for chrissake.

1567
02:27:01,856 --> 02:27:03,982
Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

1568
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:07,569
Should've known all you needed
was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

1569
02:27:07,737 --> 02:27:11,990
You're such an asshole, Rorschach.
- Spare me indignation.

1570
02:27:13,243 --> 02:27:16,245
Picked hell of a time
to be unfaithful to Jon.

1571
02:27:16,412 --> 02:27:19,248
Get tired of being patriotic,
or someone put you up to it?

1572
02:27:19,415 --> 02:27:22,084
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

1573
02:27:22,252 --> 02:27:26,088
Hey! Would you two stop?
You can argue later.

1574
02:27:26,256 --> 02:27:30,008
I had to turn the screechers off,
so we'll be drawing fire soon.

1575
02:27:34,013 --> 02:27:36,390
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

1576
02:28:15,263 --> 02:28:17,389
Are you all right?

1577
02:28:18,808 --> 02:28:21,018
Yeah. Just...

1578
02:28:21,477 --> 02:28:22,728
...heavy, you know?

1579
02:28:23,521 --> 02:28:25,647
War, jailbreak.

1580
02:28:26,149 --> 02:28:31,028
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1581
02:28:36,034 --> 02:28:39,077
- Hello, Laurie.
- Jon.

1582
02:28:39,245 --> 02:28:42,873
- TV said you were on Mars.
- I am on Mars.

1583
02:28:43,458 --> 02:28:45,834
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

1584
02:28:46,002 --> 02:28:47,502
What are you talking about?

1585
02:28:47,670 --> 02:28:50,339
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1586
02:28:56,220 --> 02:28:59,222
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.

1587
02:28:59,390 --> 02:29:01,058
I have to go.

1588
02:29:06,731 --> 02:29:08,732
Beautiful, isn't it?

1589
02:29:13,571 --> 02:29:16,531
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

1590
02:29:17,909 --> 02:29:19,743
It won't happen again.

1591
02:29:21,412 --> 02:29:23,413
That's comforting.

1592
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:27,417
Oh, my God.

1593
02:29:28,086 --> 02:29:29,920
I'm on Mars.

1594
02:29:33,925 --> 02:29:37,803
Hey. Nice ass.
Hey, asshole.

1595
02:29:37,971 --> 02:29:40,555
Hey, let's see if that comic-book
retard's up here.

1596
02:29:41,391 --> 02:29:43,308
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

1597
02:29:43,476 --> 02:29:48,188
You all hear? Some super-owl dude
just busted Rorschach out of prison.

1598
02:29:48,356 --> 02:29:50,065
- Rorschach?
- Yeah.

1599
02:29:50,233 --> 02:29:52,109
That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.

1600
02:29:52,276 --> 02:29:55,153
You mean Nite Owl.
Him and Rorschach used to be partners.

1601
02:29:55,321 --> 02:29:57,990
- Yeah.
- Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

1602
02:29:58,157 --> 02:30:00,409
- Didn't he write a book or something?
- Yeah.

1603
02:30:00,576 --> 02:30:04,413
You know, he lives over a garage
right near here.

1604
02:30:04,580 --> 02:30:07,249
- Yeah?
- Does he, now?

1605
02:30:10,003 --> 02:30:11,169
Hello?

1606
02:30:12,171 --> 02:30:14,172
Sally?

1607
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:17,259
- Hollis?
- Yeah.

1608
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:21,430
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

1609
02:30:22,223 --> 02:30:26,852
All this time you've had my number and
you wait until our sunset years to use it?

1610
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:29,813
Well, it seemed like
a special occasion, Sal.

1611
02:30:29,981 --> 02:30:31,106
What?

1612
02:30:31,274 --> 02:30:35,527
The TV is reporting there was
a tenement fire last night.

1613
02:30:36,404 --> 02:30:39,197
There were trapped people
rescued by airship...

1614
02:30:39,365 --> 02:30:44,953
...and they say the pilot
was dressed like an owl.

1615
02:30:45,121 --> 02:30:47,289
And it seems he had
a sexy woman with him.

1616
02:30:47,457 --> 02:30:50,083
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

1617
02:30:51,669 --> 02:30:54,796
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.

1618
02:30:54,964 --> 02:30:58,467
Maybe she'll finally thank me
for getting her started in the first place.

1619
02:30:58,634 --> 02:31:02,220
You know, Sal,
by the sound of your voice...

1620
02:31:02,388 --> 02:31:04,139
...you're sounding younger than ever.

1621
02:31:04,307 --> 02:31:06,600
Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.

1622
02:31:07,268 --> 02:31:09,311
But that's probably just senility.

1623
02:31:12,065 --> 02:31:14,983
Well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...

1624
02:31:15,151 --> 02:31:17,527
...but someone's knocking.

1625
02:31:18,071 --> 02:31:23,075
Well, don't get too misty-eyed
thinking about old times.

1626
02:31:23,951 --> 02:31:25,786
You take care now, Hollis.

1627
02:31:25,953 --> 02:31:27,245
Ah, you too.

1628
02:31:27,413 --> 02:31:28,663
Bye.

1629
02:31:29,207 --> 02:31:30,707
Bye.

1630
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:36,463
We're looking for Mr. Owl.

1631
02:31:37,340 --> 02:31:39,508
Yeah. Hold your horses.

1632
02:31:39,675 --> 02:31:41,259
Mr. Owl, you there?

1633
02:31:41,844 --> 02:31:43,220
Trick or treat.

1634
02:31:44,847 --> 02:31:46,431
You should've stayed retired, Owl.

1635
02:32:51,664 --> 02:32:53,248
I hate this.

1636
02:32:53,416 --> 02:32:57,627
Cowering in cave,
hiding from authorities.

1637
02:32:57,879 --> 02:33:01,089
Cops are out there hunting us.
Unless you wanna go back to prison...

1638
02:33:01,257 --> 02:33:03,717
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves
without a plan.

1639
02:33:03,885 --> 02:33:06,136
And what would that be?

1640
02:33:06,470 --> 02:33:10,182
Once we've established a pattern...

1641
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:12,726
...we can break into Pyramid,
see what we find.

1642
02:33:12,894 --> 02:33:15,312
Did that. Dead end.

1643
02:33:15,479 --> 02:33:20,108
I think it's a front company for whoever's
really behind it, but can't prove it.

1644
02:33:23,029 --> 02:33:27,365
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.

1645
02:33:27,533 --> 02:33:30,285
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1646
02:33:30,453 --> 02:33:32,579
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1647
02:33:32,747 --> 02:33:37,209
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

1648
02:33:37,376 --> 02:33:39,461
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

1649
02:33:39,629 --> 02:33:41,671
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

1650
02:33:41,839 --> 02:33:43,965
You live off people
while insulting them...

1651
02:33:44,133 --> 02:33:47,928
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

1652
02:33:59,899 --> 02:34:01,733
I'm sorry.

1653
02:34:04,403 --> 02:34:06,571
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1654
02:34:08,574 --> 02:34:09,908
Daniel...

1655
02:34:11,410 --> 02:34:13,870
...you are a good friend.

1656
02:34:16,749 --> 02:34:19,918
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1657
02:34:26,425 --> 02:34:27,926
Forget it.

1658
02:34:29,095 --> 02:34:30,762
It's okay, man.

1659
02:34:32,014 --> 02:34:33,640
Let's do it your way.

1660
02:34:52,702 --> 02:34:53,994
Oh, God.

1661
02:34:54,161 --> 02:34:58,540
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

1662
02:35:06,007 --> 02:35:07,507
Oh, you bastards.

1663
02:35:07,675 --> 02:35:10,760
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1664
02:35:11,971 --> 02:35:15,265
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

1665
02:35:16,976 --> 02:35:19,894
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1666
02:35:22,023 --> 02:35:24,190
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

1667
02:35:24,358 --> 02:35:28,862
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

1668
02:35:29,030 --> 02:35:30,697
No.

1669
02:35:32,074 --> 02:35:33,325
Yeah, yeah!

1670
02:35:33,492 --> 02:35:36,411
- I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
- You're a felon.

1671
02:35:36,579 --> 02:35:39,581
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1672
02:35:39,749 --> 02:35:43,460
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

1673
02:35:43,627 --> 02:35:47,255
- Told by whom?
- My contact, Miss Slater.

1674
02:35:47,423 --> 02:35:50,008
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

1675
02:35:50,176 --> 02:35:54,137
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

1676
02:35:54,305 --> 02:35:58,016
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

1677
02:36:02,146 --> 02:36:05,398
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1678
02:36:05,566 --> 02:36:08,276
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

1679
02:36:08,444 --> 02:36:09,486
Follow the money.

1680
02:36:09,653 --> 02:36:12,947
- former member of the
Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered...

1681
02:36:13,115 --> 02:36:15,450
...in his apartment less than
an hour ago.

1682
02:36:15,618 --> 02:36:19,704
Witnesses reported seeing members
of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops...

1683
02:36:19,872 --> 02:36:23,124
...leaving the area right around
the estimated time of death.

1684
02:36:23,292 --> 02:36:26,252
Reporting live, Tiffany Burns...

1685
02:36:28,589 --> 02:36:31,591
- Who did it?
- I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.

1686
02:36:31,759 --> 02:36:33,885
What about my civil rights?
Just because I'm wearing-

1687
02:36:34,053 --> 02:36:37,138
- Tell me who did it!
- A lot of people dress like this.

1688
02:36:38,474 --> 02:36:40,350
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

1689
02:36:46,023 --> 02:36:48,316
You tell your friends they're dead.

1690
02:36:48,484 --> 02:36:52,028
I'm gonna take out this entire
rat hole neighborhood.

1691
02:36:52,196 --> 02:36:54,697
I'll break your neck!

1692
02:36:55,282 --> 02:36:58,284
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

1693
02:36:58,869 --> 02:37:01,663
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

1694
02:37:11,715 --> 02:37:14,884
This is where we hold our conversation.

1695
02:37:15,511 --> 02:37:19,389
In it, you reveal to me that you and
Dreiberg have been sleeping together.

1696
02:37:20,558 --> 02:37:23,935
- You know about me and Dan?
- Not yet.

1697
02:37:24,228 --> 02:37:27,063
But in a few moments
you're going to tell me.

1698
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:34,446
If you already know the future, then why
were you surprised when I left you?

1699
02:37:34,613 --> 02:37:36,823
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

1700
02:37:36,991 --> 02:37:40,618
Why even argue about it
if you already know how this is gonna end?

1701
02:37:41,787 --> 02:37:44,038
I have no choice.

1702
02:37:45,374 --> 02:37:48,293
Everything is preordained.

1703
02:37:48,461 --> 02:37:50,795
Even my responses.

1704
02:37:51,755 --> 02:37:55,383
And you're just going through
the motions.

1705
02:37:55,551 --> 02:37:58,928
The most powerful thing in the universe
is still just a puppet.

1706
02:38:02,057 --> 02:38:04,726
We are all puppets, Laurie.

1707
02:38:05,686 --> 02:38:08,188
I'm just a puppet
who can see the strings.

1708
02:38:08,355 --> 02:38:10,064
And what if you're wrong?

1709
02:38:10,232 --> 02:38:14,736
Why does my perception of time
distress you so?

1710
02:38:14,904 --> 02:38:16,779
Because it's inhuman.

1711
02:38:16,947 --> 02:38:19,365
Because it makes me insane.

1712
02:38:19,533 --> 02:38:23,411
You always say you wanna comfort me.
Well, it isn't working.

1713
02:38:30,836 --> 02:38:33,338
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1714
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:37,592
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

1715
02:38:38,135 --> 02:38:40,178
You slept with Dan?

1716
02:38:41,889 --> 02:38:44,891
You just said that you already
knew about that.

1717
02:38:45,601 --> 02:38:49,604
I said often...

1718
02:38:50,272 --> 02:38:54,609
...that you were my only
remaining link to humanity.

1719
02:38:57,029 --> 02:38:58,530
Why would I save a world...

1720
02:38:58,697 --> 02:39:00,823
...I no longer have any stake in?

1721
02:39:02,952 --> 02:39:04,994
Then do it for me.

1722
02:39:05,871 --> 02:39:07,288
If you really care.

1723
02:39:07,456 --> 02:39:10,875
When you left me, I left Earth.

1724
02:39:11,043 --> 02:39:13,962
Does that not show you that I care?

1725
02:39:17,132 --> 02:39:20,093
My red world here, now...

1726
02:39:21,095 --> 02:39:23,972
...means more to me than your blue one.

1727
02:39:24,765 --> 02:39:26,474
Let me show you.

1728
02:39:44,618 --> 02:39:47,537
Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.

1729
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:59,132
It's time, gentlemen.

1730
02:40:01,218 --> 02:40:03,636
Take us to DEFCON one.

1731
02:40:10,894 --> 02:40:14,022
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1732
02:40:14,189 --> 02:40:17,066
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...

1733
02:40:17,234 --> 02:40:19,027
...out into the night at this hour?

1734
02:40:21,071 --> 02:40:22,947
Daniel?

1735
02:40:24,199 --> 02:40:25,950
You with me?

1736
02:40:26,744 --> 02:40:29,871
- Yeah.
- Then what are you doing?

1737
02:40:31,999 --> 02:40:33,750
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1738
02:40:33,917 --> 02:40:36,711
Maybe he keeps on file.

1739
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:43,676
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.

1740
02:40:43,844 --> 02:40:48,598
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

1741
02:40:48,766 --> 02:40:53,394
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

1742
02:40:53,562 --> 02:40:56,898
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

1743
02:40:57,066 --> 02:40:59,525
Setting Manhattan up.

1744
02:41:13,666 --> 02:41:14,832
Funny.

1745
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:18,503
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

1746
02:41:18,671 --> 02:41:23,716
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1747
02:41:24,343 --> 02:41:26,969
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1748
02:41:27,137 --> 02:41:28,388
Pharaohs?

1749
02:41:35,270 --> 02:41:37,271
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1750
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:40,400
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

1751
02:41:42,444 --> 02:41:44,946
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

1752
02:41:47,282 --> 02:41:50,326
If the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

1753
02:41:50,953 --> 02:41:54,914
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1754
02:41:59,002 --> 02:42:00,795
I'm in.

1755
02:42:29,658 --> 02:42:30,992
No.

1756
02:42:33,162 --> 02:42:38,916
Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

1757
02:42:39,084 --> 02:42:42,962
Your support and your enthusiasm...

1758
02:42:43,130 --> 02:42:45,423
...is what has led to this triumph.

1759
02:42:45,591 --> 02:42:49,635
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1760
02:42:49,803 --> 02:42:52,221
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1761
02:42:53,015 --> 02:42:57,143
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1762
02:42:58,061 --> 02:43:02,190
This is the new Karnak.

1763
02:43:02,357 --> 02:43:05,943
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

1764
02:43:06,111 --> 02:43:07,890
...a dream now assured

1765
02:43:08,900 --> 02:43:11,470
because of your unquestioning assistance.

1766
02:43:14,536 --> 02:43:16,204
And for this...

1767
02:43:17,039 --> 02:43:19,373
...I am ashamed...

1768
02:43:20,542 --> 02:43:24,879
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1769
02:43:26,548 --> 02:43:28,549
To the pharaohs...

1770
02:43:29,468 --> 02:43:32,470
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

1771
02:43:33,096 --> 02:43:37,433
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1772
02:43:38,310 --> 02:43:40,728
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1773
02:43:41,396 --> 02:43:44,732
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

1774
02:43:45,067 --> 02:43:47,610
...to your great sacrifice.

1775
02:43:48,570 --> 02:43:50,738
Bubastis.

1776
02:43:54,910 --> 02:43:57,912
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.

1777
02:43:58,247 --> 02:44:00,748
Veidt's behind everything.

1778
02:44:00,916 --> 02:44:02,542
Why?

1779
02:44:02,709 --> 02:44:04,752
What's his endgame?

1780
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:08,589
I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.

1781
02:44:08,799 --> 02:44:12,260
Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.

1782
02:44:12,427 --> 02:44:15,304
He could kill us both alone in the snow.

1783
02:44:15,472 --> 02:44:19,183
Antarctica.

1784
02:44:19,351 --> 02:44:22,103
Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading...

1785
02:44:22,271 --> 02:44:26,566
...I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.

1786
02:44:26,733 --> 02:44:29,277
I live my life free of compromise...

1787
02:44:29,444 --> 02:44:33,406
...and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.

1788
02:44:34,032 --> 02:44:37,034
Rorschach, November 1st.

1789
02:44:42,791 --> 02:44:45,209
Oh, God help us.

1790
02:44:48,297 --> 02:44:50,715
- It's a little early for you, huh?
- Yeah.

1791
02:44:50,883 --> 02:44:53,134
I wanted to finish
the story before school.

1792
02:44:58,599 --> 02:45:02,059
Listen, now you just keep it, okay?

1793
02:45:03,186 --> 02:45:05,813
- Huh?
- It's yours.

1794
02:45:05,981 --> 02:45:08,900
I mean, life's too short, right?

1795
02:45:09,151 --> 02:45:10,484
Yeah.

1796
02:45:10,819 --> 02:45:12,153
Uh...

1797
02:45:12,321 --> 02:45:13,905
Thanks, man.

1798
02:45:39,348 --> 02:45:41,682
Why does death pass me by?

1799
02:45:44,770 --> 02:45:46,437
Davidstown?

1800
02:45:47,689 --> 02:45:49,398
Davidstown.

1801
02:45:49,691 --> 02:45:52,109
I was only miles away.

1802
02:45:52,277 --> 02:45:54,028
By now the town was overrun.

1803
02:45:54,571 --> 02:45:57,615
The fiends imagined themselves
safe from me.

1804
02:45:57,783 --> 02:45:59,158
But now I was home.

1805
02:45:59,326 --> 02:46:01,702
And revenge would be mine.

1806
02:46:09,378 --> 02:46:12,088
No, not the brigands
from the Black Freighter.

1807
02:46:12,255 --> 02:46:15,383
The man I recognized,
a moneylender from Davidstown.

1808
02:46:15,759 --> 02:46:17,885
With Davidstown certainly captured...

1809
02:46:18,053 --> 02:46:21,222
...why would this scoundrel
and his wench be allowed free passage...

1810
02:46:21,390 --> 02:46:22,640
...for this midnight tryst?

1811
02:46:22,808 --> 02:46:24,058
Had he collaborated?

1812
02:46:24,226 --> 02:46:25,643
Had he betrayed my people?

1813
02:46:26,061 --> 02:46:28,813
- My family?
Come and get it, babe.

1814
02:46:29,272 --> 02:46:30,481
Here.

1815
02:46:39,574 --> 02:46:41,742
My heart grew cold.

1816
02:46:41,910 --> 02:46:45,079
Was my wife comforted
before her execution...

1817
02:46:45,247 --> 02:46:49,291
...while this collaborator
and his pirate masters sneered?

1818
02:46:49,751 --> 02:46:52,086
My decision was hurried,
but not difficult.

1819
02:46:52,254 --> 02:46:53,587
Who are you? What?

1820
02:46:56,258 --> 02:46:59,760
His head burst,
as if pressurized by the guilt within.

1821
02:47:09,312 --> 02:47:11,897
A buccaneer's whore deserves no pity.

1822
02:47:16,028 --> 02:47:18,195
Two figures had ridden here.

1823
02:47:18,363 --> 02:47:21,198
Two must ride back.

1824
02:47:25,328 --> 02:47:27,747
A pirate sentry.

1825
02:47:27,914 --> 02:47:32,001
I trotted unhurriedly to avoid suspicion.

1826
02:47:32,961 --> 02:47:36,088
Their violation did not stop
with the good people of Davidstown...

1827
02:47:36,256 --> 02:47:40,426
...but had cut deeply,
infecting my beloved homeland.

1828
02:47:40,594 --> 02:47:43,888
My Davidstown was not as I last saw it.

1829
02:47:44,056 --> 02:47:47,975
Already it was afflicted
with the curse of the Black Freighter.

1830
02:47:48,143 --> 02:47:51,750
Soon, I would venture amongst evil men,

1831
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,520
butchers who now reside in my home...

1832
02:47:54,649 --> 02:47:56,317
...and make them fear me.

1833
02:47:58,904 --> 02:48:03,824
Upon my return home,
I found the streets conspicuously silent.

1834
02:48:05,827 --> 02:48:08,662
I entered my former residence
noiselessly.

1835
02:48:09,331 --> 02:48:15,169
Careful not to rouse the pirate butchers
occupying it from their debauched slumber.

1836
02:48:21,009 --> 02:48:23,010
Unaware that death was amongst them...

1837
02:48:23,345 --> 02:48:28,432
...they would know its dark embrace
without ever understanding why.

1838
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:31,644
One, however, was awake. Frantic.

1839
02:48:31,812 --> 02:48:33,187
Lest he should raise alarms...

1840
02:48:33,355 --> 02:48:37,149
...I set upon him as he entered
the night-wrapped chamber.

1841
02:48:37,859 --> 02:48:39,902
No pirates come, but something worse.

1842
02:48:41,571 --> 02:48:42,613
Father?

1843
02:48:42,781 --> 02:48:47,409
I look up into faces familiar,
save for their terror.

1844
02:48:47,702 --> 02:48:51,038
Through puffed and bloodied lips,
she mouthed my name.

1845
02:48:51,206 --> 02:48:54,500
My love, why?

1846
02:48:59,005 --> 02:49:04,510
There came an understanding so large
it left no room for sanity.

1847
02:49:05,303 --> 02:49:07,012
So I ran.

1848
02:49:07,514 --> 02:49:09,390
What's happened to her?

1849
02:49:10,267 --> 02:49:11,725
You.

1850
02:49:13,061 --> 02:49:18,816
The knowledge of my damnation paced me,
shouting, celebrating its awful victory.

1851
02:49:18,984 --> 02:49:20,734
My deduction was flawless.

1852
02:49:20,902 --> 02:49:22,987
The Black Freighter
was heading to Davidstown.

1853
02:49:23,155 --> 02:49:26,031
- It should have arrived.
He went that way!

1854
02:49:26,825 --> 02:49:30,369
Can't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?

1855
02:49:31,329 --> 02:49:33,247
It ends with you in tears.

1856
02:49:33,415 --> 02:49:37,001
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

1857
02:49:37,169 --> 02:49:40,588
At some point, yes.

1858
02:49:41,673 --> 02:49:44,592
The streets are filled with death.

1859
02:49:44,759 --> 02:49:46,844
Jon, please.

1860
02:49:47,012 --> 02:49:51,599
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

1861
02:49:51,766 --> 02:49:56,103
And the universe will not even notice.

1862
02:49:58,523 --> 02:50:02,776
In my opinion, the existence of life...

1863
02:50:03,612 --> 02:50:06,614
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1864
02:50:08,533 --> 02:50:10,826
Just look around you.

1865
02:50:13,580 --> 02:50:17,917
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1866
02:50:18,543 --> 02:50:23,130
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

1867
02:50:23,298 --> 02:50:29,220
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

1868
02:50:30,055 --> 02:50:31,555
So tell me...

1869
02:50:31,723 --> 02:50:36,101
...how would all of this be greatly improved
by an oil pipeline?

1870
02:50:36,561 --> 02:50:38,562
By a shopping mall?

1871
02:50:42,901 --> 02:50:47,196
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1872
02:50:47,364 --> 02:50:49,490
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1873
02:50:49,658 --> 02:50:51,158
Oh, God, Jon!

1874
02:50:51,326 --> 02:50:56,413
- Only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit.

1875
02:50:57,499 --> 02:51:00,000
Land this thing. Now.

1876
02:51:00,168 --> 02:51:02,753
As you wish.

1877
02:51:08,343 --> 02:51:09,426
You know what?

1878
02:51:09,594 --> 02:51:12,304
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

1879
02:51:12,472 --> 02:51:14,848
...and all the other worthless humans.

1880
02:51:15,016 --> 02:51:18,435
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

1881
02:51:18,603 --> 02:51:22,773
nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1882
02:51:22,941 --> 02:51:28,195
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

1883
02:51:28,947 --> 02:51:32,700
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

1884
02:51:32,867 --> 02:51:37,288
- You shut out what you're afraid of.
- I'm not afraid.

1885
02:51:37,455 --> 02:51:42,501
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

1886
02:51:49,634 --> 02:51:54,722
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

1887
02:51:54,889 --> 02:51:57,975
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

1888
02:51:58,143 --> 02:52:00,269
I put food on the table
for you and your child.

1889
02:52:00,437 --> 02:52:03,230
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

1890
02:52:03,982 --> 02:52:06,692
Even the grimy parts of it...

1891
02:52:07,068 --> 02:52:09,278
...keep on getting brighter.

1892
02:52:09,612 --> 02:52:13,240
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1893
02:52:13,408 --> 02:52:17,828
- You got her eyes, you know. You got-
- Take your hands off her.

1894
02:52:17,996 --> 02:52:20,122
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1895
02:52:20,290 --> 02:52:23,083
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1896
02:52:23,585 --> 02:52:25,419
Now.

1897
02:52:26,421 --> 02:52:28,422
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1898
02:52:28,590 --> 02:52:32,426
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1899
02:52:33,094 --> 02:52:34,803
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1900
02:52:37,098 --> 02:52:38,432
Drive.

1901
02:52:44,439 --> 02:52:47,274
It was a mistake. One time.

1902
02:52:47,567 --> 02:52:50,736
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

1903
02:52:50,945 --> 02:52:53,655
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

1904
02:52:53,823 --> 02:52:56,784
Am I ever gonna live this down?

1905
02:53:00,121 --> 02:53:01,288
Laurie.

1906
02:53:06,127 --> 02:53:07,461
No.

1907
02:53:09,464 --> 02:53:11,965
No, not him.

1908
02:53:12,133 --> 02:53:14,259
The Comedian...

1909
02:53:14,636 --> 02:53:16,762
...was your father.

1910
02:53:18,223 --> 02:53:19,932
No.

1911
02:53:23,228 --> 02:53:28,941
No! No! No!

1912
02:54:01,516 --> 02:54:03,517
My life is just...

1913
02:54:04,185 --> 02:54:06,353
...one big joke.

1914
02:54:06,521 --> 02:54:09,064
I don't think your life is a joke.

1915
02:54:10,692 --> 02:54:12,693
Yeah, well...

1916
02:54:14,529 --> 02:54:18,699
...I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

1917
02:54:26,875 --> 02:54:28,542
Will you smile...

1918
02:54:30,211 --> 02:54:32,713
...if I admit I was wrong?

1919
02:54:35,550 --> 02:54:37,551
About what?

1920
02:54:39,554 --> 02:54:41,054
Miracles.

1921
02:54:42,724 --> 02:54:45,893
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

1922
02:54:46,728 --> 02:54:49,229
...like oxygen turning into gold.

1923
02:54:49,397 --> 02:54:54,234
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

1924
02:54:54,903 --> 02:54:57,279
...that in human coupling...

1925
02:54:58,072 --> 02:55:01,950
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

1926
02:55:02,410 --> 02:55:05,245
...for generation after generation...

1927
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:09,166
...until finally, your mother...

1928
02:55:09,542 --> 02:55:10,751
...loves a man...

1929
02:55:11,377 --> 02:55:14,963
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

1930
02:55:15,131 --> 02:55:19,134
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

1931
02:55:19,802 --> 02:55:21,720
...it's you-

1932
02:55:23,431 --> 02:55:24,765
Only...

1933
02:55:25,433 --> 02:55:26,934
...you.

1934
02:55:27,769 --> 02:55:29,061
that emerged.

1935
02:55:29,604 --> 02:55:34,107
To distill so specific a form...

1936
02:55:34,275 --> 02:55:36,568
...from all that chaos...

1937
02:55:38,446 --> 02:55:41,448
...is like turning air into gold.

1938
02:55:45,787 --> 02:55:47,788
A miracle.

1939
02:55:51,292 --> 02:55:52,793
And so...

1940
02:55:53,294 --> 02:55:55,128
...I was wrong.

1941
02:55:57,131 --> 02:56:00,968
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

1942
02:56:28,496 --> 02:56:32,541
We got a bearing on that artificial
structure. Heat signature's off the charts.

1943
02:56:33,501 --> 02:56:36,628
- Veidt.
- I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

1944
02:56:45,013 --> 02:56:47,848
- The engines.
- They're icing up. Hold onto something.

1945
02:56:48,641 --> 02:56:50,684
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

1946
02:56:53,521 --> 02:56:56,690
Don't wish to interfere,
but perhaps should pull up sharply-

1947
02:56:56,858 --> 02:57:00,819
I know! I'm trying.
I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

1948
02:57:28,056 --> 02:57:31,725
I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

1949
02:57:31,893 --> 02:57:34,728
...but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

1950
02:57:36,230 --> 02:57:37,731
You need something warmer.

1951
02:57:38,232 --> 02:57:40,400
Fine like this.

1952
02:58:09,931 --> 02:58:11,765
What is it, girl?

1953
02:58:14,102 --> 02:58:15,769
Mm.

1954
02:58:41,379 --> 02:58:43,630
Adrian's a pacifist.

1955
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:48,468
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.

1956
02:58:48,636 --> 02:58:50,053
Hitler was vegetarian.

1957
02:58:50,221 --> 02:58:54,766
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

1958
03:00:06,005 --> 03:00:07,339
Gentlemen.

1959
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:11,760
- Welcome.
- Adrian, we know everything.

1960
03:00:11,928 --> 03:00:13,720
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

1961
03:00:13,888 --> 03:00:16,890
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

1962
03:00:17,058 --> 03:00:18,558
May he rest in peace.

1963
03:00:19,060 --> 03:00:21,686
Blake figured it out first.

1964
03:00:21,854 --> 03:00:25,899
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure we weren't rocking the boat.

1965
03:00:26,859 --> 03:00:29,110
Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak...

1966
03:00:29,278 --> 03:00:33,365
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.

1967
03:00:33,533 --> 03:00:36,785
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one
to have a change of heart.

1968
03:00:37,537 --> 03:00:39,079
So...

1969
03:00:40,081 --> 03:00:42,040
...I had to kill him.

1970
03:00:42,583 --> 03:00:46,378
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

1971
03:00:46,546 --> 03:00:49,005
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

1972
03:00:49,173 --> 03:00:51,216
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

1973
03:00:51,384 --> 03:00:53,635
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

1974
03:00:54,136 --> 03:00:55,595
Got him to leave the planet.

1975
03:00:55,763 --> 03:00:59,182
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

1976
03:00:59,350 --> 03:01:03,270
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

1977
03:01:03,437 --> 03:01:05,272
...he might as well have been sobbing.

1978
03:01:05,606 --> 03:01:08,775
All I needed to do was tug on the thread.

1979
03:01:08,943 --> 03:01:10,819
The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...

1980
03:01:10,987 --> 03:01:14,614
...when he came to believe
he'd given cancer to the people he loved...

1981
03:01:14,782 --> 03:01:16,908
...was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.

1982
03:01:17,076 --> 03:01:20,912
Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.

1983
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:25,750
Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.

1984
03:01:27,879 --> 03:01:30,964
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...

1985
03:01:31,132 --> 03:01:33,758
...leaving only one loose end:

1986
03:01:34,343 --> 03:01:37,804
You, and your mask-killer theory...

1987
03:01:37,972 --> 03:01:41,099
...one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.

1988
03:01:41,267 --> 03:01:42,976
I tipped off the police.

1989
03:01:43,144 --> 03:01:45,520
Once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

1990
03:01:45,688 --> 03:01:48,315
Sorry to disappoint you.

1991
03:02:01,495 --> 03:02:03,997
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

1992
03:02:04,165 --> 03:02:05,874
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

1993
03:02:06,042 --> 03:02:07,375
Nuclear war?

1994
03:02:07,543 --> 03:02:09,711
Human extinction?

1995
03:02:19,347 --> 03:02:24,267
Of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

1996
03:02:24,435 --> 03:02:27,395
A few key regions around the globe-

1997
03:02:27,563 --> 03:02:33,026
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

1998
03:02:33,194 --> 03:02:34,861
disintegrated in an instant.

1999
03:02:35,613 --> 03:02:38,949
Fifteen million people killed...

2000
03:02:39,116 --> 03:02:41,201
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2001
03:02:42,370 --> 03:02:45,205
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War III.

2002
03:02:45,373 --> 03:02:46,498
Jon wouldn't do that.

2003
03:02:47,041 --> 03:02:49,751
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

2004
03:02:50,378 --> 03:02:54,214
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

2005
03:02:54,799 --> 03:02:58,802
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

2006
03:02:58,970 --> 03:03:01,513
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

2007
03:03:01,681 --> 03:03:03,682
You see...

2008
03:03:04,558 --> 03:03:06,977
...the Comedian was right.

2009
03:03:07,687 --> 03:03:12,691
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

2010
03:03:12,858 --> 03:03:15,652
So in order to save this planet...

2011
03:03:15,903 --> 03:03:17,988
...I had to trick it...

2012
03:03:18,364 --> 03:03:22,409
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

2013
03:03:22,660 --> 03:03:26,079
- Killing millions.
- To save billions.

2014
03:03:26,580 --> 03:03:28,581
A necessary crime.

2015
03:03:28,749 --> 03:03:30,917
You know we can't let you do that.

2016
03:03:32,336 --> 03:03:34,462
"Do that," Rorschach?

2017
03:03:34,630 --> 03:03:36,256
I'm not a comic-book villain.

2018
03:03:37,091 --> 03:03:39,384
Do you think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

2019
03:03:39,552 --> 03:03:43,722
...if there were even the slightest
possibility you could affect the outcome?

2020
03:03:46,434 --> 03:03:49,269
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

2021
03:04:13,419 --> 03:04:18,840
Eventually, I came to a dismal
black ocean stretching endlessly before me.

2022
03:04:19,592 --> 03:04:22,969
How had I reached
this appalling position with love...

2023
03:04:23,137 --> 03:04:26,139
...only love, as my guide?

2024
03:04:27,767 --> 03:04:30,852
The moneylender floated at my feet.

2025
03:04:31,020 --> 03:04:33,813
Noble intentions had led me to atrocity.

2026
03:04:33,981 --> 03:04:37,560
The righteous anger fueling
my ingenious, awful scheme

2027
03:04:37,850 --> 03:04:39,702
was but delusion.

2028
03:04:40,362 --> 03:04:42,322
Where was my error?

2029
03:04:42,740 --> 03:04:47,827
Planning to resume my flight,
I raised my head and saw her.

2030
03:04:50,122 --> 03:04:54,542
The vessel seemed to be waiting,
not hovering to strike.

2031
03:04:54,710 --> 03:04:58,880
And, gradually, I understood
what innocent intent had brought me to...

2032
03:04:59,799 --> 03:05:02,509
...and waded out beyond my depth.

2033
03:05:03,677 --> 03:05:06,679
The unspeakable truth
loomed unavoidably before me...

2034
03:05:06,847 --> 03:05:09,724
...as I swam
towards the anchored Freighter.

2035
03:05:09,892 --> 03:05:14,229
Its dark and lurching mast
filled all my vision.

2036
03:05:14,396 --> 03:05:17,357
All my well-meaning plans
had come to this.

2037
03:05:17,525 --> 03:05:21,319
The world I tried to save
was lost beyond recall.

2038
03:05:22,196 --> 03:05:24,030
A rope snaked down.

2039
03:05:24,198 --> 03:05:26,366
Sputtering, I grabbed it.

2040
03:05:26,534 --> 03:05:29,202
And from the decks above,
a cheer went up...

2041
03:05:29,370 --> 03:05:33,748
...both gross and black,
its stench affronting heaven.

2042
03:05:36,544 --> 03:05:38,920
There had been no plan
to capture Davidstown.

2043
03:05:39,755 --> 03:05:43,800
They'd come to wait until they could collect
the only prize they valued.

2044
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:48,138
Claim the only soul they truly wanted.

2045
03:05:54,145 --> 03:05:56,229
I was a horror.

2046
03:05:57,064 --> 03:06:00,400
Amongst horrors must I dwell.

2047
03:06:09,910 --> 03:06:13,913
- Man, this shit don't make no sense.
- You're telling me.

2048
03:06:15,249 --> 03:06:18,585
Sorry, but you can keep this garbage.
Wasting all my damn time.

2049
03:06:18,752 --> 03:06:21,921
Hey, hey. You know, all this time
you've been coming here...

2050
03:06:22,089 --> 03:06:23,590
...I never caught your name.

2051
03:06:25,301 --> 03:06:28,303
- Bernard.
- Bernard? You're kidding.

2052
03:06:28,470 --> 03:06:32,557
That's- Heh. That's my name too.

2053
03:06:33,184 --> 03:06:36,436
Not that big a deal.
There's lots of people called Bernard.

2054
03:08:01,647 --> 03:08:04,649
Jesus Christ, Henry.

2055
03:08:04,817 --> 03:08:07,026
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

2056
03:08:08,904 --> 03:08:13,366
It's not the Soviets, sir.

2057
03:08:13,909 --> 03:08:17,078
Intel indicates the energy signature...

2058
03:08:17,246 --> 03:08:19,706
...was generated by...

2059
03:08:20,666 --> 03:08:23,084
...Dr. Manhattan.

2060
03:08:25,921 --> 03:08:27,505
Jon.

2061
03:08:30,509 --> 03:08:31,634
Interference.

2062
03:08:32,219 --> 03:08:34,137
Cataclysmic interference.

2063
03:08:43,856 --> 03:08:46,607
I can't believe it happened.

2064
03:08:47,609 --> 03:08:51,112
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

2065
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:56,492
It was me.

2066
03:08:58,537 --> 03:09:00,121
I...

2067
03:09:00,706 --> 03:09:01,748
...did this.

2068
03:09:02,374 --> 03:09:05,835
- What do you mean, you did this?
- Not directly.

2069
03:09:06,795 --> 03:09:09,505
It was made to look like I did it.

2070
03:09:12,551 --> 03:09:13,968
Adrian.

2071
03:09:20,267 --> 03:09:22,268
Speak of the devil.

2072
03:09:25,397 --> 03:09:26,439
Jon-
I know.

2073
03:09:26,607 --> 03:09:28,775
Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

2074
03:09:28,942 --> 03:09:30,276
Wait here.

2075
03:09:41,413 --> 03:09:43,790
Adrian, stop this.

2076
03:09:45,250 --> 03:09:47,126
The tachyons were clever...

2077
03:09:48,253 --> 03:09:52,590
...but even if I can't predict where you
are, I can turn the walls to glass.

2078
03:09:53,926 --> 03:09:56,386
I should thank you.

2079
03:09:57,554 --> 03:10:00,765
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

2080
03:10:01,767 --> 03:10:04,769
...the delights of uncertainty.

2081
03:10:08,941 --> 03:10:10,608
Forgive me, girl.

2082
03:10:33,549 --> 03:10:35,258
You're such an asshole.

2083
03:11:09,209 --> 03:11:11,127
Veidt, you bastard.

2084
03:11:11,295 --> 03:11:13,754
- If you've hurt her, I'll-
- Dan...

2085
03:11:15,507 --> 03:11:20,094
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

2086
03:11:20,262 --> 03:11:22,263
Your...

2087
03:11:22,431 --> 03:11:27,393
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

2088
03:11:29,021 --> 03:11:31,898
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

2089
03:11:32,858 --> 03:11:35,234
...is your only triumph.

2090
03:11:35,444 --> 03:11:37,361
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

2091
03:11:38,155 --> 03:11:41,657
I'm very disappointed.

2092
03:11:54,046 --> 03:11:57,215
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

2093
03:11:57,883 --> 03:12:00,259
It didn't kill Osterman.

2094
03:12:02,888 --> 03:12:05,264
Did you really think it would kill me?

2095
03:12:06,558 --> 03:12:09,727
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

2096
03:12:10,229 --> 03:12:13,397
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

2097
03:12:13,565 --> 03:12:16,609
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

2098
03:12:16,777 --> 03:12:20,446
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

2099
03:12:21,573 --> 03:12:24,075
The world's smartest man...

2100
03:12:24,368 --> 03:12:26,786
...poses no more threat to me...

2101
03:12:26,954 --> 03:12:30,122
...than does its smartest termite.

2102
03:12:32,376 --> 03:12:33,834
What's that?

2103
03:12:34,253 --> 03:12:36,128
Another ultimate weapon?

2104
03:12:36,755 --> 03:12:38,464
Yes.

2105
03:12:40,092 --> 03:12:41,551
You could say that.

2106
03:12:45,097 --> 03:12:47,014
came under attack.

2107
03:12:47,849 --> 03:12:51,185
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

2108
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:56,732
...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2109
03:12:58,527 --> 03:13:02,488
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...

2110
03:13:02,656 --> 03:13:05,658
...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

2111
03:13:06,034 --> 03:13:08,869
Putting aside our past differences...

2112
03:13:09,204 --> 03:13:11,372
...we have both pledged to unite...

2113
03:13:11,707 --> 03:13:15,042
...against this common enemy.

2114
03:13:15,544 --> 03:13:17,545
With the rest of the world...

2115
03:13:18,005 --> 03:13:20,006
...we will prevail.

2116
03:13:22,551 --> 03:13:25,553
This is a day we shall never forget.

2117
03:13:25,721 --> 03:13:29,932
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

2118
03:13:30,100 --> 03:13:34,729
...and all that is good
and just in our world.

2119
03:13:36,064 --> 03:13:40,318
Thank you. God bless us all.

2120
03:13:40,694 --> 03:13:42,486
Do you see?

2121
03:13:44,698 --> 03:13:47,158
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2122
03:13:48,744 --> 03:13:51,203
I've saved the earth from hell.

2123
03:13:51,371 --> 03:13:53,331
We both have.

2124
03:13:53,790 --> 03:13:56,000
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

2125
03:14:00,797 --> 03:14:02,298
Now we can return...

2126
03:14:03,717 --> 03:14:05,301
...do what we were meant to.

2127
03:14:05,552 --> 03:14:08,429
We were meant to exact justice.

2128
03:14:08,764 --> 03:14:12,099
- Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
- Will they?

2129
03:14:12,267 --> 03:14:17,063
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

2130
03:14:17,230 --> 03:14:20,691
- Peace based on a lie.
- But peace...

2131
03:14:20,859 --> 03:14:23,069
- ...nonetheless.
- He's right.

2132
03:14:23,612 --> 03:14:27,573
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

2133
03:14:27,741 --> 03:14:30,618
No. We can't do this.

2134
03:14:30,786 --> 03:14:32,578
On Mars...

2135
03:14:34,081 --> 03:14:35,915
...you taught me the value of life.

2136
03:14:36,875 --> 03:14:39,293
If we hope to preserve it here...

2137
03:14:40,087 --> 03:14:42,129
...we must remain silent.

2138
03:14:45,967 --> 03:14:47,927
Keep your own secrets.

2139
03:14:54,768 --> 03:14:55,976
Don't even think about it.

2140
03:14:58,605 --> 03:15:00,314
Rorschach.

2141
03:15:02,109 --> 03:15:03,609
Wait.

2142
03:15:04,653 --> 03:15:06,779
Never compromise.

2143
03:15:07,114 --> 03:15:09,990
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2144
03:15:10,409 --> 03:15:13,411
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

2145
03:15:24,464 --> 03:15:27,967
I've made myself feel every death...

2146
03:15:29,469 --> 03:15:35,349
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

2147
03:15:40,939 --> 03:15:44,650
- You understand, don't you?
Without condoning...

2148
03:15:46,319 --> 03:15:48,195
...or condemning...

2149
03:15:52,617 --> 03:15:54,535
...I understand.

2150
03:16:01,960 --> 03:16:05,087
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2151
03:16:05,964 --> 03:16:07,882
You know I can't let you do that.

2152
03:16:09,134 --> 03:16:12,136
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2153
03:16:13,555 --> 03:16:15,389
Convenient.

2154
03:16:24,107 --> 03:16:28,694
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

2155
03:16:32,449 --> 03:16:35,409
I can change almost anything...

2156
03:16:39,998 --> 03:16:42,333
...but I can't change human nature.

2157
03:16:43,668 --> 03:16:47,046
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

2158
03:16:48,340 --> 03:16:51,675
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

2159
03:16:57,849 --> 03:16:59,725
Well, what are you waiting for?

2160
03:17:03,188 --> 03:17:05,022
Do it.

2161
03:17:11,112 --> 03:17:12,154
Do it!

2162
03:17:14,866 --> 03:17:18,244
No!

2163
03:17:35,720 --> 03:17:41,475
I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

2164
03:17:41,643 --> 03:17:44,144
I thought you said you cared
about life again.

2165
03:17:44,312 --> 03:17:45,729
I do.

2166
03:17:47,065 --> 03:17:49,942
I think maybe I'll create some.

2167
03:17:54,072 --> 03:17:56,407
Goodbye, Laurie.

2168
03:18:31,651 --> 03:18:32,818
Come on.

2169
03:18:35,280 --> 03:18:36,864
Come on!

2170
03:18:41,286 --> 03:18:42,620
Dan...

2171
03:18:43,079 --> 03:18:45,831
...a world united and at peace.

2172
03:18:46,708 --> 03:18:47,917
There had to be sacrifice.

2173
03:18:48,084 --> 03:18:52,463
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

2174
03:18:52,631 --> 03:18:54,381
You've mutilated it.

2175
03:18:54,758 --> 03:18:56,926
That's your legacy.

2176
03:19:05,477 --> 03:19:08,270
That's the real practical joke.

2177
03:20:00,865 --> 03:20:04,868
We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.

2178
03:20:05,036 --> 03:20:08,497
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

2179
03:20:08,665 --> 03:20:11,834
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...

2180
03:20:12,002 --> 03:20:17,798
...which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

2181
03:20:19,009 --> 03:20:21,218
Sure you don't want a drink?

2182
03:20:22,220 --> 03:20:23,262
I'm okay.

2183
03:20:24,305 --> 03:20:25,556
Cheers.

2184
03:20:26,975 --> 03:20:30,102
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

2185
03:20:31,396 --> 03:20:33,897
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

2186
03:20:36,901 --> 03:20:38,652
Laurel.

2187
03:20:39,654 --> 03:20:41,989
What you must think of me.

2188
03:20:42,824 --> 03:20:45,367
I'm sorry I never told you.

2189
03:20:45,535 --> 03:20:47,327
I should have...

2190
03:20:47,495 --> 03:20:51,623
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

2191
03:20:51,791 --> 03:20:53,751
It doesn't matter.

2192
03:20:54,586 --> 03:20:59,840
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

2193
03:21:00,425 --> 03:21:03,343
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

2194
03:21:03,511 --> 03:21:05,846
I know how that is...

2195
03:21:06,598 --> 03:21:09,183
...but I just want you to know...

2196
03:21:09,768 --> 03:21:12,603
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

2197
03:21:16,775 --> 03:21:21,028
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

2198
03:21:22,614 --> 03:21:25,115
Because he gave me you.

2199
03:21:30,121 --> 03:21:31,205
Thanks, Mom.

2200
03:21:33,958 --> 03:21:35,751
I love you.

2201
03:21:43,301 --> 03:21:47,513
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

2202
03:21:49,140 --> 03:21:53,727
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

2203
03:22:04,239 --> 03:22:08,408
- So how's it going up here?
- Good. How's it going down there?

2204
03:22:08,576 --> 03:22:12,079
Good. I think I've got everything working.

2205
03:22:12,247 --> 03:22:16,875
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

2206
03:22:17,043 --> 03:22:19,294
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

2207
03:22:19,462 --> 03:22:22,548
Well, that sounds like a date.

2208
03:22:33,852 --> 03:22:36,103
Are we gonna be all right?

2209
03:22:38,189 --> 03:22:42,484
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

2210
03:22:42,694 --> 03:22:44,570
...in the end.

2211
03:22:46,197 --> 03:22:48,365
I know what Jon would say:

2212
03:22:48,533 --> 03:22:50,576
Nothing ends.

2213
03:22:52,453 --> 03:22:55,080
Nothing ever ends.

2214
03:23:42,420 --> 03:23:46,173
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

2215
03:23:46,341 --> 03:23:47,716
Everyone in the country...

2216
03:23:47,884 --> 03:23:50,135
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

2217
03:23:50,303 --> 03:23:53,597
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

2218
03:23:54,098 --> 03:23:56,975
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

2219
03:23:57,143 --> 03:24:01,063
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

2220
03:24:01,231 --> 03:24:03,065
We could run a piece on that.

2221
03:24:03,233 --> 03:24:06,401
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

2222
03:24:06,569 --> 03:24:10,405
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

2223
03:24:11,157 --> 03:24:15,369
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

2224
03:24:15,536 --> 03:24:17,162
Crank file.

2225
03:24:17,330 --> 03:24:19,331
Whatever. Take some initiative.

2226
03:24:19,499 --> 03:24:22,125
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

2227
03:24:28,633 --> 03:24:33,345
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

2228
03:24:33,513 --> 03:24:37,975
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
