1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,280
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,400
I found this when I was in the city.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,160
Penguin's licenses.
Apparently crime is legal now.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,280
I got a license.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,360
I am not giving the city
over to Penguin.

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,840
I don't care
what the commissioner says.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,400
Oswald Cobblepot keeps
your friends safe. Not the G.C.P.D.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,880
- Is Barbara around?
- No. And she's not coming back.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
I want more.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,680
Jonathan Crane's father
created a toxin

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,080
that makes people see
their greatest fear.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,240
Jonathan, you're going
with these men.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,960
Now, you gonna take
your daddy's notebooks

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,400
and make as much of that fear juice
as I say.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Oh, no.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,680
Gotham police! You're under arrest!

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,200
- Crane?
- Jonathan Crane isn't here anymore.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,680
It's just the Scarecrow.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,520
This is where Merton said
they would be.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,480
Let's go, everybody. Stay sharp.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,240
There's no one here.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,800
They're long gone by now.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
This place smells like death.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,320
Reminds me there's a Thai joint not
far away,

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
if you wanna grab something
to eat after.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,320
Very funny.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
It's the toxin.
They've made more of it.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,640
Looky here.
An asylum uniform. 1109.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,520
That's Crane's number, right?

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,240
He's coming!

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Who?

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,800
Scarecrow!

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,520
Right, thank you very much, officer.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,720
{\an5}Alfred, you need to explain
this was just a misunderstanding.

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
{\an5}Worry not, Master Bruce,
we have Wayne Enterprise's

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,960
{\an5}most talented and expensive lawyer
on the case.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,080
{\an5}He'll have you out in a jiffy.
How'd they nick you, anyway?

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
{\an5}I fell through the skylight.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,400
{\an5}These thieves must have triggered
an alarm.

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,960
{\an5}The police were quick to respond.
I wasn't expecting that, Alfred.

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,320
{\an5}Well, you could have broken
your bloody neck.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,160
{\an5}I had them red-handed.

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,600
{\an5}- If I could've only...
- Only what?

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
{\an5}Only taken on an entire crew
twice your size?

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
{\an5}Perhaps, yes.

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,840
Well, here's something
you don't see every day.

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
{\an5}Bruce Wayne behind bars.

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
There's been a terrible mistake,
Detective Gordon.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,400
{\an5}I fell from the roof into a robbery
in progress. I wasn't breaking in.

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,320
{\an5}Is that so?
Why were you up on the roof?

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640
{\an5}I was looking for Selina Kyle.

52
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
{\an5}I see.

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,440
{\an5}Yes. We will, of course, have our
lawyer post bail, Detective Gordon.

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,960
{\an5}I hardly think that's necessary.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,320
{\an5}We'll talk more about this, Bruce.

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
{\an5}But not tonight.

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
{\an5}Thank you, detective.

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
{\an5}Thank you.

59
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,080
{\an5}<i>Locking them up.</i>

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,480
{\an5}<i>Everybody in bed. Everybody in bed.</i>

61
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,040
Covering your dirty footprints,
Warden?

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,480
It's too late, I'm afraid.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,720
Your dirty deeds have stained you.

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,280
- How did you get in here?
- Come on.

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,920
You don't spend three years
in this hellish place

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,680
without picking up a thing or two.

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
Jonathan?

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,600
That's right. I'm not the same
frightened boy you threw in a cell.

69
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,240
No treatments, no therapy.

70
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,640
Just some ice baths and some
electric shocks once in a while.

71
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,880
You know, you could just leave.
I wouldn't tell anyone.

72
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,240
I don't wanna leave, Warden.

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,760
- Now, Warden, pay attention!
- Yeah.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,080
I cured myself.

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
You see, I feared the scarecrow.

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,240
And now we are one.

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,280
Jonathan, please, if you'll just...

78
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,320
You're not listening to me, Warden!

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,440
Jonathan Crane is no more.

80
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
Call me by my true name.

81
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
The Scarecrow.

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,760
Rough night, Bruce?

83
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,400
- Get into a fight?
- No, he fell through a skylight.

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,240
He was on the rooftop
talking to Selina Kyle.

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Bloody teenagers, eh?

86
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,160
But your clothes. Looks more like
concrete and stone residue, though.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,080
- What were you doing before that?
- Rock climbing.

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
- Rock climbing.
- Yes, we were rock climbing.

89
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,920
Alfred's been teaching me.

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,720
At the rock faces
in the south gardens.

91
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,320
Taken to it like a duck to water,
he has.

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,120
But we've gotta plod on, Mr. Fox.

93
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,440
Of course. Sorry to have kept you.

94
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,800
Be careful on those rocks, Bruce.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
It's a dangerous sport.

96
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,320
We will, Mr. Fox. We will.

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,960
Did you know my father was a genius?

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,080
He wanted to end fear for my sake.

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Because he loved me.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,760
So tell me, what do you fear, Warden?

101
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
Something from your childhood, maybe?

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,880
Face your fears.

103
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Face your fears and defeat them.

104
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,680
What? No.

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,840
Brothers and sisters, look at you.

106
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,800
Prisoners, all of you.

107
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,480
My father would have freed you.

108
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,400
But he was killed.
Murdered by the G.C.P.D.

109
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Men who couldn't understand.

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
But they will.

111
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,960
For you will be my army.

112
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,840
And those men who killed my father
shall truly know fear.

113
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,680
James Gordon!

114
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,200
James Gordon!

115
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
There you are.

116
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,480
- Play nice.
- No.

117
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,600
I see you've caught one of them.
What about the other fellow?

118
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,520
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

119
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,960
Jonathan Crane?

120
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,360
People share with me because
they trust me to get things done.

121
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
Unlike you.

122
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,080
So this boy who created this lethal
toxin which almost killed me,

123
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
where is he?

124
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,320
Whereabouts unknown, for now.

125
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,120
Why am I not surprised?

126
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,720
I mean, really, the only thing
the G.C.P.D. knows

127
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,280
how to do well is fail.

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,640
What is a penguin,
a bird or a mammal?

129
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,960
Bird. It is a bird.

130
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Like a chicken?

131
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,720
Time and time again,
the G.C.P.D. expose themselves

132
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,960
for what they truly are.

133
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,960
An outdated, ineffectual,
and corrupt institution.

134
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,680
How much longer must our citizens
suffer their incompetence?

135
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,600
This, coming from a man
who takes money

136
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,400
from criminals in exchange
for a license

137
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,680
allowing them to victimize
innocent people.

138
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,840
And it is working.

139
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,200
Jim, why can't you see that

140
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,680
I am not here to destroy your
beloved G.C.P.D., but to save it.

141
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,400
And, through that, Gotham.

142
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Your licenses are illegal

143
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,080
and I will arrest anyone
I find who is issued one.

144
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,200
So sure your Boy Scout morality
can protect this city, Jim?

145
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,280
How well has that worked in the past?

146
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,880
Should I list the victims
of your antiquated righteousness?

147
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,560
Instead, let me make you a deal.

148
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Find this Jonathan Crane
and lock him up within 24 hours

149
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,480
or admit to me, your subordinates,
and the people of Gotham

150
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,120
that you failed,

151
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,360
and allow me to clean this city up!

152
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Good for you, Jim.

153
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Game on.

154
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
What are you doing here?

155
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,400
Have I taught you nothing?

156
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
I could've slit your throat
before you even saw me.

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,240
I found this on the door
this morning.

158
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,760
<i>"An Opportunity Awaits."</i>

159
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,280
Someone left this inside last night.

160
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,800
Thank you for coming, ladies.

161
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,000
No way.

162
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
I saw you die.

163
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
That so?

164
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
It is Gotham.

165
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
- Check for a pulse next time.
- I will.

166
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Right after I slit your throat.

167
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,040
So, what happened to you?

168
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,200
Long story.

169
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Right now, all you need to know
is that I'm back.

170
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,600
And like the card says,

171
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,120
an opportunity awaits you.

172
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,000
A new beginning.

173
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
You sure you want to get this close?

174
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Please hear me out.

175
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,760
Not a day goes by
where I don't think about what I did.

176
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,040
If I could take it back,
trust me, I would.

177
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,720
I wouldn't mind a do-over myself.

178
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,720
Perhaps I'll finish the job
this time.

179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,880
I was jealous.

180
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
I was stupid.

181
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,000
I am sorry.

182
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,960
Kill me if you don't believe me.

183
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,640
So, is this your place now?

184
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,400
This is our place.

185
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,800
Another club? In Gotham?

186
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
How original.

187
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,360
It's not a club.

188
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,040
Penguin's taking over.

189
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Like it or not,

190
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,640
every criminal in the city
is gonna go to him for a license

191
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,160
to mug, steal, or blow stuff up.

192
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,920
Those criminals
are gonna need supplies,

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,640
and that is where we come in.

194
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,520
Not only will we be able
to facilitate these lowlifes,

195
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,280
but we'll also find out
what they're planning

196
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
and how it's going down.

197
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,120
But I will not go forward
without you both.

198
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,240
This is our way back on top.

199
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
No.

200
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,880
What you took from me,

201
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,760
I will never be able to get back.

202
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,520
Just feel lucky I don't burn
this place to the ground.

203
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
This will be good for all of us.

204
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
Please talk to her.

205
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,360
I don't want to hear it, Alfred.

206
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,560
I'm going back out there.

207
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm not gonna let this trail go cold.

208
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,200
Far be it from me to stop you,
Master Bruce.

209
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
- You're not coming?
- No, sir.

210
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
And why not?

211
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Because, as last night proved, you...

212
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
are simply not ready.

213
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,920
Yeah, you can chuck a punch,
you can block one.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,280
You're quick on your toes,
I'll give you that.

215
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,760
What if they got guns, Master Bruce?

216
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,520
Out there, Alfred, I feel more alive
than I've ever felt before.

217
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Do you understand that?

218
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,240
And that is precisely
why I am not stopping you, sir.

219
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,240
But you'll excuse me
if I don't want to stand by

220
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,520
and watch you get shot.

221
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,320
Hey. The mental asylum's under siege.

222
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
The lunatics are running riot.

223
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,800
The guards called it in
before they bolted for the hills.

224
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,040
- Crane?
- He made more toxins, right?

225
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,480
What happens when you dose
a hundred nut-jobs?

226
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
All right, listen up!

227
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,560
There's a riot at the asylum!

228
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,520
I need as many of you as can come!

229
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Who's with me?

230
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,520
Good luck with that.

231
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,440
You really think Penguin
is gonna make this go away?

232
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
He's just getting rich off
the same lowlifes

233
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,640
you guys used to hate as much as me!

234
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,560
Forget it.

235
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,800
Not one of you is fit to wear
the badge.

236
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,760
This badge gets us spat on
and shot at every day!

237
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
For what?

238
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,240
What difference have we made
out there?

239
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,680
- Yeah, he's right.
- That's what I'm saying.

240
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Let's go, Harvey.

241
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Come on. Don't do this.

242
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I told you, one day,
that you would say, "Now or never."

243
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,000
And I would say, "Never."
Well, today is that day.

244
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,200
If I go with you, I lose them.

245
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,120
And then who's gonna be
the new captain, huh?

246
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
Because it's damn well gonna be
someone Penguin chooses.

247
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,840
So I am sorry, partner,
but you are on your own on this one.

248
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Yeah.

249
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,760
G.C.P.D.!

250
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,560
G.C.P.D.

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,800
I'm not scared of you anymore!
You see, I am you!

252
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,760
It's you.

253
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
You came.

254
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,920
<i>Brothers and sisters,
the enemy is here.</i>

255
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Crap.

256
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,040
<i>Tonight, Detective, you will pay
for what you've done.</i>

257
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,400
<i>Tonight, you will know fear.</i>

258
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,840
Get him.

259
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,080
Keep going, keep going.

260
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,560
All right, Mr. Cop,

261
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,720
let's have some real fun.

262
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,360
My, my!

263
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,080
Well, come on in, I guess.

264
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,920
Word was you were dead.

265
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,280
Imagine my surprise when I hear
you've popped back up,

266
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,720
alive, and gone and opened
a brand-new business.

267
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,240
We're not open yet.

268
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,440
Looks pretty open to me.

269
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,960
Yeah, I'd say it's open.

270
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Hot damn, it's like Christmas.

271
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,320
Which is upsetting, because this was
definitely something

272
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,080
you would want to run by me first.

273
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
Is it, now?

274
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,120
Oh, yes, absolutely.

275
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
All enterprises pertaining
to the criminal underworld shall,

276
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,160
from this time forth,
be approved, monitored,

277
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,760
and taxed by me.

278
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,800
My apologies.

279
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,280
I'm still waiting for my partners
to come aboard.

280
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,600
Who?

281
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Tabitha?

282
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Selina?

283
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,320
- Perhaps.
- Well, good luck with that.

284
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,880
Slippery characters,
the both of them.

285
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,280
Also, people can often carry grudges
after you shoot their boyfriends.

286
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
I could talk to them, if you want.

287
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,280
I distinctly remember saying
you could come

288
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,040
if you kept your mouth shut.

289
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,960
You will need an operating license,
obviously.

290
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,480
Then pay a weapon tax.

291
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,440
- Weapon tax?
- And then,

292
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,880
perhaps your little store can open.

293
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,200
Well, you don't ask
for much now, do you?

294
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,800
I am not asking for enough.

295
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
Let me be absolutely clear,
Miss Kean.

296
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,640
I will be keeping
a very close eye on you.

297
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,760
The first rumor I hear about you
and your little partners

298
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,680
making moves to contest me,
and Victor...

299
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,520
will end you
with your own merchandise.

300
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,320
Understood.

301
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Couldn't have been cheap.

302
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
I'm sorry?

303
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,840
You lost your money
on The Sirens Club,

304
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,160
then went missing.

305
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,400
Rumor was you were dead.

306
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,640
And now you're back
with a brand-new fancy place.

307
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Who paid for it?

308
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,920
You really think
I won't find out who it is?

309
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,840
I'm gonna take this.

310
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Crane?

311
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,280
Do you believe in fate?

312
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:46,320
I didn't before today, but you,
sir, have made me a believer.

313
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,120
Of all the police in Gotham,
it was you.

314
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
You came.

315
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Jonathan.

316
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,920
What happened to you?

317
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Well, first...

318
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,000
you killed my father.

319
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,160
Your father was insane.
He was trying to kill you.

320
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,120
He tried to help me,

321
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,680
help all mankind.

322
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,040
- He was a murderer.
- He was a pioneer!

323
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,600
A genius!

324
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,000
He taught me we can live
our entire lives

325
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,800
imprisoned by our fears,

326
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,040
or we can embrace them.

327
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,000
You should know that
better than anyone.

328
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,760
You should know that
better than anyone.

329
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,000
What will you see, I wonder?

330
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,640
What scares you the most?

331
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,880
What will you see, I wonder?

332
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,680
One of your victims, perhaps?

333
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,400
One of your victims?

334
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,080
What haunts you the most?

335
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Lee?

336
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
I just...

337
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,040
- I just was...
- God, no.

338
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,560
- What have you done?
- Don't touch me!

339
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,840
Let me go!

340
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,400
Please let me help you.

341
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
You've caused me so much pain.

342
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,560
I've suffered you long enough.

343
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,880
We could have been a family,

344
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,080
had a child.

345
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,160
You destroy everything you touch.

346
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,960
I just...

347
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,120
want, peace.

348
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
No.

349
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,240
Lee. No.

350
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,440
You can join her...

351
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,800
to show her
how much you truly love her.

352
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,560
Don't let her die hating you.

353
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,480
It's what she would want.

354
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,720
It's the only way

355
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,120
to show her you love her. Cut deep.

356
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
<i>Cut deep. It's what she would want.</i>

357
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,880
Cut deep and find peace.

358
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,040
Don't let her die.

359
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,360
- Follow her into death.
<i>- No.</i>

360
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
<i>She wouldn't say that.</i>

361
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,760
<i>She wouldn't want that. She loves me.</i>

362
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,320
- Cut deep and find peace.
- No.

363
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
<i>She loves me. She loves me.
She wouldn't want that.</i>

364
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,840
<i>She loves me.</i>

365
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
No.

366
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,000
Crane? Where are you?

367
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
Crane?

368
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
How did you do it?

369
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,160
How did you defeat the toxin?
It's impossible!

370
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
I overcame my fear.

371
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Liar!

372
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
You liar!

373
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,880
You can't just stop being afraid.

374
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,680
You can only become your demon
like I did.

375
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,120
No. You have a choice, Jonathan.

376
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,560
And whatever your father was,
he didn't want this for you.

377
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
You need help.

378
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,560
My father thought that I was weak.

379
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,520
My whole life.

380
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,960
Scared little Jonathan.

381
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Okay.

382
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
I can help you.

383
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Let me help you.

384
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
But I'm not weak anymore.

385
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,600
And I will never go back
to being that boy.

386
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,480
- Come on, man.
- Right this way.

387
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,200
No. Down this way. Right at the back.

388
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Just around the corner.

389
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,800
I'm telling you, man.
He leaves the back gate open.

390
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,760
It's gonna be too easy.

391
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,840
Well, well.

392
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,840
It seems we've caught our stalker.

393
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,440
And he made it way too easy.

394
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,040
Didn't know when he was being played.

395
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,160
Who are you, huh?

396
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,160
Some, some Boy Scout?

397
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,560
He's just a kid.

398
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,120
You some, some kind of do-gooder?

399
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,720
Did I date your mom
and not call her back?

400
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
Why are you hassling us, kid?

401
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,760
I don't know, guys.
His face, it seems familiar.

402
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,760
You famous or something?

403
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,360
You know we got licenses
for this, kid?

404
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,240
We're all above board.

405
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,000
- Penguin gets his share.
- That's right.

406
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,240
It's within our rights
to do anything we want to you.

407
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Anything.

408
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,640
Look what you went and did.

409
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,760
You've seen my stash.

410
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,120
And you ticked off my boys.

411
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,200
Now you got to die.

412
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,560
Wait, wait, wait. I'm telling you,
I know this kid's face.

413
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,680
Oh, would you shut the hell up.

414
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Hey, I'm telling you,
I've seen this dude.

415
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Don't matter.

416
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,880
No matter who he is,
he's got to go.

417
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,520
Get up.

418
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,240
Get up. Hurry up, he's getting away.

419
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,320
Think you're so slick, huh?

420
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,800
Now, I hate to tell you
I told you so, Master Bruce.

421
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Up you get.

422
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
We got to leave.

423
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,320
She said she's sorry.

424
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,480
She chose Nygma over me and Butch.

425
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,440
So, Nygma's a Popsicle now.

426
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Let's give her a chance.

427
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,760
Why do you want this so bad?

428
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,040
Because I'm sick and tired
of not being taken seriously.

429
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,480
Of all those selfish guys out there
who treat me like I'm stupid.

430
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,560
Alone, I can't do much about it.

431
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,240
With Barbara, maybe.

432
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,120
But with you and Barbara?

433
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,080
The three of us could give all
those creeps a run for their money.

434
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
I want in.

435
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,280
- Get out.
- No, no. Please, just hear me out.

436
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
No.

437
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,200
You're a Penguin stooge.

438
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
What? I hate that freak.

439
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,280
Oh, please. You guzzled down
his Kool-Aid. Beat it.

440
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
No one takes me seriously, either.

441
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,240
There's nothing I wouldn't do

442
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,440
to get back at the men
who've treated me like garbage.

443
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,680
Nothing.

444
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,200
Not buying it.
You're working for Penguin.

445
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,360
Cool down, okay? I believe her.

446
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Thank you.

447
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Know what?

448
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
You're rude.

449
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,680
And you're about to get your
skinny ass kicked down the block.

450
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
I won't ask again.

451
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Get out.

452
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
Get word to Barbara.

453
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,920
I'll talk business.

454
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,520
But I'll need something in return.

455
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,400
- Crane?
- The demon is here.

456
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,520
Crane?

457
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,160
The demon who haunts
and tortures you is here.

458
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,040
The one who poisoned your minds.

459
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,560
Destroy him and free yourself
from his tyranny!

460
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Kill him!

461
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,160
Water, right.

462
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,400
I'm so happy.

463
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Jonathan.

464
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
- You could have been killed!
- But I wasn't.

465
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,560
That's 'cause I followed you.

466
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,120
I had it under control.

467
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,360
How am I supposed to support you

468
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
if you refuse to accept
the realities of the situation?

469
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,040
Alfred, the realities
of the situation...

470
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Mr. Fox.

471
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
- Bad time?
- No.

472
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Not at all.

473
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Please come in.

474
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,400
Forgive me.

475
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,560
I should have called, but...

476
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
Well, I just couldn't stop
thinking about our last chat.

477
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,520
Wayne Enterprises
were developing a durable material

478
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,680
for military uniforms
when I worked there.

479
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,680
It is a thin Kevlar weave
with reinforced forearm protection.

480
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,560
The gloves have a faceted grip design
to help you cling to any surface.

481
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,480
The whole uniform
is extremely lightweight,

482
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,560
and actually, bulletproof

483
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
to impacts from 10 feet or more.

484
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,960
You know, for rock climbing.

485
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,040
Oh, and long distance
radio communicators.

486
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
In case you two wish
to talk to each other

487
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,080
whilst climbing rock.

488
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Well, I will not keep you.

489
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,520
I just didn't want to see you
get hurt again, Mr. Wayne.

490
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,640
Thank you, Mr. Fox.

491
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,360
I feel safer already.

492
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Ladies.

493
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,120
Thank you for returning.

494
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,560
- I'm glad...
- Not so fast.

495
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
I'll be needing proof
of your sincerity.

496
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Yes. Selina said you would need
something from me.

497
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,960
You can have anything you like.

498
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Fine.

499
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
I'll take your hand.

500
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
My what?

501
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,560
Both Butch and I lost a hand due
to Penguin's Machiavellian war games.

502
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,520
I believe it's your turn.

503
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,760
- You didn't say anything about this.
- Quiet.

504
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,560
- Tabitha, I assure you...
- No more words.

505
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,400
Penguin cut off Butch's hand,
Nygma mine.

506
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,360
Now I take yours.

507
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
Fine.

508
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,160
If this is the only way
I can get you to trust me...

509
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
so be it.

510
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Fine.

511
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
I'll trust you.

512
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
For now.

513
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,040
I'll start Monday.

514
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Where is he?

515
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,600
We had a deal, Detective Gordon.

516
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,840
That you would apprehend
Jonathan Crane.

517
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,840
You made a demand
in front of your cronies

518
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,400
in an attempt to undermine me
and this department.

519
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,760
There was no deal.

520
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I spoke for all of the citizens
of Gotham

521
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,360
when I said that the G.C.P.D.
can no longer keep us safe.

522
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,520
How many of you are sick

523
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,640
of risking your lives every day
just to see criminals escape?

524
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,640
How many times has this
very building become a war zone?

525
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,880
What do you say about that?

526
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,160
I say it is time to start anew.

527
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,920
To police ourselves.

528
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,000
I will triple the wage
of any cop here

529
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,320
who wants to work for me

530
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,520
in insuring the safety
of this city's people.

531
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,760
The future is now.

532
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,400
Follow me into it.

533
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,720
Police yourselves.

534
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,040
He just wants to pay you
to look the other way.

535
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,760
Would you blame him if they did?

536
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,600
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

537
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,240
This is a war, not one battle.

538
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,520
If I would have went with you,
I would have lost them.

539
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,600
And we need them to win this war.

540
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,000
Now you don't have to say nothing,

541
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,640
but I'm buying you a drink.

542
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
Oh, no. Not you.

543
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,040
Leave.

544
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,960
You never paid
for the last stuff I gave you.

545
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,840
You make me smell perfume,
make me giddy, cheap trick.

546
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,280
Out! Out!

547
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm done with perfumes.

548
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,840
I'm here for the good stuff.

549
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,920
Don't know what you're talking about.

550
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,320
Leave. I'm closing up.

551
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,240
Word is you have potions here.

552
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,680
Ancient, mystical potions
made by shamans all over the world.

553
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,640
- Who told you that?
- I'm done playing nice.

554
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,560
I need a change, a big one.

555
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,760
I need strength, power.

556
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
No.

557
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Where are they?

558
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,680
My safe.

559
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,960
Under the register.

560
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,800
- Combination?
- It's open.

561
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,080
Which ones make me stronger?

562
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,120
That's dangerous stuff.
It's too powerful for you.

563
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,080
It can get in your blood, your DNA.

564
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Good.

565
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,960
No! Don't! No!

566
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,920
No! You must stop!

567
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,520
You let me walk
into that nightmare alone.

568
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,080
Yeah, well, I figured it would take

569
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,280
more than a couple of loonies
to take you out.

570
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,520
Besides, I figured you
and me taking on Penguin

571
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,240
and the entire criminal underground
by ourselves wasn't the best idea.

572
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,240
So what? You want to sit here,
do nothing, get drunk?

573
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,200
- Is that your plan?
- Unless you got a better one.

574
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,480
What makes you think
those cops back there were wrong?

575
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,200
Are we really making a difference?

576
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,000
One worth risking our lives over?

577
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,120
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

578
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,280
Makes me miss Falcone.

579
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,280
I mean, I know he's a vicious bastard
but he was, he was fair.

580
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,200
He ran the criminals
of this city with an iron fist.

581
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,080
There was, there was,
there was honor.

582
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,640
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

583
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,360
Do not mess with Falcone.

584
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,920
You killed his son, remember?

585
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,040
Italians do not forget that crap.

586
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,360
He must hate what Penguin's
doing as much as we do.

587
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,080
You show your face to Falcone,
he will kill you.

588
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,760
Yeah. Well...

589
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,360
Like you said, we need an army.

590
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
He's got one.

591
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,240
Oh, that's a lovely leap,
Master Bruce,

592
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,760
positively gazelle-like.

593
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,000
It's so lightweight,
it's like I'm wearing nothing at all.

594
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,040
Yeah, well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

595
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,800
Remember to keep your face
covered at all times.

596
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,800
<i>Try wearing that mask I made you.</i>
