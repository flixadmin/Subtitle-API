1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,804
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:03,289
After 6 months in hell,

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:04,535
I have been released from prison

4
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,715
and returned home with only one goal...

5
00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:08,060
To save my city,

6
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:09,520
but things have changed.

7
00:00:09,523 --> 00:00:11,438
Instead of operating outside the law,

8
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:13,584
I am now working alongside the police.

9
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:16,411
I am no longer inmate 4587.

10
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:19,235
I am once more the Green Arrow.

11
00:00:20,116 --> 00:00:21,375
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:21,377 --> 00:00:23,208
Ricardo Diaz is dead.

13
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:25,582
Whoever's been running around
dressed up as the Green Arrow,

14
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:26,685
that's your murderer.

15
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:28,352
Does she have any
reason to blame my family

16
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:29,387
for her mother's death?

17
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,147
Y'all did become Starling City royalty

18
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,265
while she and her mom were
left to struggle in The Glades.

19
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,888
What our father did to
you was unforgivable.

20
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:38,008
I see now you are different from him.

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,620
You and Oliver Queen are
getting along quite well.

22
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,819
He trusts me now.

23
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:43,373
It's time for you to come home.

24
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,024
Archer is active.

25
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:47,267
I think that's more than a
security system you're working on.

26
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:48,519
I think you're on to something big.

27
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,012
You're lying about who you really are.

28
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:52,205
What makes you think they will believe

29
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,165
a word you say,

30
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:55,589
Black Siren?

31
00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:03,593
Where are we supposed to go?

32
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,869
I don't know. I'm sorry.

33
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:08,272
Sorry? This is our home, Robert,

34
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,108
one that you used to be a part of.

35
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,470
You don't understand.

36
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:14,352
If I let you stay, she
will take everything...

37
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:16,940
My company, my money, my children.

38
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,192
What about our child?

39
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:23,386
The movers will be
here tomorrow afternoon.

40
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:24,905
Tell Emiko I'm sorry.

41
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:31,603
- Emiko.
- Where are we going, Dad?

42
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:34,781
You and your mom are going to live

43
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:38,068
someplace else, someplace better.

44
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,628
But I want to stay here!

45
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,698
I know you do, kiddo,
but life isn't fair.

46
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,926
We don't always get what we want.

47
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,096
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:55,790
Dad, please don't leave.

49
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:26,895
You okay?

50
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,275
Are you?

51
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,801
Where'd you learn that?

52
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:37,418
I'll tell you if you tell me

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,460
where you learned taekwondo.

54
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:42,349
I learned taekwondo

55
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:45,695
from a woman named Talia in Russia.

56
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,595
Your past gets more
mysterious every day.

57
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:50,918
Could say the same thing about you.

58
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,119
Your turn.

59
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:02,986
It's complicated.

60
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:05,488
I had a good teacher. He, um,

61
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,958
showed me how to protect myself.

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,128
He taught you well.

63
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,155
Nice trick.

64
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,011
The key is to watch your opponent

65
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,256
and not the stick.

66
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,996
What are you smiling about?

67
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,547
- I kicked your ass.
- Oh, no.

68
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,858
You most certainly did not.

69
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:30,471
Thea and I used to spar like this.

70
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:32,732
She always wanted a sister.

71
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,660
So did I.

72
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,022
Rematch?

73
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:41,184
If you think you can handle it.

74
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:28,335
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

75
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,498
Oh, come on, Smoak. You got this.

76
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,718
You know you can be pregnant
and be CEO of a company

77
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,370
and a deputized vigilante by night.

78
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:38,798
Women really can have it all.

79
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,179
I'm talking to myself.

80
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,958
DNA match complete.

81
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:46,063
Identity confirmed. Alena Whitlock.

82
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,757
Well, that is ingenious.

83
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,371
Was not expecting an entrance

84
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,143
or that you knew my last name.

85
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,438
- Alena, hi.
- Hi.

86
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:55,097
Hi! Oh, it's been so
long. How have you been?

87
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,724
When you're the known associate

88
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,601
of the evil and murder
genius Cayden James,

89
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,395
good to keep a low profile,

90
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:02,210
so I'm working at Tech Village.

91
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,439
Oh, no. Oh. I have been there literally.

92
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:07,235
I know your pain. The... the vests.

93
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,835
So, um, how did you find me, actually?

94
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:11,739
It's part of a new project
I have been working on.

95
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,283
It started off as, like, a
home-based security system,

96
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,668
and now it's turned into, like,

97
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,503
a DNA-tracking-based
surveillance system.

98
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:19,172
- Meet Archer.
- Sorry. So you located me

99
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:20,344
using my DNA?

100
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:22,292
When did you collect my DNA? Heh.

101
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:24,754
- I know it's a little creepy.
- It's more than a little,

102
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,593
but it's also impressive.

103
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,532
I've been using it for
Team Arrow, but I think

104
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,002
if we scaled it up, it could
be so much more than that.

105
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,704
I mean, we could find missing
persons, we could track terrorists,

106
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,556
we could do crowd control,
we could do anything!

107
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,017
Just, I can't do it alone.

108
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,088
I mean, whatever you need, I am game.

109
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:41,245
I am so done telling customers to use

110
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,530
the chip in their card
when they insist on swiping.

111
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,078
Great! How does CTO of
Smoak Technologies sound?

112
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,818
Oh! Oh! Oh!

113
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,775
Oh! You're not even
gonna ask about benefits?

114
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:51,787
I don't care about the benefits

115
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,947
as long as there's no
crappy vest requirement.

116
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,326
- I am in!
- No vest. Huge benefit.

117
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:57,952
Music to my ears.

118
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:01,956
D.A. Laurel Lance is at the front door.

119
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,291
Allow access.

120
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:04,435
Access granted.

121
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:06,146
It's open.

122
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,839
- Hey.
- Is your wife around?

123
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:12,726
No. She went out. What's up?

124
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:15,136
Uh, nothing. I'll just...

125
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:17,155
I'll come find Felicity later.

126
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,801
Your bandage is bleeding through.

127
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:22,202
Sit down. We'll get you cleaned up.

128
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:29,626
Fine.

129
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,074
- Thank you.
- Sure.

130
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,174
Looks like an arrow wound.

131
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:47,352
Because it is an arrow wound.

132
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,253
Where'd it come from?

133
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,898
Your sister's bow.

134
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,648
- What?
- Look. I don't mean to

135
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,193
blindside you with this,

136
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:57,409
which is why I wanted
to talk to Felicity...

137
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:59,222
You know, empathy and all that...

138
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:02,850
But your sister is not
the hero you think she is.

139
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:05,186
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:06,854
Ben Turner saw her at Slabside

141
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:09,732
the night Diaz was murdered.

142
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:13,194
It wasn't another
inmate that killed Diaz.

143
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,568
It was Emiko.

144
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:17,407
Heh heh heh.

145
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,155
That makes no sense.

146
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:21,202
Well, I figured you'd say that,

147
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:24,048
so I did more digging,
and there are no records

148
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:25,915
of her that exist past the age of 15,

149
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:26,990
no fingerprints.

150
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:29,635
And when I followed her
last night to find out more,

151
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:31,971
she tried skewering me with an arrow.

152
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,725
Okay. I've seen her skills up close.

153
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,976
She doesn't miss.

154
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,080
If she wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

155
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,056
Oh. Maybe I should be thankful, then.

156
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:46,411
Once upon a time, I actually
shot Roy Harper and Barry Allen.

157
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,488
It was to illustrate a point.

158
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,106
My guess is that her point is

159
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:51,899
she doesn't want to be stalked anymore.

160
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:54,368
Or maybe sister has brother wrapped

161
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,070
around her little finger.

162
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:57,767
You know, the Oliver I knew, he had

163
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,407
a blind spot for family,

164
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,950
and I'm guessing you do, too.

165
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:02,669
It's called loyalty.

166
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:04,884
I know that's a concept you
don't totally understand.

167
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:07,457
I have nothing to gain here.

168
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,177
I am only trying to do what's right.

169
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,329
Why can you not see that?

170
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:11,794
There has to be more to this,

171
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:13,296
and I will look into it

172
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:15,079
if you will promise to stay out of it.

173
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,326
I already wish I would have.

174
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,320
Good luck.

175
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,653
If I give this to you,

176
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:04,889
my family's safe, right?

177
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,469
I can guarantee it.

178
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:10,579
If it's all there.

179
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,084
All that we'll need.

180
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:17,726
I believe we're done here.

181
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:25,067
What the hell is that?

182
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:35,770
Uh!

183
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:52,603
Help!

184
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:54,397
Someone...

185
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,897
Please.

186
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,284
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

187
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:59,043
I got you, I got you. I got you.

188
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:00,954
Forget about me.

189
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,530
You need to stop them.

190
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:04,740
Who? Who? Stop who?

191
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,555
The Ninth Circle.

192
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,832
The Ninth what?

193
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,334
- Circle.
- Dante's a part of it.

194
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:20,144
Turns out he's not just a banker
for terrorists and cartels.

195
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,986
Okay. Lyla and I have been
hunting Dante for months.

196
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,137
Why are we just hearing this name?

197
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,842
Because the Ninth Circle
is practically invisible.

198
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,954
I mean, I combed the entire
dark web and came up with nada,

199
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:29,011
but then I remembered
this photo you sent me

200
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:30,606
from the Ghost Initiative's last ride.

201
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,583
Right. That symbol was on

202
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,426
all the weapons that
Virgil's goons used.

203
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,470
The symbol also pops up on
artifacts dating all the way back

204
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:39,258
to 14th-century Italy,
the real Dante's era.

205
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:41,625
The insignia is mostly
commonly found on ephemera

206
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:43,749
that is connected to times
of historical upheaval...

207
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:46,091
The Russian Revolution, the
colonization of the Americas,

208
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:47,364
the War of Roses.

209
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,300
So you're saying Dante
runs a secret society

210
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:50,581
responsible for centuries

211
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,195
of worldwide regime change?

212
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:53,435
Right, but if that's true,

213
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:54,896
the Ninth Circle's clearly way bigger

214
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,135
than just Dante.

215
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:58,633
Okay. Well, how did you run
into Dante last night, Oliver,

216
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:00,878
and why didn't you call for backup?

217
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,256
Laurel came to speak
with you and found me.

218
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,884
Suggested that...

219
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,845
Emiko has been hiding
certain parts of her past

220
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:13,149
and said that she killed Diaz.

221
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,347
She killed Diaz?

222
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,849
Which doesn't mean she's bad.

223
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:17,384
I followed Emiko,

224
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:18,988
and it led me to Dante.

225
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,481
Okay. Well, all we
really know about Emiko

226
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,232
is what she's told us, which isn't much.

227
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,351
She's a vigilante. For all we know,

228
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:26,403
she's gathering intel on the
Ninth Circle to take them down.

229
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:28,877
Also, why are we taking
Laurel's word about anything?

230
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,259
Hey. Laurel has changed a lot.

231
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:31,397
I mean, she's been a
really good friend to me...

232
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,549
Not to say that your sister's
evil, but she's changed a lot.

233
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:36,702
Be that as it may, the Ninth
Circle is clearly a threat,

234
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,822
and we need to follow up
every lead that we have.

235
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,918
Well, we know that they
stole 8 military-grade drones,

236
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,161
which they could literally be
planning to do anything with.

237
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:45,789
Okay. Can you use Archer to
pinpoint Dante's location?

238
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,294
Not without his DNA.

239
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:50,709
Okay. Well, I'll talk to Lyla,
take this new intel back there,

240
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,712
and see if we can use
A.R.G.U.S.'s databases.

241
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,523
Yeah. We should be able
to use SCPD resources, too.

242
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:55,944
I'll get D up to speed.

243
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,859
I'm gonna go speak with my sister.

244
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:00,521
She deserves a chance
to explain herself.

245
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:03,699
And I... I will...

246
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:06,118
I'll be here.

247
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:13,951
What is so important that
couldn't be handled over the phone?

248
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:15,809
Do you remember our conversation

249
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:17,682
about playing by the rules,

250
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:21,574
about doing things the right
way is usually the hard way?

251
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:25,203
Why do I feel a lecture coming on?

252
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,390
The Halcones' Kingpin, Ramiro Gonzalez,

253
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:30,133
we had a witness

254
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:32,228
who was ready to nail him
for criminal conspiracy

255
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,184
until we found out his
confession was coerced by the D.A.

256
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,734
You wanted the city cleaned up, right?

257
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,277
I'm cleaning.

258
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,178
You are an officer of the law.

259
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,598
You have to play by it.

260
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,392
You know, with Team Arrow
working alongside the SCPD,

261
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:49,722
this city has a real chance
of turning things around,

262
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,732
and it's never gonna happen
if our D.A. is a criminal.

263
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:56,443
All of those guys are guilty.

264
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:58,754
You'd rather see them kicked than me

265
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:00,923
bend a couple of... of little rules

266
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,610
to make sure their charges stick?

267
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:05,927
Yes, because if anyone finds
out what you've been up to,

268
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,246
they're all gonna get
off on technicalities,

269
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,248
and you're gonna get fired.

270
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,010
Fine, but I'm sure there's a reason

271
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,753
you brought this up in the first place.

272
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,588
You have a second chance.

273
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,099
SWAT brought in one of Ramirez's
lieutenants last night...

274
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,776
Gustavo Hernandez.

275
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,778
He's looking to deal,
and I want you to put

276
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,138
that Kingpin behind bars.

277
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,266
Just need you to do it the right way.

278
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:31,795
You really know how to take
the fun out of everything.

279
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:40,487
Uh, we don't have a training
session until next week.

280
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:43,373
I don't think family
needs a reason to stop by.

281
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,450
Going somewhere?

282
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:49,763
I, uh, was just heading
out for a bite to eat.

283
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:53,383
- What some company?
- Hmm. Not really.

284
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:56,312
Because you're meeting someone?

285
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:57,779
What's with the interrogation?

286
00:13:57,782 --> 00:14:01,298
That teacher that you
were telling me about,

287
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,885
how long did you train with him?

288
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:05,354
Since I was 11.

289
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:06,897
Where'd you meet?

290
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,325
It doesn't matter. It
was a long time ago.

291
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:11,571
Yeah. I mean, if I was
working with a known terrorist,

292
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:14,830
I'd want to keep that quiet, too.

293
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:17,165
What are you talking about?

294
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,168
I saw you last night with Dante

295
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,210
outside Palmer Technologies.

296
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,756
You were following me.

297
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,250
Mm-hmm.

298
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:30,087
So now you, uh...

299
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,577
You think I'm some kind of criminal?

300
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,999
Trying to give you the
benefit of the doubt,

301
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:39,440
but... this guy Dante is...

302
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,931
He's a monster.

303
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:43,174
I know who Dante is,

304
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:46,403
but I... I didn't back then.

305
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:54,102
I was 11 when your father
walked out on me and my mother.

306
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:56,839
He chose your family over mine,

307
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:58,122
and he left us with nothing...

308
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,940
No home, no money.

309
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,953
Dante took me under his wing,

310
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,905
and he... he trained me.

311
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:08,241
He taught me how to survive.

312
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:10,886
By the time I knew who he
really was, it was too late.

313
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:14,581
You know, I owed him,
and I still do now.

314
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,466
I can help you.

315
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:18,135
You have no idea

316
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:20,587
what kind of power he holds.

317
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:21,972
The organization he runs...

318
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,108
The Ninth Circle?

319
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,759
Then you know there's no way out.

320
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:27,903
On your own,

321
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,784
but if you're being backed up

322
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:31,982
by a team...

323
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:35,059
Just, I can... I can help you,

324
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:37,487
but you have to let me.

325
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:39,873
You can't, and, trust me,

326
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,917
you will only make things worse

327
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,502
for the both of us if you try.

328
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:49,474
Delivery from Frank Bertinelli.

329
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:57,034
I didn't know the Bertinellis

330
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:59,175
employed child labor.

331
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,729
Pays better than a lemonade stand,

332
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:03,647
and the cops don't hassle a kid.

333
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,651
That'll be all.

334
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:13,824
I'll take my watch back.

335
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:22,260
Do you know who I am?

336
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:26,026
Dante. It says on the package.

337
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,987
Do you know who I am?

338
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:30,532
The suspense is killing me.

339
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,284
- Emiko.
- Well, Emiko,

340
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:35,637
taking my watch is a pretty risky move.

341
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,789
Well, I need money,

342
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,172
and it looks like you have enough.

343
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,894
I earn it.

344
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:46,299
How'd you do that thing with the knife?

345
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:48,983
Pretty simple, actually.

346
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,278
I can teach you if you want.

347
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,324
Come back tomorrow.

348
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:01,855
That was a good lift.

349
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:03,499
Steal from me again,

350
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,334
and I'll slit your throat.

351
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,674
Good news!

352
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:16,631
Lyla got a DNA sample from
the dagger used by Dante

353
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:17,650
to kill Director Bell.

354
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,128
Guess who now has said sample.

355
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:21,638
John Diggle, you give the best gifts.

356
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:22,917
Now that we have Dante's DNA,

357
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,974
will Archer be able to find him?

358
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,377
Well, with all the money I'm spending
on this program, that is the hope.

359
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,027
How's Emiko? Did you find anything more

360
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,008
- about her being...
- Being on the wrong side.

361
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,236
She admitted to being in very deep

362
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:34,211
with Dante and the Ninth Circle.

363
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,113
Sounds like she could
be in some real trouble.

364
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,159
Boom. I got him.

365
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:39,724
Looks like he's at the Star City branch
of Szrek Chemicals.

366
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:40,732
If we surprise Dante now,

367
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:41,993
we could still take him down.

368
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,280
And get my sister out of trouble.

369
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:45,582
Let's suit up.

370
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,048
Hey, Jerry. We still
on for beers tonight?

371
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,300
Maybe we should try Nelson's.

372
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,970
Better service.

373
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:05,702
I'm afraid Jerry's not gonna make it.

374
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:09,648
Please don't kill me.

375
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,798
Of course not.

376
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,359
Unh!

377
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:17,614
Those.

378
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:25,813
- You told him we were here!
- I didn't.

379
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:27,414
Your allegiance has shifted.

380
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:32,078
Now!

381
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,298
D, go! We got you covered.

382
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:45,842
Agh!

383
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,794
Let's get out of here.

384
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,271
Grab her.

385
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,107
Let me go!

386
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:00,281
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

387
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:06,726
I shouldn't be here. Dante will find me.

388
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,911
It's just a matter of time,
and you will all be targets.

389
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,895
Yeah? Well, it won't be the first time.

390
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,510
Think about it like this.

391
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,658
It'll be a hell of a
lot easier to stop Dante

392
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:17,179
with all of us working
together than you by yourself.

393
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:20,039
Okay, as long as I get to be
the one who takes him down.

394
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,376
That sounds fair to me.

395
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,463
Well, yeah, except
there's just one problem.

396
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,920
Archer just crashed, which
means I lost Dante's location.

397
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:28,339
Fine. We'll just have to find
Dante the old-fashioned way.

398
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,908
Easier said than done.

399
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:31,655
Now that he knows I'm working with you,

400
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,844
we should consider all Ninth
Circle locations burned.

401
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,364
But that op we just interrupted,

402
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:36,859
I mean, Dante didn't get
what he was looking for.

403
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:39,109
You must know what he was after.

404
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,903
Enriched uranium.

405
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:43,730
I told you he was dangerous.

406
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,398
We need to figure out
where else in the city

407
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,911
he can get his hands on that uranium.

408
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:49,210
Yeah. I'm on it.
Archer may have crashed,

409
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:51,137
but computers will never replace people.

410
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,018
Do you have any idea what
he was planning on doing

411
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,212
with the drones and uranium?

412
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:55,492
I wish I had more intel,

413
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,059
but it was always on
a need-to-know basis.

414
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,750
That's how the Ninth Circle works.

415
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:01,937
- Hey. You hurt?
- Not badly.

416
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,823
- You guys have some ice?
- Yeah.

417
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,425
This could not be worse timing,

418
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,202
but I have to run to the SCPD.

419
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:14,125
Go ahead, Captain. We'll
handle it from here.

420
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:18,559
Hey. What's wrong?

421
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,917
Just be careful with her, Oliver.

422
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,317
Okay. I will.

423
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,003
Hey, guys. Think I got something.

424
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,830
- That was fast.
- One point for the humans.

425
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:29,948
If Emiko is right and
he's after uranium,

426
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,260
there's only two places in
Star City that have it...

427
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,128
Dunkirk Power and Global Energy.

428
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,912
Sounds like a divide
and conquer situation.

429
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,682
My thoughts exactly.

430
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:48,221
So are you just gonna
not ask me about it?

431
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:50,050
You have nothing to say about the fact

432
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:52,195
that I've been secretly
working for the Ninth Circle?

433
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:55,024
I know you well enough not to pry,

434
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,951
and you did try to keep
me out of your mission

435
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:58,287
when we first met.

436
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,620
I didn't want you to
get mixed up with them,

437
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:04,399
but I... I should
have told you the truth

438
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,368
so you'd know what you
were really getting into

439
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,920
working with me.

440
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:11,490
I bet you wish you'd listened

441
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:12,939
when I told you to stay away.

442
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,804
If you think I regret
teaming up with you, I don't.

443
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:20,290
We're still partners, Emiko,

444
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,899
no matter who we're up against.

445
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:33,047
You haven't practiced.

446
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,975
This is much harder than last week.

447
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:36,942
No. You're just not prepared.

448
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,160
I was busy. I was working on something.

449
00:21:39,162 --> 00:21:42,183
Oh, yes. Your plan to impress Daddy.

450
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,934
Being a father means
more than just blood.

451
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:50,320
I know, but he is still my father.

452
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:53,031
So you would choose a
man who abandoned you

453
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,550
over the Ninth Circle?

454
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:01,570
Why can't I have both?

455
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:05,352
The Ninth Circle is not a
place of split loyalties.

456
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:08,547
Once you join, it is
a lifetime commitment.

457
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,433
There is nothing else.

458
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:13,769
I can't give up on my family.

459
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:16,572
The Ninth Circle is your family now...

460
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:23,579
And that is their gift to you.

461
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,724
You really want a deal
for this smug bastard?

462
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:54,226
Are you sure?

463
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:55,746
Bigger picture, Laurel.

464
00:22:58,598 --> 00:23:02,821
Mr. Hernandez, do you know who I am?

465
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:05,077
You're the D.A. who
used to be a vigilante.

466
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,299
Yeah, I know you.

467
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,443
Good because I know you, too...

468
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:12,055
Drug trafficking,
embezzlement, manslaughter.

469
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,195
Murder?

470
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,788
So this is the part
where you offer me a deal

471
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,299
to make it all go away, right?

472
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:21,076
Hmm. If it were up to me,
I'd let you rot or worse,

473
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,247
but, luckily for you, it's
your boss who we're after...

474
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,458
Ramiro Gonzalez.

475
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,677
And you think that a plea
deal's enough to flip me?

476
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,754
Hey. I've got enough evidence here

477
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:32,231
to convict you of 3 felonies,

478
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,384
one using a deadly weapon,

479
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:36,276
and that was in a day.

480
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,946
Imagine what I could do in a week.

481
00:23:38,948 --> 00:23:43,192
You know, your dad thought he
could convict me, too, right?

482
00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:45,566
Must be a family defect.

483
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:48,478
I would be really careful if I were you

484
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:51,008
because we're not a family
that plays very nice.

485
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:52,793
How's that going for you?

486
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:56,538
Captain Lance... He's
dead now, isn't he?

487
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,741
Say his name one more
time, and you will be, too.

488
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,545
Aw. Girl's got a soft
spot for Daddy. Aw.

489
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:06,331
That's enough, D.A. Lance.

490
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,892
We're done here.

491
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,152
Global Energy was a bust.

492
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:19,987
No sign of Dante or the uranium.

493
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,563
Ah. You still came back looking

494
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:22,765
like a prizefighter, though.

495
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:24,849
We ran into a couple
thugs on the way back.

496
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:27,200
Ooh. Cute. A little brother-sister
crime-fighting duo time.

497
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:29,035
- I like it.
- Any word from John and Rene?

498
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:30,626
They struck out, too.

499
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:32,713
Global Energy and Dunkirk Power are

500
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:35,484
two spots in Star City
that manufacture uranium.

501
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,447
- Archer's still not working.
- Right.

502
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,082
I'm just about to go down
into the deepest, darkest,

503
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:40,539
most dungeony part of this bunker

504
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:41,836
and give it a full system reboot.

505
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:43,528
Then hopefully then, you know,
Archer can be back online,

506
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,696
we can find Dante, and all my dreams

507
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:46,848
of Smoak Tech saving the
world don't have to die.

508
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:50,417
I'm gonna clean this up.

509
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:13,615
Think I found the problem.

510
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:16,410
Some kind of jammer.

511
00:25:16,412 --> 00:25:18,170
Wonder how that got there.

512
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,292
So you were never under duress.

513
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:26,036
Sorry to disappoint you,

514
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,746
but that's what family does, right?

515
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:29,212
This is the reason that
Archer isn't working?

516
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:31,207
I couldn't let you and your
team get in the way again.

517
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:32,935
We don't give up that easily.

518
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:40,550
You've been lying this entire time,

519
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:42,260
everything about our father,

520
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:43,638
your debt to Dante?

521
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,965
It was all true, but I never needed you

522
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,392
to put me back together.

523
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:50,773
I just knew you'd try.

524
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:53,103
Can't resist playing the hero, can you?

525
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:55,324
Unh!

526
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:57,492
You went looking for a family,

527
00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:59,587
and you chose the Ninth Circle?

528
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:01,696
Better than living as a Queen.

529
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:11,340
Always watch your opponent.

530
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:13,583
You don't have to be a part of this.

531
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,010
You have a choice!

532
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:16,186
I've made it!

533
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:30,618
Bye, Brother.

534
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,168
I was married to a junkie.

535
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,170
You'd think I'd know when
someone was lying to me.

536
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:45,130
At least now we know what
side Emiko's really on.

537
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:48,483
It doesn't matter. The... the
Ninth Circle are still out there,

538
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:49,772
and they are a threat.

539
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,536
You can take a minute to
process this if you need to.

540
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:53,108
I need to know where she is.

541
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,256
How soon can you have
Archer back up and running?

542
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:56,668
Not as soon as I would like.

543
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:58,749
Emiko's little device didn't
just jam up the system.

544
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,029
It wiped the entire
memory card, which means

545
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,087
I have to rebuild the
entire infrastructure.

546
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,644
Looks like we have another problem.

547
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:06,012
There's been a break-in at the
waste treatment site at Orchard Bay.

548
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:08,027
I thought the only spots
that manufactured uranium

549
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,367
were the two sites we just canvassed.

550
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:10,630
Well, that's true, but
how much do you want to bet

551
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:13,170
that Dante and his pals
aren't actually after uranium?

552
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:15,068
- More of Emiko's lies.
- What'd they get?

553
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,478
All the ingredients to make
a big batch of sarin gas.

554
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:19,106
That plus the drones
that they just stole

555
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:20,914
makes one hell of a murder party.

556
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:22,131
We have to know where the Ninth Circle

557
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,570
is planning on sending these drones.

558
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:26,081
- Oliver, we're on it.
- You might want to take 5.

559
00:27:26,084 --> 00:27:27,685
I'm going to Emiko's hideout,

560
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,839
see if she left behind
a clue or something.

561
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,893
Yeah, or you could do
exactly the opposite

562
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,520
of what your wife recommends.

563
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:35,771
I'll go with him.

564
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:46,272
Are you here to give
me another lecture or...

565
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:49,985
The Halcones' Lieutenant,
Gustavo Hernandez,

566
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:53,747
was found dead an hour ago.

567
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:56,441
Really?

568
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:59,723
Am I supposed to be sad
about that or something?

569
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:03,331
Well, we had him in
custody to prevent that.

570
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,292
That is, of course, until your
office said we had to turn him loose.

571
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:07,593
Well, he made bail.

572
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:10,034
You're the one that said I
had to do things the right way,

573
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:11,404
so I let him loose,

574
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:14,100
and here we are back to square one.

575
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,602
Well, actually, we're not.

576
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:17,021
Hernandez's death

577
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,013
spooked one of Gonzalez's
other lieutenants,

578
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:22,258
and, uh, he's gonna testify.

579
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,019
Isn't that convenient?

580
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:25,946
You think I did this.

581
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:27,404
I'm not exactly hearing a denial.

582
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:29,783
I shouldn't have to give you one.

583
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:31,809
I think I've done more than enough

584
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:35,271
to have earned the benefit
of the doubt from you.

585
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:38,149
I saw how you looked at that man,

586
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:41,653
and it was the same
look that you gave Vinnie

587
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:44,006
right before you executed him.

588
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:49,712
I have busted my ass being a good D.A.,

589
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,496
trying to play by the rules,

590
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:52,783
but no matter what I do, you

591
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:55,226
always just see me as the Black Siren.

592
00:28:58,055 --> 00:28:59,971
You're right. You're right,

593
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:02,520
and I am sorry, but I don't know

594
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:03,989
who you really are, Laurel.

595
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,946
I don't, and I don't
think that you do either.

596
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,613
I think that's what scares me the most.

597
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,865
Didn't hurt you too
bad back there, did I?

598
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:31,523
No. It was a convincing performance.

599
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:33,743
Did you, uh, make any
progress on who hired

600
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:36,423
Andrew Thorn... ton?

601
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:39,260
You know I'm a man of my word.

602
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:43,023
Once you've found and taken
care of your mother's killer,

603
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:46,309
you can go back to
focusing on the mission.

604
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:47,861
A deal is a deal.

605
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:55,201
This is really impressive.

606
00:29:55,204 --> 00:29:56,811
Did you come up with this yourself?

607
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:59,058
Yeah, I did.

608
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:02,227
Um, and Queen Materials,
Inc., could be profitable

609
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,262
in as little as 6 months.

610
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:07,739
If you look at page 7,
after an initial startup fee,

611
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:10,329
its projected growth rate is at 14%.

612
00:30:10,332 --> 00:30:13,713
I wish Oliver showed this kind
of interest in the business.

613
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:16,589
I inherited your business sense.

614
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:19,871
Let me start Queen
Materials, and I'll show you.

615
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:24,723
Well, I... I can't approve this.

616
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,525
Why not?

617
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:29,218
Queen Consolidated is for Oliver.

618
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,330
He's going to inherit it,

619
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:36,150
and if anyone were to find
out that you're my daughter...

620
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:38,770
I need this.

621
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:40,583
Okay. Otherwise, I am gonna have to find

622
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:41,915
the money somewhere else,

623
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:44,418
and I need it to help Mom,

624
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,028
- something you never did.
- Emiko.

625
00:30:47,031 --> 00:30:48,822
Do you ever even think about us?

626
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:50,415
All the time,

627
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,210
and I wish things were different.

628
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:56,871
I really do.

629
00:30:56,873 --> 00:30:58,932
Since the day you left,

630
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:01,459
I kept holding out, thinking

631
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:03,103
one day you'd do the right thing

632
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:05,345
and become the father I deserved.

633
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,443
It's never gonna happen, is it?

634
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:13,188
I have to go.

635
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,557
I have a trip planned to China

636
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,308
on the "Queen's Gambit."

637
00:31:20,197 --> 00:31:23,356
And I'm sorry.

638
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:26,300
Is there something else you'd
like to talk to me about?

639
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:32,125
No. Have a good trip.

640
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:53,320
You want to talk?

641
00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:56,748
Not even to the guy who found out

642
00:31:56,773 --> 00:32:00,414
his long lost sibling was secretly
an evil double agent?

643
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,477
Being reminded that
this has happened before

644
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,416
is not really making things better.

645
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:08,693
I get that, but I also know

646
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:10,337
that despite what Emiko's done,

647
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,664
you're not quite ready
to give up on her.

648
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:15,008
That obvious, huh?

649
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,919
Only to someone who knows you

650
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:20,538
and who's been there.

651
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,542
All I wanted was to bring
Andy back over to the light.

652
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:28,355
I don't have to remind you what
having that blind spot cost us.

653
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:29,940
No, you don't.

654
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,435
But please, John,
trust me when I tell you

655
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:38,106
that I am seeing Emiko more
clearly than I ever have.

656
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:39,724
Oliver, you're still trying to save her.

657
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,609
John, my family is to blame

658
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,128
for her current situation.

659
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:46,224
My... my father a-abandoned
her and her mother.

660
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:48,900
She was 11!

661
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:50,985
She was 11 years old,

662
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:53,017
and no one's gonna convince me that...

663
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,740
That her life wouldn't be different now

664
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:57,056
if that had never happened.

665
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,535
Andy tried to convince
me that I was the reason

666
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:01,629
for his bad choices, too.

667
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:04,165
He made me feel so
guilty that I was willing

668
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,393
to trust him again even after knowing

669
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:08,511
he worked for Damien Darhk.

670
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:10,838
I held out hope, Oliver, so much hope

671
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,568
that I put you, my family,

672
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,735
my team at risk.

673
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:20,198
John, if I abandon her now...

674
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,895
I'm no better than my father.

675
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:27,979
If I can help redeem her,

676
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:33,150
selfishly I feel like I... I
help redeem my family just...

677
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,591
A little.

678
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:41,953
Felicity got a hit on the Ninth Circle.

679
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:44,580
Drones are at an abandoned
airfield north of the city.

680
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:46,049
And Emiko?

681
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:47,434
She's there.

682
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:51,646
Let's get the team. Let's go.

683
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:10,273
All right. They're still
prepping the drones.

684
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:11,700
Good news is we're not too late.

685
00:34:11,702 --> 00:34:13,568
Bad news is we're outnumbered 5:1.

686
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,129
Those are my kind of odds.

687
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:17,377
- Got eyes on Dante.
- And Emiko.

688
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,800
Once the drones are primed,

689
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:21,951
we can begin the demonstration.

690
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:24,471
Eight stolen drones, which
means 8 potential targets,

691
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:26,126
and each one runs on a separate signal.

692
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:28,383
It's gonna take some time to
hack into the guidance system.

693
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:30,232
Oliver, that means that you
need to stop those things

694
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,478
before they take off.

695
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,962
You draw them out, I'll get the drones.

696
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:35,507
- Copy that.
- Let's go!

697
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:36,692
Unh!

698
00:34:40,823 --> 00:34:42,681
It's your brother.

699
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:44,274
I'll deal with him.

700
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:45,826
Pack up the demonstration.

701
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:47,996
No! The demonstration goes as planned.

702
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:49,538
Protect the drones.

703
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,675
Unh!

704
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:08,766
Dante!

705
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,280
Drive.

706
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:26,408
Damn it!

707
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:38,695
Emiko.

708
00:35:38,697 --> 00:35:41,048
Get out of here.

709
00:35:57,382 --> 00:35:59,474
Bad news, guys. Those
drones are airborne,

710
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:01,363
which means you need to
incinerate them mid-air

711
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,595
or else that's a lot of sarin
gas raining down on the city.

712
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:07,223
Overwatch, it would be very
helpful if I could see them.

713
00:36:07,225 --> 00:36:10,643
Okay. I'm working on
decloaking them now.

714
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:11,870
I'm in.

715
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:31,252
There's still one drone left.

716
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,174
I'm working on it.

717
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:36,169
Emiko, it's not too late.

718
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,254
Whatever you owe Dante...

719
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:41,183
I owe Dante everything.

720
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:43,301
Dante taught me how
to take care of myself,

721
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:46,113
to cut the ties that bind
us, that hold us back,

722
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:50,951
which is why it's time
for us to say good-bye...

723
00:36:50,953 --> 00:36:52,894
Brother!

724
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:54,075
Kill him!

725
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:14,903
Please tell me you got that last drone.

726
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:17,760
By the time I locked on, the
gas had already been deployed.

727
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,632
Sorry, Oliver.

728
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:29,228
- How many casualties?
- None.

729
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,177
The target was an abandoned building.

730
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,679
What about the other targets?

731
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,218
Well, that's the even weirder thing.

732
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:36,435
All of the other buildings
targeted were also empty.

733
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:38,604
Who goes to the trouble
of bombing empty buildings?

734
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,092
Seemed like some sort of weapons test.

735
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,966
Well, imagine what would
happen if all the drones worked

736
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,435
instead of just one.

737
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:45,983
They'd be able to take out
multiple targets simultaneously.

738
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,505
If we couldn't stop this test,

739
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:49,538
how are we gonna stop the real thing?

740
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:56,538
Reacting to the shocking allegations

741
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,516
about District Attorney Laurel Lance,

742
00:37:58,518 --> 00:38:02,503
new photos show her with
notorious criminal Ricardo Diaz.

743
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:04,656
Could the city's highest prosecutor

744
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:07,025
actually be a wanted criminal herself?

745
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:10,227
Looks like you've got a problem.

746
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:13,031
- You.
- Knocked off that Halcone?

747
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:14,842
I did.

748
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:16,958
Media's gonna have a field day.

749
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,611
- You're a psycho.
- And you make me sad,

750
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:22,189
trying so hard to become
someone you're not,

751
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:23,247
and for what?

752
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,539
So that the city will take
you seriously as a hero.

753
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:31,460
That is almost as ridiculous
as you wanting to be one.

754
00:38:31,463 --> 00:38:35,136
Get the hell out of my office. Now!

755
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:38,247
I thought I was punishing
you for following me.

756
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,475
Maybe I just set you free.

757
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:51,592
Oh, hey. Good. You're still here.

758
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,555
I'm sorry. It's been a day.

759
00:38:54,557 --> 00:38:56,574
I assume that's always the case.

760
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:58,710
Honestly, going over
Archer has made me happier

761
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,306
than I've been in months.

762
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:02,083
The algorithms you programmed are like

763
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,939
this beautifully composed Rondo-Finale.

764
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,900
A Rondo what, now?

765
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:08,920
Not into opera. Got it.

766
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:10,663
Hey. So question for version two.

767
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,591
- Mm-hmm?
- What happens when we

768
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:16,651
don't have the DNA of the
person that we are looking for?

769
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,839
- What do we do then?
- Well, that's a little trickier.

770
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:23,019
We could reprogram the
algorithm to highlight

771
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,960
any individuals whose DNA we don't have,

772
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,754
but unless we hack into a
medical or criminal database

773
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,320
and collect all of
their DNA profiles first,

774
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:32,725
all we'd really be doing
is taking a couple pieces

775
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,761
of straw out of the
haystack we're looking in.

776
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,689
Ah. Guess we'd better get to work then.

777
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:37,698
Okay.

778
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:51,820
Felicity couldn't find her,
but you think you can, huh?

779
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,548
I just... I don't want to give up.

780
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,359
Still trying to redeem her?

781
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,304
Trying to stop her

782
00:40:08,314 --> 00:40:10,074
before it's too late.

783
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:17,363
You disobeyed a direct order.

784
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,147
I gave you that dagger.

785
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,356
The weapons test failed

786
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,982
because of your brother's involvement.

787
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:32,488
Any more mistakes, and the rest
of the Ninth Circle will mutiny.

788
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:35,005
- I am their Leader.
- Then lead.

789
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:37,416
Where is your focus
at this critical time?

790
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:41,345
The family you swore to give up
to be part of the Ninth Circle.

791
00:40:41,347 --> 00:40:43,387
Your absence has been noted.

792
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,375
Thanks to my time with Oliver,

793
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,546
I found something even better.

794
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,381
The Archer Program,

795
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,110
cutting-edge surveillance technology.

796
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:58,673
We can't stake our future on technology

797
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:00,406
we haven't even seen.

798
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,934
I need you to trust my vision,

799
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:06,529
okay, trust that you
have taught me well,

800
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:10,566
but if you question my authority again,

801
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,418
I'll kill you.

802
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,368
The "Queen's Gambit" sent

803
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:22,410
a mayday transmission late last night

804
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,630
and has not been heard from since.

805
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,575
Casualties of the
"Queen's Gambit" include

806
