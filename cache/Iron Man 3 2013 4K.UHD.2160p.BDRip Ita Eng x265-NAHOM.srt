1
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,570
<i>A famous man once said,</i>

2
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,410
<i>"We create our own demons."</i>

3
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,950
<i>Who said that?
What does that even mean?</i>

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,000
<i>It doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</i>

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,620
<i>So, now, he was famous</i>

6
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,210
<i>and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</i>

7
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,920
<i>I don't...</i>

8
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,130
<i>I'm going to start again.</i>

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,800
<i>Let's track this from the beginning.</i>

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,170
Half hour till the ball drops.

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,560
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?

12
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,070
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.

13
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,720
I gave a speech? How was it?

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,440
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.

15
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,280
Really? It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,140
- Where are we going?
- To town, on each other.

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,220
Probably back in your room

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,490
because I also want
to see your research.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Okay, you can see my research,

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,760
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,850
Mr Stark.

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
Ho Yinsen.

23
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
I finally met a man called "Ho."

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,400
I would like to introduce you
to our guest, Dr Wu.

25
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,950
- Oh, this guy.
- Mr Stark.

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,370
You're a heart doctor. She's going to
need a cardiologist after I...

27
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,080
Perhaps another time?

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,500
<i>It started in Bern, Switzerland.
1999.</i>

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,670
<i>- The old days.
- Mr Stark!</i>

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,130
<i>I never thought they would
come back to bite me.</i>

31
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,220
<i>Why would they?</i>

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,010
Wow! Hey, Tony!

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,680
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

34
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,330
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.

35
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,560
Of course, but Ms Hansen,

36
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,060
My organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

37
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,230
Yeah, we're full.

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,690
Wow, he made it. He made the cut.

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,020
What floor you going to, pal?

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,720
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

41
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,830
The ground floor, actually,

42
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,780
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,700
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

44
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,700
She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,460
"Advanced Idea Mechanics,"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,140
I see that,
because it's on your T-shirt.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,710
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

48
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,510
Thank you, I'll call you.

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,430
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

50
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,860
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.

51
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,610
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,240
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

53
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,550
You know what I'm talking about?

54
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
I'll see you up there.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,900
Damn betcha.

56
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,650
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,020
Well, it was.

58
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,880
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,100
- that governs repair...
- Wow.

60
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,320
And chemically recode it.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

62
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,030
operating system...

63
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,470
- of a living organism.
- Exactly.

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,830
- Yes.
- Wow.

65
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,950
Is that... Can you...

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,540
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?

67
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,540
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

68
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,930
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

69
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,540
- Happy...
- That's cute...

70
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,090
Leave her ficus alone.

71
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,570
Because“.
And, no, seriously, don't.

72
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,780
- And you're starting with plants.
- For now, yeah.

73
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,760
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

74
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,620
- Well, it's...
- Human application.

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,850
Exactly, exactly.

76
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,930
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,740
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,220
Even limb regrowth.

79
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,030
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

80
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,110
Wow.

81
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,730
- In Switzerland.
- That's better.

82
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,860
- You're seeing things.
- This week.

83
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,990
You almost bought it, didn't you?

84
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,640
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

85
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,350
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

86
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,370
- The what?
- Down!

87
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,630
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

88
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,260
- We're good.
- Stay down.

89
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,470
You're right on me. I made it.

90
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,140
What the hell was that?

91
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,410
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...

92
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,270
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

93
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,980
It's not Y2K.

94
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,810
HEY! Happy New Year!

95
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,340
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

97
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
- You good?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,780
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

99
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,210
<i>So, why am I telling you this?</i>

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,090
<i>Because I had just created demons</i>

101
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,680
<i>and I didn't even know it.</i>

102
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,060
<i>Yeah, those were good times.</i>

103
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,770
<i>Then I moved on.</i>

104
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,150
<i>After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.</i>

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
<i>I forgot that night in Switzerland.</i>

106
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,610
<i>- These days, I'm a changed man.
- Forty-six.</i>

107
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,070
<i>I'm different now.</i>

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,320
<i>I'm... Well...</i>

109
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,910
<i>- Forty-seven.
- You know who I am.</i>

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,910
<i>Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</i>

111
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,410
No. Forty-eight.

112
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,460
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

113
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
<i>As you wish, sir.</i>

114
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,670
<i>I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</i>

115
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,380
Which I will.

116
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,970
All right, let's do this.

117
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,010
<i>BUM-E.</i>

118
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,100
Hi, Dummy.

119
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,520
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

120
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,520
Hey. Hey!

121
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,380
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

122
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

123
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,490
<i>Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</i>

124
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Focus up, ladies.

125
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,240
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

126
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,700
<i>I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival</i>

127
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,750
<i>of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.</i>

128
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,790
Start tight and then go wide.

129
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,330
<i>Stamp date and time.</i>

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
<i>Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.</i>

131
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,420
Initialise sequence.

132
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,800
Jarvis, drop my needle.

133
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,280
Crap.

134
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,350
All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

135
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,250
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

136
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,320
Slow it down just a...

137
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
little bit.

138
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,830
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

139
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,920
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

140
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm the best.

141
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,150
<i>As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</i>

142
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,110
<i>I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.</i>

143
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,200
<i>I didn't think it could get any worse.</i>

144
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,580
<i>Then I had to go and turn on the TV.</i>

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,920
<i>That's when he happened.</i>

146
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,840
<i>Some people call me a terrorist.</i>

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,220
<i>I consider myself a teacher.</i>

148
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,060
<i>America.</i>

149
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,360
<i>Ready for another lesson?</i>

150
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,650
<i>In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</i>

151
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,990
<i>until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</i>

152
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,370
<i>Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</i>

153
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,750
<i>and claim their land.</i>

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,710
<i>39 hours ago,</i>

155
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,670
<i>the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</i>

156
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,010
<i>I... I... I did that.</i>

157
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,430
<i>A quaint military church</i>

158
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,970
<i>filled with wives and children,
of course.</i>

159
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,020
<i>The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.</i>

160
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,350
<i>The braves were</i> away.

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,900
<i>President Ellis.</i>

162
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,360
<i>You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</i>

163
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,150
<i>And now you've missed me again.</i>

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
<i>You know who I am.</i>

165
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,290
<i>You don't know where I am.</i>

166
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,290
<i>And you'll never see me coming.</i>

167
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,920
<i>Now that we seem to be back,</i>

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
<i>let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</i>

169
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,470
<i>American airwaves were hijacked...</i>

170
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,130
<i>The nation remains on high alert.</i>

171
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,940
<i>All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</i>

172
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,310
<i>Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</i>

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,520
<i>is a newly minted resource.</i>

174
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,850
<i>I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

175
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,110
<i>The American people
will soon know him</i>

176
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,820
<i>as the Iron Patriot.</i>

177
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>And how is President Ellis responding?</i>

178
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,030
<i>By taking the guy
they call War Machine</i>

179
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,740
<i>and giving him a paint job.</i>

180
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,490
<i>The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</i>

181
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,460
<i>Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."</i>

182
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,460
<i>You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</i>

183
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,630
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

184
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,420
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.

185
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,230
"War Machine" was
a little too aggressive.

186
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,770
All right?
This sends a better message.

187
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,850
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

188
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,350
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

189
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,980
It's classified information, Tony.

190
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,570
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

191
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,860
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.

192
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,030
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.

193
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,240
There's no bomb casings.

194
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,620
You know I can help. Just ask.

195
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,700
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

196
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,870
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.

197
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,000
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

198
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,210
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

199
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,860
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

200
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,530
You're going to come at me like that?

201
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,050
I'm not trying to be a dick...

202
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,470
tator.

203
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,050
Do you mind signing my drawing?

204
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,660
If Richard doesn't mind.
Are you all right with this, Dick?

205
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,270
Yeah. Fine with me.

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
- What's your name?
- Erin.

207
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,730
I loved you in <i>A</i> Christmas Story,
by the way.

208
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,400
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

209
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,320
After New York, aliens... Come on.

210
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,070
They need to look strong.

211
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

212
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,260
- It's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.

213
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,830
- I get it.
- It's American business.

214
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,750
That's why I said I got it.

215
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,910
Are you okay?

216
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,620
I broke the crayon.

217
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,420
Are you okay, Mr Stark?

218
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,340
Take it easy. Tony.

219
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,510
How did you get out of the Wormhole?

220
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,260
Wait a minute. Tony!

221
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,420
- What did you say?
- Tony.

222
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,050
Sorry.

223
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,680
I'm just checking on the suit.

224
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,770
Okay.

225
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,440
Check the heart.

226
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,940
Is it the brain?

227
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,940
<i>No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</i>

228
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,860
Okay, so I was poisoned?

229
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,280
<i>My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</i>

230
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,910
Me?

231
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,250
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

232
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,250
Sorry, I gotta split.

233
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,590
Badge.

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,050
Badge.

235
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,510
Come on, badge.

236
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,430
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

237
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,030
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

238
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,970
This is an asset that we can put to use.

239
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,100
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

240
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,770
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that

241
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,940
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

242
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,360
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

243
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,900
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,

244
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,460
- you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?

245
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,950
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.

246
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,740
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head Of Security. Okay?

247
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,590
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

248
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,160
- However...
- I do appreciate it.

249
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,770
- Since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.

250
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,750
We've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.

251
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,920
Thank you.

252
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,540
It's not a compliment.

253
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,880
It's not... It is a compliment.

254
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,810
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

255
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,830
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.

256
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,840
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.

257
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,490
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?

258
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,220
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

259
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,780
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

260
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,140
How so?

261
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,790
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

262
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,850
so it's a little awkward.

263
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,770
I don't like the sound of that.

264
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Pepper

265
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Killian?

266
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,570
You look great.

267
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,280
You look really great.

268
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,620
God, you look great.

269
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,910
I... l... I.-

270
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,860
What on earth have you been doing?

271
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,210
Nothing fancy.

272
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,580
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.

273
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,630
And please, call me Aldrich.

274
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,340
You were supposed to be
issued a security badge.

275
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,430
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.

276
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,050
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.

277
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,260
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.

278
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,140
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

279
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,860
Hey, guy.

280
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,530
Merry Christmas.

281
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,870
After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" biotech research,

282
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,290
my think tank

283
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,420
now has a little something
in the pipeline.

284
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,380
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

285
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,790
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

286
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,430
Regard the human brain.

287
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,810
Wait, hold on, hold on.

288
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,860
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.

289
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,820
But if I do that...

290
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,450
That's the brain.

291
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,950
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?

292
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,370
Wow, that's amazing.

293
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,120
Thanks, it's mine.

294
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,460
What?

295
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,420
This. You're inside my head.

296
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,580
It's a... It's a live feed.

297
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,500
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

298
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,300
Come on.

299
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Now, pinch my arm.

300
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,470
I can take it. Pinch me.

301
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,890
What is that?

302
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,310
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.

303
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,900
But this is what I wanted to show you.

304
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,650
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential

305
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,660
and it goes here.

306
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,950
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us

307
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,830
is that our mind,

308
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,410
our entire DNA, in fact,

309
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,420
is destined to be upgraded.

310
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,670
Wow.

311
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,460
Wait...

312
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Hello?

313
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,680
- Is this Forehead Of Security?
- What?

314
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,660
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

315
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,030
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.

316
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,100
What, harassing interns?

317
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,540
<i>Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</i>

318
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,360
<i>when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</i>

319
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,600
<i>They would laugh in my face.</i>

320
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,070
<i>I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</i>

321
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,980
<i>Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</i>

322
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,860
What's going on? Fill me in.

323
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,150
<i>- For real?
- Yeah.</i>

324
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,200
<i>All right.
She's meeting up with this scientist.</i>

325
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,530
<i>- Rich guy. Handsome.</i>
- Right.

326
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,090
<i>I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</i>

327
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,180
- Yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.

328
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,880
<i>Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</i>

329
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,170
<i>Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</i>

330
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,880
<i>Where were we in '99?
The science conference?</i>

331
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,500
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.

332
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,270
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

333
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,900
Of course you don't remember him.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

334
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,880
<i>At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.</i>

335
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,640
But now it's getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

336
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,470
<i>- His</i> what?
<i>- Big brain.</i>

337
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,120
<i>And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</i>

338
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,180
Hold on. See?

339
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,080
<i>Look at what? You, watching them?</i>

340
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,860
<i>Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</i>

341
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,770
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

342
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,750
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

343
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,540
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

344
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,060
<i>Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</i>

345
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,480
<i>All right? I don't work for you.</i>

346
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,520
<i>And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</i>

347
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,080
<i>He's shifty.</i>

348
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
<i>- Relax.
- Seriously?</i>

349
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,930
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

350
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,350
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

351
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,230
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

352
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,810
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

353
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,250
and you're just ignoring her.

354
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.

355
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,900
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

356
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,600
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

357
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,200
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

358
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,930
I miss you, Happy.

359
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,100
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

360
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,490
<i>Now you're off with the super-friends.</i>

361
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,780
<i>I don't know what's going on
with you any more.</i>

362
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,910
<i>- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!</i>

363
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,940
I hate to cut you off.

364
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,080
- Do you have your Taser on you?
<i>- Why?</i>

365
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,370
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

366
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,480
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

367
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,860
<i>Yeah, nice.</i>

368
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,780
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

369
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,910
and recode its DNA.

370
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,990
That would be incredible.

371
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,790
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.

372
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,540
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

373
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,290
Tony, TOW-

374
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,090
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.

375
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,220
He turned me down.

376
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,760
But something tells me,
now there's a new genius on the throne

377
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,100
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more

378
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,140
and who has slightly less of an ego.

379
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,230
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

380
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,690
As much as I'd like to help you.

381
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,320
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

382
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,120
But then, as my father used to say,

383
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,950
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

384
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,500
That's very deep.

385
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,000
And I have no idea what it means.

386
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,960
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

387
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

388
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Happy-

389
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,930
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

390
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,770
Yes, I just...

391
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,280
God, I forgot my other things, so...

392
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,490
I'm just gonna...

393
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,220
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

394
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,680
What the... What is that?

395
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,270
You're wearing this in the house now?

396
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,940
What is that, like, Mark 15?

397
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,880
Yeah. Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

398
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,110
And you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

399
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,900
Just breaking it in.

400
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,120
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag at first, so...

401
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,370
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

402
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,790
Yes, I did. I...

403
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,370
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

404
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,500
Is it gonna fit through the door?

405
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,230
Well, actually, it's a good question.

406
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,320
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.

407
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,090
- Okay.
- So...

408
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,840
Tense? Good day? Huh?

409
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,590
Shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

410
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,260
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

411
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,470
Did I like it?

412
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,310
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

413
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,190
I appreciate the thought very much.

414
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,860
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?

415
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,650
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

416
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,620
You want to just kiss it
on the... The facial slit?

417
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage

418
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,370
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to Jimmy that thing open?

419
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,120
Crowbar, yeah.

420
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,540
Except there's been a radiation leak.

421
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,540
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

422
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,750
At least, let me get you, like,
a Hazmat suit.

423
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,220
A Geiger counter or something like that.

424
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,430
Busted.

425
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,100
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.

426
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,640
You ate without me already?
On date night?

427
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,760
- He was just...
- You mean you.

428
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,480
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were hosting you...

429
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
while I finished up a little work.

430
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,860
And yes, I had a quick bite.

431
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,420
I didn't know if you were coming home

432
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,290
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

433
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,870
- What?
- What?

434
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,540
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?

435
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Happy was concerned.

436
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,020
- You're spying on me.
- I wasn't.

437
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,270
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.

438
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,580
Come on. Pep?

439
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,670
Hey, I admit it.

440
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,800
My fault. Sorry.

441
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,010
I'm a piping hot mess.

442
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,180
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

443
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,770
Northing's been the same
since New York.

444
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,310
Really? I didn't notice that at all.

445
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,980
You experience things

446
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,260
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.

447
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,950
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.

448
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,470
The only reason I haven't cracked up

449
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,450
is probably because you moved in.

450
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,950
Which is great.

451
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,580
I love you. I'm lucky.

452
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,620
But honey, I can't sleep.

453
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,040
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.

454
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,880
I thinker.

455
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
Threat is imminent.

456
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,510
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

457
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,300
That's you.

458
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,640
And my suits, they're...

459
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Machines.

460
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,560
They're part of me.

461
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,810
A distraction.

462
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,980
Maybe.

463
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,670
I'm gonna take a shower.

464
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,460
Okay.

465
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
And you're gonna join me.

466
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,050
Better.

467
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,820
Tony.

468
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,950
Tony. Tony.

469
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,410
To...

470
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,830
Power down!

471
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,630
I must have called it in my sleep.

472
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,010
That's not supposed to happen.

473
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,510
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

474
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,390
Can we just... Just let me...

475
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,360
Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

476
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,110
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

477
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,440
Tinker with that.

478
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,140
Can you regulate?

479
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Yes, I can regulate.

480
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,470
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

481
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,440
It's a decent batch.

482
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,980
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.

483
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,450
I mean, for understanding.

484
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
I'm sorry, buddy.

485
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,440
What are you doing, buddy?

486
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,120
You out by yourself?
A little date night?

487
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,540
Seeing your favourite
chick flick, maybe?

488
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,320
Yeah, a little movie
called The <i>Party's</i> Over,

489
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,280
starring you and your junkie girlfriend.

490
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Here's the ticket.

491
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,800
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

492
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,270
Savin!

493
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,430
Help!

494
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,310
Help me!

495
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,480
<i>True story about fortune cookies.</i>

496
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,900
<i>They look Chinese.</i>

497
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,860
<i>They sound Chinese.</i>

498
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,070
<i>But they're actually
an American invention.</i>

499
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,950
<i>Which is why they're hollow,

500

<i>My disciples just destroyed another

00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,420
<i>The Chinese Theatre.</i>

503
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,010
<i>Mr President,</i>

504
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,390
<i>I know this must be getting frustrating.</i>

505
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,810
<i>But this season of terror
is drawing to a close.</i>

506
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,900
<i>And don't worry, the big one is coming.</i>

507
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,360
<i>Your graduation.</i>

508
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
Hi.

509
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,200
Do you mind leaving that on?

510
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,000
Sure.

511
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,430
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton <i>Abbey.</i>

512
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,140
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

513
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,010
One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.

514
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,660
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

515
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,360
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

516
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,480
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

517
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,210
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...

518
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,820
His reaction
to the latest attack.

519
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,490
Mr Stark, hi there.

520
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,830
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

521
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,040
Anything else you can tell us?

522
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

523
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm just saying.

524
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,090
Is that what you want?

525
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,970
Here's a little holiday greeting

526
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,470
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

527
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,930
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

528
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,690
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

529
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,810
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided

530
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,150
that you just died, pal.

531
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,360
I'm gonna come get the body.

532
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,200
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

533
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,490
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

534
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,410
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

535
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,000
10880 Malibu Point.

536
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,250
90265.

537
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,170
I'll leave the door unlocked.

538
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,450
That's what you wanted, right?

539
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,340
Bill me.

540
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,770
<i>I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,</i>

541
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:18,060
<i>drawn from
S.H.l.E.I.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.</i>

542

<i>Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.</i>

543
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,650
Okay. What have we got here?

544
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,080
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "advisor to the king."

545
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,450
South American insurgency tactics.

546
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,000
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

547
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,420
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.

548
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,090
<i>The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.</i>

549
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,800
<i>Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.</i>

550
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,550
No bomb parts found in a three-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?

551
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
<i>No, sir.</i>

552
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Talk to me, Happy.

553
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,330
When is a bomb not a bomb?

554
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,760
Any military victims?

555
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,410
<i>Not according to public record, sir.</i>

556
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,600
Bring up
the thermogenic signatures again.

557
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,390
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

558
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,180
<i>The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.</i>

<i>and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.</i>

561
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,440
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

562
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,910
Nope.

563
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,040
That.
Are you sure that's not one of his?

564
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,580
<i>It pre dates any known Mandarin attack.</i>

565
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,500
<i>The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.</i>

566
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,420
Bring her around.

567
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,510
<i>The heat signature
is remarkably similar.</i>

568
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,640
<i>3,000 degree Celsius.</i>

569
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,520
That's two military guys.

570
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,550
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

571
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,480
<i>Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.</i>

572
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,570
Are we still at ding-dong?

573
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,070
We're supposed to be on total...

574
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,280
security lockdown.

575
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,200
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

576
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,910
<i>There's only so much I can do, sir,</i>

577
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,910
<i>when you give the world's press
your home address.</i>

578
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,180
Right there is fine.

579
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,890
You're not the Mandarin.

580
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,060
Are you? Are you?

581
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,230
You don't remember.

582
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,440
Why am I not surprised?

583
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,830
Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

584
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,320
<i>Gluten-free waffles, sir.</i>

585
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,690
That's right.

586
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,700
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
some place not here.

587
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
It's urgent.

588
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,080
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

589
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,200
It's...

590
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,040
- With her.
- Tony?

591
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,590
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

592
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,710
Old botanist pal

593
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,180
that I used to know, barely.

594
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,180
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

595
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,830
waiting in the car that I've never met.

596
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,220
He's 13.

597
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,100
No, I need your help.

598
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,770
But, what for? Why now?

599
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,100
Because I read the papers, and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

600
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,230
I'll be fine.

601
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,770
I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

602
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,730
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.

603
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,570
- She's not, really.
- No, not really.

604
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,820
- It was just one night.
- Yep.

605
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,620
That's how you did it, isn't it?

606
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,040
- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.

607
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,040
- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?

608
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,760
- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.

609
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,990
Okay. We've been through this.

610
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,920
- Nope.
- Yep!

611
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,960
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

612
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,540
- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.

613
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

614
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,840
This is how normal people behave.

615
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,090
I can't protect you out there.

616
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,010
Is... ls that normal?

617
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,260
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!

618
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,020
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

619
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,350
Calm down.

620
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,350
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.

621
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,200
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.

622
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,150
I don't like it.

623
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,460
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

624
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,840
- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?

625
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,280
That's not even up for discussion.

626
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,990
- Can we...
- I said no. What?

627
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,310
Do we need to worry about that?

628
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,790
<i>I</i> 9011 you.

629
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
I got you first.

630
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,460
Like I said, we can't stay here.

631
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,840
Move! I'm right behind you.

632
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,540
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

633
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,870
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

634
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,980
Go!

635
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,090
Oh, my God. Tony!

636
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,230
<i>Sir, Ms Potts
is clear of the structure.</i>

637
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,680
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

638
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,810
<i>Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.</i>

639
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,910
That's one.

640
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,410
<i>Sir, the suit is not combat ready.</i>

641
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,510
That's two.

642
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,380
Tony!

643
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,910
<i>Sir, take a deep breath.</i>

644
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,470
<i>Flight power restored.</i>

645
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,950
<i>Sir?</i>

646
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,740
<i>Sir!</i>

647
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,870
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

648
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,000
<i>That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.</i>

649
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,950
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?

650
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,750
<i>We are five miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.</i>

651
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,250
Why?

652
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,000
Jarvis. Not my idea.

653
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,910
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!

654
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,350
I gotta get Pepper-

655
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,140
<i>I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.</i>

656
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
Who asked you?

657
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,260
Open the suit.

658
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,030
<i>I... I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.</i>

659
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,050
Open it, J.

660
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,820
That's brisk.

661
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,620
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...

662
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,620
<i>I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.</i>

663
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,290
Jarvis.

664
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,880
Jarvis?

665
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,550
Don't leave me, buddy.

666
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:16,910
<i>Stark secure server now transferring
to all known receivers.</i>

667
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,320
<i>Pepper, it's me.</i>

668
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,700
I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.

669
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,660
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

670
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,500
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.

671
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,670
Also, it's Christmastime
and the rabbit's too big.

672
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,760
Done. Sorry.

673
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,840
And I'm sorry in advance

674
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,890
because I can't come home yet.

675
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,100
<i>I need to find this guy.</i>

676
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,020
<i>You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.</i>

677
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,440
<i>I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.</i>

678
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,960
Let's get you comfy.

679
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,680
You happy now?

680
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,060
Freeze!

681
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,650
Don't move.

682
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,650
You got me.

683
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,900
Nice potato gun.

684
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,570
Barrel's a little long.

685
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,580
Between that and the wide gauge,
it's gonna diminish your FPS.

686
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,000
And now you're out of ammo.

687
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,540
What's that thing on your chest?

688
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,750
It's an electromagnet.

689
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,800
You should know,
you got a box of them right here.

690
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,340
What does it power?

691
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,270
Oh, my God.

692
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,560
That...

693
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,980
That's... ls that Iron Man?

694
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,610
Technically, I am.

695
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,360
Technically, you're dead.

696
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,410
Valid point.

697
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,870
What happened to him?

698
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,370
Life.

699
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,040
I built him. I take care of him.

700
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,040
I'll fix him.

701
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,170
Like a mechanic?

702
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,710
Yeah.

703
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,130
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...

704
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,300
It's "Iron Patriot" HOW-

705
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,550
That's way cooler.

706
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,970
No, it's not.

707
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,100
Anyways, I would have added in
the retro...

708
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,770
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

709
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,770
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

710
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,900
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

711
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,310
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.

712
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,730
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?

713
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,990
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

714
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:01,490
Sorry.

715
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,070
Are you?

716
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,870
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

717
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,660
So, who's home?

718
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,120
My mom already left for the diner,
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

719
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,250
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.

720
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,450
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.

721
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Here's what I need.

722
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,840
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,

723
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,350
the pneumatic actuator
from your bazooka over there,

724
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:31,810
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.

725
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,020
What's in it for me?

726
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,860
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?

727
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,360
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

728
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,940
How'd you know that?

729
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,280
I got just the thing.

730
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,580
This is a <i>piniata</i> for a cricket.

731
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,380
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.

732
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,710
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

733
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,870
it discourages bullying.

734
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,300
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?

735
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,800
Deal? What do you say?

736
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,720
- Deal.
- Deal?

737
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,180
What's your name?

738
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,800
Harley. And you're...

739
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,260
The mechanic.

740
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,560
Tony.

741
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,520
You know what keeps
going through my head?

742
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,190
"Where's my sandwich?"

743
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,490
Where is Tony Stark?

744
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,560
<i>Stark secure server.
Retinal scan verified.</i>

745
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,770
<i>Pepper, it's me.</i>

746
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,780
<i>I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.</i>

747
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,900
<i>So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</i>

748
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,370
<i>That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.</i>

749
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,140
Why were you at the house tonight?

750
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,710
What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?

751
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,500
I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.

752
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,480
So, if you still want to talk about it

753
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,600
I suggest that we get
ourselves some place safe.

754
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,600
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?

755
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,890
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

756
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,730
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

757
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,150
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.

758
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,940
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

759
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,360
This boss of yours,
does he have a name?

760
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,200
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

761
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,790
<i>We took the house down, sir.
But there's no sign of a body.</i>

762
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:57,910
- I see.
- No Stark.

763
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,620
I have to go.

764
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,960
The master is about to record
and he's a little...

765
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,630
Well, you know how he gets.

766
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,260
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

767
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,850
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.

768
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,230
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

769
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,950
Report in.

770
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,990
Path is clear.

771
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,460
The master is travelling.

772
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,350
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

773
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,680
The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,

774
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,150
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

775
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:08,000
By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...

776
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,260
- Yeah?
- I was kind of hoping

777
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,530
for something a little more
adult than that.

778
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:15,240
She's six.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.

779
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,740
When can we talk about New York?

780
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,700
Maybe never. Relax about it.

781
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,670
What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?

782
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,900
I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.

783
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,170
What's the official story here?
What happened?

784
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,800
I guess this guy named Chad Davis
used to live roundabouts.

785
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,300
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

786
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:42,640
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

787
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,400
Then he blew himself up, right here.

788
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,490
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.

789
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,320
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.

790
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,870
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

791
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,210
Think about it.

792
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,880
Six dead. Only five shadows.

793
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,460
Yeah.

794
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,380
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.

795
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,840
Except the bomb guy.

796
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,810
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.

797
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,310
That's why there's only five.

798
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,350
- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.

799
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,110
You know what
this crater reminds me of?

800
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,650
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

801
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,370
That giant Wormhole in New York.

802
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,870
Does it remind you?

803
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,000
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

804
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,040
Are they coming back? The aliens?

805
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,420
Maybe. Can you stop?

806
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,330
Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?

807
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,170
Does this subject make you edgy?

808
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,620
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

809
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,430
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

810
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,930
Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?

811
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,810
- Do you have medication?
- No.

812
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,450
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

813
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,990
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

814
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,520
Are you going completely mental?

815
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,770
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

816
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,120
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

817
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,690
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

818
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,820
Man, you did it, didn't you?
You happy now?

819
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:19,950
What did I say?

820
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,700
Hey! Wait up!

821
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,580
Wait, wait.

822
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,290
What the hell was that?

823
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,470
Your fault. You spazzed me out.

824
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,510
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

825
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,800
The guy who died.

826
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,020
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs Davis, where is she?

827
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,140
Where she always is.

828
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,850
See? Now, you're being helpful.

829
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,360
Sorry.

830
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,900
Lady?

831
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,820
Is this...

832
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,870
Thank you.

833
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:08,000
Nice haircut. It suits you.

834
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,540
Nice watch.

835
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,250
Yeah. A limited edition.

836
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,840
I don't doubt it.

837
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,130
Well, have a good evening.

838
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,850
Excuse me.

839
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,200
Mrs Davis?

840
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,950
Mind if I join you?

841
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,820
Free country.

842
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,780
Sure is.

843
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,920
All right.

844
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,880
Where would you like to start?

845
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,420
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.

846
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,030
I want to know
what you think happened.

847
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:08,060
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.

848
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,810
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.

849
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,770
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?

850
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,100
Supposed to meet someone here?

851
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,190
Yeah.

852
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,460
Mrs Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.

853
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,420
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

854
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,250
Someone used him.

855
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,590
What?

856
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,180
As a weapon.

857
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,680
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?

858
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,600
Actually, I am.

859
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,940
Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?

860
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,030
It's called an arrest.

861
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,120
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

862
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,240
Homeland Security. We good here?

863
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,160
No, we're not "good."

864
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,930
I need a little more information
than that.

865
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,210
I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.

866
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,750
Yeah? Why don't you get on the horn
to Nashville, and upgrade me?

867
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,630
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way

868
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,470
but the fun way is always good.

869
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,340
Deputy, get this woman out of...

870
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,460
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.

871
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,170
- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.

872
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:02,710
Watch this.

873
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,700
You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

874
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,080
That's all you got?

875
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,060
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

876
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,460
Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.

877
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,270
- Let me go!
- Help me!

878
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,650
Anyway-

879
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,900
Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?

880
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,950
Mr Stark, I am so sorry.

881
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,630
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,

882
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,570
"I want my god damn file."

883
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,700
It's not your fault, kid.

884
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,210
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

885
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,880
You like that, Westvvorld?

886
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,740
That's the thing about smart guys,

887
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,300
we always cover our ass.

888
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,410
You're welcome.

889
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,080
For what? Did I miss something?

890
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,120
Me, saving your life.

891
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,340
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.

892
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,170
And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.

893
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,550
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.

894
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,430
Unlike you?

895
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,890
Admit it, you need me.

896
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,520
We're connected.

897
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,760
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

898
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,150
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

899
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,670
and stay connected to the telephone,

900
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,410
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?

901
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,490
Can you feel that? We're done here.

902
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,410
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.

903
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,810
Bye, kid.

904
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,710
I'm sorry, kid.

905
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,420
You did good.

906
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,380
So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?

907
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Yeah.

908
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,730
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?

909
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,050
I'm cold.

910
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,590
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

911
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,600
Because we're connected.

912
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,520
It was worth a shot.

913
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,290
<i>You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.</i>

914
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,750
<i>It goes with any décor...</i>

915
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,960
- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.

916
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,050
- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

917
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,190
<i>I'm trying. There's nothing I can...</i>

918
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,440
<i>Well, where is the feed coming from?</i>

919
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,460
<i>I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and</i> I...

920
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,590
The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.

921
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,010
It's not just our station.

922
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,180
What about a backup manual?

923
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,390
<i>We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...</i>

924
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:09,350
Mr Vice President,
I think you should see this.

925
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,810
Oh, God, not again.

926
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,650
Is the President getting this?

927
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,500
<i>Mr President.</i>

928
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,750
<i>Only two lessons remain.</i>

929
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,880
<i>And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.</i>

930
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,710
<i>Meet Thomas Richards.</i>

931
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,970
<i>Good strong name. Good strong job.</i>

932
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:45,850
<i>Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.</i>

933
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,850
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

934
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,590
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

935
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,940
live on your television, in 30 seconds.

936
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,150
No!

937
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,610
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.

938
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,830
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?

939
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,660
<i>America,</i>

940
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,870
<i>if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,</i>

941
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,670
<i>Tom lives.</i>

942
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:13,750
<i>Go!</i>

943
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,340
How did he hack my phone?

944
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,380
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

945
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,710
I have to make this call.

946
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,200
I'd strongly advise against that.

947
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,890
This is the right thing to do.

948
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,870
<i>There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis.</i>

949
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,830
So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.

950
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,920
Because nothing,

951
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,420
not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,

952
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,510
can save YOU.

953
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,970
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

954
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:11,430
Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.

955
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,230
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

956
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,140
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

957
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,630
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

958
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,820
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

959
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,460
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy.

960
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,510
Don't move!

961
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:57,810
Hang on a second.

962
01:02:58,690 --> 01:02:59,690
Hello?

963
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,940
You ever have a chick straddling you,
and you look up

964
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,440
and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

965
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,060
Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?

966
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,110
<i>It's me, pal.</i>

967
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,320
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,

968
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,330
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?

969
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,850
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.

970
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:14,870
What are you doing?

971
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,080
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?

972
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,170
Yeah.

973
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,240
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat now, I need your login.

974
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,460
It's the same as it's always been,
"WarMachine68."

975
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:26,630
And password, please.

976
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,750
Look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.

977
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,140
It's not the 80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.

978
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,220
Give me your login.

979
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:36,270
"WAR MACHINE ROX"
with an all caps.

980
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:40,980
Yeah, okay.

981
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:44,320
That is so much better
than "Iron Patriot."

982
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,990
<i>Very nice. Very nice.</i>

983
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,790
<i>I have one question for you.</i>

984
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,420
<i>What would you like
for Christmas this year?</i>

985
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,540
<i>Well, David...</i>

986
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,430
Do not erase a programme from
my DVR unless you are 100% sure...

987
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,810
<i>One more time!
Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.</i>

988
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,520
Because you erase my shows!

989
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,320
That ain't gonna cut it.

990
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,530
We talked about this.

991
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,120
Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...

992
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,440
Mom, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.

993
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,370
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

994
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,100
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

995
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:44,250
I knew you were still alive!

996
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,880
Come on in. Close the door.

997
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,050
Wow. Can I just say, sir...

998
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,260
Yep.

999
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,220
I am your biggest fan.

1000
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,510
First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?

1001
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,600
No, no, no. Just us.

1002
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,770
Great. What's your name?

1003
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,440
- 680'- - 680'-

1004
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,560
- Wow.
- Right there is fine.

1005
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:05,860
- Okay.
- Okay?

1006
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,180
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

1007
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,490
- Good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.

1008
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,990
I don't know if you can tell,

1009
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:15,200
but I have patterned
my whole look after you.

1010
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,680
- My hair's a little...
- It's fine.

1011
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,620
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.

1012
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,160
Right.

1013
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:24,290
I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...

1014
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,750
Boom!

1015
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,960
A Hispanic Scott Baio.

1016
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,760
- I'm sorry. ls that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...

1017
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,600
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.

1018
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:40,140
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?

1019
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:44,140
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.

1020
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,150
I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys.

1021
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,990
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.

1022
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,150
I don't have enough juice.

1023
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,570
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?

1024
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,860
Recalibrate the lSDNs.

1025
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,990
Pump it up by about 40%.

1026
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,930
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.

1027
01:05:58,950 --> 01:05:59,660
Yeah.

1028
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,750
Tony needs Gary.

1029
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,000
And Gary needs Tony.

1030
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,420
- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.

1031
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:31,480
<i>What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?</i>

1032
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:34,450
<i>I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.</i>

1033
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,950
<i>Will you please state your name
for the camera?</i>

1034
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,230
<i>Ellen Brandt.</i>

1035
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:44,540
<i>Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.</i>

1036
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,070
<i>Addiction will not be tolerated.</i>

1037
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,080
<i>Those who cannot regulate
will be out from the programme.</i>

1038
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,300
<i>Once misfits, cripples...</i>

1039
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,050
<i>You are the next iteration
of human evolution.</i>

1040
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,220
<i>Everybody, before we start...</i>

1041
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:06,520
<i>I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter</i>

1042
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,730
<i>as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.</i>

1043
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,480
<i>Today is your glory-</i>

1044
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,650
<i>Let's begin.</i>

1045
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,950
<i>We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!</i>

1046
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,300
<i>Get her out!
Get them out of here!</i>

1047
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,590
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

1048
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,300
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?

1049
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,600
It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?

1050
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,020
Sold it to the Mandarin.

1051
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,850
Got you, pal.

1052
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,940
<i>What happened?</i>

1053
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,610
Fun fact.

1054
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:59,820
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,

1055
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,330
the idealistic Werner Von Braun

1056
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,620
dreamed of space travel.

1057
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:09,750
He stargazed.

1058
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,590
Do you know what he said
when the first V-2 hit London?

1059
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:18,050
"The rocket performed perfectly."

1060
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,640
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

1061
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:28,310
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.

1062
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:33,940
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.

1063
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,280
And you look up,

1064
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,610
you're a long way from shore.

1065
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,700
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.

1066
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,870
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.

1067
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:51,500
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

1068
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:54,130
That's exactly what we used to do.

1069
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,420
So, don't judge yourself.

1070
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,920
Thank you, Pepper.

1071
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:02,930
I really appreciate that.

1072
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,890
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.

1073
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,060
<i>Maya, rum!</i>

1074
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:19,900
Hi, Pepper.

1075
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:24,090
So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?

1076
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:25,270
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1077
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,800
I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.

1078
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,950
I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark, when he threatened us?

1079
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,910
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

1080
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

1081
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,050
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

1082
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,680
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

1083
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,220
<i>This is support team Blue-Zero.</i>

1084
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:53,110
<i>Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.</i>

1085
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,170
COPY-

1086
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,400
Nobody move.

1087
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:09,580
Support Blue-Zero,

1088
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,580
unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.

1089
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,250
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1090
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,750
I think you messed up again.

1091
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:18,670
Yes, you're free, if you weren't before.

1092
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,000
It's... Of course.

1093
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,090
Yes, ma'am.

1094
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,300
Iron Patriot on the job.

1095
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,470
Happy to help.

1096
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:24,760
No need to thank me, ma'am.

1097
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,130
It's my pleasure.

1098
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,520
Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.

1099
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,850
If you want this suit,

1100
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,270
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.

1101
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,070
That's the plan, Colonel.

1102
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:46,240
Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.

1103
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,620
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?

1104
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,750
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.

1105
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,620
<i>- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.</i>

1106
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,230
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.

1107
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:57,710
<i>Jarvis, how are we?</i>

1108
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:00,230
<i>It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</i>

1109
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:03,170
<i>and then at the end of the sentence,
I say the wrong cranberry.</i>

1110
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,550
<i>And, sir, you were right.</i>

1111
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,300
<i>Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities</i>

1112
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,800
<i>I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.</i>

1113
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,260
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa...

1114
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,270
Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?

1115
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,770
<i>Actually, sir, it's in Miami.</i>

1116
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,730
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through

1117
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,190
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

1118
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,690
but not right now.

1119
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:22,850
Harley, where is he really?

1120
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,900
<i>Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.</i>

1121
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:28,530
It does say Miami, Florida.

1122
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:31,580
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?

1123
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:33,080
It's not charging.

1124
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,630
<i>Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.</i>

1125
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,130
<i>It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.</i>

1126
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,260
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?

1127
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:52,160
It's my suit, and I can't...
I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...

1128
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:54,140
Oh, God, not again.

1129
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,930
<i>Tony?</i>

1130
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,900
<i>Are you having another attack?</i>

1131
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,300
I didn't even mention New York.

1132
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,820
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.

1133
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:06,690
Okay...

1134
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:09,990
God, what am I gonna do?

1135
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,620
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.

1136
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,540
You're a mechanic, right?

1137
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,080
Right.

1138
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,250
<i>You said so.</i>

1139
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,710
Yes, I did.

1140
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,710
Why don't you just build something?

1141
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,770
Okay.

1142
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,810
<i>Thanks, kid.</i>

1143
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:29,590
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.

1144
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:31,000
My fault again.

1145
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,930
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...

1146
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:35,280
Well.

1147
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,110
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

1148
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,700
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

1149
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,080
That's me.

1150
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,700
Nessie.

1151
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,880
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

1152
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,460
There's some guy over here.

1153
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,760
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.

1154
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,050
Hey!

1155
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,180
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1156
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,800
Don't move.

1157
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,010
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.

1158
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,300
Although the guns are all fake

1159
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,640
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1160
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:09,780
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

1161
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,610
Heard enough.

1162
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:14,770
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.

1163
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:15,980
Where?

1164
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,240
Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?

1165
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,280
He's here.
He's here, but he's not here.

1166
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,360
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

1167
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:25,120
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

1168
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,950
- It is.
- It's complicated.

1169
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,370
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.

1170
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,100
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.

1171
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,960
Sit.

1172
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,090
Oh, Jesus.

1173
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:46,260
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1174
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:47,390
What are you?

1175
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,100
A decoy? You're a double, right?

1176
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:53,270
You mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.

1177
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,150
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

1178
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,030
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.

1179
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:03,070
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," it's not real.

1180
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:05,530
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1181
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:13,670
Well, I had a little problem
with substances.

1182
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:18,000
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,

1183
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:20,380
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.

1184
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,010
- Next?
- Then,

1185
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:24,970
they approached me
about the role,

1186
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,470
and they knew about the drugs.

1187
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,230
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?

1188
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,520
They said they'd give me more.

1189
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,640
They gave me things.

1190
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:34,230
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.

1191
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:36,560
They gave me things.

1192
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:38,860
Did you just nod off?

1193
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,030
Hey.

1194
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,950
No, and a lovely speedboat.

1195
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,450
And the thing was, he needed someone

1196
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:48,450
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.

1197
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:52,870
"He"?

1198
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,460
- Killian?
- Killian.

1199
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:00,380
- He created you?
- He created me.

1200
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:02,130
Custom-made terror threat.

1201
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,380
Yes. Yes.

1202
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:06,340
His think tank thought it up.

1203
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,060
The pathology of a serial killer.

1204
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:12,140
The manipulation
of Western iconography.

1205
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,730
Ready for another lesson?

1206
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,270
Blah, blah, blah.

1207
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,820
No.

1208
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,860
Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.

1209
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:23,490
Your performance?

1210
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,530
Where people died?

1211
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,280
No, they didn't.

1212
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:31,290
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.

1213
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:33,500
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1214
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,370
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.

1215
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,630
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma

1216
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,880
and he might not wake up.

1217
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:40,350
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.

1218
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:41,880
You're still going down, pal.

1219
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,960
You under...

1220
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:52,560
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

1221
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:55,140
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

1222
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,150
No.

1223
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,040
You should have pressed
the panic button.

1224
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,940
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

1225
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,710
Okay.

1226
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:26,300
It's just like old times, huh?

1227
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:29,390
Yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.

1228
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,100
It wasn't my idea.

1229
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,180
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

1230
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:34,350
I took his money.

1231
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,810
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.

1232
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,730
- No.
- Yeah.

1233
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,480
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.

1234
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,400
Yeah?

1235
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,780
A lot has happened, Tony.

1236
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,200
But I'm close.

1237
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,990
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.

1238
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,250
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.

1239
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,810
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.

1240
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:58,160
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1241
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,500
Then help me fix it.

1242
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,170
Did I do that?

1243
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:08,510
Yes.

1244
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,360
I remember the night, not the morning.

1245
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,780
Is this what
you've been chasing around?

1246
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,890
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

1247
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,270
You used to have a moral psychology.

1248
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:21,520
You used to have ideals.

1249
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,270
You wanted to help people.

1250
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,230
Now look at you.

1251
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,240
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who

1252
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:34,080
still has their soul.

1253
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:40,750
Get me out of here.

1254
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,210
Come on.

1255
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,060
You know what my old man
used to say to me?

1256
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:52,180
One of his favourite of many sayings...

1257
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,640
"The early bird gets the worm,
but the second mouse gets the cheese."

1258
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,410
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1259
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:01,480
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1260
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,560
I'm here to thank you.

1261
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:06,050
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

1262
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,190
Desperation.

1263
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,400
If you think back to Switzerland,

1264
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:13,490
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

1265
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:16,450
For the first 20 minutes,

1266
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,870
I actually thought you'd show up.

1267
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,750
And the next hour...

1268
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:26,750
I considered taking
that one-step shortcut to the lobby.

1269
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,050
If you know what I mean.

1270
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,420
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1271
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,180
But as I looked out over that city,

1272
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:37,100
<i>nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</i>

1273
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:39,430
<i>no one was even looking.</i>

1274
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,520
<i>I had a thought that would guide me
for years to come.</i>

1275
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,310
Anonymity, Tony.

1276
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,780
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

1277
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:49,940
Right?

1278
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,450
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.

1279
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:54,990
<i>Because the second
you give evil a face,</i>

1280
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,030
<i>a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</i>

1281
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,700
you hand the people a target.

1282
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:01,450
You're something else.

1283
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:04,790
You have met him, I assume?

1284
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:06,460
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

1285
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,880
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.

1286
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,760
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

1287
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:11,830
He's a stage actor.

1288
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,890
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1289
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,010
Anyway, the point is,

1290
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,430
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1291
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,840
subtlety has kind of had its day.

1292
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,060
What's next for you in your world?

1293
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,270
I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.

1294
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:38,070
Desperation.

1295
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,080
Now, this is live.

1296
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:43,370
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment

1297
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:47,920
the body is trying to decide whether to
accept EXTREMIS, or just give up.

1298
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,840
And if it gives up,

1299
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:54,840
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.

1300
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,220
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.

1301
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:03,930
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1302
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,520
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1303
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,400
Let him go.

1304
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:10,690
Hold on, hold on.

1305
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,690
Maya...

1306
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,740
I said, let him go.

1307
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:16,900
What are you doing?

1308
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:19,700
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1309
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:24,790
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1310
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,210
Maya, give me the injector.

1311
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:28,750
If I die, Killian,

1312
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:31,920
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1313
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,210
We're not doing this, okay?

1314
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,630
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

1315
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,600
The good news is,

1316
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:53,190
a high-level position
has just been vacated.

1317
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:03,870
You are a maniac.

1318
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:06,120
No, I'm a visionary.

1319
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,660
But I do own a maniac.

1320
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:11,710
And he takes the stage tonight.

1321
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,780
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1322
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,550
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

1323
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:22,550
That's great, but the last time I looked,
there was somebody inside of it.

1324
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,730
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1325
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,900
Hello, Colonel.

1326
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,240
Step aside.

1327
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,410
We'll get you out of there.

1328
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,620
Don't worry.

1329
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,080
You'll damage the armour.

1330
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,710
Yes, I will.

1331
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:54,460
But you can fix it, right?

1332
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,050
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.

1333
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:59,630
And I want Potts with me.

1334
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,720
She's still in Phase Two.

1335
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,000
You're not going deaf, are you?

1336
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,990
Careful, there. It's a limited edition.

1337
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,450
Hey, Ponytail Express.

1338
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,860
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?

1339
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,890
832 miles.

1340
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,410
Very nice.

1341
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,830
I'm good like that.

1342
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,920
Can you stop that?

1343
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,540
Break it, you bought it.

1344
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,920
I think I bought it.

1345
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:41,930
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.

1346
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:44,370
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.

1347
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,610
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1348
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:48,090
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1349
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,180
This.

1350
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,270
That.

1351
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,650
Are you coming out?

1352
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,700
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.

1353
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:06,780
All right. Let's go.

1354
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,170
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

1355
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:24,430
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1356
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,470
This time tomorrow,

1357
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:30,140
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,

1358
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,980
and the world's most feared terrorist
in the other.

1359
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:37,230
I'll own the war on terror.

1360
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,270
Create supply and demand.

1361
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:43,690
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

1362
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,990
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

1363
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:50,490
on the ground in five, four, three...

1364
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,870
Come on! Two...

1365
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,910
How did we get this shift?

1366
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,000
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1367
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:58,330
Put down your weapons.

1368
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:00,800
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.

1369
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,260
In five, four, bang!

1370
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:04,420
Wow.

1371
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,440
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.

1372
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,970
I am just beyond terrified.

1373
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,550
Here it comes.

1374
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,970
- Three, four...
- Shut up.

1375
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,810
Five, four, three, two, one!

1376
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:16,310
Told you.

1377
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,030
Where's the rest?

1378
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,890
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.

1379
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:38,640
Better late than never.

1380
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,570
Not this time. Not the face.

1381
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:49,950
It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.

1382
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,360
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

1383
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,950
<i>All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1384
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:01,920
<i>Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1385
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,210
Let's go!

1386
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,880
Crap.

1387
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,680
Tony?

1388
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,490
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.

1389
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,230
No. You got yours?

1390
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,440
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.

1391
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,330
<i>There's somebody I'd like you to meet.</i>

1392
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,860
You, you, you! Move! Get out!

1393
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,450
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1394
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:37,740
What's this? I had winners.

1395
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,090
What have you come as?

1396
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,590
You make a move,
and I break your face.

1397
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:54,550
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1398
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:56,010
This is the Mandarin?

1399
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,100
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

1400
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:59,970
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1401
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:03,190
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1402
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:07,020
But, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1403
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,570
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1404
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:10,780
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1405
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,400
Doing what?

1406
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,660
I get it! That hurt. I get it! I get it!

1407
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,450
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1408
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,700
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1409
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,830
What? No.

1410
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,370
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1411
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:27,880
Something to do with a big boat.

1412
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,300
I can take you there.

1413
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,840
<i>Olé, Olé, Olé, Olé...</i>

1414
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,930
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1415
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:38,970
And this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1416
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,800
Is that... ls that important?

1417
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,600
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1418
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,440
So?

1419
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,360
What are we gonna do?

1420
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,560
We don't have any transport.

1421
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:50,610
Right.

1422
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,610
Hey, Ringo.

1423
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:56,320
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1424
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:01,180
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1425
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,300
But we also have to figure out

1426
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:04,080
- this vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1427
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,560
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1428
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:06,630
That's the vice president.

1429
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:08,000
Thanks.

1430
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:09,750
Hello?

1431
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,500
<i>Sir, this is Tony Stark.</i>

1432
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,460
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1433
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:16,110
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1434
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:18,180
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1435
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,220
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1436
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,560
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1437
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,940
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1438
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,060
I think we're good, here.

1439
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:29,150
<i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1440
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,440
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1441
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,130
<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1442
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:34,710
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1443
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:36,900
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1444
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:39,910
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1445
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:41,750
<i>- Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodes and Stark out.</i>

1446
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:45,120
Everything okay, sir?

1447
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,210
Couldn't be better.

1448
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:55,550
I love you, babe.

1449
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:17,650
Colonel Rhodes.

1450
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:21,070
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1451
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:27,040
We gotta make a decision.

1452
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,920
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1453
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,710
<i>Sir, I have an update from Malibu.</i>

1454
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:33,920
<i>The cranes have finally arrived,</i>

1455
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,090
<i>and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.</i>

1456
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,840
And what about the suit I'm wearing?

1457
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,260
<i>The armour is now at 92%.</i>

1458
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,430
That's going to have to do.

1459
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:53,230
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get a quick picture.

1460
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,300
Sure.

1461
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,200
Everything all right, Colonel?

1462
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,030
It is an honour, Mr President.

1463
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:49,410
If you're gonna do it, do it!

1464
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,750
Cool your boots, sir.

1465
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:53,330
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1466
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,920
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.

1467
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,920
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1468
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,170
Get me eyes on it now.

1469
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,470
Image coming through now, sir.

1470
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,680
Was that Rhodes?

1471
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,190
Is anyone there?

1472
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,190
Let us out!

1473
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,170
The President.

1474
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:37,880
Now.

1475
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:38,960
He's not here.

1476
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:44,840
Try the jet stream?

1477
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:47,890
Speaking of which, go fish.

1478
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,580
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1479
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:26,590
How many in the air?

1480
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:28,300
<i>Thirteen, sir.</i>

1481
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:32,220
- How many can I carry?
- Four, sir.

1482
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:45,240
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?

1483
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,910
Oh, God! No! No!

1484
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:55,750
Listen to me. See that guy?

1485
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,790
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.

1486
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,330
- You got it?
- What?

1487
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,170
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.

1488
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:07,630
We can do this, Heather.

1489
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,770
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

1490
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:24,230
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?

1491
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,520
That's what we're going to do.

1492
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:26,740
<i>18,000 feet.</i>

1493
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,580
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.

1494
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,530
Nice.

1495
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:36,540
<i>10,000 feet.</i>

1496
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,170
<i>6,000 feet.</i>

1497
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:42,880
Come on, people.

1498
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,050
Come on, come on, come on!

1499
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:49,470
Yeah!

1500
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:51,390
<i>1,000 feet.</i>

1501
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:54,140
<i>400 feet.</i>

1502
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,930
<i>200 feet, sir.</i>

1503
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,450
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.

1504
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:59,350
Hello.

1505
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:21,790
We made it!

1506
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,000
Nice work, guys!

1507
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,710
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

1508
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,090
All right, Jarvis.

1509
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:30,410
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...

1510
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,180
That came out of nowhere.

1511
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,480
Wow.

1512
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:42,020
Give me some good news, man.

1513
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,100
I think they all made it.

1514
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,190
Thank God.

1515
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:45,550
Yeah, but I missed the president.

1516
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,610
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,

1517
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,820
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?

1518
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,950
Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

1519
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:53,950
<i>The House Party Protocol, sir?</i>

1520
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:55,070
Correct.

1521
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,770
Hi.

1522
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,620
You think he's gonna help you?

1523
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,700
He won't.

1524
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:47,080
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's...

1525
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:50,250
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.

1526
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:52,550
You're here as my...

1527
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:55,300
trophy-

1528
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,860
Good evening, sir.

1529
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:16,240
Welcome aboard, Mr President.

1530
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,330
Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?

1531
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:31,210
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.

1532
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,670
<i>This is the Roxxon Norco.</i>

1533
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,160
And, of course, you'll remember

1534
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:38,680
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,

1535
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:41,680
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1536
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,850
What do you want from me?

1537
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:46,060
Nothing, sir.

1538
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,900
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1539
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:52,020
You see, I've moved on.

1540
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,480
I found myself a new political patron,

1541
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,700
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.

1542
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:00,530
String him up.

1543
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:03,200
Hey!

1544
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,930
Come on.

1545
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:26,350
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

1546
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:28,140
I hope not.

1547
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:54,630
Oh, my God.

1548
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,930
He's strung up over the oil tanker.
They're gonna light him up, man.

1549
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,050
Viking funeral.
Public execution.

1550
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:02,930
Yeah, death by oil.

1551
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:12,150
<i>Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.</i>

1552
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:14,730
Okay. That's good.

1553
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:18,650
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1554
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,070
Is your gun UP?

1555
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:22,740
Yep. What do I do?

1556
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:25,280
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.

1557
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:27,620
Six, high, back. All right.

1558
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:37,840
You see that? Nailed it.

1559
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,820
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

1560
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,320
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

1561
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:42,870
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1562
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,220
<i>All personnel, we have hostiles</i>

1563
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:46,530
<i>- on east unit 12.
- Over there!</i>

1564
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,200
<i>- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give</i> me...

1565
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:50,520
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.

1566
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,790
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.

1567
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:54,160
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.

1568
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:55,430
You've got, like, five of them.

1569
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:56,720
Here's what I'm going to do.

1570
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:58,610
Save my spot, ready?

1571
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:01,490
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.

1572
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:02,860
Here we go.

1573
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:08,660
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

1574
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,470
God, I would kill
for some armour right now.

1575
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,460
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.

1576
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,140
You know what?

1577
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:30,180
Is that...

1578
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:32,140
Yep.

1579
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,850
- Are those...
- Yeah.

1580
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,790
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1581
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:59,790
Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.

1582
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:01,710
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1583
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:03,210
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1584
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:10,100
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1585
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,640
Take them to church.

1586
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:21,400
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1587
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,660
Incoming!

1588
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:35,910
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1589
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:51,010
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?

1590
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:52,120
Everybody needs a hobby.

1591
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,400
Heart breaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?

1592
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,140
Nice timing.

1593
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:32,430
Yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?

1594
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:35,560
I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

1595
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:37,890
- What does that mean?
- I got you covered.

1596
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:43,570
<i>Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?</i>

1597
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,110
Very funny.

1598
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:03,460
<i>Sir, I've located Ms Potts.</i>

1599
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:04,540
About time.

1600
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,020
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

1601
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:26,690
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1602
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:29,110
You're such a jerk.

1603
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,760
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

1604
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:34,370
Come on. A little more, baby.

1605
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,930
Is this guy bothering you?

1606
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,090
Don't get up.

1607
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:00,850
Is it hot in there?

1608
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,500
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

1609
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:08,900
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.

1610
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:10,240
Tony.

1611
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:12,320
She's watching.

1612
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:15,390
I think you should close your eyes.

1613
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,240
Close your eyes.

1614
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:20,080
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

1615
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,210
Yeah, you take a minute.

1616
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:03,870
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1617
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:15,880
Come on!

1618
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:21,010
Mr President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

1619
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:24,310
Just hold on. Hold on.

1620
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,530
Okay.

1621
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,330
Bye-bye.

1622
01:47:59,050 --> 01:48:00,220
Brace yourself.

1623
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,070
You look damn good, Mr President,

1624
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:14,690
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1625
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:29,490
<i>The President is secure, Tony.</i>

1626
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:30,950
<i>- I'm clearing the area.</i>
- Nice work.

1627
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,170
- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1628
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:45,140
Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.

1629
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,220
Just look at me!

1630
01:48:48,730 --> 01:48:51,010
Honey, I can't reach any further
and you can't stay there.

1631
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,520
All right? You've got to let go.

1632
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:56,070
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

1633
01:48:58,490 --> 01:48:59,490
No!

1634
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:29,390
A shame. I would've caught her.

1635
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:01,550
Eject.

1636
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:48,550
Well, here we are on the roof.

1637
01:50:59,270 --> 01:51:00,360
<i>Mark 42, inbound.</i>

1638
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:03,860
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.

1639
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,840
Whatever.

1640
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,550
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1641
01:51:25,170 --> 01:51:28,930
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.

1642
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,060
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!

1643
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,520
You're right. I don't deserve her.

1644
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,810
Here's where you're wrong.

1645
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:41,110
She was already perfect.

1646
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:50,490
Jarvis,

1647
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:53,080
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

1648
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,580
No...

1649
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:10,610
No more false faces.

1650
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:13,280
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

1651
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:17,160
You're looking right at him.

1652
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:20,500
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

1653
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,670
I am the Mandarin!

1654
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:35,350
I got nothing.

1655
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:44,940
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1656
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:55,120
What? What, are you mad at me?

1657
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:22,440
Honey?

1658
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:28,360
Oh, my God.

1659
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:32,110
That was really violent.

1660
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:35,390
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

1661
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:37,460
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

1662
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:42,460
Who's the hot mess now?

1663
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:44,710
It's still debatable.

1664
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:48,670
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home?

1665
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:50,670
Sport bra. The whole deal.

1666
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,970
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

1667
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:56,680
What am I going to complain
about now?

1668
01:54:57,510 --> 01:54:59,140
Well, it's me.

1669
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:00,970
You'll think of something.

1670
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,320
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

1671
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:06,260
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

1672
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:07,980
Not hot.

1673
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,070
Am I gonna be okay?

1674
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:12,150
No.

1675
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:14,950
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

1676
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:17,070
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1677
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:19,200
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

1678
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:22,360
I think I can get you better.

1679
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:25,370
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

1680
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,750
And all your distractions?

1681
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,380
I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

1682
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:33,010
Jarvis. Hey.

1683
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:36,380
<i>All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</i>

1684
01:55:36,630 --> 01:55:38,590
You know what to do.

1685
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,430
<i>The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</i>

1686
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:44,680
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1687
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:22,260
Okay, so far? Do you like it?

1688
01:56:24,850 --> 01:56:25,850
It Will do.

1689
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:40,450
<i>And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.</i>

1690
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,830
<i>You start with something pure,</i>

1691
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:51,080
<i>something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</i>

1692
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:53,880
<i>The compromises.</i>

1693
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,140
<i>We create our own demons.</i>

1694
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:10,560
Great to see you! Bloody hell!

1695
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:15,820
<i>As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.
It took some tinkering.</i>

1696
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:19,700
<i>But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</i>

1697
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:26,870
<i>Of course, there are people who say
progress is dangerous,</i>

1698
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:30,460
<i>but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</i>

1699
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:33,920
<i>And now, neither will I.</i>

1700
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:36,630
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

1701
01:57:36,710 --> 01:57:38,840
<i>that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</i>

1702
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,700
It's okay. It's okay.

1703
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:02,820
It's okay.

1704
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:03,910
No, look.

1705
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:25,240
<i>So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...</i>

1706
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:29,620
<i>I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,</i>

1707
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:31,790
<i>or a hobby.</i>

1708
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:33,870
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

1709
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:36,870
<i>And now,</i>

1710
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:40,130
<i>I'm a changed man.</i>

1711
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:52,720
<i>You can take away my house,
and all my tricks and toys.</i>

1712
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:56,560
<i>One thing you can't take away...</i>

1713
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:00,900
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1714
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:29,050
<i>You know, and thank you by the way.
For listening.</i>

1715
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:31,590
<i>Plus, something about getting it off
my chest,</i>

1716
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:35,220
<i>and putting it out there in the
atmosphere instead of holding this in...</i>

1717
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:38,020
<i>I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.</i>

1718
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:41,140
<i>Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.</i>

1719
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:43,730
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts

1720
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:45,090
and my experiences with someone,

1721
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:47,570
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

1722
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:49,090
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.

1723
02:09:49,110 --> 02:09:50,860
Everything comes full circle.

1724
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:54,370
And the fact that you've been able to
help me process...

1725
02:09:56,910 --> 02:09:58,550
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... l was, yeah.

1726
02:09:58,570 --> 02:09:59,570
We were at...

1727
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:00,960
Are you actively napping?

1728
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,330
I was... I... I drifted.

1729
02:10:03,830 --> 02:10:05,000
Where did I lose you?

1730
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,670
Elevator in Switzerland.

1731
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:11,720
So, you heard none of it.

1732
02:10:12,050 --> 02:10:15,010
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

1733
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,930
I'm not a therapist.

1734
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:18,970
- It's not my training.
- So?

1735
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:20,730
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?

1736
02:10:20,810 --> 02:10:22,060
Temperament.

1737
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:23,990
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

1738
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:25,390
God, my original wound.

1739
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:27,730
- 1983, all right?
- Yes.

1740
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:30,530
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
