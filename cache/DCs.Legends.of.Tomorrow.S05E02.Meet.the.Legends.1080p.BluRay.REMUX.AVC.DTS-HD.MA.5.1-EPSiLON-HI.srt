1
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:04,506
[Kevin] <i>The Legends of Tomorrow
are everywhere.</i>

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,759
<i>Since they defeated a demon with
the help of a dragon on national TV,</i>

3
00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:10,512
<i>they've become a worldwide obsession.</i>

4
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:13,891
<i>Sure, we've all been mesmerized
by the global phenomenon</i>

5
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,392
<i>known as "Legends Mania."</i>

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:16,476
Yum.

7
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:20,772
And the Oscar for Best Picture
goes to...

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:25,152
[Kevin] <i>But who are the people beneath
those supersized public personas?</i>

9
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,447
<i>What are they like
when the spotlight is off?</i>

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm Kevin Harris,

11
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:32,659
and my documentary film crew
is the first ever

12
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:34,953
to be granted unfettered access
to their lives

13
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:37,080
and their ship, the <i>Waverider.</i>

14
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:41,793
So, strap in, because today,
we meet the Legends.

15
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,527
[Kevin] So, why don't we start
with just a brief introduction?

16
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:51,762
And let us know what we're doing today
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

17
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:52,845
Uh, yeah.

18
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:56,266
Hi, I'm... I'm Ava Sharpe.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,560
After Congress shut down
the Time Bureau,

20
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:00,187
Sara went off to help Oliver Queen...

21
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:03,440
...and, uh, I had to fight to keep
the <i>Waverider</i> from being impounded.

22
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,984
<i>Bad luck that the senator
chairing the committee was</i>

23
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:08,153
<i>the same person
we almost killed last year.</i>

24
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:11,406
Senator Wellington, I know the Time
Bureau may have been compromised...

25
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:14,576
...but you must allow the <i>Waverider</i>
to continue patrolling the timeline.

26
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,704
Ms. Sharpe, how do we know
these so-called "Legends"

27
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,623
can be trusted with time travel?

28
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,251
Oh, there's simply no transparency.

29
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:26,588
Which is why you all are here.
Right? To show everyone what we do.

30
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:28,966
What could go wrong?

31
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,260
[Kevin] <i>The</i> Waverider
<i>was surprisingly quiet</i>

32
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,428
<i>because half the team
was away on a mission.</i>

33
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,307
Oh, the crossover.
Yeah, had to take a rain check.

34
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:41,728
See, when you are a superhero/
amusement park impresario...

35
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:44,356
.../historian that rises from the dead,

36
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,984
your dance card tends
to get pretty full. [chuckles]

37
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:51,196
<i>- For two full minutes, I was not alive.</i>
- [guitar strumming]

38
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,699
<i>That changes you, man.</i>

39
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,034
<i>Don't get me wrong, I love fame.</i>

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,662
<i>No one says no to you about anything.</i>

41
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:01,373
Hey, man, that's a cool hat.
Can I have it?

42
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:05,544
But still, something doesn't feel right.

43
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:12,551
Oh, sorry.

44
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,760
Hang on.

45
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:17,514
There we go.

46
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,766
[Behrad] <i>Hi, I'm Behrad Tarazi.</i>

47
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,244
I guess you probably think I'm some kind

48
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:24,062
of awesome future man
since I'm from 2044.

49
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:29,151
<i>My literal birthday was yesterday,
which is pretty wild, man.</i>

50
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:30,736
[baby cries]

51
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,739
That's me. Hey, baby Behrad.

52
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,575
Be easy and go with the flow.

53
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:39,536
Like Wu-Tang Clan and Bruce Lee.

54
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,955
I mean, now, that we're no longer
D-list superheroes,

55
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,874
we can just go where we want.

56
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,042
Do as we please.

57
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,710
Why have I stuck around?

58
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,713
Tell you the truth,
I have no bloody clue.

59
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,132
I am bored as a post, ain't I?

60
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,968
Gids, I'm nicking the Jumpship,
all right?

61
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,386
I'll see you when I see you.

62
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,430
[Gideon] The Jumpship is fully totemed.

63
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:01,350
She's a mad old bat,
that one. [chuckles]

64
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,980
Hi, I'm Mona Wu. I'm a Kaupe.

65
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:11,735
That's basically like a werewolf,
but Hawaiian.

66
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,365
I'm also a literary agent for...

67
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:18,533
<i>...romance novelist Rebecca Silver,</i>

68
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,577
[whispers] who is secretly Mick Rory.

69
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,706
Jeez, Peter, take me out on a date first
before you try to... You know.

70
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,709
<i>Basically, what I do is,
I sell movie rights,</i>

71
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:30,003
<i>get book advances,
that kind of stuff.</i>

72
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:33,048
You're telling me that
you don't have a single dollar

73
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,217
for a Rebecca Silver book advance?

74
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,344
Okay, now you're not
just disrespecting me,

75
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,429
[distorted voice]
you're disrespecting my client!

76
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:40,514
[Wolfie roars]

77
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,642
Not now!

78
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,019
Pay up, or I will thrash you!

79
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,146
[growls]

80
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:51,274
Hi, I'm, uh, Gary Green.

81
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:56,571
Um, if I had to sum myself up
in two words, they would be, uh...

82
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:57,906
fully forgiven. [chuckles]

83
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,493
A lot of things happened last year
that you could misconstrue

84
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,286
as potentially maybe being my fault.

85
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:07,541
<i>But thankfully, everyone agrees that
at worst, I was just a hapless rube</i>

86
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:11,378
<i>who got manipulated by
the forces of hell to betray humanity.</i>

87
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:14,714
<i>Uh, I had a Fairy Godmother named Nora,
but we separated amicably</i>

88
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,967
after she granted me
my heart's deepest wish.

89
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,470
Gary, what the hell are you doing?
Come on. We got bigger fish to fry.

90
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,848
Nora made me Constantine's apprentice.

91
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,182
[Constantine] Gary!

92
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,267
Call me!

93
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,833
[Kevin] So, uh, how does your girlfriend
feel about the documentary being made?

94
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:36,236
Actually I haven't told Sara
about the documentary yet.

95
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,714
I just think it was a little awkward
over the phone.

96
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,950
<i>It's... it's better to spring it on her
when she gets back from the big mission.</i>

97
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,828
Okay, big smiles, everyone.

98
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,330
And nobody mention Oliver Queen.

99
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:48,582
Why?

100
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,667
Because he died.

101
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,294
Shouldn't have done the crossover.

102
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,712
[door opens]

103
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,758
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

104
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,886
- [Ray] Yay, team!
- Yeah.

105
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:02,678
[exclaim]

106
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,680
[all] Bros!

107
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,474
Orange drink or limeade?

108
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,808
Alcohol.

109
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,977
Hey, love. Welcome back, baby.

110
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Mmm.

111
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:12,762
- What is going on?
- Before you object, let me explain.

112
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:16,252
The only way that I could stop Senator
Wellington from cutting off our funding,

113
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,571
was to be clear and transparent
about our process.

114
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:20,822
Get it?

115
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:23,825
So, you're shooting a documentary
about the Legends?

116
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,869
Not me per se... [clears throat]

117
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,746
Hi, Captain Lance. Huge fan.

118
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,749
Uh, I'm the director, Kevin Harris.
You can call me "Kev."

119
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,793
Uh, just carry on, do what you're doing.
We're not even here.

120
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:36,588
That's Kev. He's got it under control.

121
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:41,635
And what if I wanna talk about
something in private?

122
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:44,888
It's not a problem. That's what
the confessional interviews are for.

123
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:49,142
Oh. [scoffs] Okay, so I can...
I could just say it to the camera.

124
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:52,020
- Sure.
- My girlfriend, she's lost her mind.

125
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:53,980
[chuckles awkwardly]

126
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,899
She just...
She really probably needs a nap.

127
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,710
She gets a little sleepy
after a long mission.

128
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:00,028
Um... Oh, Mick!

129
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,489
Why don't you tell us all
what you do on the ship, huh?

130
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,325
I steal stuff.
Get out of my way, you putz.

131
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,870
Okay. [laughs nervously]
He's just joking. Uh, Ray!

132
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,790
Who else saved the multi-verse?

133
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:15,168
Oh. Uh, well, the Flash, Supergirl,

134
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,836
- Batwoman...
- Cool.

135
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,171
- Yeah.
- What, no Superman?

136
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,649
Couldn't have been that big a deal.

137
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,091
Oh, no, no, Superman was there.

138
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:22,634
He's very handsome.

139
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,053
- It's good to have you back, buddy.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,138
Hey, we're missing someone.

141
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,890
Where's Charlie?

142
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,392
Took the Jumpship for a joyride.

143
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh, a joyride to check the timeline.

144
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,730
Right? It's called a time scout.

145
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:38,858
Now, who wants to visit
the temporal zone? Shall we?

146
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:45,615
[man grunts] Guys, I'm still outside!
I'm still outside!

147
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,908
Don't leave me!

148
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:50,161
Hi, I'm Ray Palmer. The Atom. [chuckles]

149
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:54,457
This documentary is an exciting
opportunity for me to improve my image.

150
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,586
<i>A lot of people still confuse me
for the demon</i>

151
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,171
<i>who possessed me
and opened up the gates of hell.</i>

152
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:03,466
<i>His name was Neron,
and he is no longer with me.</i>

153
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,427
Or inside me, or...

154
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,346
I really wish that you could
meet my girlfriend Nora.

155
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,975
Uh, but she works
out of town a lot, internationally.

156
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,228
<i>She's got a lot of global clients.
Kids mostly.</i>

157
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:16,688
She is a Fairy Godmother.

158
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,274
- [Kevin] There's something behind you.
- [explosion]

159
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,442
[rumbling]

160
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,444
[Mona gasps] Is this a Timequake?

161
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:28,033
See? I knew the timeline was
still in jeopardy. What do we got?

162
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,869
Time pirates? Time terrorism?
Time sex tourism?

163
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,162
Wow, Ava.

164
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,331
You could be a supervillain
if you applied yourself.

165
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,249
Gideon, what's the point of origin?

166
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,878
[Gideon] It appears my Jonah Hex has...
Beebo loves... loves you.

167
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:41,421
Gideon may have a virus.

168
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,757
Doesn't she make everything work?

169
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,050
We are perfectly safe.

170
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:48,553
Guys, that was a Class 5 Timequake!
That is so dangerous.

171
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,598
Okay, guys, let's just try to
keep our composure, shall we?

172
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,894
I've triangulated the Timequake
to 1917 St. Petersburg, Russia.

173
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,563
Let's go and shrink the problem.

174
00:07:58,647 --> 00:07:59,814
- Uh...
- Not good.

175
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,691
I'm developing a catchphrase?

176
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,777
[Gideon] Executing time jump now.

177
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,863
No, Gideon,
we're not taking a film crew to...

178
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,329
Imperial Russia. Yeah, great.

179
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,789
This is great, Ray.

180
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,834
[Nate] All right, Legends,
put on your babushkas

181
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,380
because we are rushing into Russia.

182
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,757
And now, you're copying my thing.

183
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
[Nate] Totally.
I just got really excited.

184
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,344
Okay, listen, babe,
this may seem like a problem,

185
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,596
but let's turn it into
a proble-tunity, huh?

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,974
Maybe a party-snake
is just what the doctor ordered.

187
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,352
Uh, what's a party-snake?

188
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,854
"Sneak." Party-sneak.

189
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:42,440
[Kevin] <i>The wonder of time travel
is allowing our cameras</i>

190
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:45,735
<i>to capture some of the first
color images of Imperial Russia</i>

191
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,655
<i>as we ride along
on the Legends' patented party-sneak.</i>

192
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,866
Turns out
it's more of a fun funeral-sneak.

193
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:53,242
Who died?

194
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:56,204
[Nate] Grigori Rasputin,
aka The Mad Monk.

195
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,499
Equal parts mystic advisor
and manipulative hornball.

196
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,419
[Ray] Rasputin was
notoriously hard to kill.

197
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:05,839
It took cyanide, a gun,
and drowning before he stayed dead.

198
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:08,842
- [rumbling]
- [woman whimpers]

199
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,510
[people screaming]

200
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,388
- [Rasputin gasps]
- [screaming continues]

201
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,349
[indistinct shouting]

202
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,309
Um, guys...

203
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:20,311
we sure he stayed dead?

204
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:29,195
Rasputin came back from the dead,
and it caused a Timequake.

205
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,782
Ugh, this is the kind of problem
that I can wrap my head around.

206
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,160
So, I need you guys

207
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,662
to forget about
this documentary film crew

208
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:39,831
and focus on the mission at hand. Yes?

209
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,625
Yes, we need to minimize the mishap.

210
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,509
[Agent Sharpe] Oh, right,
that's good, because

211
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,796
saving the day
is what the Legends do best.

212
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,799
- [Nate whispers] Ava, you're in my shot.
- Oh, sorry.

213
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,603
Gideon, what does
the historical record say?

214
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,929
[Gideon] Perhaps time loop... time loop
released him from Marion Ravenwood.

215
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,055
Of course!

216
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,558
Okay, B-money, with me.

217
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,269
We're gonna fix Gideon,
get our guests back to 2020.

218
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:04,856
Mona, Nate, Ray,
I want you three researching Rasputin.

219
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,539
Figure out
what his next move's gonna be.

220
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,984
Okay? Let's do it.

221
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,572
[Agent Sharpe] Hey, Ray, sorry.
But just...

222
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,616
Hey...

223
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,995
- is everything okay with Sara?
- Oh, um, I don't know,

224
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:22,457
but I do know that Oliver's death
was pretty tough on her.

225
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,292
Yeah.

226
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,712
Maybe you should write Sara
a condolence card.

227
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,261
That's actually not a bad idea.
I guess I could

228
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:38,431
put my thoughts and feelings into words
on a card.

229
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:43,019
What if more baddies started coming back
throughout history?

230
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:47,524
If they do,
we can call 'em "evil do-overs."

231
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:48,858
"Villa-agains."

232
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,110
I like "Encores."

233
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,340
- [Nate] Mmm...
- It's a good idea.

234
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,991
- We could take a vote. Like a team vote.
- Okay, let's vote.

235
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,743
- Encores.
- Villa-agains.

236
00:10:58,827 --> 00:10:59,869
Encores.

237
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,996
- Mmm...
- Don't be a jerk about it.

238
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,915
[roaring] Encores!

239
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,417
[Kevin] <i>Meanwhile, back in New York,</i>

240
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:09,128
<i>Constantine and Gary
were doing some soul searching.</i>

241
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:12,715
We're here with
the great mage John Constantine,

242
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,593
responding to an urgent call
regarding the supernatural.

243
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,137
- [knocking on door]
- Oh, bloody hell, Gary.

244
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,683
You know I must have been off my rocker
when I made you my assistant.

245
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,979
- Mr. Constantine.
- It's what the card says, love.

246
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,605
It's my son, Edgar.

247
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:31,025
I came home late from my shift,
usually he's up playing video games...

248
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:32,360
All right, love, there you go.

249
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,113
Now, why don't you let me
take a look, eh?

250
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,783

[snarling]

00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,501
- What's wrong with him?
- His PJs, for starters.

254
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:52,130
Do people really wear
matching pajama sets?

255
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,213
Yes.

Masher?

- Masher, is that you possessing the lad?
- Glad to see you escaped hell.

262

[chuckles]

263
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,650
Yeah, I could say the same
about you, mate.

[exhales] Demon's gotta have his fun.

265
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:18,448
Yeah, well, I could murder a pint
right about now.

266
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,783
- Fancy a drink?
- You're buying.

267
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:21,993
You've got it. Let's go.

268
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,163
Uh, excuse me, greatest of warlocks,

269
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,498
- but what about Edgar's mother?
- [clicks tongue]

270
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,792
Good thinking, G-man.

271
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:31,794
We'll take the fire escape.

272
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:32,878
[chuckles]

[Gideon] What distable do you wix,
Captain Cat? What distable...

275
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,555
[Behrad] Easy on Gideon, Cap.

276
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,391
[Gideon] What are are you wixtable
Captain Cat... Captain Cat?

277
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:48,895
Is everybody just
trying to get on my nerves today?

278
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,982
Camera crew shows up and, what,
nobody can act like themselves?

279
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,401
The spotlight does weird things
to people.

280
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:56,819
But hey,

281
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:58,988
you know I'll always be my true self.

282
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,282
Oh, yeah? Your true self?

283
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,260
Don't your parents think
you're in business school?

284
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,869
I am a tangled web.

285
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,746
- [scoffs]
- Enough about me.

286
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,124
How are you doing with Oliver
and everything?

287
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,461
[sighs] I'm fine.

288
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,224
No worries,
we don't have to talk about it.

289
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:17,756
But...

290
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:20,593
I made you something.

291
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:24,681
Oh, please don't be a condolence card,
'cause those are always super awkward.

292
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:26,933
Nah, hopefully, something better.

293
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,732
[Behrad] It's you, Ollie, and Laurel.

294
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,776
B, this is actually...

295
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:39,654
It's really sweet.

296
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:40,947
Thank you.

297
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,282
My condolence card wasn't awkward.

298
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,995
"Dear Sara,
I'm sorry the vigilante you slept with

299
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:48,798
when he was already
dating your sister died.

300
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,623
Some say it's better
to have loved and lost,

301
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,542
but I hope you never loved him at all."

302
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,503
Sara and I aren't the type
to give each other cards, anyway.

303
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,547
I'd rather do something for her,

304
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,591
you know, like fix this
Rasputin situation and get the Legends

305
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,761
the heck out of Russia
before they screw something up.

306
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,265
Uh, you can cut the last part
of that out, right?

307
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:11,352
Apparently, when Rasputin cured
the Tsarina's only son,

308
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,938
<i>the two fell madly in love.</i>

309
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:18,651
I think if Rasputin realized
how much the Tsarina loved him,

<i>Maybe Rebecca Silver's next series
could be called</i> Russian Nights.

313
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,540
So, the St. Petersburg elite hated
Rasputin's influence over the Tsarina.

314
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,502
So the Tsar's own nephew,
a prince by the name of Yusupov,

315
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,672
<i>- he spearheaded the assassination.</i>

Ray,

319
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,387
what if old Grigori came back,

320
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,264
- to settle the score?
- To settle the score.

[heroic music playing]

322
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,608
We need to stop Rasputin
from killing Yusupov.

323
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,198
I'm going to deliver
a love letter to Rasputin.

324
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,993
I'm gonna kill Rasputin.

325
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,537
- You in?
- [Mick] Yep!

326
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,795
Rasputin and I are two wandering souls
who got a second chance at life.

327
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:22,715
He shouldn't waste his encore
on revenge. Damn it!

328
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,883
[Ne-Ray] What?

329
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,719
Mona was right. "Encore" feels better.

330
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,263
It does. Plus, with my new Atom cam,

331
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:32,475
everybody can watch us fixing history
without any bloodshed.

Do people call you "Griggy"? [chuckles]

346
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,766
There's just been
a slight misunderstanding.

347
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,978
Um, your monk friends here think
I'm here to kill you,

348
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,480
uh, when really,
I just would like to chat.

349

Oh, this? This is, uh, my camera crew.

350

We're producing a news reel
about your startling return.

351
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:32,243
After all, you're not a big deal
until you're a big deal on camera.

352
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:42,295
Grigori Rasputin. Monk. Mystic.

353
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:48,092
It is hard coming back to life.
I think, "What will make me happy?"

354
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,219
So, I killed the man who killed me.

355
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,014
But am I happy? Eh...

356
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:56,934
I'll give you Yusupov. He had it coming.

357
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,728
But let's talk big picture, Griggy.

358
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,189
- You rose from the dead.
- Mmm-hmm.

359
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:02,607
That's wild.

360
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:07,111
Nate, what are you doing?
Now, you're in my shot.

361
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:08,571
[Nate] To be honest with you,

362
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,781
I'm here to find out
what makes you tick.

363
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:14,202
Are we killing folks?

364
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:16,787
Or chilling with folks?

365
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,207
Sorry, Nate, this one's for Sara.

366
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:20,822
[Ne-Ray] I got your back, Nate.

367

Size small, standing tall!

[sighs] Of course she is.

376
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,522
Hi, guys, I forged a letter
that's gonna save history.

377
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:48,736
That's for Rasputin.

378
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:54,325
Hmm, not bad.
Nice use of "musky embrace."

379
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,535
[chuckles] I learned
from Rebecca Silver.

380
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,412
Well, you learned from the best.

381
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,917
You know, your aura is quite strong.

382
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,461
I get that a lot.
I rotate hair products.

383
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,339
Like me, you too
have experienced a miracle.

384
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,800
God brought you back to life.

385
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,595
But there's something missing.

386
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,391
I sense a hole in your heart.

387
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,602
There. Right there.

388
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,147
You once loved someone,

389
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,276
but you have forgotten.

390
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,320
Allow me to hypnotize you,

391
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,198
and I will help you recover
everything you have lost.

[Agent Sharpe] <i>Don't even
think about it, Nate.</i>

393
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,704
Thank you, Rasputin,
but I'm gonna have to say yes.

399
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:53,676
I've gotta ask, Masher.

Has she done it?

401
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,532
[Edgar as Masher] I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

402

Don't be coy with me.

403
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:05,271
Has Astra released
the worst souls from hell onto Earth?

404
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,482
What can I say?

405
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:11,027
The girl's all grown up
and making money moves.

406
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,237
The question is,

407
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,990
what are you gonna do?

408
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,784
I don't need to do anything about it,
all right?

409
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:21,537
My life is settled right now.

410
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,664
I'm not gonna stir up
a hornet's nest of trouble

411
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,293
because Astra Logue wants to
break the glass ceiling in hell.

412
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,086
Is that so?

413

- You smug git.

414

Right then...

Ah, you know, give him the usual.

What? What do you want?

You want my confessional?

All right. Come here,
I'll give one to you.

I confess that I hate this doc.

I confess that
I don't want to be a celebrity,

432
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,369
and I confess
that if you don't get that camera

- out of my face...
- [Behrad] Captain!

I think Gideon is suffering
from phantom data.

00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,668
Do you want me to come back later?

436
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,837
No. You should stay.

437
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,590
Stay with me, hang out. Let's get lit.

438
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,635
Questionable timing,
but should I get my stash box?

439
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,095
Yes, you should.

440
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,222
[Gideon] Captain,
I have an incoming Bollywood.

Gideon has a bug, and we're trying
to get buzzed. What do you want?

444
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,151

Focus on my voice and this bauble.

449
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:31,542
Now, drop into
the deepest part of yourself.

00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,757
God has spared Rasputin again!

468
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,258
Kill her!

469
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:24,136
[men yelling]

470
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:25,971
[grunting]

471
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:26,971
[Agent Sharpe] Rory!

472
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,557
[Mick growls]

473
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:35,648
[roars]

474
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,195
[roars]

475
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,280
Nate, I'm coming for you, buddy.

476
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,332
- Nate, snap out of it.
- [grunts]

477
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,376
- I remember her, Ray.
- Who?

478
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,045
I don't know her name,
but she was on the ship with us.

479
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,673
[grunts] Mission's blown.
We need to retreat.

480
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,841
[Mick] <i>I'm not done with you, you rats!</i>

481
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,510
<i>Good thing Sara's not watching this.</i>

482
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,345
[exhales]

483
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,183
[sighs]

484
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:21,694
[Sara] So, you guys decided to go off
on your own and face Rasputin?

485
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,487
I thought I could calm him down.

486
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,864
I thought I could make him fall in love.

487
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,784
And I thought I could,
you know, assassinate him.

488
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:33,414
None of that was ever going to happen.
He's fresh out of Hell.

489
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:36,750
- Well, let's kill him, then.
- You... you can't!

490
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,877
Look, John said that he can't be killed

491
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,463
while the chit of his soul
is in hell, or...

492
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,340
Whatever that means.

493
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:44,717
Look, Sara, we're really sorry.

494
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,653
We thought we could
make things easier for you

495
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,262
by... by taking this off of your plate.

496
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,014
And risking your own necks?

497
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,975
Look, I already have
one dead friend on my plate,

498
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,059
I'm good there.

499
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,769
And you know,

500
00:23:56,437 --> 00:24:00,065
none of you self-absorbed megastars
even bothered

501
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:02,276
to ask me how I was doing.

502
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,696
Look, Sara, I...
I told them not to mention Oliver, okay?

503
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,823
I thought you wouldn't
want to be reminded.

504
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,116
Reminded?

505
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:10,701
What...

506
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:14,371
Did you think that I could just forget
that my friend died?

507
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:15,706
No, I...

508
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,708
Look, I know things have been
crazy around here.

509
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,460
[Sara] Crazy around here?

510
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,505
You still have no idea
what I saw out there.

511
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:25,548
What did happen?

512
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:29,845
Countless Earths died.

513
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:34,016
I became a Paragon
and traveled back to the Big Bang.

514
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,643
We restarted the universe,

515
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,270
and now, no one even remembers
what we've changed.

516
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,483
- It's a lot to process.
- Yeah, I know.

517
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,738
So, you could see why I want to
talk to my friends about it,

518
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,324
and instead, I get cameras

519
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,035
in my face.

520
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,350
[Agent Sharpe] <i>"Agent Sharpe
lacks a delicate touch</i>

521
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:01,710
and is extremely deficient
at relating to people." [scoffs]

522
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:05,381
That is straight from
my Time Bureau personnel review.

523
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,424
Pretty harsh.

524
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,011
I wrote that review.

525
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,847
Yeah, of course I'm bummed
that we let Sara down,

526
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,934
but I am glad I got to meet Rasputin.
Little help?

527
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,103
[whooshing]

528
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:24,900
[grunts] I mean, the guy
got in my head and laid a bomb.

529
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,695
- He freaked your bean, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

530
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:31,615
He also told me about the mystery woman
that I was in love with before I died.

531
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:34,201
I know it sounds crazy, but it just...

532
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,536
It feels right.

533
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,955
Sounds like you got
some soul searching to do.

534
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,040
Wanna watch <i>How Stella Got
Her Groove Back</i> again?

535
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,211
No, my groove feels fine.

536
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,589
You think I have either split memory
or partial amnesia?

537
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,509
That's like what's happening
with Gideon.

538
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,570
Her memory is processing
what I thought was phantom data,

539
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,638
but maybe it's real data
from a different timeline.

540
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,726
Either you're a computer who caught
the same virus as Gideon...

541
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,271
Or, when we fixed Heyworld,
we changed the timeline.

542
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,250
Damn, we deducted the hell outta that.

543
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,272
I have to tell Sara.

544
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,460
Wait. Five minutes. Five minutes.
Stay on the inversion table.

545
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,111
Your back's gonna thank me.

546
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:14,366
[sighs] Okay, so clearly, we shouldn't
have avoided asking Sara about Oliver,

547
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,702
but in my defense,
I was desperately afraid

548
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,495
I was gonna say the wrong thing,
you know?

549
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,541
I don't know what she needs, and
everything I try seems to make it worse.

550
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,962
Hold on, Behrad, so, you're saying

551
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,922
Gideon's glitching
because we fractured time?

552
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,758
Look, at least we didn't break time.

553
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,968
We just sort of dinged it up.

554
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,720
<i>- Hello?</i>
- [taps]

555
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,389
What is on the feed?

556
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:40,350
- [Rasputin] <i>Is this thing on?
- Yes, we're rolling, Mr. Rasputin, sir.</i>

557
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:41,685
<i>Good. Get out.</i>

558
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,024
Now, what was it that man
with the hair product said?

559
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,358
Yes.

560
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:52,154
"You're not big deal
until you're big deal on camera."

561
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,449
<i>You are going to make me big deal,
Mr. Kevin Harris.</i>

562
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,284
They left the director behind?

563
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,454
<i>I've invited my dearest Tsarina
and her family over for dinner.</i>

564
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,830
Tonight

565
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,126
will be a night
that you can remember. [laughs]

566
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,130
That... that doesn't sound right.

567
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,215
What?

568
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,509
The... the laugh.
You need to nail the laugh

569
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,594
before we kill the Romanovs
and take the throne.

570
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,888
It's a work in progress.
How about this...

571
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:19,597
[clears throat]

572
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,352
[laughing maniacally]

573
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,938
He's gonna kill the Romanovs.

574
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,482
Making him an immortal Tsar.

575
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,568
We can handle this.

576
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,278
We can? What about the team?

577
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,824
Shh. They're not thinking straight,
and their cover's blown.

578
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,742
Look, this is up to you and me, B.

579
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:41,078
We're gonna stop
this assassination alone.

580
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:42,704
Yes.

581
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,665
Yes.

582
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,884
What's this?
Is this a smudge on this goblet?

583
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,929
Every detail must be perfect.

584
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,266
Tonight, I am dining
with the Imperial Family.

585
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,601
Take it back.

586
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,273
They are going to love the tea cakes.

587
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:12,985
I've laced them with cyanide. [chuckles]

588
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,989
Hello? Kevin? Right here.

589
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,785
- Your guests have arrived.
- The Romanovs are here!

590
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:24,496
Welcome.

591
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,959
It is such a shame that
your daughters could not attend.

592
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,129
I know how much they must have missed
their Uncle Rasputin.

593
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,966
Word of your death
sent them into mourning,

594
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,344
but none were so heartbroken as I.

595
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:40,470
[Rasputin] Oh.

596
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,848
Music!

597
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:52,316
How did you manage to survive
being poisoned, shot,

598
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,027
and thrown into the river, Grigori?

599
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,029
Oh, I have a very hearty constitution.

600
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:00,823
Damn it.

601
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,911
The Red Wedding's about to start,
and I don't see the tea cakes anywhere.

602
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,122
[Behrad whispers] All I see is cookies.

603
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,167
Tea cakes? My favorite.

604
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,711
The cookies are the tea cakes.

605
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,507
What is the meaning of this?

606
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,719
Forgive me, sire, I saw a bug.

607
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,225
Grigori, what is going on?

608
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,602
<i>What have you done?</i>

609
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,146
Oops. I think we forgot the cameraman.

610
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,232
That's Kevin, the director.
He's really more of an auteur.

611
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,943
We should get out there.

612
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,736
Sara clearly wants to handle this alone.

613
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:40,030
But are we gonna let her?

614
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:43,741
Go.

615
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,829
Nicholas, Alexei, come.

616
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,081
Wait!

617
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,918
You will stay exactly where you are.

618
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,004
For years, I have flattered you both,

619
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,757
our subjects adore you,

620
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,051
the army needs you,

621
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,471
and look at the state
of our beloved Russia.

622
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,639
[Sara] Hey.

623
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,725
Let me guess, you're the only one
that can save it.

624
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,603
- Not today, Grigori.
- Who are you?

625
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:17,943
No matter. Perhaps I didn't give
an adequate demonstration of my bauble.

626
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,076
Attack this serving wench!

Come on, Behrad, snap out of it.

00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,266
[man] Rasputin.

631
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,853
The Grand Duchess Anastasia is here.

633
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,064
No. Anastasia, run!

634
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,400
So glad you could join our soiree.

635
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,693
Me, too.

636
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:06,700
Hey.

637
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,411
You're going to have to
do better than that!

638
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,124
Sorry.

Didn't hurt.

645
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,031
[Sara] All right, this way.
You're gonna hide to be safe.

646
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:50,994
Look, Sara, I...

647
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:54,206
wish I was the person
who could say the perfect thing...

I'm not that person, okay?

651
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,465
Emotions are hard for me,
and I don't even know what

652
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,134
restarting the universe means.
Behind you.

653
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,057
Listen to me.
Whatever happened to you, okay?

654
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,518
Whatever happens to you,

655
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,687
I wanna be the person
that's there for you. Okay?

656
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:19,898
I'm here for you, Sara.

Ava, that was perfect.

659
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,036
Oh, sorry to, uh,
ruin the moment, ladies,

660
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,329
but we have a problem.

661
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,956
Come on.

[Ne-Ray] Guys, come on,

00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:47,303
- we don't need to use violence here.

[grunts] Sara, think of something.

00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:02,274
- [Wolfie growls]
- Hey, Grigori! It's your big moment.

671
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,693
Don't you wanna ham it up
for the cameras?

672
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,194
Oh, yes.

673
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,283
I'm Grigori Rasputin,
and I'm unkillable! [laughs]

674
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,876
Guys? Where am I? What happened?

675
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,503
Don't think, Ray. Just enlarge.

676
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,689
[Ne-Ray] <i>Why's it so dark in here?</i>

677
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:27,549
Am I in a lake? A...
A lake that smells like perogies?

678
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:29,926
- [Wolfie growls]
- Ray, do it. Get big now.

679
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:31,386
Embiggify!

<i>Your atomic number is up!</i>

Now, Ray!

Size...

683
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,019
matters!

684
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,400
Oh, no, what did...
What did I do?

685
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:47,694
You found your catchphrase, Ray.

686
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:50,113
- What the hell?
- Raw meat.

687
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,531
The question is,

688
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,200
did you get the shot, Kevin?

689
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,828
Uh, yeah, I got it.

690

[Ray] <i>You know, I chalk it up
to saving the timeline.</i>

<i>History has to be saved,</i>

692
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,377
and sometimes, you have
to take some people out, I guess.

693
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,880
The public is gonna love this ending.

694
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,132
- It's only missing one thing.
- Hmm?

695

Hear that applause?
This movie is not even gonna begin

710
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,670
to satiate the Legends craze.
You know what this is?

711
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:29,921
This is a TV show.

712
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,215
I'm talking cameras on every mission.

Sara, you okay? You look nauseous.

714
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:37,512
Yeah, she's fine. And when you go
out there, just... just be yourselves.

- But, you know, bigger.
- Like, bigger how?

Just act heroic.

717
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,768
You guys have
a real Bad News Bears vibe.

718
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,270
It's not doing you any favors.

719
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,356
Now that you're big-time,
people expect you to put on a show.

720
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,608
So, you're asking us
not to be ourselves?

721
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,320
This guy gets it. Let's do this.

[audience applauding and cheering]

723
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:06,082
[Sara] Hi, everybody.
We are the Legends...

724
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:09,627
...and we just wanted to say thank you
for watching our film.

725
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,463
We hope that you enjoyed it.

726
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,641
Of course, uh,
none of it was real. [chuckles]

727
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,436
[woman] No, way! It's not real?

728
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,064
Excuse me? Uh, she's joking.

729
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,483
No, I'm not. Come on, time travel?

730
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,818
It's the biggest hoax in history,
am I right?

731
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:37,238
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
it's obvious that this is all fake.

732
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,632
How could Rasputin speak English?

733
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:40,867
You told me it was
temporal linguistic dysplasia.

734
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,827
I mean, if we had so much as coughed,

735
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,914
our modern germs would have
wiped out half the population.

736
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:49,292
Why wouldn't we just find baby Hitler
and make him wrestle baby Stalin?

737
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,376
Think about it.

738
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:53,004
The special effects
were kind of questionable.

739
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:54,297
[booing]

740
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:55,507
Shut up!

741
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,633
It's not real.

742
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:58,927
All right, everybody,

743
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,222
I guess that just means don't believe
everything you see on camera.

744
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,985
Yeah, it was all
just a big fake spectacle,

745
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,159
just like Heyworld last year.

746
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:07,560
We are all a bunch of frauds.

747
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,687
Big frauds, everybody.

748
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,649
- You guys ruined my movie.
- [Nate] Yeah, sorry.

[booing continues]

750
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,950
This is for the best, right?

751
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,428
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know.
I feel like I'm supposed to say that.

752
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,830
We're better off.
Fame messes with people.

753
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:28,415
We still have that money problem.

754
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,542
Oh, I almost forgot.

[Mick groans]

757
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:38,007
I steal things.

758
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,511
Whoa. Is that a Fabergé egg?

759
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:42,594
[Sara] Mmm-hmm.

760
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,306
- What's that worth?
- Fifty million.

761
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,641
[gasps]

762
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:47,725
[Sara] Whoa!

763
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,228
Careful with that, babes.

764
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,940
John, what...
What are you doing here?

765
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:57,944
I heard your movie premiere was in town
tonight, so, I thought I'd pop in.

766
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:02,866
Well, just make yourself at home, then!

767
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:05,160
[sighs] Why can't he ever
just be normal?

768
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,832
What are you doing?

769
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,585
[Constantine] Yeah,
I need to borrow something.

770
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:17,088
Rasputin wasn't an isolated incident.

771
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,681
[Agent Sharpe] Not isolated?
What do you mean?

772
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,261
- Okay. Hey, whoa! No, no, don't do it...
- Don't!

773
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,804
[both groaning in disgust]

774
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:28,850
[Constantine exhales]

775
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,769
I'm plumbing into this.

776
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,189
Wait. Are you trying to go back to Hell?

777
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:38,318
Soul become my soul,
flesh become my flesh.

778
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,487
Hades, firstborn of Cronus,

779
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,572
I call upon you.

780
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:45,700
Hey, John, there's gotta be another way.

781
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:48,328
I'll return when the sigil is complete.

782
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:50,914
[Sara] John?

783
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,918
You take care, you lunatic.

784
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:59,214
I always do, love. I always do.

785
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:06,054
[reciting incantation]

786
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:10,141
[sighs]

787
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,894
You know,
sometimes what happens on this ship

788
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,396
really would be hard
for an audience to follow.

789
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:22,403
That love letter you wrote,

790
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,780
it was good.

791
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,366
Very good.

792
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:30,954
Gee, thank you, Mick.
This means so much coming from you.

793
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,959
Listen, um, I'm giving up the writing.
It's getting in the way of my thievery.

794
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:39,587
So, I'm handing the Rebecca Silver
novels over to you.

795
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,005
Someone deserving.

796
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,552
Me?

797
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,806
This is... This is so much.
Are you sure?

798
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,141
Yes, I'm sure. That's why I'm saying it.

799
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,355
There's a novelist inside you.

800
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,901
There's more inside of me
than just Wolfie?

801
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,028
Yes. That's right.

802
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,244
Well, it was great living with you
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

803
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,540
- What?
- Yeah, I... I can't stay here to write.

804
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,333
I need to be free.

805
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,545
I need to fall in love and break hearts.

806
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:23,506
I can't do Rebecca Silver justice here.

807
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,506
But... But I...

808
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,385
But you tried writing on the ship
and ran out of ideas?

809
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,511
I mean, frankly, Mick,

810
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:32,515
your latest novel <i>Carjacked,</i>
it sucked.

811
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,312
But don't worry. Rebecca Silver
is about to have her comeback.

812
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,106
You'll see.

813
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,112
You were my favorite.

814
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:55,371
How's it going, Gideon?

815
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,975
[Gideon] The phantom memory scrub
is proceeding without a hitch.

816
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:01,252
The flaws only go
as far back as the last two years.

817
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,105
Oh, it feels good
to get my thoughts straight.

818
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,714
Good work, Gidi.

819
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,467
- I'm turning in.
- Good night, B.

820
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:09,969
- Don't stay up too late, Nate.
- You got it.

821
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,554
- [Gideon] Dr. Heywood?
- Mmm.

822
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:14,015
I have encountered a glitch
during the Heyworld event.

823
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,184
Show me.

824
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:32,742
<i>Nate...</i>

825
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,704
<i>if you're seeing this,
we altered my future at Heyworld.</i>

826
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:38,831
<i>I don't know where I'll be
or who I'll be, but...</i>

827
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,917
<i>I know that I love you.</i>

828
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,379
<i>Find me.</i>

829
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:49,634
Gideon! Gideon, who was that?
Play it again.

830
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:51,344
[Gideon] Memory scrub complete.
