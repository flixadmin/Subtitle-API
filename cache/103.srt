1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,580
Did you hear they started their bus already?
-No?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,720
One month into high
school and they started their bus already.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,040
Ingrid..
I miss you.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,320
You look like a slut.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,000
Maybe I can get a friend?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,860
You invited loads of people on a cabrin trip 
that was supposed to be just us! -Two guys?!

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,540
I can see your messages then.
-I already to you this is ridiculous!

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,160
Why don't you trust me?

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,960
I'll call you later, okay?

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,380
Yeah.

11
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,240
Eva..

12
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,280
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,980
If I knew how important this cabin
trip was for you, I wouldn't have invited the guys.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,620
I didn't know it wasn't
that important to you.

15
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,980
It was important to me!

16
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,140
But..

17
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,740
It's also important to 
me to spend time with my firends.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,420
It used to be 
important to you, too.

19
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,940
It's important to me.
But not as important as your friends.

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,360
I told you that 
you could bring friends!

21
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,080
Can't you just-
-Get some firends?

22
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,300
That's not what I meant.

23
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,460
But it's what you're thinking.

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,260
I don't know 
what the right answer is.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,420
Just be completely honest.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,720
Completely honest?

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Eva, you are the coolest girl I know.

28
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,120
You're pretty, sweet, smart, and funny.

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,540
But..

30
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,500
I don't know what the problem is.

31
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,180
You have to find new friends!

32
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,300
Get yourself new friends!

33
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,640
Anyone who gets to 
be your friend is really lucky.

34
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,440
You don't know what to say?
-I nailed it.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,140
You nailed it.

36
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,260
<i>[Congratulations on having me as a friend!]</i>

37
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,640
<i>[Hey girl! What's up?]</i>

38
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:10,920
<i>[Hi, is what I meant. Wanted to write Hi, but then
 I pressed the send button and so it was just H. Haha.]</i>

39
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,860
Hello.

40
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,740
How are you doing?

41
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,360
I'll sit here.

42
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,160
Hi.

43
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,480
Or.. H?

44
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,780
H-H.

45
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,600
Should we have done homework during the fall break?
-Yes!

46
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
Fuck!

47
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,500
Eva?

48
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,400
What does the main 
character of this story do?

49
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,500
She feels alone.

50
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,820
Noora, I don't want you to respond for Eva.

51
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,320
She hadn't found her homework yet.

52
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
I was just helping.

53
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,320
You asked it the wrong way.

54
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,540
The right way would be:

55
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,700
What are the main
 characters of the story like?

56
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
You're right. I'm sorry!

57
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,760
I lived in Madrid.
Okay, okay.

58
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,560
That's why I don't have friends.
In Oslo.

59
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,100
What's your excuse?

60
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,860
Strong body odor.

61
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,840
Culturally.

62
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,800
Hi!

63
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,820
Thanks for last time.
-Hi!

64
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,840
I can't remember if I greeted
you preoperly. I was a little out of it.

65
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
Vilde.
-Eva.

66
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,640
It was so nice of
you to help me!

67
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,640
No, no. It was nothing!

68
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,640
We were wondering
if you already had a Russ bus.

69
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,440
Eh, no.

70
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,920
That's perfect! We justrented a 
completely new bus. We really want you to join.

71
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,280
I haven't really started
thinking about Russ time.
<i>[Google: Russefeiring]</i>

72
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,580
It's really important to think about it
if you want to be on a bus.

73
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,100
I don't know what it's like in Trondheim,
but here in Oslo you have to start planning really early.

74
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,060
Otherwise you end up on a 
bad bus, or you become a gå-russ.
<i>(= graduate not participating in bus activities)</i>

75
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,140
Being a Russ is not just about Russ time,
it's also about being social and about unity.

76
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,820
Yes, think of it a like a sect.
Once you're in, you can't get out.

77
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,220
It ends in a collective suicide in Tryvann,
on the night of the 17th of May in 2018.

78
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,720
She's just joking.

79
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,360
Do you perhaps want to join
our bus meeting Friday after school?

80
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,120
Yeah, yeah ok.
-Yeah?

81
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,260
That's so cool! If you 
have friends, just take them with you!

82
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,220
We'll see each other then.

83
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,980
What the fuck was that?

84
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,360
What is it?

85
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,020
She was sucking on that spoon
and looked him straight in the eyes.

86
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,580
Who is she?

87
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,580
H. As in, "Have you got a drug problem?"

88
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,540
Or H as in, "Have you got any plans for Friday?"

89
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,520
Hi!

90
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
Vilde, this is Noora.

91
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,800
Hi.

92
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,780
Have you talked to Chris?
-No.

93
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,540
We can't have the bus meeting
at hers, her mom is having a wine reception.

94
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,360
And we can't have it
at mine because it'll become stressful.

95
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,580
So I was wondering
if we can do it at yours?

96
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,460
Mine?

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Eh, yes! But how
many will come?

98
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,520
Do you want to join?

99
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,400
What?
-Bus meeting.

100
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,600
But meeting.. what?

101
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,720
We'll create the world's coolest
Russ bus. You want to join?

102
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,860
No.

103
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
Then we're with three..

104
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,840
Hi guys. Meet Sana.
She'll join the bus meeting.

105
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,820
What do you know each other from?

106
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,280
We met at a Ramadan
programme in the mosque.

107
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,040
She's joking. We have German together.

108
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,300
But you want to join our bus meeting?

109
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,040
Yes.

110
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,780
Is that okay, then?

111
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,720
What's the problem?

112
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,880
No, eh..

113
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Since you're Muslim, isn't it true that
Muslims aren't allowed to be a Russ?

114
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,420
No, it's punished by stoning.

115
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,620
When is it?
-Tomorrow. Who's hosting?

116
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,620
Me.

117
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,360
I'll put your address in the GPS.

118
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,000
Auf Wiedersehen!

119
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,060
It means "see you later".

120
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,680
She can't be on our bus.
-Why not?

121
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,320
We'll give her a chance.
She was really cool.

122
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
We?

123
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
You're not even on our bus.

124
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,120
If she's joining, so am I.

125
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,000
Awesome!

126
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,600
We have a really big advantage over the other
 bus groups. I already bought a lot of toilet paper.

127
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,320
Vilde managed to buy toilet paper
for 40.000 Kroner with a credit card for another bus.

128
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,160
Anyway, we're left with 
a profit of 60.000 Kroner.

129
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:01,840
According to the budget, we'll
need 50.000 next to the toilet paper sales.

130
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,260
So I'll need an individual plan from
all of you on how you'll earn that money.

131
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,020
Is there something?

132
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,580
We're wasting time on 
toilet paper. It's not enough.

133
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,360
It's important that we have


134
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,980
Listen, we're losers at school. If we don't 
want to end up in a loser car, we need a strategy.

135
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,460
 We aren't the losers of the school.
-Wasn't it you who was thrown out of another bus?

136
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,300
Not really thrown out.

137
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes you were.

138
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:43,520
Listen, Vilde. It'll be hard if you 
deny everything. Acknowledge that we're losers.

139
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,080
Do you think so yourself?

140
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,780
Hello?! I'm a Muslim girl in a faithless country.
I'm the biggest loser of them all.

141
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,080
You talk really maturely.
-Thanks.

142
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,380
But what do you want us to do?

143
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,400
First, we need to get more girls.
Cool girls.

144
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,880
How do we do that?

145
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,880
Ask them?
-Wrong.

146
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,720
We ask nothing.
The cool girls ask us.

147
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
But first, we need something we don't have.

148
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,180
A four-letter word.

149
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,040
"Spenn."
-Cred.

150
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,100
Spenn has five letters, Chris.

151
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,240
Do we know any '97 guys?

152
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,560
Okay..

153
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,980
Then we need to find out who from the '97 people have
 the best bus, get ourselves invited to parties and to those busses.

154
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,900
Any idea how we'll do that?

155
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,620
You guys have to hook up with them.

156
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,840
Are you serious?

157
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,120
"You guys"?
-I'm not hooking up!

158
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,720
Okay, so we'll hook up.
What will you contribute?

159
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,740
Are you kidding me? I'm rescuing you here with
a strategic plan and you're wondering what I'll contribute?

160
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,980
Does anyone have a boyfriend?

161
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,580
I have.

162
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,380
How old is he?

163
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,180
He's from '99.

164
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,760
Dump him.

165
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,780
You're not serious now?

166
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,120
She's the prettiest here.
It's wasted if she has a boyfriend.

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,800
Honestly. This is really stupid.

168
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,820
What is?

169
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,540
You can't ask us to use our
sexuality in exchange for credibility.

170
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,520
You're crazy.
-No, I'm honest.

171
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,220
Norwegian girls exchange sex for money, 
popularity, and acknowledgement every day.

172

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,300
It is crazy. So try to change it

ask Eva to break up with her boyfriend.

175
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:11,460
It was a suggestion. She can think
for herself. She's not a child.

176
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,260
I think it went well.
