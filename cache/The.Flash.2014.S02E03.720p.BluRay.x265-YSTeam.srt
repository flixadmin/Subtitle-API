1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,182
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,143
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,188
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,649
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,103
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:22,147
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,359
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,702
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,946
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,623
How come you haven't
given me a code name?

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,290
What do you think I should be called?

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,539
Golden Glider.

13
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,953
Smart is sexy, Cisco.

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,341
Then why didn't you just kill me?

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,341
Well, I guess you owe me one now, too.

16
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,716
My name is Jay Garrick.

17
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,637
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

18
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,972
When you created the Singularity
above Central City,

19
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,637
you also created a portal
connecting our two Earths.

20
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,521
I somehow ended up in your world.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,191
There isn'tjust one breach.
There's 52 of them.

22
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,896
But the most significant breach
of all appears to be here.

23
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,817
Inside S.T.A.R. Labs.

24
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,665
Hey, Iris, what's up?

25
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,826
Barry, I need your help. Now!

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,331
- Were those gunshots?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,042
I'm at Baldwin Tower.
I can't find a way out.

28
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,212
Window. Is there a window?

29
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,427
Over here!

30
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,551
Um, yeah. Up ahead.

31
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,723
Okay. I'm by the window. Why?

32
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,433
Okay, great. You're gonna need tojump.

33
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,356
What? Are you crazy? Barry, no way!

34
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,359
Iris, do you trust me?

35
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,569
Yes. I trust you.

36
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:48,445
Okay. Then jump.

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,704
I can do this. I can do this.

38
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,385
All right. You good?

39
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,634
- Yeah.
- All right.

40
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,423
Wait. How many guys are up there?

41
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,555
- Two. They both have guns.
- Okay.

42
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,099
Okay. Now they're taking little naps
until the C.C.P.D. wakes them.

43
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,436
So what exactly were you thinking?

44
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,317
I got a hot lead on a
real estate scam. I mean,

45
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,109
these guys have been
illegally evicting people,

46
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,406
breaking up families.

47
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,950
Okay, look. No story is worth your life.

48
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,402
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,742
I can't wait to write about this.

50
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,247
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

51
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,836
I still can't believe what I'm looking at.

52
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,510
Fifty-two breaches in Central City

53
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,347
and the biggest one just
happens to be in our basement.

54
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:53,590
We need a name for it.

55
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,346
It's not a pet, Cisco.

56
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,177
No, it's a wormhole.

57
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,929
Professor Stein, what are you doing?

58
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,812
Your blood pressure is 147 over 82.
You could pass out again.

59
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:06,316
It's merely a few points above the
140 average for someone my age.

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,693
Besides, I have some ideas
I would like to contribute

61
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,485
to this discussion, Dr. Snow.

62
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,284
And lwant to hear them.
This isn't just a wormhole.

63
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,694
It's my way home.

64
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,158
Back to Earth-2.

65
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,536
Jay, you really think that we can use

66
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,951
this as some kind of bridge
from yourworld to ours?

67
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,121
Zoom uses the breaches. Why can't we?

68
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,454
Well, we don't know how.

69
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,340
Everything I put through
just bounces back.

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,635
If Zoom's using these breaches
to transport people from Earth-2,

71
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,295
maybe it takes a speedster.

72
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,679
- He's not gonna...
- Yeah, he is.

73
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,687
Maybe I'm not fast enough.

74
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,144
I don't believe your speed
is the entirety of the issue, Barry.

75
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,862
It might be the breach's stability,
or lack thereof.

76
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,360
He's right. We need to think
of the breach as a door.

77
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,864
And on Earth-2 there's another door.

78
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,159
In between we have a hallway.

79
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,495
But the hallway's constantly shifting,
twisting, collapsing upon itself.

80
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,372
And the doors keep moving with it.

81
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,169
So we stabilize the door,
we stabilize the hallway.

82
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,045
- And then I can jump through it.
- Exactly.

83
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,840
It would serve as a kind of cannon.

84
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,709
A speed cannon.

85
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,009
Mmm...

86
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,545
We should hang out more.

87
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:18,180
All right. No more tests today.
All of you are leaving now. As am I.

88
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,514
Cherish the gift of youth
as I will go cherish my much-needed nap.

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,018
Clarissa's already on her way
to pick me up.

90
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,069
Joseph.

91
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,028
You're wearing your wedding ring.

92
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,538
Divorced men take them off.
Widowers don't.

93
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,877
I need you to leave town.

94
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,463
And you thought you could pay me
to walk away from my own daughter?

95
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:53,880
Last time you walked away for free.

96
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,053
No amount of money
is gonna keep me away from Iris.

97
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:03,557
It has been 20 years, Francine.
Why did you show up now?

98
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,062
Now, I'm different. Now, I'm ready.

99
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,981
No, now you're too late.
Iris is fine without you.

100
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,603
You've done a...

101
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,483
You've done a wonderful job, Joe.

102
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,819
Better than I ever could.

103
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,781
But right now, she needs her mother.

104
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,292
Losing the love of your life
isn't something

105
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,461
you can just get over in a few months.

106
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,497
I would know.

107
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,341
Would you?

108
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,509
You have 48 hours to leave Central City.

109
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,348
I'm not going anywhere.

110
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,441
- Oh!
- Hey. Hey!

111
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,446
Hey! The Flash!

112
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:56,985
What?

113
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,651
The drinks that they're serving today.
They're called "The Flash."

114
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,454
"A brewed coffee with an extra shot
of espresso to keep you running all day."

115
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,124
But you should maybejust,
you know, have one of those.

116
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,954
Yeah. No, my friends ordered
these. I didn't even realize that, umm...

117
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:13,163
Are you sticking around to celebrate?

118
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,045
I don't know. Should I?

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,968
You know, actually, never mind. I can't.

120
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,512
- L... I have to head into work.
- Okay.

121
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,136
- But it was great to see you.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,012
- Good to see you. Bye, Patty.
- Okay. Bye.

123
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,850
- All right. Four Flashes.
- Mmm-hmm.

124
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,307
Be careful, apparently
they are super-caffeinated.

125
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:33,692
First, I had a day named after me,
now I have a drink.

126
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,898
Well, all the things you do,
rebuilding this place, protecting people,

127
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,319
everyone's appreciative, right?

128
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,399
- Mmm-hmm, I'll drink to that.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:43,072
Hey, you guys think
Professor Stein is okay, right?

130
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,322
I mean, Clarissa would call
if there was anything wrong?

131
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,534
- Yeah.
- All right.

132
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,334
I'm just going to call and check in.
I'll be back.

133
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,211
I don't see that call going well.

134
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,711
Young lady, these
repeated intrusions are interrupting

135
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,884
what should be a speedy... Oh!

136
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,175
I'm so sorry.

137
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't apologize.

138
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,345
You can bump into me any day, Cisco.

139
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,843
Huh. Lisa Snart.

140
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,853
You here to double-cross us again

141
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,557
or are you and your big bro
holding up coffee shops now?

142
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,391
I need your help.

143
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,023
In your dreams, Sister Cold.
You know I could call The Flash,

144
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,279
he'd be here in, like,
two seconds. Probably one.

145
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,692
Call him.

146
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,033
Oh! Okay. lmma call him.

147
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,279
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,197
You really want me to call The Flash?

149
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,949
I need his help, too.

150
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,206
My brother's been kidnapped.

151
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,879
All right, so you really
want us to just believe

152
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,553
that Captain Cold was kidnapped?

153
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,090
- I saw it happen.
- Hmm...

154
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,050
Last night, Lenny, me,
and Mick were knocking over

155
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,310
the cashier's cage
at Central City Racetrack.

156
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,725
Does it physically pain your
family not to rob people?

157
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,728
I never finished the job.

158
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,819
Well, after Mick torched through the
side entrance, I looked back for Lenny,

159
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,903
and saw him getting thrown
into the back of a van.

160
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,314
And why didn't you and Mick follow?

161
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,815
Iwould have.

162
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,988
Someone hit me from behind
and knocked me out.

163
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,738
When I came to, Lenny was gone
and Mick already made off with the cash.

164
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,577
How do we know
this isn't some kind of a trap?

165
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,908
If Lenny wanted Flash dead,

166
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,120
he would have let Mardon, Simmons,
and Bivolo take that honor, remember?

167
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,829
- Yeah, I remember.
- Good.

168
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,504
Then you'll also recall that you owe
Lenny a favor for saving your life.

169
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,011
Time to make good on that debt, Flash.

170
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,346
I do not like her.

171
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,261
Yeah, but she makes a point.

172
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,517
What? We should at least
hear her out. Right?

173
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,139
Even if I wanted to help,
how are we supposed to find him?

174
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,440
Not a problem.

175
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,770
See, when I rebuilt the cold gun,

176
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,352
I didn't have time
to place a tracker on it.

177
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:43,027
So I devised a method of locating it
by borrowing some military technology.

178
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,946
See, the gun works
the same as thermal imaging,

179
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,610
only instead of infrared heat signatures,

180
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,162
it's looking for
ultraviolet cold signatures.

181
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,788
Whoa, look at that.

182
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,621
The gun's UV thermal reading
was last picked up at 5th and Hoyt.

183
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,202
- Eight minutes ago.
- All right.

184
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,875
Let's see if you're a liar.

185
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,845
Snart.

186
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,301
Barry.

187
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,677
Are you okay?

188
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,062
Peachy.

189
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,139
Okay. Well, uh...

190
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,355
I'm supposed to be here to rescue you.

191
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,817
That's not necessary.
You can speed along now.

192
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,236
Look, Snart, if these guys
are making you do this...

193
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,155
No one makes me do anything.

194
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,070
Then why does your sister think
you've been kidnapped?

195
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,748
What's taking so long?

196
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,995
Igot held up.

197
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,172
Always the excuse with you...

198
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,834
Well, look at that.

199
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,169
I didn't think you had it in you, son.

200
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,009
Thanks, Dad.

201
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,221
Come on.

202
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,019
We're behind schedule.

203
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,691
You know what they say.
"Live fast, die young."

204
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,527
Talk to me. What's going on?

205
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,028
Cisco! Snart hit me with his cold gun!

206
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,606
His vitals are bottoming out.

207
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:08,278
I'm bringing the heat right now.

208
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,243
What?

209
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,870
The suit. What's happening?

210
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,206
Therma-threading, baby!

211
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,748
It's a little something I added
for situations exactly like this one.

212
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,388
Please... Please tell me it's working.

213
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,890
Yeah. It worked.

214
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:36,059
But Snart's gone.

215
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,605
And Lisa has a lot of explaining to do.

216
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:47,480
So, your brother was not kidnapped.
He was pulling ajob.

217
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,898
With your father.

218
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,571
What?

219
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:52,652
No. Lenny would never do that.

220
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,121
Oh, just like he would never try
and kill The Flash with his cold gun.

221
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,073
Are you sure it was my dad?

222
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,244
That's him.

223
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,961
Lewis Snart.
Convicted of larceny, armed robbery,

224
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,509
aggravated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon...

225
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,003
You have to believe me.
Lenny would never work with him.

226
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,424
He's a bad guy.

227
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:17,094
You and your entire family are criminals.
Why should we trust anything you say?

228
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,275
I didn't get this scar being a criminal.
I got it being a daughter.

229
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,447
Let me go. I got this.

230
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,375
I see you found my hiding spot.

231
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,797
This is usually where I come to, you know,

232
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,091
get away.

233
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,101
First time my father came
after me, I was seven.

234
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,139
Second time, I was eight.

235
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:07,940
That's when I learned that a
bottle hurts worse than a fist.

236
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,485
He used to say he was
trying to teach us lessons.

237
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,953
I must have been a slow learner
because the lessons never stopped.

238
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,336
I'm sorry, Lisa.

239
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,754
Lenny practically raised me.

240
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,683
If it weren't for him,
I would have turned out a lot worse.

241
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,307
I know.

242
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,346
How could I be any worse?

243
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,855
I didn't say that.

244
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,100
You didn't have to.

245
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,192
But believe me, there is worse.

246
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:57,570
And look, he may be a jerk brother,
but he's the onlyjerk brother I've got.

247
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,163
He protected me.

248
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,658
Now it's my turn.

249
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:10,423
If he's with my dad,
he is in serious trouble.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,125
Please.

251
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,549
You've gotta find out what's going on.

252
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,985
- Hey, baby.
- Dad.

253
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:32,774
What are you doing here?

254
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,822
I came to check in on my
favorite crime-fighting reporter.

255
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,157
Dad.

256
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,450
Actually, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

257
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,452
Hey, Iris, Editorial needs your
photos and story ASAP.

258
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,033
Congratulations, Detective.

259
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,995
Your daughter's exposé
just made the front page.

260
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,417
What?

261
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,341
I am so happy for you.

262
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,418
A little bit jealous,
but I'll get over it.

263
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,549
Thanks, Linda. I... lgot lucky.

264
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,883
No. She's being modest.
Your daughter's a serious badass.

265
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,763
You don't have to tell me.

266
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,557
Well, I better let you get back to work.

267
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,014
Wait, there was something that you
wanted to talk to me about, right?

268
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,099
Later. It can wait. Go be fabulous!

269
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,559
Okay.

270
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,158
Back from the dead so soon, Barry.

271
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:26,914
Pass me the salt.

272
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,620
Don't spill, it's bad luck.

273
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,547
Why are you working with Lewis?

274
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,673
Lisa told us you hate him.

275
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,090
Things are...

276
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:46,222
Complicated with family.

277
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,721
As you know with your own parents, hmm?

278
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,937
Tell me what's going on. Let me help you.

279
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,312
Don't waste your time trying to save
people who don't want to be saved.

280
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,024
Yeah, well, maybe it's not
just about you, right?

281
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,701
I'm betting, whatever you two are up to,
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

282
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,528
Don't worry. I remember our deal.

283
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:07,115
You leave me alone,
I make sure no one dies.

284
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,543
All right. You're a criminal, Snart.

285
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,121
But you live by a code.

286
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,176
It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't.
Like he won't care if people die.

287
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,629
That's why I can't leave this alone.

288
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,135
Then everyone will know who
The Flash is under that mask.

289
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:29,307
I don't care.

290
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,981
I will take you down anyway. Both of you.

291
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,187
We'll see about that.

292
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,988
Thanks for dinner.

293
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,243
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,338
Iris' mom is alive.

295
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,926
I lied to Iris. You. Everybody.

296
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,009
Why?

297
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,054
I felt like I didn't have a choice.

298
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,929
Francine did so many things wrong.

299
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:10,686
Just about everything.

300
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:17,565
I don't know. Now I feel like
my one wrong might be worse.

301
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,907
Look, Joe.

302
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,198
I've known you for,
you know, most of my life,

303
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,499
and I know that you always have
a good reason for the decisions you make.

304
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,918
And obviously, you were worried

305
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,246
that Iris would go down
the wrong path if Francine raised her.

306
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,672
I mean, look at Snart.

307
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,967
He's a criminal because he had Lewis
for a father. That could have been me.

308
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,552
Oh, come on. Never.

309
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,379
Yeah, because I had you.

310
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,807
And so did Iris.

311
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:52,729
You just gotta trust in that
and tell her the truth.

312
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,022
Yeah, how do I do that
without hurting her?

313
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,979
She's not a little girl anymore.

314
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,775
You should've seen her
in action the other day.

315
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,812
Putting her neck on the line for a story.

316
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,943
She can handle anything
that comes herway.

317
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,400
I've just lied to her for so long,

318
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,406
I'm scared she's not
gonna understand or forgive me.

319
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,121
I could lose her.

320
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,914
No. She's gonna forgive you.

321
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,335
You just gotta give her a chance.

322
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,751
We make our move at 9:00.

323
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,555
That's when the cleaning crews go in,
and the daytime shift leaves.

324
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,509
Now we'll go up in the
service elevator to the 27th floor.

325
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,721
They got a two-man team of armed guards
working the 27th to the 29th floor.

326
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,772
But if we time it perfectly
with their shift change,

327
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,226
we should be able to get in and out.

328
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:40,901
And if timing doesn't work out?

329
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,072
- Then those guards don't make it home.
- But ifwe start on the top floor,

330
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,240
- there's a service elevator that will...
- Son.

331
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,286
You and I both know that there's
casualties in this line of work.

332
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,119
Rutenberg, you're the tech guy.

333
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,580
Did you find a solution
for the vault hallway?

334
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,038
Not yet. That Draycon Systems
keypad's gonna be a problem.

335
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,005
Fine. How about you?

336
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,337
You gonna disappoint me too,
or is that freeze gun of yours

337
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,048
gonna look after the
power source for the laser grid?

338
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,473
It's a cold gun.

339
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,269
And yes. But I have a better way
to get past the lasers.

340
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:20,224
That gun is the only reason you're here,
so shut up before I make you...

341
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,604
Ow. Ow, my... My head!

342
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,903
Oh, my head!

343
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,778
Ow! Ahhh!

344
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,117
It feels like it's gonna...

345
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,744
Nobody talks to my son that way. Nobody.

346
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,635
Don't worry, sir.
I waited for you this time.

347
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,763
Okay, I may have done a quick
preliminary assessment of my own.

348
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,845
Something is definitely weird.

349
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,307
- Oh.
- Decapitation.

350
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,642
- Yeah.
- Yikes.

351
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,147
We're still recovering parts of the head,

352
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,446
so the ID is taking
a little longer than normal.

353
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,991
Ugh! Sorry.
I thought I stepped on an ear.

354
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,201
I didn't. lf I did, I'd be hearing things.

355
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,824
Oh, hell no.

356
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,616
It doesn't look like the head was sliced
off with any weapon I'm familiar with.

357
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,326
And I'm familiar with most weapons.

358
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,580
Yeah, you're right.

359
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:26,132
Perforation around the neck is too jagged.
It's almost like the head was blown off.

360
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,173
Like a meta-human
who can explode heads, right?

361
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,878
Not necessarily.

362
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,055
Traces of thermite.

363
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,306
- Bomb residue?
- Uh-huh.

364
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,221
But then why wasn't the
rest of the body blown apart?

365
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,476
I don't know.

366
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,233
The victim is David Rutenberg,
security systems expert.

367
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:48,311
And guess who's on his list
of known associates.

368
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,817
Lewis Snart.

369
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,983
Lewis Snart? Isn't he related
to Leonard Snart AKA Captain Cold?

370
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,489
Please don't call him that.

371
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,740
Okay.

372
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,950
- Uh, one second. Come here.
- Sure.

373
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,207
I think this guy is part of Snart's crew.

374
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,660
So, Snart put a bomb in him
to keep him in line?

375
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:05,246
No, Snart wouldn't do that.
But his father would.

376
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:08,583
Wait, so Lewis is killing people,
and Snart's still working with him?

377
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,883
What happened with the deal you had?

378
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,426
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.

379
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,550
So you think Lewis
put a bomb in his own son

380
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,007
to force him to pull off a heist?

381
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,340
Snart still wouldn't do it.

382
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,222
He'd dig the bomb
out of his own head if he had to.

383
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,930
So there must be something else
that Snart cares about.

384
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,567
The only thing Snart
cares about is his sister.

385
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,193
- Hey.
- Hey.

386
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:35,529
- Thought you might be hungry.
- Ah!

387
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,079
Good to know whatever Earth you go to,
there's always a Big Belly Burger.

388
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,405
Thank you very much.

389
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,082
Looks like you're making progress.

390
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,457
Slowly.
I should be able to do this a lot faster.

391
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,413
You miss it. Your speed?

392
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,795
Yeah. Surprising how much.

393
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,876
So what will you do
when you get back to your Earth?

394
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,594
I don't know.

395
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,008
Guess I'll just have
to get used to being...

396
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,261
Normal?

397
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,804
Yeah.

398
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,150
Two years ago, I was just a scientist
slowly trying to save the world

399
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:10,898
by purifying heavy water
without residual radiation.

400
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,150
Important work.

401
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,780
Yeah. It was.

402
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,407
But after the particle
accelerator exploded,

403
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,781
I didn't need to wait years
for my research to save a life.

404
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,240
I could save one before breakfast.
I could save 50 before going to sleep.

405
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,290
There's nothing like that rush.

406
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,961
You guys have been fighting
so many battles, one after another,

407
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,506
I'm not sure Barry's
had time to take it in.

408
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,335
To appreciate how great it can feel.

409
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:38,632
Being a superhero isn't always
about how fast you can run.

410
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:44,517
It's about helping however you can,
wherever you're needed most.

411
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,849
I think that Jay Garrick, physicist,
has just as much to contribute

412
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,106
as Jay Garrick, superhero. Maybe more.

413
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:59,029
You know what would help me
build the speed cannon faster?

414
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,703
- Hmm?
- An extra set of hands.

415
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,198
Specifically ones
with a surgeon's precision.

416
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,078
Me?

417
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,877
Sure, if you think I can really help.

418
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,748
Hey, Caitlin. We need you up here.
Like, right now.

419
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,795
Sorry.

420
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:23,471
Oh, boy.

421
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,135
What is it?

422
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,559
Lisa, there are traces
of thermite on your skin.

423
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,102
Thermite? Like an explosive?

424
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:33,902
Not like an explosive...

425
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,236
It's a bomb.

426
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,451
When you were knocked out,
your dad must have injected you with it.

427
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:53,247
Hey. Dad, what's up?

428
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:56,424
Your message was pretty cryptic,
even for you.

429
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,425
Hey, baby.

430
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,258
I need you to sit down.

431
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,973
Dad, what's going on?

432
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,852
Okay.

433
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,105
When I was still a beat cop,

434
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,574
me and my partner were on patrol.

435
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,736
And dispatch came on the radio.

436
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,573
A little girl had called in.

437
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:32,127
She said her mom had taken
some pills and she wouldn't wake up.

438
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,460
And the little girl gave the address.

439
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,334
The address was mine.

440
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,007
By the time I got here,

441
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:46,550
your mother was unresponsive,
passed out on that couch.

442
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,808
And in that kitchen, the stove was on.

443
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,858
There you were,
standing in front of an open flame.

444
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,480
If I hadn't gotten here when I did...

445
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:58,528
Wait, my mom...

446
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,605
Your mom was a drug addict.

447
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,739
This wasn't the first time
something like that had happened.

448
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:10,037
I got Francine into another rehab,

449
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,584
and a couple days later,

450
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,211
she was gone.

451
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,707
I looked everywhere for her, but...

452
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,756
Wife of a cop. She knew how to disappear.

453
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,757
I couldn't stand the thought

454
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,559
of you growing up
thinking you were abandoned.

455
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:32,387
Going to sleep at night
thinking your mother left

456
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,769
because you weren't enough to
make her stay, that you weren't loved.

457
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,567
Because I loved you.

458
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,152
I loved you with everything I got.

459
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,653
Then we took Barry in.

460
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,450
And I saw the trauma
he was going through, and I...

461
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,324
I was sure. I was sure

462
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,078
that I did the right thing.
Not giving you that burden.

463
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,290
What do you mean Mom left? l...

464
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:02,759
I don't... I don't understand.
I don't understand.

465
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,428
What are you telling me?

466
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,179
Your mother's alive.

467
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,517
She's here in Central City.

468
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,016
She wants to see you.

469
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,684
All these years, I thought...

470
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,821
Dad, you told me that my...

471
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,115
I know.

472
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,287
I should've told you sooner,
but I couldn't figure out the right way.

473
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,827
And the mother you thought you remember,

474
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,045
the perfect mother in the stories
I made up for you,

475
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:42,541
that is the mother you deserved.
And I knew Francine couldn't be like that.

476
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,292
She would only break your heart.

477
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,632
I'm so sorry.

478
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,559
Dad.

479
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,816
It's okay. I understand.

480
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,150
You were just trying to keep me safe.

481
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:21,832
The micro-bomb casing must be made
of some kind of a ferromagnetic material.

482
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,840
Once you hold it steady with the magnet,
I can surgically excise it.

483
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,047
Put the magnet down!

484
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,508
This is a really concentrated bomb.

485
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,048
It's gonna combust if it's exposed
to magnetic friction and an oxidant.

486
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,352
What's he talking about?

487
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,349
- Air.
- Uh...

488
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,603
The... The bomb will explode
if it comes in contact with air.

489
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,942
Don't worry, Lisa. We're gonna find
another way to get it out.

490
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,945
Scientific minds, can we confer, please?

491
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,111
What if The Flash speed-extracts it?

492
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,574
No. It's too risky.

493
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,243
I'm gonna find a way to get it out,
I just need a little time.

494
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,616
Well, we need to keep track of Lewis

495
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,580
Until you figure out
how to disarm the bomb.

496
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,580
I wish we knew what he was
gonna steal next. And when.

497
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,540
Maybe I can get them to tell me.

498
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,204
Their tech guy is dead.

499
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,045
So I'm betting they're
gonna need a new one.

500
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,126
I'm saying I'm gonna
infiltrate Lewis' crew.

501
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,970
You're going to pretend to be a criminal?

502
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,214
How hard can it be?

503
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,439
These visits are getting old.

504
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,393
Third time's a charm.

505
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,896
I told you. I don't need saving.

506
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,482
But your sister does.

507
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:34,406
I know your dad put a bomb in Lisa.

508
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:38,240
And Lewis told you he'd kill her
if you didn't help him, right?

509
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,453
Look, don't worry.

510
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:42,085
My team's working on a way
to remove the bomb.

511
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,335
Hope you got that gun of yours
ready to blast 'cause...

512
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,426
- Who the hell is this?
- Uh, I'm...

513
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,595
Lenny said you need a new tech.

514
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,432
What's up? I'm... I'm Sam. What's up?

515
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:05,017
You're telling me you think this kid
can crack a Draycon keypad?

516
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,111
Well, I did help Snart steal
the Kahndaq Dynasty Diamond

517
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,942
from Central City Museum last year.

518
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,450
That was locked up behind an AmerTek
Industries Phase Three Suppression Door

519
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,527
with a Draycon XL-1218 keypad.

520
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,778
So...

521
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,702
Couldn't have done it without him.

522
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,165
Draycon's my jam.

523
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,451
Ah...

524
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:32,002
Okay, Sam. Let's go.

525
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,008
Right now?

526
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,347
You got a problem with that?

527
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,642
No. All good. Can't wait.

528
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,982
Oh, this should be fun.

529
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,026
Keep quiet and follow my lead.

530
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,982
Just like old times.

531
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,072
You watching the Diamonds game?

532
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,537
Yeah. The Salamanders are killing 'em.

533
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:00,037
IDs.

534
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,413
- What floor are you going to?
- 27th.

535
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,844
Hey, what's the hold up, guys?

536
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,260
I mean, you wanna call management

537
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,676
and explain why the toilets
are still overflowing?

538
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,016
We're all on the clock, right?

539
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,097
Yeah. You guys are good to go.

540
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,766
- Thanks.
- Ah...

541
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,023
You enjoy the game, guys.

542
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,435
- Diamonds don't stand a chance.
- Not tonight they don't.

543
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,442
Oh, hold on. Did you hear that?

544
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,117
I got it.

545
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,412
It's two armed guards.

546
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:46,367
Guess your timing
didn't work out after all.

547
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,208
Yeah, that's why we got a Plan B.

548
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,791
'Cause you always needed one.

549
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,044
Yeah, but...

550
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,795
Your sister turned out
to be a disappointment also.

551
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,050
Hey, what do you guys say
we get on with the job?

552
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,644
Guards are gone.
I don't know, must've taken a break.

553
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:06,887
Yeah. Must've.

554
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,401
Okay, Sam. Show us what you got.

555
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,568
Yeah. All right.

556
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,570
I'll just...

557
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,075
You guys just keep a lookout and I'll...

558
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,556
Told you Draycon was my jam.

559
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:43,807
- Nice job, Sam.
- Yeah.

560
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,719
It's good to go out on a high note.

561
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,269
Sorry, Barry.

562
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,422
What are you going
to do to me with that thing?

563
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,008
Operating pressure on this
is over 1,000 PSI.

564
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,476
This will easily suck the
micro-bomb out of her neck

565
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,479
and into the barrel of this
with one high-powered shot.

566
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,438
There is one slight risk.

567
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,645
Besides shooting a high-powered
weapon directly against my neck?

568
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:40,486
The gun does use compressed air.

569
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,492
I trust you, Cisco.

570
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,294
Okay, son, make me proud.

571
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,965
Like I care.

572
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:07,512
Now what?

573
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:23,199
I told you I had a better way
past the lasers.

574
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,698
Step aside. Time for another lesson.

575
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,663
You've got 125 seconds
before the system defrosts.

576
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,665
- Then what?
- Sirens.

577
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,891
How do you feel?

578
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,189
Like we should've put down some plastic.

579
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,020
That's not funny.

580
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,727
Yeah.

581
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,396
But I like it when you smile.

582
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,532
Okay. Ready?

583
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:09,570
Shoot me, Cisco.

584
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,878
It's... Flash!

585
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:19,125
Cisco, how you doing with Lisa?

586
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,465
Uh, kind of in the middle of it
right now, buddy.

587
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,255
All right. We need that bomb out.

588
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,053
The heist is going down right now.

589
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:30,971
Time's up.

590
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:33,385
Let's get outta here.

591
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,599
Only place you're going
is back to Iron Heights, Lewis.

592
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:39,900
Ah...

593
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,986
- You wanna bet?
- Do I wanna bet?

594
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,605
Do not bet! Give me a minute!

595
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,441
Tell me this. What kind of man
puts a bomb in his own daughter?

596
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,449
- A very rich man.
- Ah...

597
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,121
Shoot him, son.

598
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,795
Kill him or you'll never
see your sister alive.

599
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,141
Do it, Cisco.

600
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:20,603
I got the bomb out!

601
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,318
Lisa's safe.

602
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,157
You're working with The Flash?

603
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,452
I thought you hated him.

604
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,666
Not as much as I...

605
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,331
Hate you.

606
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,842
Lisa was safe.

607
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,847
Why did you do that?

608
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,847
He broke my sister's heart.

609
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,849
Only fairl break his.

610
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,237
Last time I was in Iron Heights,
I was visiting my dad.

611
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,534
Yeah, me too.

612
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,208
- And yet you killed him.
- He deserved it.

613
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,376
Is that funny to you?

614
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,375
No.

615
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,170
What's funny is I finally
figured out your secret.

616
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:28,217
And what secret would that be?

617
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,096
You'd do anything to protect your sister.

618
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,891
Well, I know your secret too.

619
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,393
Better hope I don't talk in my sleep.

620
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,686
You won't.

621
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,728
Today just proved what I've always known.

622
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,106
There's good in you, Snart.

623
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,239
Yeah, you don't have to admit it to me.

624
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,530
But there's a part of you that knows

625
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,577
you don't have to
let your past define you.

626
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,199
A part of you that really wants
to be more than just a criminal.

627
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:03,293
So I should be a hero like you, Barry.

628
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:06,418
What exactly does that pay again?

629
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,965
It's just a matter of time.
Something you'll have a lot of in here.

630
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,259
Not as much as you think.

631
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,592
Be seein' you.

632
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,237
You really think that leopard's
gonna change its spots?

633
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,110
I do.

634
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,360
Maybe we should transfer him
to the meta-human wing anyway.

635
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,036
I already got Patty on the papewvork.

636
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,579
All right.

637
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:44,293
Hey, I wanted to thank you
for the advice you gave.

638
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:48,456
I told Iris.
She's going to sit down with Francine.

639
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,634
It was hard, but it was for the best.

640
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,045
I'm glad. Anytime.

641
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,471
You're a good son, Barry.

642
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,802
I know.

643
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,219
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

644
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,478
Fancy seeing you here.

645
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,652
Okay, we have to stop
running into each other like this.

646
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,063
I know. We should just
make a schedule or something.

647
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,990
Okay, great. Well, then I'll just have,
you know, my people call your people.

648
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,152
See, that's the problem.
Neither one of us have people.

649
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,320
So, how are we possibly gonna do this?

650
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,501
There. My number.

651
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:26,751
Oh!

652
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,338
That... That's what you meant, right?

653
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,632
Yes.

654
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,838
- No.
- Yeah, uh...

655
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,846
No, you didn't. Um...
You know what, though?

656
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,677
I've actually been meaning
to give you my number,

657
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,971
in case you had questions about a case.

658
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,769
You know, sometimes when you call
through dispatch, it gets all jammed up.

659
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,096
And this is efficient.

660
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,023
And as law enforcement colleagues,
efficiency is important.

661
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,518
Yes, it is. No, that's...

662
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,815
Yeah.
That's exactly what I was thinking too.

663
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,813
Okay, great. Awesome.

664
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,864
- Okay, I'll see you.
- Yeah.

665
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,115
- Oh.
- Oh!

666
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,697
Just kidding. Okay.

667
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,702
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

668
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,201
So, taking off?

669
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,835
Thought I'd say goodbye.

670
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,375
And thank you.

671
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,206
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't leave a bomb in anyone.

672
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,548
Not even you.

673
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,217
It's more than that.

674
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,170
You were there for me
when I was feeling weak.

675
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,385
I hate feeling weak.

676
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,139
It's hard for me to trust people,
but I trusted you.

677
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,981
You know, you might actually
be my first real friend.

678
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,527
Is any of that true?

679
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,083
Until next time, Cisco.

680
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,423
Later, Golden Glider.

681
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,603
Ta-da! The speed cannon.

682
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,690
Wow! Look at that.

683
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,951
Dudes, you actually built the thing.

684
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,695
Mr. Garrick, I am...
I am quite impressed

685
00:39:24,903 --> 00:39:27,623
by what you've accomplished
during my recent wellness hiatus.

686
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,288
- Have you tested it out yet?
- Not yet.

687
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,786
Want to do the honors?

688
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,039
No, no, no, no! Now that I...

689
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,876
Now that I am back to optimal health,
please, allow me.

690
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,431
Excelsior!

691
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:44,927
How did you stabilize it?

692
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,135
- CFL quark matter.
- Ah!

693
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,771
Negative energy density
with positive surface pressure.

694
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,099
- It's genius!
- You created CFL Quark Matter?

695
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,561
It's something we perfected on my Earth.
I'll show you some time.

696
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,400
You mean,
sometime in the next few minutes?

697
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,648
Oh...

698
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,822
Yeah, I guess this is it, huh?

699
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,992
Time for me to go back home.

700
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,496
Right now? I mean, we still need
your help with the breachers.

701
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,748
My first priority is Zoom.

702
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,748
I need to find out what he's up to.
How he stole my speed.

703
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,333
But you can do that here.

704
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:20,001
And, you know, if you go back

705
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,672
then we can't get in touch with you
when we need your help,

706
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,510
or with Zoom,

707
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,510
or whatever else.

708
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:31,019
It would be nice to be able to
pick your brain every once in a while.

709
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,309
Get some more speedster tips.

710
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:34,940
Hmm.

711
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,990
Okay.
Once we take care of Zoom, I'm going home.

712
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,451
- That's fair.
- Good.

713
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,784
'Cause I could use a shower
and a shave, and some sunlight.

714
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,659
I'll, uh, see you later.

715
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,043
So, Professor Stein, how are you feeling?

716
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:01,505
Well, uh, it appears that
a little rest heals all maladies.

717
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,632
I couldn't feel...

718
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,217
Professor?

719
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,969
No, no, no, no. Get back! Come here!

720
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,398
Professor Stein!
Professor Stein, can you hear me?

721
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:22,813
- Professor Stein?
- What happened to him?

722
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:24,989
He... He went up like Firestorm,
but the flame, why was it blue?

723
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,739
I don't know. This isn't good.
We need to stabilize him fast.
