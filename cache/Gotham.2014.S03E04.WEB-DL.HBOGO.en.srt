1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously</i> on Gotham...

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,240
Listen to the watch.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,280
Its ticking synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,280
Stand upon the back of the chair.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,960
So you could get him to do
anything you wanted?

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,520
I want you to find my sister.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,840
Her condition...

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,040
Some poison in her blood.

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
I announce my candidacy for mayor.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,760
Hugo Strange made another you.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,040
- He's gone.
- He cut his hair, too...

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,440
To look more like you.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,200
- Does Alfred know you have his car?
- Would you like to go for a ride?

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
The ticking synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
- Step off the ledge...
- Stop!

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
You, you don't understand.

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,640
My, my brother will find out I'm
here, and he'll come for me.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,760
Nothing will stop him.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,080
This is the brother that took you
to Strange to try and fix you?

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,280
What? No.

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,880
Jervis kept me a prisoner most
of my life,

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,280
and when I finally managed to escape,

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,440
I ran as far away
from him as I could.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,280
And landed in Gotham.

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,600
It seemed like a good place to hide.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
Until Strange found me
and locked me in Indian Hill.

28
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,440
I'll admit, not the best luck.

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,080
For you or your future landlord.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,360
That was an accident.

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,000
The infecting part,
or the lighting him on fire part?

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm not a monster!

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,800
But if you want to see one,

34
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,240
just wait until my brother
comes for me.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
You don't know what he's capable of.

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,280
This isn't over.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,600
For either of us.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
It's perfect.

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,560
Oh, my sister used to love
amusement parks.

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
The rides. The food.

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
The tents with amazing acts.

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,000
That's why I became a performer.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,520
Are you a family man?

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,240
Yes. I am a family man.

45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,960
The day I lost her was the saddest
of my life.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,120
The only thing that got me
through, that kept me sane...

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,920
was the hope of one day
being together again.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,800
Reunited.

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,600
And if all goes well
that day is today.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Of course, a reunion like this
needs to be a private affair.

51
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
You understand.

52
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,480
<i>It's Election Day in Gotham
with former mayor, Aubrey James,</i>

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,600
<i>and former criminal kingpin,
Oswald Cobblepot,</i>

54
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,480
{\an5}<i>running toe to toe for the hearts
and minds of Gotham.</i>

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,360
{\an5}Why don't you take care of that?
Appreciate it.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
{\an5}- All right.
- Thank you.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,200
{\an5}- To you too.
- Butch. Your phone call.

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
{\an5}I must say, you are looking quite
the dapper fellow.

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Hold on.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,520
{\an5}I had to guess on the jacket size.
I hope it fits.

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,640
{\an5}Perfectly...

62
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,440
{\an5}I cannot thank you enough.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
{\an5}It's just a suit...

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,240
No. No, if it weren't for you,

65
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,800
{\an5}I would still be falling asleep
to the screams of the insane.

66
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,200
{\an5}It becomes almost a white noise
after a while, doesn't it?

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
It does.

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,280
{\an5}I do believe, Oswald,
Arkham has made us both stronger.

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,000
I couldn't agree more.

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,880
{\an5}Which is why I had
our release certificates framed.

71
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,480
{\an5}A reminder of past struggles
and new beginnings.

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,840
{\an5}If I didn't know better, I'd accuse
you of being a sentimentalist.

73
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Guilty.

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,600
You all set, boss? Busy day today.

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
Who were those people
you were speaking with?

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,360
{\an5}- Don't worry about it.
- Come now, Butch, play nice.

77
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,920
We're all on the same team here,
right?

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
My team.

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,640
{\an5}Yeah. Sure. Whatever you say.

80
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,160
{\an5}You keep your nose out
of my business.

81
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,920
{\an5}Yeah. Sure.

82
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Whatever you say.

83
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,040
Why is it that every time something
hits the fan around here

84
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,440
I inevitably find you
at the center of it?

85
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,480
{\an5}I was just working a job.
Her brother asked me to find her.

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,520
{\an5}Yeah, you're some sort of PI now?
Is that it?

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,040
{\an5}- I'm whatever pays the bills.
- Right.

88
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,960
{\an5}What do we know about this
girl's blood?

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,040
{\an5}Not much. She claims infecting
the landlord was an accident.

90
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
{\an5}Have Thompkins draw some samples.

91
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,480
{\an5}See if she can find out what
we're dealing with here.

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
{\an5}And pick up the brother
for questioning.

93
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Any idea where we might find him?

94
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,960
{\an5}No. But when I do, I'll let you know.
We have some unfinished business.

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,800
Not anymore.
This is an active investigation.

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,120
You go anywhere near him,
I'll have you arrested.

97
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
For what?

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,560
No law against two private
citizens having a chat.

99
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,320
I'll come by later to pick up
my check.

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,760
I bet that I'd make a kick-ass PI.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Get out.

102
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,320
Have you had this condition
since birth?

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Tell me about it.

104
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,040
If a person comes into contact
with my blood it changes them.

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,320
It affects every person differently.

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,400
My brother believes it brings out
a person's true nature.

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,680
Is your brother infected?

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,520
Is that why you're
so terrified of him?

109
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Jervis isn't infected.

110
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,080
He believes we're connected.

111
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,240
Two sides of the same coin.

112
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,280
My way is the blood and his the mind.

113
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,320
Hypnosis.

114
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,080
It goes way beyond that.

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,480
He preys on fear, anger, regret.

116
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,480
And if he gets in your mind...

117
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
you're doomed.

118
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,040
<i>Vote for Oswald Cobblepot.</i>

119
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,280
<i>- Your next Mayor of Gotham.</i>
- Here you go. Cobblepot for Mayor.

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,160
<i>- And Make Gotham Safe Again!</i>
- Good, Sir. Sir, vote for Cobblepot.

121
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,560
<i>Vote for Oswald Cobblepot
your next Mayor of Gotham...</i>

122
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,560
<i>You are so very tired of life,
aren't you?</i>

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
<i>Do you hear my watch ticking?</i>

124
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,080
<i>Hard road for you, Jim Gordon.</i>

125
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,200
<i>Listen closer.</i>

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
<i>You are so very tired of life,
aren't you?</i>

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
<i>Now you can rest, Jim.</i>

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Hey, pal!

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
You got a death wish
or something?

130
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Right. Yes, sir, will do.
Thank you very much.

131
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Goodbye.

132
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
Well, that was the impound yard
from downtown.

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,040
It appear the Rolls was towed only
this morning, Master Bruce.

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,480
This doesn't make any sense.

135
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,320
Why would he leave?

136
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,200
But he cut his hair to look more
like you, if that's even possible.

137
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
You think he went to the city
to pretend to be me?

138
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
Yeah, absolutely, bloody-yes.

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
So where would he go?

140
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,960
Take in a show? Do a little bit
of shopping? Have a facial?

141
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,320
I mean, where do pain-resistant
clones of multi-billionaire

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
teenagers normally go?

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,520
- Alfred.
- Well, I don't know.

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Oh, the car was found
at Eleventh and Dillon.

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,080
- Wasn't it?
- That's in the Narrows.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,320
So, I suppose, we should be thankful
there's anything left to tow.

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,040
What the Dickens was he doing
down there in the first place?

148
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Selina.

149
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,520
Eleventh and Dillon
is near her apartment.

150
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,960
Sorry again for the way I acted
when you came by yesterday.

151
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
Any word on your friend Ivy?

152
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
No.

153
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,760
I even braved a beat-down

154
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,960
from Sonny to see if she
was growing magic mushrooms

155
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,440
for him again.

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,240
- Magic what?
- Mushrooms?

157
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
Sonny Gilzean?

158
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,320
Pounded you to within
an inch of your life?

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah. Sonny. Right.

160
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,040
Well, this is it.
Time to earn a living.

161
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,440
- You work here?
- No. I rob here.

162
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
What?

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,240
The Bang, Bang Room
is a betting parlor.

164
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,040
Should be flush today
with the mayor's race.

165
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
Meet me around back in five minutes.

166
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Selina.

167
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,760
Yeah.

168
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
Pay up.

169
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,280
Hey, I got twenty five points for it.

170
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,680
Yeah, that's true.

171
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,520
Oswald Cobblepot.

172
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Hey. That guy at the end of the bar
said you're buying the place a round.

173
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,320
What?

174
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,960
Oh, and your mom sucks.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Or something.

176
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Really?

177
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
Hey. Wise guy.

178
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,200
He's your drink.

179
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,680
Get him on the face and...

180
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,400
Come on, you messed up the face!

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,080
Who the hell are you?

182
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,760
Sorry... My first day.

183
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Can you help me find the cherries?

184
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,240
No? Probably behind the bar. Right.

185
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,040
Oh, I'll go check.

186
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,400
Hey, Squirrel, what's the odds
of a person getting out of here

187
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
in one piece?

188
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,360
Not good, boss.

189
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,760
My beloved mother always
believed in me.

190
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,040
Even when I doubted myself,
she held firm.

191
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,240
Seeing all of your bright
faces reminds me

192
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,440
that there is nothing you cannot
do if you put your mind to it.

193
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,320
And when I am Mayor,
I believe...

194
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,040
no, I know...

195
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,560
that together we will
Make Gotham Safe Again!

196
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Excuse me.

197
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,520
- Are you on the election board?
- Yeah.

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,920
I work for Mr. Cobblepot.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,320
He just wanted me to
confirm what Butch gave you.

200
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,920
May I? Thank you.

201
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
It's all there. Thank you.

202
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
Follow him for the rest of the day.

203
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,560
Don't let him leave your sight.

204
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,240
Well, look who's back.

205
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,000
I saw you last night.

206
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,480
You didn't even say hi. Rude.

207
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,560
I need to find Jervis Tetch.

208
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,840
Oh, you mean The Great Jervis Tetch
Hypnotist Extraordinaire!

209
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,280
Can you believe it actually says
that on his business card?

210
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,520
His number's been disconnected.
Where is he?

211
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,720
I don't know. Magic shop? Bunny farm?

212
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,880
Some place where everyone
wears top hats and drinks tea?

213
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
Barbara.

214
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,560
You know? I'm not sure I like this
new thing of you storming

215
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,320
in here every time
you need something.

216
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,920
It's almost like we're married.
Scary thought.

217
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I need a favor.

218
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,000
Then you must be monumentally
screwed.

219
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,560
What happened?

220
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,720
Did he hypnotize you?

221
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,920
Make you bark like a dog?

222
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,640
He's dangerous, Barbara.

223
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,680
Don't say I didn't warn you.

224
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Okay.

225
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,880
He came in here earlier.

226
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
Said he wanted to hire some muscle.

227
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,240
- "Muscle"?
- Yeah.

228
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,800
For some performance he's planning.

229
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,000
Said he needed them to have flair.

230
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
What'd you tell him?

231
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,160
It's Gotham, baby.

232
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
We've all got flair!

233
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Thanks.

234
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,920
Always a help.

235
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Excellent!

236
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,480
Deever and Dumfree, I presume?

237
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,760
The Terrible Tweeds.

238
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,480
Your reputation precedes you.

239
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,280
And you are?

240
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,600
Jervis Tetch.

241
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,520
I have a job that might
suit your particular skills.

242
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,760
My sister has been taken by the GCPD.

243
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,280
I need to get her back.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,280
You wanna break someone
out of the GCPD?

245
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,280
Not someone. My sister.

246
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,720
I assumed men like yourselves
understood the bond of family.

247
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,120
What's in it for us?

248
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,640
Does he ever speak?

249
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
Regardless, if you'll do the courtesy
of listening to me,

250
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,880
I think you'll find I can be
quite persuasive.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
Place is packed to the gills.

252
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
It's running two-to-one for Penguin.

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,160
Sounds like you're busy.

254
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,520
Maybe I should go, huh?

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,880
No. This won't take long.

256
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,160
I hate people with sticky fingers.

257
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,920
Okay, wait. What do you,
what do you need? Huh?

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,640
Money? Information?

259
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,560
I could be useful.

260
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,720
Oh, you will be.

261
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,040
You'll send a message.

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But maybe...

263
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,360
I don't got to do this?

264
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,440
That maybe you learned your lesson?

265
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,920
Yeah! Totally! I...

266
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,760
You're screwing with me, aren't you?

267
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,320
Yeah. Do it.

268
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Bruce?

269
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,880
Let's go.

270
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,240
<i>And although some have criticized
Mr. Cobblepot</i>

271
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,920
<i>for running a campaign based
largely on name-calling</i>

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,480
<i>and fear mongering.</i>

273
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,280
<i>His simple message
of "Make Gotham Safe Again" has...</i>

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,680
You believe Penguin
might win this thing?

275
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,760
This city is going to hell in
a hand basket.

276
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,440
You okay?

277
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Fine.

278
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,240
I assume you didn't come here
to ask about my health.

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,960
- I need to speak with Alice Tetch.
- No.

280
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,520
Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.

281
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
She's scheduled to be moved
to a facility upstate.

282
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
I'm sure she'll have plenty
of time then.

283
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
This can't wait.

284
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
What's going on?

285
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,880
You can talk to me, son.

286
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,840
Her brother, I had a run in
with him last night.

287
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,880
I think he may have done
something to me.

288
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,440
Like what?

289
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I don't know.

290
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,880
I'm having thoughts.

291
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,560
Look, you've caught some bad breaks.

292
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,520
Blackgate. Lee.

293
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,240
I don't know what happened
when you went to see her,

294
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,840
but I can take a pretty good guess.

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But at some point,
you're gonna have to make peace

296
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,480
with the decisions you've made.

297
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,200
And what if I can't?

298
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,440
Take it from me, you don't wanna
wake up one day

299
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,560
and realize that 20 years
has gone by.

300
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
We're keeping Alice in interrogation.

301
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Five minutes.

302
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,360
What was that back there?

303
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,960
- What?
- You.

304
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,600
Remind me to give props
to Alfred on his training.

305
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,600
I did not think you had that in you.

306
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,920
Me neither. You okay?

307
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
You?

308
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
A little light headed.

309
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Bruce...

310
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,720
- Oh! You need a hospital.
- No. No hospitals.

311
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,680
- Are those scars?
- Nothing, they're nothing.

312
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,400
- You're not Bruce.
- Selina, just...

313
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,280
- You're not Bruce.
- Just, just listen to...

314
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,920
- What the hell are you?
- I won't hurt you. Just let me...

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,520
Just let me explain.

316
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,800
I assume you know Butch
is paying campaign officials

317
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,200
to buy the election.

318
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,320
You don't approve?

319
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,360
My dear, Ed, this is Gotham.

320
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,600
This is how things are done.

321
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,640
And in theory, I support that.

322
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,800
But, Oswald, do you see how
these people are cheering for you.

323
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,640
Yes, they do seem very excited.

324
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,120
You can win this on your own.

325
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,920
Why risk it? There is no upside.

326
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,360
I want this, Ed. I want this like
I've never wanted anything.

327
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,560
I know, which is why you need
to call off Butch.

328
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,160
Mr. Penguin...

329
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,600
Hello, there.

330
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,640
I wanted to thank you for getting rid
of all the monsters.

331
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Do you see?

332
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
People look at me differently now.

333
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,600
For the first time
in my life I feel wanted.

334
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,280
Nice doing business with you.

335
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
And how do you feel now?

336
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
I feel like I've misjudged someone
who was supposed to be my friend.

337
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,280
I am your friend.

338
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
I can't be bought
but I can be stolen with a glance.

339
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm worthless to one
but priceless to two.

340
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,200
- What am I?
- I don't care!

341
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
I do not need
a stupid riddle, right now.

342
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,360
I know what I want.

343
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,600
I want to be Mayor.

344
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,880
Stay out of it, Ed.

345
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm warning you.

346
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,200
I need to find your brother.

347
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
You turn me in
and now you want my help?

348
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,840
I was hoping we could help
each other.

349
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,240
He's still in your head, isn't he?

350
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,360
- How do I stop it?
- I don't know.

351
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,960
Most of the time, once
the trance is broken that's it.

352
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
You should have been fine the
moment you stepped off the ledge.

353
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,520
Then why is it still happening?

354
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,000
Jervis has tapped into something
you're struggling with.

355
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,600
Something a part of you
would do anything not to face.

356
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,720
Then give me something to fight
this until I find him.

357
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,280
There's usually a trigger
that brings on the hypnotic state.

358
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,000
What's the last thing you remember?

359
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,000
He pulled out his watch.
Asked if I could hear it ticking.

360
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,120
That's it then.

361
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,080
His watch, anything resembling
the ticking will trigger the impulse.

362
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,240
He's made you a prisoner
in your own skin.

363
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
He did it to you.

364
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,640
When we were kids.

365
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,640
At first, he did it
to control me, keep me with him.

366
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,560
But then he started putting other
thoughts in my head.

367
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Thoughts a...

368
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,000
Thoughts a brother should never have.

369
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,080
That's why I wanted to kill him.

370
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,440
I won't go back to him.

371
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Not ever.

372
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah! Everybody!

373
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,160
Come on.

374
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,960
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen.</i>

375
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,560
<i>It is with great excitement
that we welcome you to our show!</i>

376
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,240
That's him. He's come for me.

377
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
<i>- I'd like to introduce you...</i>
- I'm getting you out of here.

378
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,920
<i>...to wrestling's most notorious
family here to entertain and amaze!</i>

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,920
<i>The Terrible Tweeds!</i>

380
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
<i>Let the show begin!</i>

381
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,920
Harvey, look out!

382
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,520
Hello, sis.

383
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,160
We both know you can't kill me.

384
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,040
Not until I remove that nagging
little impulse I planted.

385
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,360
Turn around. Hands in the air.

386
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,720
Alice, go! Now!

387
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,120
Goodbye, Mr. Gordon.

388
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,480
- No!
- I doubt I'll be seeing you again.

389
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,200
Get off me! Let go! Mr. Gordon!

390
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,240
It really doesn't hurt?

391
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
No.

392
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,960
Whatever they did to me
at Indian Hill I don't feel pain.

393
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,160
So why'd they make a Bruce Wayne
look-a-like anyhow?

394
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
I don't know.

395
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,200
I didn't even know I looked like him
until a few days ago.

396
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,000
I went to his house thinking he might
have some answers about who I am.

397
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
He didn't.

398
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,600
So you ran off
and pretended to be him.

399
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Why?

400
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
- You'll laugh.
- I doubt it.

401
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,320
Neither of you has a sense of humor.

402
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,800
When you came to see him the other
night I was watching from the hall.

403
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
I saw the way you looked at him.

404
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,320
No one's ever looked at me like that.

405
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,040
I wanted to know how it felt.

406
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,160
You should have your eyes checked.

407
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,760
I didn't look at him like anything.

408
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,360
All I mean
that I've never had a friend.

409
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,640
I've never had anyone.

410
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,840
You have no idea what it's like
to spend your whole life alone.

411
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,160
You're actually better off.

412
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,200
People are overrated.

413
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You don't believe that.

414
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,720
My mom left
before I could ride a bike.

415
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,600
Never knew my dad.
I had two friends.

416
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
One ended up barbecued,

417
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,880
and the other's
at the bottom of the river.

418
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,440
What about Bruce Wayne?

419
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,920
Forget about him.

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
He's even more screwed up than you.

421
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,040
You're more normal than you think.

422
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,320
Hey. You're up.

423
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,960
What's going on?

424
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,280
Barnes told me what happened
during the attack.

425
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,440
Nothing happened.

426
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,360
I heard the tape from the
interrogation room with Alice.

427
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,880
- Listen to me...
- Whatever Jervis is doing to you...

428
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
You need to uncuff me.

429
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I can't do that.

430
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't know what I would
do if something happened to you.

431
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
You'd be fine.

432
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,040
Do you really believe that?

433
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,760
You seemed to have moved on okay.

434
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,240
Yes, I moved on, Jim.

435
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,960
What choice did I have?

436
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,600
I went through the most painful
period of my life alone.

437
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,280
I cried myself to sleep every night
and like an idiot, I would wake up

438
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,240
thinking, hoping, that the next day
you would show up at my door.

439
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,160
But you never did.

440
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,360
Mario was there for me
when I needed someone.

441
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,360
He was there as I tried to put
myself back together.

442
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,160
But I'm the one who doesn't care?

443
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
After everything that's happened,

444
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,120
you really have nothing to say to me?

445
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,400
The past is the past and there's
nothing I can do to change that.

446
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,600
Alice told me that her brother
preys on anger and regret.

447
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,080
I really don't want that to be
all that's left of us.

448
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,760
You mean all that's left of me.

449
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,760
Barnes asked me to put you on
a 48 hour suicide watch.

450
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,040
I've already signed off on it.

451
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
I know that we can't change the past,

452
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,920
but there's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

453
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,120
Most of you guys have been
with me for a while.

454
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
You know me.

455
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,040
And I know Gotham
like the back of my hand.

456
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,840
Penguin, when he's Mayor,

457
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,920
boys, I promise you...

458
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,720
we are gonna run this city. Huh?

459
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,880
- To Butch!
- To Butch!

460
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,040
- Hey.
- What?

461
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,760
I lost track of the guy in
the glasses.

462
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,480
Nygma?

463
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,000
That skinny loon gave you the slip?

464
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,840
Yeah.

465
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,920
No. No, no, that's not possible.

466
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,960
Let's go! We gotta go, guys!

467
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,560
Two of your brothers are dead.

468
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,040
The other two escaped
with Alice and Jervis.

469
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,760
And I need to know where
they're taking her.

470
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,800
Jervis gains a sister
and you lose two brothers?

471
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,400
That don't seem too fair?

472
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,720
I bet you were close growing up, huh?

473
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,800
Wrestling around the house.

474
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,400
Driving your mom crazy.

475
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,440
Five little kids all dreaming
of stardom.

476
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah.

477
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,160
I'm a fan.

478
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,360
My dad used to always take me

479
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
down to the wrestling matches
at the Garden.

480
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,120
I also happen
to know most luchadores...

481
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,600
request to be buried
in their masks...

482
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,000
...as a sign of honor and respect.

483
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,320
I really, really hope that wasn't
the case with your brothers.

484
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,600
This freak, Jervis, did something
to my friend.

485
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,640
And I need him to undo it.

486
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
Where are they taking her?

487
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,920
Okay! Okay! I'll tell you!

488
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
Well...

489
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
do you like it?

490
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,040
I know you were surprised
to see me last night...

491
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,280
And I want you to know
that I forgive you.

492
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,560
For everything.

493
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,160
But, I want you to understand
the consequences

494
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,000
if you ever leave me again.

495
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,520
I need you to understand
how important you are to me.

496
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,320
Don't. Please.

497
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,920
Now, you might feel a little prick.

498
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,040
Your escorts agreed to take
a long lunch.

499
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
- You know where they took Alice?
- Yeah.

500
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,560
But it's only a matter of time
until Barnes finds out

501
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
and sends in the cavalry.

502
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,680
- How'd you find me?
- Lee.

503
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,360
- Lee?
- Yeah!

504
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,680
She also told me if you check
out on my watch it's my head.

505
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,720
Well, I guess you're gonna have
to trust me.

506
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,320
Remember to chisel
that into my tombstone.

507
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Let's go.

508
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,400
Thanks, Francisco!

509
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,920
- Took you long enough.
- Where's Selina?

510
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,720
She's not at her squat.
If you did anything...

511
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,120
- She's fine.
- Where is she!

512
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,400
She left a little while ago.
I don't know where she went.

513
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
I take you in
and this is the thanks I get?

514
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,760
You run around with Selina,
pretending to be me?

515
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,280
Is that why you're angry?

516
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,280
Because I was pretending to be you,
or that I spent the day with Selina?

517
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,720
For someone who has everything, you
have no idea what you actually want.

518
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,720
Or maybe, you're just too
scared to take it.

519
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,160
At least I know who I am.

520
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,400
Cool your boots, Master Bruce.

521
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,800
Let's all just take a breath,
shall we?

522
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,120
Don't worry.

523
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,240
You won't be seeing me anymore.

524
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,360
Neither will she.

525
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,240
I don't know why I was created,
but I know I don't belong in Gotham.

526
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,760
Say goodbye to Selina for me?

527
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,440
And thank her for the kiss.

528
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,800
What're you going to use that for?

529
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,960
Oh, I imagine I'll...

530
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,000
mix it into some public
drinking fountain.

531
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,680
Create a few dozen monsters.

532
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Please, Jervis. Please.
I'll do whatever you want.

533
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,920
You will now.

534
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,440
Because you know the price
other people will pay if you don't.

535
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't know what
I would ever do if I lost you.

536
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,600
That connection.

537
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,040
It keeps me sane.

538
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,640
It always has.

539
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,240
Tetch! Jervis!

540
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Don't move!

541
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,520
Mr. Gordon.

542
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,120
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
So stubborn.

543
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,320
Let her go, now!

544
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,240
You know I can't do that, but if you
let me leave with my dear sister,

545
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:38,360
my dear Alice, then I'll free you
from that nasty little impulse.

546
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,200
Maybe you can live a long, happy...
Well, a long life.

547
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,520
Let her go and you live.
That's the deal.

548
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,440
One question...

549
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,280
Do you hear that?

550
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Jim!

551
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,960
We both know what you really want.

552
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,640
I saw it in your eyes
the first time we met.

553
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,240
You want to be free.

554
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,600
Free from the pain.

555
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,880
And you can be.

556
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,160
Stop fighting and let go.

557
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,160
Past is the past.

558
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,320
There's nothing
I can do to change that.

559
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,280
There's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

560
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,560
No!

561
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,800
Well, well, Mr. Gordon breaks
my spell!

562
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,520
I dare say it's time we bid
this foul city our good-bye.

563
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,960
- No!
- Alice!

564
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,280
I'll never go with you!

565
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,800
Why do you say such things?

566
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,560
We belong together.
You know that. I love you.

567
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,680
- You're insane!
- Oh, no!

568
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,560
No!

569
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,600
You killed her!

570
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,080
You want to explain yourself?

571
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,160
I was following a lead.

572
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,480
You were following some misguided
notion about friendship.

573
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,080
James Gordon is gonna
get you killed one day.

574
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
Do you get that?

575
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
Maybe.

576
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,560
But until that day, I will never
turn my back on him.

577
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,040
<i>The night that all of Gotham
has been waiting for.</i>

578
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,080
<i>Final results should
be coming in shortly...</i>

579
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,440
This is it.

580
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,120
The moment I've been waiting for.

581
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Indeed.

582
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,720
You! You, you ruined everything!

583
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,960
Butch! Release him this instant!
What is going on?

584
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,480
I'll tell you what's going on.

585
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,200
He just cost you the election.

586
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,200
He went to every district official
and took the money back.

587
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,720
Said you wanted to run
a clean election!

588
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,560
Tell me this is not true.

589
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,240
I'm afraid Butch is right. For once.

590
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Why?

591
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,880
After everything I've done for you.

592
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,680
Everything we could have
done together.

593
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,600
You betrayed me.

594
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Butch...

595
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,480
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
let Butch kill you where you stand.

596
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,840
Well, there are
about thirty witnesses.

597
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,160
I don't care!

598
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,040
And there's that...

599
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,040
<i>In what can only be viewed
as a seismic shift</i>

600
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,880
<i>even by Gotham standards,</i>

601
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,640
<i>former underworld kingpin,</i>

602
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,880
<i>Oswald Cobblepot, has won
the mayor's office by a landslide...</i>

603
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,160
<i>momentum based largely on
his outspoken criticism...</i>

604
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I still won?

605
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,960
<i>...of how city officials
and the GCPD mishandled</i>

606
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,360
They really want me as Mayor?

607
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yes.

608
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,360
I can't be bought but I can be
stolen with one glance.

609
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,320
I'm worthless to one
but priceless two.

610
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,600
<i>Cobblepot! Cobblepot!
Cobblepot! Cobblepot!</i>

611
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,480
They love me.

612
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,960
If you would have bought the election
you would have never known.

613
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,400
And now you do.

614
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,320
Feels good, doesn't it?

615
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,280
How did you know I would win?

616
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,920
I believe in you, Oswald.

617
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,360
Even when you don't believe
in yourself.

618
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
You!

619
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,160
You never believed I could win
this election on my own!

620
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,360
I think maybe you're not cut out
for this after all.

621
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,560
What? You've gotta be kidding me.
This guy...

622
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,160
Don't worry!
I still need someone to crack skulls.

623
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Come, Ed.

624
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,480
We have plans to make.

625
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,040
You think we'll ever see him again?

626
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Well, that I very much doubt,
Master Bruce.

627
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,840
I reckon he is gonna try
and get as far away from Gotham

628
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,360
as he possibly can.

629
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,240
I still wonder why Hugo Strange
made him.

630
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,920
Long lonely nights in the laboratory,

631
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
probably needed someone to talk to.

632
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,960
Or some other, nefarious reason.

633
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Perhaps.

634
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,240
There is one thing...

635
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,640
Yes, Master Bruce?

636
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,240
Do you think Selina really
kissed him?

637
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,280
Oh, bloody hell.

638
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,840
I mean, you've had training
in interrogation right?

639
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,200
- You can tell when someone's lying.
- I'm not...

640
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,640
You know, I'm not gonna
have this conversation.

641
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,880
And if she did kiss him, do you think
she thought he was me?

642
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,240
Good night, Master Bruce.

643
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,200
I bet she thought it was me.

644
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Hey.

645
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Hi.

646
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,320
You're here late.

647
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,720
The Tweeds really
did a number on this place.

648
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,760
Guess I'm Medical Examiner
slash-medic.

649
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,280
Slash-resident-therapist.

650
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,640
I wanted to thank you
for telling Bullock where to find me.

651
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,960
I heard about what happened
with Alice. You okay?

652
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,280
- Yeah.
- No. I mean, are you okay?

653
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,880
Whatever Jervis did to me,
it's over now.

654
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I'm glad.

655
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,800
Guess I should get going.

656
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Lee?

657
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,000
There's something I need to tell you.

658
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,280
Something I should have told you
the moment I saw you back in Gotham.

659
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,280
- Everything you've said today...
- I'm sorry about that.

660
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Don't.

661
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
You were right.

662
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,920
And after everything
that happened today.

663
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,080
This is harder than I thought.

664
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,600
What is it, Jim?

665
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,800
I'm happy for you.

666
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
You are?

667
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,000
Trying to be.

668
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,240
Maybe we can start there?

669
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,280
Yeah. I think we can do that.

670
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Bruce Wayne?

671
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,040
- No.
- But you could be.

672
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,640
In fact, you could be so much more.

673
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Who are you?

674
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
You might think
of us as your parents.

675
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,480
We've been looking for you
for a long time.

676
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,320
It is with a humble heart

677
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,400
that I accept the trust placed
in me by this great city

678
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,840
to become your Mayor.

679
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,120
The people have spoken,
and I have heard their call!

680
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,520
- Yeah.
- That's right!

681
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,760
And as my first act as Mayor,

682
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,040
I would like to introduce you
to my Chief of Staff.

683
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,280
Mr. Edward Nygma!

684
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,720
Congratulations!

685
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,920
No.
