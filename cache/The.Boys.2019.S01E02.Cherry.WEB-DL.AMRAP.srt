1
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:10,357
So, you're-you're not a Fed?

2
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:12,529
Do you hear that?
That's the old bill.

3
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:14,254
So unless you want to explain
why you've got

4
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:17,368
America's favorite invisible
wanker dead on the floor,

5
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:19,446
give us a fucking hand,
will ya?

6
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:24,792
Aw, shit.

7
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:45,226
All right, listen,
I have worked for the Feds.

8
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,478
I've worked for loads of people.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,860
I'm what you might call
an independent contractor.

10
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,279
You got a problem, you call me,
I solve the problem.

11
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,249
What is that?

12
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,881
That's a problem.

13
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,629
Oh, thank fuck, he's alive.

14
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:17,802
Yes, yes, he's alive!
Okay, pull over.

15
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:19,528
No, no, no, Hughie,
you don't fucking get it.

16
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:22,142
- Pull the car over.
- This is a fucksight worse.

17
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:23,969
He's seen our faces.

18
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,269
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:32,541
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't do this.

20
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:34,565
I can't do this.
Let me out.

21
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,986
- Let me out. Pull over!
- Hughie,

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,370
you walk away now, and you will
never get payback for Robin.

23
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:43,778
You'll spend the rest
of your life

24
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,656
sitting on your ass
with fucking regret.

25
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:47,253
Now, is that what you want?

26
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:57,255
I know a bloke.
Top man.

27
00:01:57,298 --> 00:01:58,758
He'll know what to do.

28
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,226
Morning, luv.

29
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,441
Frenchie about?

30
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,868
Mmm.

31
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,539
You'll love this guy.

32
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:45,967
Frenchie.

33
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:48,393
Oi, Frenchie.

34
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,599
Monsieur Charcuter.

35
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,896
Huh.

36
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,780
This is a surprise.

37
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,398
Good to see you.

38
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:02,244
Good to see you, too, mate.

39
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:07,656
Means you brought that 40,000
you owe me?

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,460
I mean, why else would you
show your face around here?

41
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:16,747
Because I've got something
even better for you.

42
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:21,264
How would you like
to double your money?

43
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,983
The double of zero is zero.

44
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,347
Who is he?

45
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,904
This guy?

46
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,557
Oh, this here is
Hughie Campbell.

47
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:39,855
We're, uh, working
a little job together.

48
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,030
Ooh.

49
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:45,278
And he's still alive?

50
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,678
You and I worked together,
and you're still in one piece.

51
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:51,832
Am I?

52
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:57,251
Look, do you want to know
what the fucking job is or not?

53
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,883
Open it.

54
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:04,723
Who is in there?

55
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:09,932
Where's your sense of adventure, Frenchie?

56
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,016
You dumb fucks are fucking dead!

57
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,484
Have you any...
Aah!

58
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:25,324
That's Translucent.

59
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,362
You got Translucent
in your trunk, huh?

60
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,776
Nothing gets past you, mate.

61
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:31,374
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

62
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,830
Go away.
Get him out of here.

63
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,830
All right, all right, easy.

64
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:35,291
He's chipped.

65
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:36,711
The Supes could be
on their way.

66
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:38,226
Homelander could be on his way
right now.

67
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,250
Wait, he's chipped?

68
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:40,520
You bring this to my doorstep?

69
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:42,384
This is not my problem, huh?

70
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:45,841
Well, it is now.
He knows what you look like.

71
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:49,426
Look, Frenchie, I need
your help, mate,

72
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,220
and I ain't leaving
till I get it,

73
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:53,563
or till The Seven show up.

74
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:05,235
Ah, here comes the A-Train!

75
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:06,987
My man, how you doing?

76
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:08,949
Look, I brought you something.

77
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,740
- Thanks?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:17,786
I'm sorry, I asked
for Translucent.

79
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,131
Right, but Translucent is
on a secret,

80
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,247
undercover mission right now.

81
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:24,384
But you got the A-Train, baby.

82
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:30,509
But... my wish was
to meet Translucent.

83
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:35,223
That was my only wish.
He's my hero.

84
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:40,266
Yeah. Um... well, you know,
maybe he can swing by

85
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:43,322
next week or some...

86
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:45,357
something...

87
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,283
Fuck.

88
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:52,871
Um... you know what?

89
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,488
Maybe I can't turn invisible,

90
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:57,655
but I am the world's
fastest man.

91
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,415
Like, I can outrun anybody
or anything.

92
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:01,957
That's-that's something, right?

93
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,711
Look, I'll tell you what,
you get better,

94
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:08,304
and I'll teach you to run
as fast as me.

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,590
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:12,894
You'll teach me
to outrun cancer?

97
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,726
Yeah.

98
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,227
Oh, my God, turn that off.

99
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:25,773
How many times do I have
to tell you

100
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:27,146
that A-Train needs
to be scripted?

101
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:28,628
- Right.
- When he does not have a script,

102
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:30,589
- this is what happens.
- I'm on it. I'm so sorry.

103
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:32,323
- It will not happen again.
- All right.

104
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:33,534
And where is Translucent?

105
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:35,034
We know he's not
in the building.

106
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,761
He hasn't triggered any
of the motion sensors.

107
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,763
He's probably out on another one
of his fucking benders.

108
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:40,657
Doesn't he have a team-up
tomorrow night?

109
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:41,916
Yeah, with the Deep.

110
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,167
- Get a backup.
- I'm on it.

111
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,378
Okay, go.

112
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,378
Okay.

113
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,670
Hello?

114
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,890
Black Noir.

115
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:58,558
We haven't properly met yet.
I'm Starlight.

116
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:07,685
Well...

117
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,693
I look forward
to working with you.

118
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:12,696
There she is.

119
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:15,068
Hi. How you settling in?

120
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:18,405
Well, uh, it's an adjustment.

121
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:19,702
That's for sure.

122
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:21,075
- This is Trevor...
- Hi.

123
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:22,501
...from Crime Analytics.

124
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,249
So, we have exciting news
for you.

125
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:28,132
We are sending you
on your first patrol.

126
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,510
It's a team-up tomorrow night.

127
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,257
Oh, that's great.

128
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,549
That's great news.
Thank you.

129
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:36,433
Hi. Big fan.
There you go.

130
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,114
- A crime itinerary?
- Yep.

131
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:39,638
Where and when to find
the bad guys.

132
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,812
That's what my department does.
We vet leads,

133
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,310
crunch satellite data,
COMP-STAT.

134
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:44,902
Better intel than the police.

135
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:47,017
- Mm.
- You know, thanks, but I'm good.

136
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:49,364
I-I like to do
my own investigating.

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,150
And that is why we love you,

138
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:52,323
but it's not coming from us.

139
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,071
It's corporate.
To protect you.

140
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:55,493
What if you nab
the wrong person?

141
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,371
There's liability to consider.

142
00:07:57,408 --> 00:08:00,618
The-the Deep is coming?

143
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,251
Yeah,
it's a water-adjacent crime.

144
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,577
Then he should do it himself.
He doesn't need me.

145
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,504
It was gonna be
Deep and Translucent,

146
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:11,673
but everyone on 82 is so excited
to get you out there.

147
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:14,384
Yeah, it's just, uh, you know,
back in Des Moines,

148
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,215
I always patrolled alone.

149
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,300
And that is why we love you.

150
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:20,215
But we see at least
a 23% uptick

151
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:22,434
in social media mentions
and hero hashtags

152
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:23,894
when there's a team-up.

153
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:24,944
People love a team-up.

154
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:26,647
- Love a team-up.
- Mm.

155
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:04,433
That stuff really
blocks the chip's signal?

156
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:05,827
Yeah. It's just
R.F. Shielding Foil.

157
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:06,811
You can get it at Fry's.

158
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:09,022
You in tech intelligence?

159
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,442
Uh, sales and installation.

160
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,110
Ah...

161
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:16,821
Oh, what the fuck?

162
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,532
Where am I?

163
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:21,162
Oi. Morning, sunshine.

164
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,240
- You know who I am?
- Not sure.

165
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:25,865
I know so many
invisible assholes.

166
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,713
You fucking amateurs!

167
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,343
Fuck!

168
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,126
What the fuck?!

169
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,630
Ooh, mind them bars, son.

170
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:37,221
You'll only bollocks
yourself again.

171
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:38,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

172
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,085
Uh, okay, what do
you guys want? Money?

173
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:44,096
We don't want
your fucking money.

174
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:50,904
What do you think, Frenchie?

175
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,478
You just dropped
the Moby fucking Dick

176
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,073
of problems on my plate.

177
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,987
That's what I think.

178
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,317
Okay?

179
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:01,913
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

180
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,619
It's hard as diamonds.

181
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,330
It's nearly impossible
to penetrate.

182
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,910
All right,
how 'bout we suffocate him?

183
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,786
Some Dominicans
already tried this,

184
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,463
way back in '07.

185
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,131
And what happened?

186
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,396
They're all fucking dead now.

187
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,920
That's what happened.

188
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,526
All right, then,
fuck it, electrocution.

189
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,760
We'll just increase the amps.

190
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:22,320
You already hit him
with enough to drop

191
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:24,014
a water buffalo, and look.

192
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,064
Might knock him out.
Doesn't seem to kill him, huh?

193
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,728
No. We need to pierce
the skin somehow.

194
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,477
Well, how the
hell are we gonna do that?

195
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,480
I don't know.

196
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:34,982
You're gonna kill him?

197
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,031
We didn't bring him here
for a fucking Happy Meal.

198
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,160
I don't... I thought we'd
question him or something.

199
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:46,989
I don't know, you get a... you
get ahold of someone this big...

200
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:50,155
At Gitmo, we had to water board
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

201
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:54,785
183 times over six months
to get him to talk just once.

202
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:56,455
Now, we ain't got six months.

203
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,923
I doubt we've even got
six hours.

204
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:04,087
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

205
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,176
but right now, you're talking
about randomly killing

206
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:11,062
one of the most famous men
on the planet.

207
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,941
A goddamn national treasure.

208
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:17,318
I mean... people tend to notice
that kind of thing.

209
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:20,487
And if we let him go...

210
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,697
what do you think The Seven
will do to us?

211
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:25,278
Hmm?

212
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:29,454
You can't get A-Train if you're
a greasy smear on the pavement.

213
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:33,666
I'm not a murderer.

214
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:38,632
That's all right.

215
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,090
I am.

216
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,929
The race is coming up quickly.
How you feeling?

217
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:47,098
Look, A-Train is
a fierce competitor,

218
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:49,073
but no one can be the world's
fastest man forever.

219
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:50,387
Let's just say I like my chan...

220
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:51,993
I'll always protect you.

221
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:54,187
Your little
hero will never be afraid

222
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:55,897
with the Junior
Homelander Cuddle...

223
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:59,778
I regret to inform you that I've
located the mayor's Gulfstream.

224
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:02,816
It's about two miles down at
the bottom of Hudson Canyon.

225
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,361
There are no survivors,

226
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,954
and I've yet to locate
the flight recorder.

227
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,240
Though the jet was fragmented,

228
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:10,203
there was one engine
fully intact,

229
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,953
and it appears to be
engine failure.

230
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:14,405
So I'd like to offer...

231
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,375
Whoa...

232
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:23,013
- Still going strong, huh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

233
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,317
I've just been pumping
for 30 minutes,

234
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,801
and I got a quarter of an ounce.

235
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:28,012
Hey, hey, go easy on yourself.

236
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:29,853
Come on, now.

237
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:33,848
Personally, I think it's amazing
that a woman your age

238
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:36,942
can have a baby, period.

239
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,229
That is so sweet of you to say.

240
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:42,072
Oh, no problem.

241
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,399
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

242
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:46,283
- You heard about that?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:48,161
No, not yet.

244
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:50,618
Well, you know,
I could search for him.

245
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:51,949
Personally.

246
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:54,254
That's not necessary.

247
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:56,037
Right.

248
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:59,999
Hey, did you hear about
the mayor of Baltimore?

249
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:06,008
Yeah. Yeah.

250
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,629
Heard his plane went down.

251
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,546
Some sort of engine trouble.

252
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:10,934
Yeah, it's awful.

253
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:12,221
I saw him on Tuesday.

254
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:13,934
Had a meeting with him
right here.

255
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,894
Wow.

256
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:18,274
Well, hug your kids, right?

257
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,441
'Cause you never know
what might happen.

258
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,770
- So true.
- Mm.

259
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:23,935
You know what's interesting?

260
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:26,954
The Deep told me, and only me,

261
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,907
that there were, uh,
scorch marks

262
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,448
on the mayor's engine.

263
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:37,212
Almost as if from two small,
high-intensity beams,

264
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,327
roughly the width of human eyes.

265
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:44,052
Say what you mean to say.

266
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:49,547
Your brand is hope,

267
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:53,263
baseball, America...
sunshine.

268
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:55,966
You don't do vengeance.

269
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,233
Madelyn, I heard him
through the wall of this...

270
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,692
He was blackmailing you.

271
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:05,902
I am the last person
you need to save.

272
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,362
Yeah, but I-I did it for you.

273
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:10,742
I know, but did the timing
occur to you?

274
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:13,121
I have half the Senate
Appropriations Committee

275
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:16,368
coming tonight.

276
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:32,507
How did he even know
about Compound V?

277
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:34,302
We are not going
to talk about that.

278
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:35,926
Oh, come on, Madelyn.

279
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:38,732
You do not need
to hide things from me.

280
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,517
I love Vought as much as you do,

281
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,690
- and I can do more.
- You can do more?

282
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,190
You've already grossed
$12.3 billion for us.

283
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:49,824
Right. So the pricks on 82 can
take all the fucking credit?

284
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:52,241
Empty fucking suits
with Cornell degrees? Come on.

285
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,870
I'm the one who's out there.
Not them.

286
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:01,409
I'm the one who,
who-who knows the audience.

287
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,706
Who knows what's good
for this company.

288
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,380
I know. I hear you.

289
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:08,338
I do. But what I need right now,

290
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,680
is I need you to charm the shit
out of those congressmen.

291
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,507
Right.

292
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:19,724
'Cause that's all
I'm good for, huh?

293
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:22,346
Smile, look pretty,
say my lines.

294
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:24,694
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

295
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:27,319
No. No.

296
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:34,069
You just need
to let me protect you.

297
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:37,534
- Oh, you're gonna protect me?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,000
Gods are pure

299
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,751
and they're perfect

300
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:50,174
and they're above it all.

301
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,513
And they need to stay that way.

302
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,310
Huh...

303
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:09,015
You're leaking.

304
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:12,275
Thank you.

305
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:48,518
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

306
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:51,903
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

307
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:53,572
- I'm fine.
- But the police are saying

308
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,070
some wacko drove
into Gary's store,

309
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:56,911
right through the window,
and then took off.

310
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:59,617
I-I thought maybe you've been
hurt, or-or kidnapped.

311
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:01,698
I saw this Dateline
on human trafficking...

312
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,163
Dad, I haven't been
human trafficked, okay?

313
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:06,674
I-I closed up early. It must
have happened after I left.

314
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,456
But where'd you go?

315
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,420
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

316
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,421
- Blowing off steam.
- No... now, I called Anthony, all right?

317
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:17,134
I called everybody. No one's
seen you. Don't lie to me.

318
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:19,545
Yeah, it's kind of
hard to explain.

319
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:22,314
Hey, Dad, listen,
I got to, I got to go.

320
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:23,741
Just, l-listen,
I know you've been taking

321
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,345
Robin's accident real hard.

322
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:26,786
- It wasn't an accident.
- All-all right, all right.

323
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,650
My point is, you're a good boy.

324
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:31,437
You're a sensitive boy.
Come home.

325
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:34,861
Okay? Before you do something
stupid, come home, Hughie.

326
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:38,531
- I got to go.
- No, w-wait, Hugh...

327
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:21,658
Oh. Well, I heard
we had a meeting.

328
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:24,328
So, um,
I'll just leave you to it.

329
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:28,037
Well, we're having a meeting
right now, aren't we, Deep?

330
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,709
You and me.

331
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:34,134
- Come on in.
- Yeah. Sure.

332
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,323
So, uh, what, uh...

333
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,937
Or is there, is there anything
I can, can do for you,

334
00:18:57,984 --> 00:18:59,404
Homelander?

335
00:18:59,444 --> 00:19:03,074
Well, yeah. I-I guess, uh...

336
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,701
Well, you can help me
understand something, Deep,

337
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,703
'cause, uh...

338
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,325
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.

339
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,793
Am I stupid, Deep?

340
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,793
What? No.

341
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,795
No. You're not stupid.

342
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:22,588
You're-you're smart.
Very smart, right?

343
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,224
Yeah. Okay.

344
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,640
So, what possible reason...

345
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:32,481
what, uh, razor-sharp
fish instinct...

346
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,519
made you run to Stillwell

347
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:38,403
and tell her what you thought
you saw down there?

348
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:41,611
All right, look, I-I thought...
I thought I, I was, uh...

349
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:44,283
I-I don't even know... I don't
know what I saw down there,

350
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:47,872
as a matter of fact. It was, it
was really dark and, uh, muddy...

351
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:49,489
the water was really muddy.

352
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,286
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

353
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,750
I-I didn't...

354
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,751
I didn't really see anything
down there, as a matter of fact.

355
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,259
That's what I thought.

356
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,508
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,900
And I trust we never have
to have this conversation again.

358
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:19,318
No. Of course not.

359
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:20,897
Just this once.

360
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:31,868
Now go fuck Shamu
in the blowhole.

361
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:37,081
Yeah.

362
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:25,755
Rounds coated in the same carbon
metamaterial as his skin.

363
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,016
Will it work?

364
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:36,388
Je ne sais pas.

365
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,650
Guys?

366
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:50,565
What are you doing?
Wait! No, no, no! Wait, wait!

367
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:52,075
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

368
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,117
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

369
00:21:57,163 --> 00:22:01,333
You stupid, fucking asshole.

370
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:03,626
I'm invincible.

371
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,090
You stupid motherfuckers.

372
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:10,297
I'm fucking Translucent.

373
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:12,723
I'm indestructible.

374
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,740
It's only a matter of time
before they come for me.

375
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:16,604
You're fucking dead!

376
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:23,772
Well, that was great, guys.

377
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:25,275
That was awesome.

378
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,988
Frenchie, back later.

379
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,319
Where are you going?

380
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:36,701
Got an idea.
Long shot, might help.

381
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:39,214
- Now?
- Yeah, well, it's all under control here, isn't it?

382
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:40,957
Try not to bugger each other.

383
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:54,715
Ah, fuck me.

384
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,432
Fuck.

385
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:09,105
Oh. Sorry, Ms. Stillwell.

386
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,152
Oh...

387
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:13,818
Are you Anika?

388
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,825
Ms. Stillwell,
I didn't know that you were...

389
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,197
You look really nice.

390
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:18,873
Thank you.
Could you please show me?

391
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,711
Yeah. We haven't been able
to ping Translucent's chip

392
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,958
- until about five minutes ago.
- Well, where is he?

393
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,590
Jersey City.

394
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:27,587
What the hell is he doing
in Jersey City?

395
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:30,379
Uh... well, he's somewhere
in this ten-block area.

396
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:32,013
That is the best you can do?

397
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,527
It's possible
the chip's glitching,

398
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:35,511
- or there's some kind of interference...
- Okay.

399
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:39,023
Tell security to search the
area, door-to-door if necessary.

400
00:23:39,057 --> 00:23:40,637
But tell them to be discreet.

401
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:43,313
He is invisible,
so it shouldn't be that hard.

402
00:23:43,353 --> 00:23:44,653
Okay.

403
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,819
Oh, wow. What a surprise.

404
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:53,401
A water crime.

405
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,066
Fuck me running. I swear to God,

406
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:57,584
they only call me when
there's trouble at a dock.

407
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:01,657
Or a river or a lake, canal.

408
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:04,214
A jetty.

409
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:08,208
Fucking idiots.
I could be doing so much more.

410
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:10,842
But no, Vought just wants me
to make my big pretty dives

411
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,010
into the water and flash
my fucking biceps for Instagram.

412
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,390
I mean, sure, four million hits
a day, but still,

413
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,807
it's fucking demeaning.

414
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:22,847
What's your problem?

415
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,352
You've had that pissy look
on your face all night.

416
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:32,607
Ooh. What...?

417
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:34,702
Is this about
the other night again?

418
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:39,486
Jesus Christ.

419
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:41,494
Cry me a fucking river,
all right?

420
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:43,786
I took my share of shit
when I first got here, okay?

421
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,670
Besides, you had
a crush on me, remember?

422
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:50,499
That gives you no right...
zero right...

423
00:24:50,545 --> 00:24:52,755
to do what you did,
you pathetic asshole.

424
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:55,927
- Hey. You shut your fucking mouth.
- Or what?

425
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,837
You'll sic a grouper on me?

426
00:24:57,885 --> 00:25:00,045
I'll tell everyone
you're a psycho.

427
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:02,556
- I'll go to Homelander.
- No, you won't.

428
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:05,848
See, I asked around; you're not
number two around here.

429
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:08,483
You're just the fish guy.

430
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,821
Everyone thinks you're a joke.

431
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:13,107
Me, most of all.

432
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:17,201
I cannot believe
I fell for your crap.

433
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:21,618
- You stuck-up little...
- You ever touch me again,

434
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,539
I will burn your eyes out.

435
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:29,536
Understand me?

436
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,385
We'll finish this later.

437
00:25:39,427 --> 00:25:42,177
You take them from the front,
I'll come in from behind.

438
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:03,699
I'll always...

439
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,668
Hey.

440
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:19,052
Hey, boys.

441
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:28,637
Hurry up. Move faster.

442
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:31,444
You're amazing. That was so
great. That was really good.

443
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,819
- Smile for the cameras.
- What? What the hell is this?

444
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,334
Yeah, stand over him
and say "This is lit."

445
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:37,188
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

446
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:40,735
Catch my dive in the water?
It was fucking cherry.

447
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,910
Nice.

448
00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:47,448
Smile at the camera, Starlight.

449
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,304
Congrats
on your promotion, Susan.

450
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,260
Jesus Christ. Butcher.

451
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:05,101
Madam Deputy Director, eh?

452
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:09,427
Wow. Andrew and the kids
must be chuffed for you.

453
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:11,765
Keep your voice down, and don't
talk about my family.

454
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:13,941
It makes my skin crawl.

455
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,520
What are you doing here?

456
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:19,235
Just need a quick dekko
at some of your files.

457
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:22,527
- My files? What files?
- A couple of Supes.

458
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:24,572
Big Game, Shout Out.

459
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:26,575
Translucent, if you got him.

460
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,287
- Why Translucent?
- Eh, nothing special,

461
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:30,367
- just ticking a few boxes.
- Oh.

462
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:32,293
So you just broke
into my goddamn house

463
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,541
in the middle of the night?

464
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,083
All right.

465
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:37,336
I'm trying to find a way
to do the job on the cunt,

466
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,273
and if it's anywhere,
it'll be in Mallory's files.

467
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:41,547
- Now would you like me to keep talking?
- No.

468
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:45,721
No. Christ. Just don't
fucking say another word.

469
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:48,261
The Mallory files
are dead and buried.

470
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,806
You're the deputy director
of CIA Operations.

471
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,640
- Dig 'em up.
- No.

472
00:27:52,685 --> 00:27:54,895
- Why not?
- Because of you.

473
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:56,647
- Me?
- Yes, you.

474
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,479
The director will shitcan anyone

475
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:00,114
who even goes near those files.

476
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:04,201
You made it suicide
to go after the Supes.

477
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:07,828
What are you even doing back
involved in this?

478
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:09,737
I mean, you have a death wish,

479
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:12,535
or are you a glutton
for punishment?

480
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah. A bit of both, I suppose.

481
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:25,005
Come on... Susan.

482
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:28,051
Five minutes alone
with a piece of paper.

483
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:30,845
For old time's sakes.
No one will know.

484
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,814
You-You're really trying
to sell this shit?

485
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:37,652
- Why, you buying it?
- You think I look back fondly

486
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:41,188
at the times we fucked
in bar bathrooms?

487
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:43,283
Oh, come on.
We had a few laughs.

488
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,359
Like the time you sent me
the Edible Arrangement.

489
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:48,985
And what we had was
you trying to use me,

490
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,953
for a Get Out of Jail Free card
at a time like this.

491
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:54,584
Well, if that's all
it was, then,

492
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,582
what's got you
so hot and bothered

493
00:28:56,624 --> 00:28:59,714
when a simple "fuck you"
would suffice?

494
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:02,712
Fuck you.

495
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,050
Now get out of my house.

496
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:20,193
Did I mention this is
life or death?

497
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:23,231
I'll send an Edible Arrangement
to your funeral.

498
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:47,215
Hi.

499
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:50,428
I, um... I thought you
might be thirsty, so...

500
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,650
Well, if you don't want it,
I can always...

501
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:05,902
No, I want it.

502
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:15,243
Cheers.

503
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:19,669
So, listen, um,

504
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:24,087
I need to ask you some
questions about A-Train.

505
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:27,668
When he, uh, burst
through that woman

506
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:31,835
the other day, Robin Ward.

507
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:33,506
I-I need to know why.

508
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:35,564
Where was he going?
What was he doing?

509
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,978
Why? Was she your sister?

510
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:40,637
Girlfriend?

511
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:41,896
Girlfriend.

512
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:46,073
That's what all this
is about? Christ.

513
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:47,938
What makes you think I know
anything about it?

514
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,296
I know you and A-Train
were tight.

515
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,490
You guys came up together.

516
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:53,119
What are you, a fucking fan?

517
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:57,447
Listen, those two guys in there,
they want to kill you, okay?

518
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:59,325
So you give me something,
maybe I can...

519
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:01,791
What? Hold 'em off?
'Cause they hang

520
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:04,002
on your every word.
You're the big man around here.

521
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:06,213
Okay, you don't want to talk,
don't talk. I tried.

522
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:07,423
Good luck.

523
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:11,093
Buddy, my superpower
ain't invisibility.

524
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,553
You know that, right?

525
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:17,472
It's reading people.

526
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:19,345
Watching them when
they think they're alone.

527
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:33,531
I see people for who
they really are.

528
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:36,032
I see you, too, pal.

529
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,275
Right.

530
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:39,366
'Cause you know me
so well, right?

531
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:40,847
Yeah. I know you're trying
your damnedest

532
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:43,961
to be tough...
it's a little adorable...

533
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:48,499
but the truth is...
you're terrified.

534
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:51,506
Shitting in your tighty-whities

535
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:55,759
'cause you're "in over your head
fucked," and you know it.

536
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:19,736
Hughie,

537
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:22,955
I even kind of feel for you.

538
00:32:22,997 --> 00:32:27,247
Your girl died, and we do crazy
shit when we got broken hearts,

539
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:29,673
but now every instinct
is screaming at you

540
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:32,592
to head for the hills, and you
should listen to that instinct.

541
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,683
Unless we kill you first.

542
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,099
How?

543
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:41,098
I got invulnerable skin.

544
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,100
I'm a fucking superhero, guy.

545
00:32:45,144 --> 00:32:48,444
We fight gangs and terrorists.

546
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,940
We save the world daily.

547
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:55,454
I've stood in front
of thousands of screaming fans,

548
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:58,487
all of 'em creaming their jeans.

549
00:32:58,532 --> 00:32:59,992
Uh...

550
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:01,414
Who are you?

551
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:05,922
A water balloon filled

552
00:33:05,956 --> 00:33:10,876
with blood and meat.

553
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,090
Homelander's gonna find me,
and when he does,

554
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:15,721
he's gonna burst you wide open.

555
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:17,588
I'm gonna make it home
in time for cocktails.

556
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:20,675
'Cause that's who you are,
and that's who I am.

557
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:25,101
You're not the hero
of this story.

558
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:28,902
And I'm not the one

559
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:30,938
who's trapped.

560
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:38,573
Well, good luck.

561
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:40,624
I tried.

562
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Great chat.

563
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:47,374
Run for the hills, Hughie.

564
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:55,690
It looks like we're losing him.

565
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:58,014
The signal's going in and out.

566
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:03,805
Keep searching,

567
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,847
another 50 feet down
on the right.

568
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:42,549
Because,
thanks to Samaritan's Embrace,

569
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,054
Asim has a bed,

570
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,926
a ventilated cooking area,
and a laptop.

571
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:49,774
But our work is not done.
There are millions more children

572
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,440
just like Asim,
who need your help.

573
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,609
For just $9.99 a month.
That is only...

574
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:57,648
Hi, John.
Thanks for your support.

575
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:01,913
It's what makes this republic
so great.

576
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:04,407
Bill. How are the kids?

577
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,080
Hey.

578
00:35:06,118 --> 00:35:08,578
Give
to Samaritan's Embrace today,

579
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,410
and give a child
just like Asim...

580
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:11,956
Could I get a club soda?

581
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:13,669
Ms. Stillwell.

582
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:16,919
Senator, what can I get you?

583
00:35:16,962 --> 00:35:20,422
- Jack, rocks.
- You know, we have Macallan 25.

584
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,046
You'd be wasting it.
Whiskey's whiskey to me.

585
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,600
Boy, they're blowing
so much smoke up Maeve's ass,

586
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:31,189
it's a miracle she doesn't die
of lung cancer.

587
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:35,438
But you know it's just that,
right? Smoke.

588
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,571
- I'm sorry?
- Everyone loves

589
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:41,528
to bask in their glow,
but tomorrow morning

590
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,950
no one's putting Supes
into national defense.

591
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,870
It won't get out of committee,
much less hit the floor.

592
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,670
Because God forbid
we could have an advantage

593
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,043
in an armed conflict.

594
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,830
You send a Supe over
the 38th parallel,

595
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:55,544
Pyongyang's gonna answer
with a nuke.

596
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:57,424
Then one of my guys
will catch it.

597
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:01,011
You see Robertson over there?

598
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:04,298
He's got Lockheed in his state
and in his pocket.

599
00:36:04,343 --> 00:36:09,263
McCrea? He's got Fort Bragg
and its couple thousand voters.

600
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:13,346
No one wants
to outsource to you.

601
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:15,604
America runs on weapons.

602
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:18,016
Hell, it's one of the only
damn things we still make.

603
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:20,225
But you are the chairman.

604
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:21,235
Where do you stand?

605
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:23,106
Me? I'm just an old leatherneck.

606
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:24,783
And if I was on the line,

607
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:28,162
scare the shit out of me
to have Homelander there.

608
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,620
My heroes are the most
loyal, patriotic...

609
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:31,871
That's just it.

610
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:35,962
They're your heroes,
aren't they?

611
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,510
Get him a Macallan 25.

612
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:48,604
Why have average
when you can have extraordinary?

613
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:57,062
Thank you.

614
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:00,395
Guys, we should get
back to the party.

615
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,168
- What?
- Elena just ordered more booze.

616
00:37:02,192 --> 00:37:03,461
- Come on, let's go back.
- No, no...

617
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:04,546
It'll be more fun at the party.

618
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,755
Please... okay, don't touch me.

619
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:07,569
No, please, please.

620
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:10,084
Oh, no, no! Stop!
No, no, no, no!

621
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,197
Please, no, no, no, no!

622
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:13,623
- The girl said no.
- Help.

623
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:15,292
We're all friends here.

624
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,710
Yeah, it's all good.
It's fine.

625
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:29,296
Miss, do me a favor
and shut your eyes.

626
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:32,809
Fucking bitch.

627
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:53,583
Fucking diamond skin.

628
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:56,829
- Fuck.
- Merde!

629
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,125
Here.

630
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,093
Here, take it.

631
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:10,593
What is that?

632
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,846
It will help
with your, uh, anxiety.

633
00:38:12,888 --> 00:38:15,808
It's LSD and MDMA.
This is a candy flip.

634
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:17,269
It'll smooth you right out.
Take it.

635
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:19,559
Uh, thank you, but I-I
don't think now is the time

636
00:38:19,603 --> 00:38:22,363
for a major hallucinogen.

637
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:25,397
Fais-toi plaisir.

638
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:37,196
What are you exactly?

639
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:40,866
Chemist? Engineer? What?

640
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:44,996
No. I know a little
about a lot of things.

641
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:48,795
I'm a gunrunner by trade,
but, uh, as you can see,

642
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,630
I've developed a certain niche.

643
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,216
Killing superheroes?

644
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:54,561
No.

645
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:57,676
You can count on one hand
the number of dead superheroes.

646
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,734
Sometimes you can, uh,
incapacitate them.

647
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:06,864
Truly, they are
magnificent creatures.

648
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,190
Mm.

649
00:39:09,236 --> 00:39:12,276
Each one with a unique power
that requires a unique solution.

650
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:15,952
It's, uh...
it's never the same twice.

651
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:17,703
Who pays you to do that?

652
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:20,044
Whoever can pay.

653
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:25,632
And when you do kill a Supe...

654
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,959
or, you know, any-anyone...

655
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:31,835
um... what's it like?

656
00:39:38,473 --> 00:39:41,643
You know...

657
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:44,725
I saw this woman once,
in a midtown elevator,

658
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:47,691
2008.

659
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,403
No more for ten seconds,
I see her, huh?

660
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:52,454
Stunning.

661
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:54,107
Five-nine.

662
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:58,787
Hair so black it absorbed
the light, you know?

663
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:02,367
Tom Ford pencil skirt,
Louboutin stilettos.

664
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:03,964
C'est magnifique.

665
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,339
But she had,

666
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:08,956
uh... she had...

667
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:11,974
I never forget this, you see...

668
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:14,797
she had dirt
under her fingernails

669
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:17,803
and callouses on her hands,
and I see this and I say, "Oh,

670
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:20,346
strange for such a refined woman
like this."

671
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,600
What, you...

672
00:40:21,642 --> 00:40:22,642
You a gardener?

673
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:23,745
You know, are you a sculptor?

674
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,649
What is this, huh?

675
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:29,357
And I think about this...

676
00:40:32,986 --> 00:40:35,156
I think about her all the time.

677
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:39,661
She was the first person
I ever killed.

678
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:45,709
I carry...

679
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:48,999
I carry them all with me.

680
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:52,924
It's like scars in a way,
you know?

681
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,770
Okay, Senator, you ready?

682
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,478
Oh, yeah.

683
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:08,358
Oh. Oh, darling.

684
00:41:08,397 --> 00:41:10,647
- Mm-hmm?
- You know I like to watch.

685
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:13,281
No. Can't always be in control.

686
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:16,068
Sir.

687
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:19,033
Then I guess I'll just have
to feel my way through it.

688
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:22,084
Oh, you'll feel
good indeed, baby.

689
00:41:27,374 --> 00:41:30,254
- You ready?
- Oh, I was born ready.

690
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:33,713
- Mm-hmm.
- Feels like butter, baby.

691
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:35,125
Get ready, sir.

692
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:37,223
You're going in.

693
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:38,719
Yee-haw!

694
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,350
Giddyup, gal. Come on.

695
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:41,467
Oh, God.

696
00:41:41,513 --> 00:41:44,063
That-that feels different.

697
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:59,489
Hey...

698
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:01,371
Homelander.

699
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:03,788
Starlight.

700
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:05,827
How are you?

701
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:10,582
Uh, I'm good.

702
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,165
Good.

703
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:17,011
Hey, is that your, uh,
secret identity?

704
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:19,888
- Mm-hmm.
- Charming.

705
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:21,086
Thanks.

706
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:24,426
Yeah, I-I gave up on mine...

707
00:42:24,473 --> 00:42:28,193
oh... a long time ago now.

708
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:31,307
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

709
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:35,106
Good night.

710
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:47,906
No. No, I did not

711
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:50,714
go through eight rounds of IVF

712
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:53,459
and bleeding nipples
to quit now.

713
00:42:53,502 --> 00:42:56,592
I am doing this. Yes.

714
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,220
That little kid is gonna drink
my goddamn milk

715
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,007
if it's the last thing I do.

716
00:43:25,075 --> 00:43:28,075
While scientists
now believe the shell evolved

717
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,499
to help turtles burrow
underground...

718
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:47,259
What are you doing?

719
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,465
Shocking our invisible friend.

720
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:51,976
I need him unconscious.

721
00:43:52,018 --> 00:43:53,438
Why?

722
00:43:55,105 --> 00:43:56,725
Because I got it.

723
00:43:58,191 --> 00:43:59,941
Now what the fuck do you want?

724
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:06,282
What the fuck, Starlight?!

725
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:07,994
What?

726
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:15,455
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

727
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,880
Oh, shit.

728
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:18,748
And so glad you did it
in plain clothes,

729
00:44:18,795 --> 00:44:20,795
so you could blow
your secret identity.

730
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,299
Here: "OMG. I recognize
Starlight, that's Annie January!

731
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:26,933
"I went to Hoover High with her.

732
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,680
# SheWasBulimic."

733
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,899
One, this was stupid.

734
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:39,146
Two, it was really stupid
to do it on camera.

735
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,900
Always look for cameras.

736
00:44:40,942 --> 00:44:43,282
- They were about to rape a girl.
- What girl?

737
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,200
There's no girl in that video.
You get a name?

738
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:46,358
No, she ran off.

739
00:44:46,406 --> 00:44:48,156
Oh, great. She ran off. Great.

740
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:50,739
Always get a fucking name,
Starlight. Always!

741
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:52,495
Well, uh...
They-they said... Hmm.

742
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:55,327
They-they said she was a friend.

743
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:56,753
It was date rape, I think.

744
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,791
Great.
Well, she hasn't come forward

745
00:44:58,835 --> 00:45:00,625
and, statistically,
she's not likely to.

746
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,130
So all we really have
is two Delta Betas

747
00:45:03,173 --> 00:45:05,223
who insist they were just
getting drunk in an alley

748
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:08,138
until you beat them unconscious.

749
00:45:08,178 --> 00:45:09,928
They're lying! I, uh...

750
00:45:09,971 --> 00:45:12,681
Aren't I innocent
until proven guilty?

751
00:45:12,724 --> 00:45:15,564
When you're in the big leagues?
You flip it.

752
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:20,875
I don't know what you were
planning on doing today, hmm,

753
00:45:20,899 --> 00:45:22,979
with your little... cute day,

754
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:24,816
but you have to cancel
everything, okay?

755
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:26,339
You're gonna have meetings
with Risk Assessment,

756
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:28,623
with Crisis Management,
with Legal.

757
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:31,527
Jerry is gonna lose his shit!

758
00:45:31,576 --> 00:45:33,236
Fuck.

759
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:35,246
Am...

760
00:45:36,665 --> 00:45:38,455
Are they gonna fire me?

761
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,800
Just be in Stillwell's office
at 10:00.

762
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:43,506
What?

763
00:45:43,546 --> 00:45:45,586
Am I fired?

764
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:48,842
Senator, I very much appreciate
you coming bright and early.

765
00:45:48,885 --> 00:45:53,005
I realize, uh,
how busy you were last night.

766
00:46:01,147 --> 00:46:03,227
These... are fake.

767
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:05,034
I think we both know
they're not.

768
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,200
Look. I was with a young woman,
all right?

769
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,740
Of legal age.

770
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:13,123
Her name was Rhonda.

771
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:15,659
So this isn't possible.

772
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:18,124
They've... obviously
been doctored or something.

773
00:46:18,164 --> 00:46:19,874
I'm sorry, they are authentic.

774
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:22,206
I should know. I was there.

775
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:24,002
You what?

776
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,262
You shiver when you orgasm, sir.

777
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:34,934
Oh, Jesus.

778
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:39,141
That will be all, Doppelganger.

779
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:41,185
Who the fuck is he?

780
00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:43,149
Anyway, I would love to continue

781
00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:46,189
our conversation
from last night.

782
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:49,364
This is some dirty fucking pool,
Madelyn.

783
00:46:49,404 --> 00:46:52,074
You're really gonna clutch
your pearls, Senator?

784
00:46:52,115 --> 00:46:55,945
I don't think either one of us
is that naive.

785
00:46:55,994 --> 00:46:58,334
Yeah. It's not...

786
00:46:58,371 --> 00:47:01,461
it's not fatal to be...
homosexual these days.

787
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:03,539
It is in Oklahoma, sir.

788
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:05,585
Where your voters live.

789
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,915
Even if I get the bill
out of committee,

790
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:12,586
nobody's gonna vote for it
on the floor.

791
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:15,635
No one wants your fucking Supes
in the Army.

792
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,680
We'll see.

793
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:24,147
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

794
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:31,027
Homelander.

795
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,121
Uh...
wel-welcome to Crime Analytics.

796
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:35,760
Can... Would you like a Red Bull?

797
00:47:35,784 --> 00:47:37,244
Have you found Translucent yet?

798
00:47:37,285 --> 00:47:39,785
Oh. Uh, no.
But Security's on it.

799
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:43,829
He's been missing over 24 hours.

800
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,285
- Is he in danger?
- Um...

801
00:47:46,336 --> 00:47:48,336
Do... you even know?

802
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:51,930
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

803
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:53,360
What's his last known position,
please?

804
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:55,474
Why don't I just call
Ms. Stillwell?

805
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:57,062
- And I...
- No.

806
00:47:57,097 --> 00:47:58,347
No, no, no, no, no.

807
00:47:58,389 --> 00:47:59,639
You're talking to me.

808
00:47:59,682 --> 00:48:02,482
Well, I'm not sure

809
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,309
I'm supposed to be talking to...

810
00:48:04,354 --> 00:48:06,654
What's your name?

811
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:07,859
- Anika.
- Anika.

812
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:08,979
Sir.

813
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:10,185
It's a beautiful name.

814
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:13,237
Listen, Anika.

815
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:15,369
- I'm the Homelander.
- Mm-hmm.

816
00:48:15,406 --> 00:48:18,276
And I can do whatever
the fuck I want.

817
00:48:18,326 --> 00:48:20,536
Okay?

818
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:22,288
Now...

819
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,960
Translucent's last known
position.

820
00:48:27,377 --> 00:48:29,377
Please.

821
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:39,562
What the...?

822
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:40,557
Something doesn't feel right.

823
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:41,888
Oh, I'll bet.

824
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:43,483
I'm not ashamed to admit

825
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:45,518
I have outdone myself.

826
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:51,477
Now, the problem is
the skin, no?

827
00:48:51,526 --> 00:48:53,566
It's, uh, hard like diamonds.

828
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:56,871
But then I realized, it is just
your shell that is hard, huh?

829
00:48:56,906 --> 00:48:59,366
Like a turtle.

830
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:01,199
But your insides...

831
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:03,624
they're like the rest of ours...

832
00:49:03,663 --> 00:49:05,043
soft.

833
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:08,291
So, how do you get to the...
squishy insides?

834
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:09,544
Through the mouth? Non.

835
00:49:09,586 --> 00:49:12,376
The stomach acid,
the gag reflex.

836
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:16,932
If I stick something down your
throat, you may vomit it up.

837
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:20,141
There's truly only one way...

838
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,470
The fuck did you do to me?

839
00:49:22,515 --> 00:49:26,265
He stuck a lump of plastique
up your bum, son.

840
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:28,651
Ass bomb.

841
00:49:30,148 --> 00:49:32,148
Oh, my God.

842
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,236
Now...

843
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,030
you stick a little finger up
there and try and fish it out...

844
00:49:41,075 --> 00:49:43,405
bang.

845
00:49:43,453 --> 00:49:46,793
I trigger this... also bang.

846
00:49:46,831 --> 00:49:48,211
Savvy?

847
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:51,169
Oh, please don't kill me.

848
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:52,841
I'll do anything.

849
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:56,589
I'll tell you about A-Train.

850
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:58,263
That's what the kid wants,
right?

851
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:00,801
I-I-I-I don't know
where A-Train was going

852
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:02,175
that night he killed the girl,

853
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:04,062
okay, but I know
where he was coming from.

854
00:50:04,098 --> 00:50:05,228
What? Where?

855
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:06,886
Popclaw's.

856
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:09,345
He fucking... loves her.

857
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:11,123
He doesn't think anyone else
knows, but I know.

858
00:50:11,147 --> 00:50:12,317
I know a lot of things.

859
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:13,897
But he-he's there every night.

860
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:16,242
Maybe... now, even.

861
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:17,546
Popclaw?
That's the hero with the...

862
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,490
the sharp things
coming out of her arms.

863
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,030
Yeah. Real D-lister.

864
00:50:21,074 --> 00:50:23,124
Anyone knows what A-Train
was doing, it's Popclaw.

865
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,539
But that's all I know
about that, I swear to Christ.

866
00:50:25,578 --> 00:50:27,828
But I'll tell you
anything else you want.

867
00:50:27,872 --> 00:50:29,922
Just ask.

868
00:50:34,754 --> 00:50:36,424
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

869
00:50:36,464 --> 00:50:39,434
Just... ask anything.

870
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:43,547
Now, normally, that would be
just what the doctor ordered.

871
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:46,806
But unfortunately... for you...

872
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:48,689
we're out of time.

873
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:50,476
No.

874
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,690
No!

875
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:53,899
Please! Listen, I know shit.

876
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,030
Dark shit!
All the way to the top!

877
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:58,128
Wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no!
Please, wait, wait, wait.

878
00:50:58,152 --> 00:51:00,112
Listen, I can help you.
I'm fucking invisible!

879
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:01,632
- We can be a team.
- Butcher!

880
00:51:01,656 --> 00:51:03,050
No, please, please, please!
Please, I can...

881
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:04,784
A moment, s'il vous plait.

882
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:10,122
Here.

883
00:51:11,624 --> 00:51:12,634
What is that?

884
00:51:14,377 --> 00:51:15,797
Homelander.

885
00:51:15,837 --> 00:51:18,087
That's Homelander?

886
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:20,171
Homelander's here? Oh, shit.

887
00:51:20,216 --> 00:51:21,926
Oh, shit!

888
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:25,349
He could see us.

889
00:51:25,388 --> 00:51:27,616
He's got X-ray vision. He can
see through the fucking roof.

890
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,640
And super fucking hearing.

891
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:32,484
You pull that detonator,
he will hear.

892
00:51:38,985 --> 00:51:41,395
Homelander.

893
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,696
We got to throw him
off the scent.

894
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,700
But how?

895
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:47,081
Pittsburgh.

896
00:51:47,118 --> 00:51:48,948
Oh, you cannot be serious, huh?

897
00:51:48,995 --> 00:51:50,995
Deadly.

898
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,459
You know how much
this will cost me?

899
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:55,079
Put it on the tab.

900
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,641
Guys?!

901
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:14,653
Where is it?

902
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:16,607
Back door panel.

903
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:26,967
Look, the mall shooting's a tragedy.

904
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:28,671
I'm just saying,
if more people were armed,

905
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:31,201
maybe I wouldn't have
to save the day every time.

906
00:52:31,245 --> 00:52:32,598
- So, in a situation...
- Hello?

907
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:33,582
Cherie.

908
00:52:33,623 --> 00:52:34,583
It's a burn.

909
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:36,254
You're joking.

910
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,592
Now?

911
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:38,667
No joke, I'm afraid.

912
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:43,756
Fine.

913
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,470
I'll be ready in three.

914
00:52:48,763 --> 00:52:50,263
Come on.

915
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:51,825
Frenchie, I'm getting
shit reception here.

916
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:53,169
Well, figure it the fuck out,
huh?

917
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:58,647
Come on.

918
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Evening.

919
00:53:33,224 --> 00:53:34,814
Holy shit.

920
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:36,191
You're the Homelander.

921
00:53:36,227 --> 00:53:37,413
I am talking to the Homelander.

922
00:53:37,437 --> 00:53:38,477
Mm-hmm.

923
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:40,361
Sir, I need to see some ID.

924
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:44,318
Get the fuck back in that cage.

925
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,650
Just take it easy. Okay?

926
00:53:46,696 --> 00:53:48,276
You doing out here?

927
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:50,242
This is my place.

928
00:53:50,283 --> 00:53:53,623
We... I'm, uh...
I'm opening a Fogo de Chao.

929
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:55,661
You know what a churrascaria is?

930
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:57,575
Yeah.
It's a Brazilian steakhouse.

931
00:53:57,623 --> 00:54:00,883
Sir, I need to see
in the back of the van.

932
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:03,458
No offense, you got a...
warrant or something?

933
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:07,375
Well, if you got nothing
back there,

934
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:09,105
then you got nothing
to worry about, right?

935
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,390
Please get back in the cage.

936
00:54:17,477 --> 00:54:19,397
I'm not getting back
in that cage, man.

937
00:54:19,437 --> 00:54:21,147
I do, I am dead.

938
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:24,479
Yeah, well, if you don't...
you're dead.

939
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:50,719
Just think.

940
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,350
You kill me,

941
00:54:52,386 --> 00:54:56,216
they'll never stop
looking for you.

942
00:54:56,265 --> 00:54:59,805
You'll be glancing over
your shoulder your whole life

943
00:54:59,852 --> 00:55:02,272
till they find you,
which they will.

944
00:55:15,952 --> 00:55:17,352
Everything all right, sir?

945
00:55:38,432 --> 00:55:41,482
Look, you let me go...

946
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,899
you'll be the hero
that saved Translucent.

947
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,320
It's not too late.

948
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,109
You can still go home.

949
00:55:51,153 --> 00:55:54,283
Back to your life.

950
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,829
Attaboy.
