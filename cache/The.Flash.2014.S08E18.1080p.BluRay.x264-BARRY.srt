1
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:05,089
<i>To understand
what I'm about to tell you,</i>

2
00:00:05,465 --> 00:00:07,467
<i>there is something
you need to remember.</i>

3
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:11,221
<i>In every atom,
there is a perfect balance</i>

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,806
<i>of protons and electrons.</i>

5
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:18,436
<i>But it's those negative particles
that let an atom grow.</i>

6
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,232
<i>My name is Dr. Meena Dhawan,</i>

7
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:27,820
<i>and for the next three minutes and
52 seconds, I'm the fastest woman alive.</i>

8
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,451
Oh. My. Gosh.

9
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:37,705
Did you see that?
I just hit 300 meters per second.

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,229
<i>It's your best time yet.</i>

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,875
<i>Now let's see if you can keep up.</i>

12
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,586
Come on.

13
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:46,255
Come on, Meena.

14
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,896
I'm so sorry. What just happened?

15
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,898
You created
your own lightning bolt again.

16
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:06,693
Something I couldn't do for months
when I first got my speed.

17
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:07,860
I didn't mean to do it.

18
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:11,322
I was just frustrated I couldn't
catch up, and then it just happened.

19
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:15,886
I've never seen artificial lightning

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,037
interact with organic lightning
like this before.

21
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,875
Okay, that's disturbing.

22
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,503
We should go over your biometrics,

23
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,755
make sure everything else
is within normal parameters.

24
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,172
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,843
I... I can't,
I have to head back to the lab.

26
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,179
My speed is running out.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,849
Okay, tomorrow 10:00 a.m.

28
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,755
Hi, I just need to...

29
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,423
make a little deposit.

30
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,009
It's in here somewhere.

31
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,678
I have this new client
who decides to pay me in cash.

32
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,556
What year is it?

33
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,142
Oh! Got it. There we go.

34
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,393
All right.

35
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:24,812
Everybody, on the ground!

36
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,105
Get down!

37
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,899
Move!

38
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,483
Get down!

39
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,403
You. Cash in the bag.

40
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,087
Don't even think about
hitting the alarm.

41
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,870
Hey, teacup! You trying to be a hero?

42
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,708
Are you for real?

43
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,211
Get down, lady!

44
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,148
What part of "Get down on the ground"
don't you understand? Let's go!

45
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,518
If you don't get on the ground,
I swear to God...

46
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:05,561
Three...

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Two...

48
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:08,605
One.

49
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,448
No.

50
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,501
What am I doing here?

51
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,880
I should have been an engineer.

52
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,009
I just wanna go home. No voodoo, please.

53
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,093
No voodoo.

54
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,225
C.C.P.D.!

55
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,310
Stay where you are!

56
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,370
Fiery Francis Sumner,

57
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,206
Cecile, according to Gideon,

58
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,334
your empathic capacity's up 1,000%.

59
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,087
Your brain just got supercharged.

60
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:18,926
Usually when I sense a wave of fear
and panic, it just hits me like a train.

61
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,303
Like when we fought Blockbuster.

62
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,847
Exactly. Except this time
when my powers kicked in,

63
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,725
I barely broke a sweat.

64
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,394
Which is all very badass.

65
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,315
But is anyone else wondering
how the heck this happened?

66
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,775
Well, I mean, I don't know.

67
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:37,361
My powers have changed before,
like when Jenna was born.

68
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,072
Maybe it's just natural.

69
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,201
It's possible,
but let's run some more tests

70
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,702
just to make sure.

71
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,997
- Barry.
- Hmm.

72
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,834
I can feel a massive wave of concern
wash over you.

73
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,213
You're worried about something.
It's way more than just me.

74
00:04:56,798 --> 00:05:01,385
It's the new speedster I'm training,
Meena Dhawan.

75
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:06,182
During our last training session, I got
struck by her artificial lightning.

76
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,809
Now, it was an accident.

77
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,853
But when it hit me,
it collided with my lightning

78
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:14,106
and it set off some kind
of a bio-kinetic chemical reaction.

79
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,903
Okay. Accidental attacks.
Artificial speed...

80
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,280
Is she about to go all Spock, Flash?

81
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,740
No, I don't think so.

82
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:26,285
I mean, Meena did find a way to generate
her own speed source artificially,

83
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,454
but it's not affecting her
like it did me.

84
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,206
I mean, her emotions seemed fine.

85
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,208
So it's just her powers that are funky.

86
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,002
Maybe you should fathwoom
over to Fast Track Labs,

87
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,337
take a peek at that generator.

88
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,840
<i>See how her speed machine
really works.</i>

89
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,763
- Barry Allen.
- Yeah.

90
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,014
Sorry to keep you waiting.

91
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,099
No, no.

92
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,016
How can I help you?

93
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:55,357
Yeah, actually, I am here
on behalf of a mutual friend.

94
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,110
Who likes to run... fast.

95
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,196
- Oh.
- Yes.

96
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:07,910
Our friend was hoping I could take
a look at your, um, special project.

97
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:11,706
He thinks it'd be a good idea
to get a second set of eyes on this

98
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,208
just to make sure everything is safe.

99
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,503
I understand.

100
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,299
And he's right.

101
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,802
I could use another scientific eye
on all this right now.

102
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,512
- Okay.
- Follow me.

103
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,596
Yeah.

104
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,979
There she is, my pride and joy.

105
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,147
Wow.

106
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,525
Is that an oscillation chamber?

107
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:44,322
It's a Biometric Lightning
Oscillation Chamber, technically.

108
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,740
We call it the B.L.O.C.

109
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,451
It's filled with quantum computing
to remotely harness lightning

110
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,894
from the Earth's upper atmosphere,

111
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,581
and turn it into artificial speed.

112
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,877
This equipment is decades ahead
of any other lab.

113
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,464
Oh, including yours, I hope?

114
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,967
But I can't take full credit
for all this innovation.

115
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,386
Sure, I can handle the physics,

116
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,015
but my colleague is more familiar
with the nuts and bolts.

117
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:14,602
Ah, there he is.

118
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:29,325
Barry Allen, meet the man
who built this machine.

119
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,996
Eobard Thawne. Nice to meet you,
Barry Allen.

120
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,633
Eobard Thawne.

121
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:48,594
Nice to meet you, Barry Allen.

122
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,227
Thawne...

123
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,981
I'm chief of engineering here
at Fast Track Laboratories.

124
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,651
Eobard here is our only employee
who knows the truth about this project

125
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:09,156
while I'm still perfecting it,
and Barry here is a friend of the Flash.

126
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,075
Really?

127
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,244
Yeah. You know the Flash, don't you?

128
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,831
- No. I...
- Do...

129
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,041
You two, have you met before?

130
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,923
- Go to hell!
- You're taking both of us there!

131
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,093
Now who's the villain, Flash?

132
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,220
Now who's the villain?

133
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,349
No. I don't think so.

134
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:39,395
Uh, but my memory is a little hazy.

135
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,107
Eobard suffers from a rare form
of retrograde amnesia.

136
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:44,691
You're kidding?

137
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:48,654
I just I have trouble accessing memories
connected to my personal life.

138
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,367
You know, anything over a year ago,
all I get are occasional flashes.

139
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,597
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:58,038
Hey, Avery.

141
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,631
I'm supposed to believe
you don't remember who you are.

142
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:13,179
Or where you're from.
What the hell are you doing here?

143
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,181
Why did you build this thing?

144
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,601
Because Meena asked me to.

145
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,247
Her lightning is like nothing
I've ever seen before.

146
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,898
I guess that's your doing, isn't it?

147
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,317
I assure you,
the B.L.O.C is perfectly safe...

148
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
But you aren't.

149
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:30,488
What he hell do you want from me?

150
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,283
I'm sorry. I have no idea why you're
so upset with somebody you just met.

151
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,493
Stop. Stop!

152
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,580
I've known you all my life.

153
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,209
You're the Reverse-Flash.

154
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:44,877
Look, Allen,

155
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,881
I have no idea what you're talking about

156
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,841
or why you think I'm
a murderous speedster...

157
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:51,926
Because you are.

158
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,719
No, I'm not.

159
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,974
Now, if you don't mind,
I have work to do.

160
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,485
Chester, has A.R.G.U.S. posted
any security alerts?

161
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,028
Uh...

162
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,612
No.

163
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,491
Is everything okay, boss?

164
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,120
- No. I just saw Thawne.
- What? How did he escape?

165
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,223
I don't know,
but he's using his original face again,

166
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,087
the one he had
before he killed Harrison Wells.

167
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,351
Okay, how is that even possible?

168
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,752
And how the frak did he end up
working at Fast Track Labs?

169
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,879
I don't know that either,
but I'm going to find out.

170
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,635
I can't hire you, Mr. Thawne.
This resume is a joke.

171
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,220
Well, nobody's perfect.

172
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,223
Wow.

173
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,517
You really are something.

174
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,436
Even after the 11 other interviews
I had today,

175
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,858
I'm starting to think that all this
is just like a huge waste of time.

176
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,652
I mean, seriously?

177
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,404
You call this a resume?

178
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,324
Am I boring you?

179
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:04,039
When calculating quantum static
and genetic speed,

180
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,877
you have to account for the tachyons.

181
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,805
I have been working on this for months.

182
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,808
No one's even come close.

183
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,269
Well, the other candidates were idiots.

184
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:27,396
I'm not.

185
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:31,275
Which is how I can tell
you're trying to create a speedster.

186
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,821
I can help.

187
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,546
How are you still here?

188
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,718
Well, I want to see how this ends.

189
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,094
Don't screw with me.

190
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,930
How'd you get your speed back?

191
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,848
I didn't.

192
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,267
Stop lying! I saw you.

193
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:08,562
Five minutes ago, a thousand miles
from here, wearing your original face,

194
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,148
pretending you didn't remember me.
So who is he?

195
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,275
A version of you from your past?

196
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,487
Answer me!

197
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,613
I don't know.

198
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,615
And I don't care.

199
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,242
Don't you get it?

200
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,286
You took my speed.

201
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,747
There's no other versions of me
out there.

202
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,791
No other tricks up my sleeve.

203
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,834
You took everything from me.

204
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,754
So why don't you just leave me alone?

205
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,968
When you were nearly erased
during Armageddon.

206
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,887
It erased your past, didn't it?

207
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,683
Which means he must be
from another timeline.

208
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,978
Like when I created Flashpoint,
there was another Thawne.

209
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,480
- I need you to kill my mother.
- With pleasure.

210
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,275
<i>The only way to fix things
was to let him go.</i>

211
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:55,775
<i>He fought with the Legends.</i>

212
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,296
<i>He tried to keep himself
from getting erased.</i>

213
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,029
<i>But Black Flash caught up to him.</i>

214
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,535
I guess he didn't finish the job.
Here's a suggestion.

215
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,787
Why don't go you bother him?

216
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,048
The other Thawne built this.
Does that mean anything to you?

217
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,051
He didn't build that. That's mine.

218
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,305
That's my Biometric
Lightning Oscillation Chamber

219
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,349
that I built two centuries from now
when I was a younger man

220
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,685
to see if I could become
a speedster like you.

221
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,269
It worked.

222
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,688
But not the way I intended.

223
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,774
<i>Has it tapped into
the Negative Speed Force?</i>

224
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,154
That's why Meena's powers
are so erratic.

225
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,490
They're not artificial.
They're negative.

226
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,175
I've seen what
that kind of force can do.

227
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,162
- Who's Meena?
- Dr. Meena Dhawan.

228
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,514
She's the one that's using the B.L.O.C.

229
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,873
Never heard of her.

230
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,125
And guess what? Neither has history.

231
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,588
So I guess your new adversary, you make
sure that this Dr. Meena Dhawan...

232
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,631
never sees the future.

233
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,925
Because if she keeps using that device,

234
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,596
the Negative Speed Force will start
to alter her personality,

235
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,015
it'll destroy her.

236
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,266
Not "if."

237
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,434
"When."

238
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:16,023
There's one thing you should know
about us Thawnes, Allen.

239
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:20,778
No matter when we exist,
no matter what our memories are,

240
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,281
we only look out for ourselves.

241
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,618
So whatever this new guy's endgame...

242
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,957
he'll sacrifice every pawn on the board
to get what he wants.

243
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,043
Not if I stop him
before he has a chance.

244
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,382
Well.

245
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,430
Just when I thought this day
couldn't get any more interesting.

246
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,850
Oh, John,

247
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,353
you can come out now.

248
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,910
It's been a long time.

249
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,586
Last time I saw you, you were still
pretending you needed a wheelchair.

250
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:20,003
Last time I saw you, your friend
Oliver Queen was still alive.

251
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,801
What do you want, John?

252
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:30,889
For the past two years, I've covered
every corner of this Earth.

253
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,062
And I still can't get
this damn thing to open up again.

254
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,776
But I believe you can.

255
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:48,240
<i>This cube fell out of the sky
and dropped into my lap.</i>

256
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,410
<i>Before I could see what was inside,
it shut itself.</i>

257
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,621
<i>I've had friends examine
every inch of it.</i>

258
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:55,956
I can't get it open.

259
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,585
Damn it. Got that same line
from A.R.G.U.S.

260
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,004
And all they could tell me
is that its...

261
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:07,342
knowledge is beyond
any current human understanding,

262
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,761
and that it can transport matter.

263
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,264
So when I heard from Lyla
you were here, I...

264
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,559
You thought some
23rd century ingenuity might help.

265
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,018
Good call.

266
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,063
Why not just have Lyla
give it to me herself?

267
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,401
I see. Trouble in Paradise.

268
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,738
Trying to open this box...

269
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,211
I had to spend
a lot of time away from home.

270
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Away from my kids.

271
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,164
But you just can't leave
the box behind, can you?

272
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,209
Even when this thing is away from me,

273
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:45,172
I can still feel it in my mind,
it's pulling me closer.

274
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,222
And the more I fight it,
the louder I hear its call,

275
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,505
but I have to know what it is.

276
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,310
I have to know what
these damn voices want from me.

277
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,102
Well.

278
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,981
You've come to the right place.

279
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,817
I've seen transmatter technology
like that before

280
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:11,490
forged at the Orrery of Worlds with
the power to travel across realities.

281
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:16,411
So, yeah,
I'll help you on one condition,

282
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,457
that when you open up that box again,
John,

283
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,170
I get to see what's inside.

284
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,317
<i>Chester,
I'm heading back to Central City.</i>

285
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,302
<i>I need you to find out who's
still inside Fast Track Labs.</i>

286
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,943
Pretty cleared out
for the night,

287
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,683
just two heat signatures inside.

288
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:38,976
Meena and Thawne.

289
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:40,769
What's the 411, boss?

290
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,288
I think
it's the Thawne from Flashpoint.

291
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,992
Now he's pumping Meena
with negative speed.

292
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,984
- If you need backup...
- No, it's too dangerous.

293
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,666
I don't know why he's doing this,
but I won't let anyone get hurt.

294
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,239
Artificial speed saturation at zero.

295
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,117
- Ready for infusion.
- Doc,

296
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,996
you set the oscillation levels
at 52 million joules,

297
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,873
that is more speed
than you have ever absorbed before.

298
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,335
Are you sure the Flash
would want you to do this?

299
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,337
He's why I'm doing this.

300
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,173
I hurt him this morning
when my speed started to run out.

301
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,010
I need to make it last longer.

302
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,349
Powering the chamber.

303
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,437
Activating electrostatic fins...

304
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,817
Ready for biometric absorption.

305
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,237
Meena, stop!

306
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,745
Flash. What are you doing here?

307
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:44,249
Flash, I know what happened today,
and I know how to fix it.

308
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,626
No, you don't.

309
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,044
I know why you attacked me.

310
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:50,438
It's because your speed is connected
to the Negative Speed Force.

311
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,301
It's an extra dimensional power source
fueled by rage and hate.

312
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,012
The B.L.O.C is fueled by lightning
from the upper atmosphere.

313
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,222
We've run the numbers a thousand times.

314
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,225
Then your math's wrong
or you're a damn liar.

315
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,103
Eobard. What is he talking about?

316
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,064
I'm talking about who he really is.

317
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,567
The Eobard Thawne that I know,
no matter what body he's in

318
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,945
or what timeline he comes from,
he's always the same person.

319
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,864
<i>A psychotic murderer...</i>

320
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,115
Please don't hurt me.

321
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,825
<i>...known as the Reverse-Flash.</i>

322
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,619
No!

323
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,205
I didn't do anything to you
or anyone else.

324
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,498
Why can't you understand that?

325
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,975
I'm done listening to you.

326
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,126
Whatever you're trying to do to her,
it ends now.

327
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,586
You're making a huge mistake.

328
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,481
No, I'm taking you to Iron Heights,

329
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,705
which is letting you off easy.

330
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,509
Leave him alone!

331
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:37,635
Meena, don't!

332
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,514
Oh, no.

333
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,683
Her brainwaves are altering,
it's too much power.

334
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,345
Speed.

335
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,099
Need... more...

336
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,394
speed.

337
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,299
Time to get faster.

338
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,773
These cubes appear to people
at a crossroads, at a...

339
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,150
turning point in their lives.

340
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,753
So when the cube first opened,
what was going through your mind?

341
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,822
I had just buried Oliver.

342
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,701
We were moving the kids to Metropolis.

343
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,803
You were starting a new life.

344
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,139
You were in control of your destiny
for the first time in years.

345
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,708
That is why the cube chose you
for that sense of purpose.

346
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,337
Then why did it close?

347
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,631
Because you weren't ready
to accept its power yet.

348
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,301
But really,
the only question, John, is...

349
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:43,845
are you ready now?

350
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,562
- I am.
- Good.

351
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,399
Then put yourself
in that head space again.

352
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:59,528
Close your eyes,

353
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,240
think of what your future could be.

354
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:09,788
All the light you could bring
into this world.

355
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,338
All the cosmic odysseys that await.

356
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,802
<i>No one can know my secret.</i>

357
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,805
<i>You don't come between
those folks and their gold.</i>

358
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,432
<i>Sir, we are quite sure
you will bring them back to justice.</i>

359
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:30,968
<i>Look at them all.</i>

360
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,062
<i>All those lives you can lead.</i>

361
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,690
Do it, John, do it.

362
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,526
Drink of the Bleed Mandrakk hid
within the cube,

363
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,195
feel its power break through
the source wall,

364
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,155
for when you break through that wall,

365
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,992
all those worlds that await
will be yours.

366
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,913
<i>This universe
is far bigger than any of us...</i>

367
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,500
<i>I couldn't dare imagine.</i>

368
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:03,924
No.

369
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,551
I don't want this.

370
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:08,305
I don't want any of this!

371
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,474
Do you hear me? The answer is no!

372
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,481
No, no!

373
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,985
What have you done?
Do you know what you've done?

374
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:23,945
I do.

375
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,115
I finally do.

376
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,370
I saw a thousand lives I could lead.

377
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,792
But not one of them
led me back to my family.

378
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,172
I was meant to see inside that cube!

379
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,883
To find a way out of this hell hole!

380
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,803
I guess it's a good thing
the cube didn't choose you.

381
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,101
You're not special.

382
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,814
You're not someone important.

383
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,901
This was your last chance
to be someone powerful.

384
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,154
But I am...

385
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,446
someone special.

386
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,284
Now I realize

387
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,622
the cube was trying
to make me someone else,

388
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,208
something else.

389
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,421
And it even tricked me into believing
that somehow

390
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,383
I wanted it to, but...

391
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,343
I don't.

392
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,724
Because there is no power
in the universe

393
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,812
more powerful than the love
I have for my family.

394
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,023
Sweetie.

395
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,160
But I suppose a man like you
wouldn't understand that.

396
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:01,334
Because if it came down to a choice
between some cosmic destiny or

397
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,254
being a father,

398
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,213
a husband...

399
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,011
there's really no choice at all.

400
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,575
Hey, Lyla. Hey, baby, no, no.

401
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,202
I didn't see Barry this time.
I think he has a lot on his plate.

402
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,665
Yeah, you're right.
We do have a lot to talk about.

403
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,418
But I'm coming home.

404
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,860
Chester, Meena's negative lightning
pulses cancelled out my speed again,

405
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,737
just like this morning.

406
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,821
Chester?

407
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,072
Meena.

408
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,743
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

409
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,621
This is what you wanted
all along, isn't it?

410
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,716
For the Negative Speed Force
to corrupt her.

411
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,124
Why would I want that?

412
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:28,546
I didn't even know the Negative
Speed Force existed before today!

413
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,259
She protected you from me.

414
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,301
Why would she do that?

415
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,720
Because she loves me!

416
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,763
You idiot!

417
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:40,683
And I love her.

418
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,896
More than anything.

419
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,566
When I lost my memories,

420
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,319
I had a singular focus in my life.

421
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,948
Somehow, some way,
I was going to be a speedster.

422
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,074
And then I met Meena.

423
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,496
Everything changed.

424
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:07,210
I know this sounds strange, but
I think I'm supposed to be a speedster.

425
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,772
I think that's why,
despite all the holes in my brain,

426
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,340
I can see the B.L.O.C crystal clear.

427
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,633
I think I'm meant to use it.

428
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:18,930
So you you want to be
like Flash, be a superhero?

429
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,307
I want to be bigger than a superhero.

430
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,768
I want to recharge power grids.

431
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:27,856
I want to reverse tornadoes
before they destroy cities and towns.

432
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,691
I want to end famine, end war.

433
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,318
I want to save the world.

434
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,905
<i>But it wasn't meant to be.</i>

435
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,324
<i>I had already fallen in love with Meena</i>

436
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,327
<i>when we discovered her machine
could only work for one person.</i>

437
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:42,954
This isn't right.

438
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,166
<i>But that wasn't the worst part.</i>

439
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,918
<i>Meena had a heart condition.</i>

440
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:53,423
<i>And one night,
she went into cardiac arrest.</i>

441
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,050
Meena, no!

442
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,054
<i>There was only one way to save her.</i>

443
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,866
You gave up your dream.

444
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,370
Your chance to save the world.

445
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,248
You are my world.

446
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:39,093
So please, even if I was this... monster

447
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:42,597
somehow or in another life,

448
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,266
don't hold my sins against her.

449
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,601
I am begging you.

450
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,438
Save her.

451
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,443
The Thawne I know has haunted my life
since I was just a kid.

452
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,906
He's killed people I care for.

453
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,575
He deserves to rot.

454
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,330
He could never put
someone else's needs before his.

455
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,004
You're not the man I thought you were.

457
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,341
You're someone better.

458
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
My speed's back.

459
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,729
<i>Flash? Flash, are you there?</i>

460
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,207
Yeah, I hear you. What's happening?

461
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,775
Okay, Meena's attacking power junctions
all over the city.

462
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,861
Why would Meena need electricity?

463
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,156
Her speed is supposed to be temporary.

464
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,494
If Meena runs out of speed, the Negative
Speed Force will lose its grip on her.

465
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:52,208
It's making her absorb electricity
to make more speed and maintain control.

466
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,644
If that's the case,
then she's going to look

467
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,253
for the largest power source possible.

468
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,090
<i>The Keystone Cleveland Dam.</i>

469
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,393
Time to get faster.

470
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:33,166
Speed. Unlimited speed.

471
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:43,051
Meena, I don't want to hurt you.

472
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,487
But you're not in control
of yourself right now,

473
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,139
and if this dam breaks,
thousands of people could die.

474
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:49,598
Then let them.

475
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,206
Guys, she's right behind me.

476
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,230
<i>Are you in position?</i>

477
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,485
Almost. Everyone okay back there?

478
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,338
I just hacked into Meena's speed gauge.

479
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,239
Her saturation is already
under 40%, it's working.

480
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:09,077
If Flash can keep her running
for another 119 seconds,

481
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,287
she'll burn off the rest of her speed.

482
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,985
Meena? Are you okay?

483
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:05,133
Flash? Can you hear me, Flash?

484
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,719
She just summoned power
directly from the Negative Speed Force.

485
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,806
It canceled out the Flash's power.

486
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,692
How pathetic...

487
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:29,449
Avatar of the speed force
dying on his back.

488
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,581
Meena, stop! I can't let you do this.

489
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:37,622
Please.

490
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,417
Please, you have to stop this.

491
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:42,336
The Meena you knew is gone.

492
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:48,843
Lost in the electrostatic pits
of your precious machine.

493
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,553
I know you're still there.

494
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,890
I can feel you locked away inside.

495
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:54,973
Please.

496
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,349
Meena, come back to me.

497
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,896
You're wasting your time.

498
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:07,236
This is who I am now.

499
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,948
And killing the Flash is my purpose.

500
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:13,618
No. No, it isn't!

501
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,495
Perhaps I should kill you first.

502
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:22,251
Go ahead, because I'd rather die
right here, right now,

503
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:23,919
than lose you.

504
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,381
I know the real you.

505
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:31,344
You're the genius who stumped
every lab tech in Central City.

506
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,930
You have to account for the tachyons.

507
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:37,183
<i>The health conscious partner
who'd never let me have a cheeseburger.</i>

508
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,434
Don't tell anybody.

509
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,979
The hero who taught me to put others
before myself.

510
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:47,610
And that Meena, she would never be able
to do something like this.

511
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:51,864
I love you, Meena.

512
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,783
The chamber's ready.

513
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,494
But only one of us can use it.

514
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,455
I am begging you, please.

515
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,625
<i>I want to save the world.</i>

516
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,354
<i>I want to save the world, too.</i>

517
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,632
You are my world.

518
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,342
No!

519
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,094
I can't lose you!

520
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,221
Please...

521
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,306
come back to me.

522
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:19,809
<i>Come back to me.</i>

523
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:22,645
You should go first.

524
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:32,988
Eobard.

525
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,155
Oh, God.

526
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,745
- Flash, are you okay?
- Yeah, I will be.

527
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:41,956
So will they.

528
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:45,959
You saved me.

529
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:50,047
No, you saved me.

530
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,227
Okay. Well,
my speed has finally worn off.

531
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:06,814
And so are the effects the
Negative Speed Force had on your brain.

532
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,527
I know that your experiment
didn't exactly go as planned,

533
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:15,990
but... this is one seriously dope lab.

534
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:18,743
How do you feel now?

535
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,996
Well, I finally feel like myself again.

536
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,792
I am so sorry
I didn't listen to you, Flash.

537
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:30,129
We built the B.L.O.C
so we could help people,

538
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,174
but if we can't use it without me
turning into a super villain...

539
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,842
Then it's not worth the risk.

540
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,553
Especially if we don't even know
how we tapped into

541
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,889
the Negative Speed Force to begin with.

542
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,808
What if there was a way around it?

543
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,811
Whenever I start to feel
like I'm in over my head,

544
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:49,148
I think about the person I love most.

545
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,609
She helps guide me home.

546
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,027
Like a lightning rod.

547
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,865
Just like tonight when the Negative
Speed Force corrupted you.

548
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,575
Eobard brought me back.

549
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:06,457
So you think that our bond
could help me control my powers?

550
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,751
It would take some tinkering
with the B.L.O.C,

551
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:12,296
but if Eobard's your lightning rod,

552
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,383
there's nothing
you can't accomplish together.

553
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:19,345
Well, should we take a look
at the instruction manual?

554
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,471
Oh!

555
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,099
I thought you'd never ask.

556
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,978
Sorry to interrupt the sniffers.

557
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:30,815
When you said that
Flashpoint Thawne came back,

558
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,359
I reached out to a mutual friend
to gather some intel.

559
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:34,944
He just left a message.

560
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:41,534
Chester. Hey, sorry it took me so long
to get back.

561
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,745
The Quincy P. Runk Institute
is having a minor infestation

562
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,997
of serpent creatures
from the Morlay dimension.

563
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,083
It's under control, I think.

564
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,169
<i>As for your question, I was out
having retirement drinks with Nate</i>

565
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:55,965
and turns out the Legends had their own
encounter with Reverse-Flash this year.

566
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,385
Yeah, apparently the Time Wraiths
saved him from Black Flash.

567
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,263
My power's stripped. I was "re-educated"

568
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:05,725
and assigned here
to protect this fixed point.

569
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:07,393
As penance for your past crimes.

570
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,729
Believe it or not, Sarah,
I came to see their point.

571
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:14,984
That history cannot
and should not be changed.

572
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,027
<i>Thawne spent years
protecting the timeline.</i>

573
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,446
- Thawne.
- It is yours now.

574
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:23,075
Until he died helping the Legends.
Pretty tragic twist, huh?

575
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,703
Oops!

576
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,789
Another serpent loose,
so I just gotta grab my sword.

577
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,457
And, it's over here.

578
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,336
Wait. If Thawne from Flashpoint
became a hero,

579
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,546
but then, died...

580
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,922
How could he be here?

581
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,551
Maybe when he sacrificed himself,
the Time Wraiths saved his life again.

582
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:42,887
- Brought him here.
- To Meena.

583
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:47,099
Guys, I know it sounds crazy,
but however it happened,

584
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,601
I think we're lucky it did.

585
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,103
So are they.

586
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,066
Plus, we could always use
another hero around here.

587
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,070
Stop!

588
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,824
You think I'm playing with you?

589
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,241
Give me the purse!

590
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,210
What's happening to me?

591
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,440
Now that's more like it.

592
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,496
<i>- Mark.</i>
- Yes.

593
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,665
<i>Are you in my apartment?</i>

594
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:53,748
Yes.

595
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:54,916
Where the hell are you?

596
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,293
<i>With my mom.</i>

597
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:59,088
<i>I needed to get out of there,
clear my head.</i>

598
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,132
Then do that and get your ass
back here, okay?

599
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,647
I was looking at our data
again last night.

600
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,679
It all clicked for me.

601
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,974
Caitlin. I know how to bring Frost back.

602
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,100
<i>We can't.</i>

603
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,268
<i>Not now.</i>

604
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,436
<i>Plus, Barry took the Mirror Gun.</i>

605
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,315
<i>I'm sorry, Mark, but It's over.</i>

606
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,483
We don't need the gun.

607
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,485
Not for what we're gonna do.

608
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,199
We just need you.

609
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,370
<i>What did you do?</i>

610
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,136
<i>My speed is my life.</i>

611
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:52,182
<i>I wonder what face I'll be wearing
next time we meet.</i>

612
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,185
Merry Christmas.

613
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,439
<i>And I'm just getting started!</i>

614
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,151
<i>Everything you are is because of me!</i>

615
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,234
<i>What did you do?</i>

616
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:06,488
<i>I got faster than you.</i>

617
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,575
<i>Your precious
Speed Force cannot help you now,</i>

618
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:13,913
because in this timeline,
Iris chose me, I won.

619
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:20,044
<i>There is no trace of the
Negative Speed Force left in your body.</i>

620
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,670
You took my life!

621
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,631
<i>And left me in hell.</i>

622
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,636
<i>We've been looking
for you, Eobard.</i>

623
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:34,642
<i>The man with no past.</i>

624
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,227
<i>The anomaly.</i>

625
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,023
<i>You were invisible to us</i>

626
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:45,486
<i>until the light from that damn cube
showed us where to find you.</i>

627
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,910
Well, good for me.

628
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,581
Now, who are you and...

629
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,626
what do you want?

630
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:06,840
<i>I guess you could say I'm an old friend.</i>

631
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,429
<i>And a new one all rolled up in one.</i>

632
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,933
<i>Because that's how I roll.</i>

633
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:18,978
And as for why I'm here?

634
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,989
It's time to fulfill your destiny.
