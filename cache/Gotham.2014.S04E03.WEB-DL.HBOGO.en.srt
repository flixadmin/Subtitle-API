1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,080
<i>Previously</i> on Gotham...

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,760
You know, you can't commit
a crime in Gotham

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,760
without a license from Penguin.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,080
Tell your family's Oswald Cobblepot
keeps them safe.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,520
Not the GCPD.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,840
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,640
I am not giving this city over
to Penguin.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,280
I don't care
what the Commissioner says.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,480
Makes me miss Falcone.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm done with this business. I'm out.

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,920
I've got a place down south
I can go to.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We need an army.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,080
He's got one.

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,640
You show your face to Falcone,
he will kill you.

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,360
An opportunity awaits you.

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,520
Why do you want this so bad?

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm sick of not being
taken seriously.

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,120
With you and Barbara,

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,080
the three of us could give all those
creeps a run for their money.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,280
You were the one time
I let love weaken me.

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,920
- No!
- And I want you around

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,440
as a constant reminder,
never make that mistake again.

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm the one you seek.
I am Ra's al Ghul.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,360
I have to be ready
for when Ra's al Ghul returns.

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,240
You need to find your true north.
Let that guide you.

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,400
It is you...

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,720
At last.

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
I was no more.

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,640
Now you live.

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,000
- How can this be?
- The power is in the water.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,600
It has given you life and a destiny.

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,760
You must find your heir,
as I found you.

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,920
Find him.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
Be free.

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
{\an5}Alfred, you read?

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,640
{\an5}Loud and clear, Master Bruce.

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,080
{\an5}Looks like the rumors
around town are true.

38
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,720
Penguin's bringing in a big shipment.

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
Whatever it is must be valuable.

40
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,120
He's got four armed men
loading it onto a truck.

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,600
{\an5}I'm gonna go down
for a closer look.

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,800
{\an5}How did I know
you were gonna say that then?

43
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
{\an5}I'm wearing bulletproof armor,
remember?

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,480
{\an5}Yes. Lucius Fox's armor
was bulletproof.

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
{\an5}My mask is not.

46
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,040
{\an5}Don't get shot in the face. Got it?

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,400
{\an5}<i>Do I detect a note of sarcasm,
Master Bruce?</i>

48
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Hold on.

49
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,440
{\an5}I just picked up a thief
heading toward the truck.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,280
{\an5}<i>Thieves stealing from thieves
is a victimless crime, Master Bruce.</i>

51
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,520
{\an5}<i>You just walk away now.</i>

52
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,480
{\an5}- They're walking into a trap.
<i>- Master Bruce.</i>

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm all for you protecting
the innocent.

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,520
But I won't have you risking
your life over a thief.

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
<i>Now, walk away.</i>

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Master Bruce?

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
<i>Master Bruce?</i>

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,480
The hell are you supposed to be?

59
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
{\an5}Must be real stupid trying
to steal from Penguin.

60
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,560
{\an5}Bad idea.

61
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Hold it!

62
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,080
Let's get out of here!

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Come on.

64
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
In the truck.

65
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Damn it!

66
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,280
<i>Hola, Señor.</i>

67
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Can I help you?

68
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
James Gordon.

69
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm here to see Carmine Falcone.

70
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,560
He's not expecting me.

71
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,120
Come with me, please.

72
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Carmine.

73
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Jim.

74
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,600
You're a long way from home.

75
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,120
Came down to see you, Carmine.

76
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,560
Heard you retired down here.

77
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,280
Sorry for not calling ahead.

78
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
No, you're not.

79
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,640
It's quite the spread you have here.

80
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
I think we're past
the point of small talk, Jim.

81
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,680
Just tell me why you're here.

82
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Morning, Daddy.

83
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,840
How was Artemus?

84
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,120
Feisty, as usual.

85
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,440
But I whipped him into shape.

86
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,880
Who's this?

87
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,400
James Gordon.

88
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
Jim, meet my only daughter, Sofia.

89
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,640
What are you doing here, James?

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Go ahead, Jim.

91
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,440
I have no secrets from my children.

92
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,000
Penguin has taken over the city.

93
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,080
GCPD has turned its back on Gotham.

94
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
There are families
that are still loyal to you.

95
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,720
I need your help to knock him
off his perch.

96
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,120
Sure this isn't about you, Jim?

97
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,960
Your loss of power in Gotham?

98
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,240
This is bigger than me.

99
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
You have fight, kid.

100
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,600
I've always admired that in you.

101
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,240
But I can't do what you ask.

102
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Why?

103
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,920
Because I'm dying.

104
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
Doctors don't know why.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,040
Maybe old age. Karma.

106
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,040
They seem to think the air is
better down here for me.

107
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
Give me more time.

108
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm not one to argue with doctors.

109
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,960
Or time.

110
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,600
So you see, I can't go back with you.

111
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll go back.

112
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Hush.

113
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
You're not ready for Gotham.

114
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
There was a time in my life when I
would've done anything for the city.

115
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
Those days are gone.

116
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,240
I'm sorry, Jim.

117
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
You're on your own.

118
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,720
You sure you know what you're doing?

119
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
You're mad because
I didn't listen to you, Alfred.

120
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,080
You're damn bloody right I am, yeah.

121
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,800
You're right. I let my guard down.

122
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
It won't happen again.

123
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
All right, there we go.

124
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,440
Might leave a little bit of a scar.

125
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Thanks, Alfred.

126
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
All right.

127
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Oh, no, where do you think
you're going?

128
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
To the docks.

129
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,880
I'm sure there's a manifest
on the freighter.

130
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
Whatever's in that crate
must be important

131
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,280
if the thief was willing
to steal it from the Penguin.

132
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I want to know what it is.

133
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
Right, so being shot
wasn't enough, was it?

134
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,640
You got to let this slide, Master B.

135
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,880
There's more to this, Alfred.

136
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,880
I can feel it.

137
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,840
This is my chance
to investigate a real crime.

138
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,880
Stop it before it becomes
something bigger.

139
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,560
Fine. But just don't go charging
around in broad daylight

140
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
with that bloody mask on.

141
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,520
It'll be like having a socking great
bulls-eye on your back, all right?

142
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,320
So how do you suggest
I get on to the ship?

143
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,880
There are other kinds of masks
you can wear, Master Bruce.

144
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,320
As you can see, the scatter pattern
is tighter than most.

145
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,480
You won't find a superior
weapon anywhere in Gotham.

146
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll take two dozen.

147
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Excellent.

148
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,480
You can pay out front.

149
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,160
Right this way, sir.

150
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Thank you, everyone for coming.

151
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,080
Tabitha planning on coming to work?

152
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,560
I am paying her half the profits.

153
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
Don't you mean a third?

154
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,920
That depends.

155
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Where's my crate?

156
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,800
I ran into some trouble.

157
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,840
- Did Penguin's men see you?
- No.

158
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
I wore a mask like you said.
I know you're pissed.

159
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm not mad. I misjudged you.

160
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,680
I was wrong to cut you in
on my new business.

161
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
You're clearly not ready.

162
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,200
You're serious?
I can get the damn thing!

163
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,440
I'll do it myself.

164
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
But if you do want to redeem
yourself, you can do the floors.

165
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,640
Mop's in the closet.

166
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,040
You can mop your own damn floors.

167
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,320
Another excellent night of business,
Victor.

168
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
Except for the part
where a couple of thieves tried

169
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,720
to rob your shipment.

170
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
- What?
- Relax, boss.

171
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,320
My men stopped them before they
could get their hands on anything.

172
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
You see what I'm dealing with, Ed?

173
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,280
That shipment is full
of black market items

174
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm auctioning off tonight
to Gotham's elite.

175
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,960
I stand to make a killing.

176
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,000
I cannot do that without the items.

177
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,480
Where are they?

178
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,200
- At the warehouse.
- Take me.

179
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,280
I want to be sure
it's all accounted for.

180
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,280
And once I do, bring everything
back here for safe keeping.

181
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,600
Okay.

182
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,520
No.

183
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
No.

184
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,360
No!

185
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,080
- This cannot be happening!
- I don't know.

186
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,360
Kind of opens up the room.

187
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,280
Whoever did this, I want them found.

188
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
I want them dead.

189
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,480
And I want Ed back here today!

190
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,520
Where are you, Ed?

191
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,640
- Oh! He's up! He's up! He's up!
- Where am I?

192
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,360
Whose... how did I get here?

193
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,520
I brought you here.
You're in my home.

194
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,800
What do you think?

195
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm sorry. Who, who are you?

196
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,840
You don't remember?
Hilltop Elementary?

197
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,000
Mrs. Macher's class?

198
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,000
I was third row,
closest to the window?

199
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,640
Eddie, it's me. Myrtle Jenkins.

200
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,000
I followed your rise
to becoming the Riddler.

201
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,760
I've read every article.

202
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,280
All the police reports.

203
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,880
I guess you could say,
I'm your number one fan.

204
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Okay.

205
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,160
Oh, I should get going.

206
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,960
Whoop! That's gonna be tough.

207
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,800
- Why am I tied up?
- You're not.

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,320
Your muscles have
atrophied from being on ice.

209
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,680
Okay? But don't worry, these warming
lamps should help thaw you out.

210
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,120
- Ice?
- Yeah.

211
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,480
The last thing I remember...

212
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,720
- Yeah?
- ...was being frozen by the river.

213
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,520
How long was I on ice?

214
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Five months.

215
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,600
I know. Since then Penguin opened
a club called the Iceberg Lounge.

216
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,920
You were its centerpiece.

217
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,680
That little freak.

218
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,320
He put me on display
like some caged animal?

219
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Yes.

220
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,360
And I will nurse you back to health

221
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,840
so you can reclaim your throne
as Gotham's greatest villain!

222
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh! Oh, caveat.

223
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,840
With me as your sidekick, of course.

224
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Doesn't that sound wonderful,
my love?

225
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,160
You lost, kid?

226
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,680
My uncle Al works on your ship.

227
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,360
My aunt hasn't heard from him
in a few days, and she's worried.

228
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
There are a few men below deck.

229
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,640
I'm pretty damn sure none of their
old ladies are looking for them.

230
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,640
Listen, I told my aunt I'd find him.

231
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,800
Can I just take a quick look?

232
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,840
I'll be in and out in a few minutes,
I promise.

233
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,800
Sure. Go ahead.

234
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Thank you.

235
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,280
Bet you think you're real smart
giving us the slip?

236
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
I don't know what you're talking
about.

237
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,440
Save it. Somebody tried to steal
from this ship last night.

238
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,360
Did this to my face.

239
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,760
Tell me who you are working for.

240
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,880
I assure you,
I'm just here looking for my uncle.

241
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
I took a wrong turn.

242
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,600
Assure?

243
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,560
Here's a little advice.

244
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,320
If you're gonna play the part
of a street kid,

245
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,960
learn how to talk like one.

246
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,000
Hey, Andy! Get over here.

247
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,800
What'd I tell you
about bothering me at work?

248
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Sorry, fellas.

249
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
You're right, though.

250
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,680
The boy's acting
does need some work, doesn't it?

251
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,040
You see, improvisation, Master Bruce
is a very important weapon

252
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,640
in any actor's toolkit.

253
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Should we go?

254
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
There's a knife being sold
at your auction tonight.

255
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,200
I was thinking you might be
kind enough

256
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,240
to sell it to me ahead of time.

257
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,000
And why is this knife
so important to you?

258
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,960
It's not.

259
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,840
I have a client who's interested.

260
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Gave me a ton of cash,

261
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,560
so I was hoping to get it for a
lower price and make a profit.

262
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,040
That start with the attempted
five-finger discount last night?

263
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,000
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

264
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Of course, you don't.

265
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,520
I'll triple the opening price.

266
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
It'll probably go
for less at auction.

267
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
My dear, wherever you disappeared
to these last few months

268
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,720
has not made you a better liar.

269
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,720
It's clear
that this isn't about a profit

270
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,520
but about your mysterious benefactor.

271
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,880
He is your client, is, is he not?

272
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,000
Reveal his identity to me
and you have a deal.

273
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Wow.
He's really got his hooks into you.

274
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,560
See you tonight, I guess.

275
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,560
Don't forget to bring your checkbook.

276
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,760
Always a pleasure, Oswald.

277
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,000
The knife was used to embalm
King Balahsi.

278
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
According to this,
he ruled Ancient Mesopotamia

279
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
for the first century.

280
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,000
And what thief in Gotham
would want a knife like that?

281
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,320
That's a good question.

282
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,120
According to the manifest

283
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,240
the shipment was full
of jewels and expensive art.

284
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,040
Yet, our thief went for the item
with the least intrinsic value.

285
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
Well, that tells me she
was a gun for hire.

286
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
But who hired her?

287
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,960
I think I just found the answer.

288
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Alfred, look.

289
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,880
This drawing depicts a man
being healed by water.

290
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Look at his eyes...

291
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
his face.

292
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,560
Who does that remind you of?

293
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,440
That's impossible.

294
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,280
I mean, this, this drawing
is 2,000 years old.

295
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
I know.

296
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
That's him.

297
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
That's Ra's Al Ghul.

298
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
He wants the knife.

299
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,200
I struck out with Falcone.

300
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
<i>That right?</i>

301
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,680
Try not to sound too happy about it.

302
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,520
<i>Look, if you brought back Falcone,</i>

303
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>that would mean gang wars
and blood in the streets.</i>

304
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
<i>And I don't like it
when the streets are bloody, Jim.</i>

305
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
Yeah. I'll see how you like it
with Penguin.

306
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
See you tomorrow, Harvey.

307
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,080
Mind if I join you?

308
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
What are you doing here?

309
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,720
I figured you didn't know
anyone in town.

310
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,200
I thought I'd keep you company.

311
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,520
Or maybe I just didn't want to drink
alone.

312
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
To my dad.

313
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,240
I am sorry about your father.

314
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,360
We may have had our differences
over the years.

315
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,720
But I always respected him.

316
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,000
When I was a little girl,

317
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,280
if I wanted to spend time
with my father,

318
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,160
he'd have me schedule an appointment.

319
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,040
Save the respect.
I know who my father is.

320
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,040
Took him getting sick for us
to finally have a real relationship.

321
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,640
How long have you lived down here?

322
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
Since I was 13.

323
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,720
My father thought sending me away
from Gotham would keep me safe.

324
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400
There are worse places to grow up.

325
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,600
People are happy here.

326
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,920
You can see the sun every day.

327
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,920
And I wasn't alone. I had Mario.

328
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,200
We took care of each other.

329
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,760
I know there's nothing I can say.

330
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,000
I am sorry for what happened to him.

331
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
You're right.
There is nothing you can say.

332
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,960
He was infected with the virus.

333
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,280
You did what you had to.

334
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,720
There's no sign of Nygma
anywhere in Gotham.

335
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,400
Word on the street is
it was an inside job.

336
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,600
Find whoever's in charge of hiring.
Kill them.

337
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,280
I want everyone here interrogated.

338
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,720
There's a traitor amongst us.

339
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,120
Those needles should help
stimulate your muscles.

340
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,120
You'll have feeling back in no time.

341
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,480
Just call me the Riddlette.

342
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,720
I know. What do you think?

343
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,560
I think that rehashing someone
else's idea isn't very original.

344
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,960
Wow. It's an homage
and I thought you'd like it.

345
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
It's very nice.

346
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,520
This is so much fun.

347
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,720
If only I were the criminal
mastermind you are,

348
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
we would've been together sooner.

349
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
I'm sorry.
I don't really follow that.

350
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,720
Well, it took me months
to plan your escape.

351
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,360
I had to learn Penguin's schedule.

352
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,920
When he came and went.

353
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
Devise an exit strategy.

354
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm sure it would've taken you
two seconds to think something up.

355
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,640
It is slightly impressive
you were able to outwit Oswald.

356
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,200
Though, as you say, my plan
would've taken much less time.

357
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,240
Oh, wait. That is a great idea.

358
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
You should tell me what
your plan would've been.

359
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,680
Because a window into your master
villainy would mean so much to me.

360
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
I...

361
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,080
Here I am, bombarding you
with silly questions

362
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,480
after everything you've been through.

363
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,080
You must be exhausted.

364
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Yes.

365
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,720
Yes, I must be exhausted.

366
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,880
Ooh! Soup's ready.

367
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,000
Do you like tomato?

368
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,000
I put little question marks
in it, too.

369
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,720
Last one.

370
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,760
One, two, three.

371
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,800
Anything, my love?

372
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
No!

373
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,680
Acupuncture is therapeutic snake oil.

374
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,920
I've been focused on repairing
the wrong muscle.

375
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,120
What?

376
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Your brain.

377
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,760
It fires synapses that carry neurons
to the rest of your body.

378
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,200
And if we can stimulate it, perhaps
your other muscles will follow.

379
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,320
- Logical.
- Yeah.

380
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
- What do you suggest?
- Well, in anticipation

381
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,240
of our partnership,
I have been working on a few riddles.

382
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,760
- Yes. Riddles.
- Yeah.

383
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,080
That's exactly what I need.

384
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,600
That's gonna make me feel
like myself again.

385
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,960
- Fire away.
- Okay. Here goes.

386
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,960
What's black and white
and red all over?

387
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,640
Easy. Zebra with a gaping hole. Next.

388
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,520
- No. It's actually a newspaper.
- That's ridiculous.

389
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,560
There's nothing red in a newspaper.
Next.

390
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,160
- Well, it makes sense. And if you...
- Next!

391
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,760
Oh, I have a face and two hands,
but no arms or legs.

392
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,960
What am I?

393
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Deformed baby. Come on.

394
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,520
Surely, you can do better than this.

395
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,280
Oh, the answer is a clock. Hands.

396
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Oh, my.

397
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,440
I think something is wrong
with your brain, Ed.

398
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,120
There is nothing wrong with my brain.

399
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,040
The problem is your riddles.

400
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,360
Bring me a riddle
that is worthy of my name!

401
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,600
Well, next time
I'll know to pack a swim suit.

402
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,560
You actually own one?

403
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,960
Yeah. I got a nice two piece.

404
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,680
He comes with a sense of humor.

405
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,200
Do you ever think about walking
away from it all?

406
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Gotham?

407
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Sometimes.

408
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
But I can't.

409
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Why not?

410
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,040
It's in my blood.

411
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,480
Father spent his entire life
fighting for the city.

412
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,840
Never took the easy way out,
neither can I.

413
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
What?

414
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Give them to me.

415
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,520
Don't really think they're your size.

416
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Come on.

417
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
That too?

418
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,960
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

419
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,120
You can't be serious.

420
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,200
Just a little water, Jim.

421
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,360
Can't remember the last time
I just stood still.

422
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,600
Right, Master Bruce.

423
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,960
Let's go over the plan again.

424
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,360
It's simple.

425
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,320
I show up at the auction
and buy the knife.

426
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,040
Should be easy enough.
I am a billionaire.

427
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,680
And a very public one at that.

428
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,760
Turning up at the Penguin's
black market auction's

429
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,080
certainly gonna raise
a few eyebrows, isn't it?

430
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,720
You're the one that said that bidding
on it was the smarter play.

431
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,360
That I did. But I didn't mean
as going as yourself, did I?

432
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,920
Oh, what do you think the idea was?

433
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,600
Going down to the docks pretending
to be someone else?

434
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,640
I was trying to teach you a lesson.

435
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,800
Now if you're gonna continue down
this vigilante path, Master Bruce...

436
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,080
you've got to learn
how to assume other roles.

437
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,040
Play the role
that you were born to play.

438
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,800
That of a privileged,
somewhat pedantic teenager

439
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,480
with deeper pockets
than anybody else in this city.

440
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,080
You mean behave like a spoiled brat.

441
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,840
It goes against everything
that your beautiful parents

442
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,080
tried to ingrain in you...

443
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,960
but yes, sir.

444
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Bruce Wayne.

445
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,600
Billionaire brat.

446
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,320
Two hundred and fifty thousand!

447
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,160
Two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.

448
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,200
Going once. Twice.
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

449
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,400
That's what I'm talking about!

450
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,520
I love art.

451
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,240
I love it! Yeah!

452
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,720
I'm gonna put it in my
in my bathroom.

453
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,720
Steady on, Master Bruce.

454
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
Let's not overplay your hand,
shall we?

455
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,880
I must admit, this is fun.

456
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,160
And try to exercise a modicum
of financial restraint.

457
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,680
Technically, you are the richest man
in the room,

458
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,440
but let's not try and buy absolutely
everything, shall we?

459
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,680
True. But if I only bid on the knife
everyone's been trying to steal

460
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,680
from Penguin,
it might draw his suspicion.

461
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,960
If I go on a spending spree,

462
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,400
recklessly throwing my money around,
he won't think twice.

463
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,120
Nice. When'd you think of that?

464
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,520
Improvisation, Alfred.

465
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,200
It's a weapon in any actor's toolkit.

466
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,320
All right, sir. Here we go.

467
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,360
Oswald! My friend!

468
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,640
Bruce Wayne. What a lovely surprise.

469
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,320
You certainly are getting out quite
a lot these days, aren't you?

470
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,440
The way I see it, everyone else
in this town is having fun,

471
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,560
- why shouldn't I?
- I agree.

472
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,600
You and your insanely
large bank account

473
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,320
are more than welcome here.

474
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,400
Barbara Kean.

475
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,040
I thought she died.

476
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,400
Unfortunately, nobody stays dead
in this town.

477
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Excuse me.

478
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,400
You do realize, don't you,

479
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,680
Master Bruce
that if you actually win,

480
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,600
Ra's Al Ghul
will come after the knife.

481
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,800
Let him.

482
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,120
The next item up for auction
is an embalming knife

483
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,080
from the tomb
of King Balahsi of Sumeria.

484
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,840
Opening bid will begin
at 50,000 dollars.

485
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,440
A hundred thousand dollars.

486
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,080
What does she want with it?

487
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,680
I have no idea. Stay focused.

488
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,840
One hundred thousand dollars
to Miss Kean.

489
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Do I hear...

490
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,800
One hundred thousand and one dollar.

491
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,920
Actually, Mr. Wayne, the bidding
amounts are in fifty thousand...

492
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,640
- Two hundred thousand.
- Fine.

493
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,040
We have two hundred thousand dollars.

494
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,080
Two hundred thousand and one dollar.

495
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
Mr. Wayne.

496
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,760
How about you let someone else
have some fun?

497
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,720
Oh. Sure. No problem.
I'm sorry about that.

498
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Three hundred thousand.

499
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,560
Very well. Three hundred...

500
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,920
Three hundred thousand dollars
and one cent.

501
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,520
Five hundred thousand.

502
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,560
Now back off, you little brat.

503
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,880
Wow, Miss Kean.

504
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,200
That's a lot of money...

505
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
For someone like you.

506
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,120
Two million dollars!

507
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,280
Two...

508
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,160
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

509
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,000
Congratulations, Bruce.

510
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Thank you.

511
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
I do love seeing that woman lose.

512
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
But a little piece
of friendly advice.

513
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Barbara Kean does not give up easily.

514
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,640
She'll be coming for that knife.

515
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I would just keep a close eye on it
if I were you.

516
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,960
There's a new wrinkle, isn't it?

517
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,520
What's green and red and goes
'round and 'round?

518
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,640
Someone's obsessed
with the color red.

519
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,920
The answer obviously
isn't newspaper.

520
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
You're stalling.

521
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
No.

522
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,560
You don't know the answer.

523
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,800
Of course, I do.

524
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,640
No, you don't, Ed.

525
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,040
Your brilliant mind is as damaged
as the rest of your body.

526
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,480
Actually, my body is feeling fine.

527
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,120
Frog in a blender!

528
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Selina?

529
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,960
Why are you sitting in the dark
by yourself?

530
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,440
I was expecting someone else.

531
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,920
Like who?

532
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,080
Doesn't matter.
What are you doing here?

533
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,920
Heard about Penguin's auction.

534
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,760
So Barbara sent you for the knife.

535
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,960
Figured, what? Because we're
friends I'd just hand it over?

536
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,480
Something like that.

537
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,920
Why is it so important to her?

538
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
How should I know?

539
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,840
She was supposed to get it
for some client.

540
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
Said he was a pretty dangerous guy.

541
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,680
And that if you were smart,

542
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,000
you'd hand it over
and save yourself the trouble.

543
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,520
So you're here to protect me,
is that it?

544
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,760
The knife can't possibly mean
that much to you, Bruce.

545
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,440
I don't know, like you said,

546
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,720
I spent 2 million dollars on it.
I think I'll keep it.

547
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
- Why are you acting like this?
- Me?

548
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,920
What about you? Are you really
Barbara Kean's errand girl now?

549
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,600
I'm her partner.

550
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,000
But if I don't give her
this knife back,

551
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,120
she won't ever see me as an equal.

552
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm asking you to do me a solid.

553
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,480
I'm sorry, Selina.

554
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,320
You should go.

555
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Morning, Harv.

556
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,440
Jim, hey.

557
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,720
This is Detective Harper.

558
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
She just transferred over
from the three-five.

559
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,160
- Jim Gordon.
- Nice to meet you, Detective.

560
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,440
Heard a lot of good things.

561
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,560
From who?

562
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,960
It's good to have you in the fold,
Harper.

563
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Thanks.

564
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,640
Gordon.

565
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,920
You got a visitor.

566
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,680
Hot damn!

567
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,280
Fox in the henhouse.

568
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,480
No offense, Harper.

569
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
None taken.

570
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,240
But you got the wrong idiom, Captain.

571
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,480
No, I don't.

572
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
Be right back.

573
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,240
Sofia, what are you doing here?

574
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,120
I came to help you.

575
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,960
Oh, yeah? How's that?

576
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,760
Penguin.

577
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
Oh, I know you
didn't directly ask me.

578
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,680
But I find men tend to have
trouble seeing the simple solution

579
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,560
even when it's presented to them.

580
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,960
You shouldn't have come back here.

581
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Oh, Jim.

582
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,120
I don't need your permission.

583
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,920
Or my father's.

584
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm a Falcone.

585
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,000
This city is my birthright.

586
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,200
My father might not think
I'm ready, but I am.

587
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
Is that so?

588
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
What do you think I've been doing
down South the past 10 years?

589
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,120
You knew you were coming back
from the moment

590
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,400
I left your father's house.

591
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,840
Everything that's happened,
was what?

592
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,680
- You sizing me up?
- No.

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Not everything.

594
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,760
But I had to get to know you
if we're gonna work together.

595
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,200
We're not.

596
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,800
Don't be sore, Jim.

597
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
You came looking for a gangster.

598
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,560
That's exactly what you found.

599
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,080
We can do great things
together, you and I.

600
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,480
I'll be in touch.

601
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
You?

602
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,240
You were the one who stole from me?

603
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,800
Some good it did.

604
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,640
The ice broke his brain.

605
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,560
What are you talking about?

606
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,080
What's green and red and goes
'round and 'round?

607
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,680
- Frog in a blender.
- Exactly.

608
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,160
Ed couldn't even get that.

609
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,720
Does seem unlike Ed
to keep this rube alive.

610
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,000
Sound the word.
I want him found.

611
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
And her?

612
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,720
A lot of people have been trying
to steal from me lately.

613
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,360
An example needs to be made.

614
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,080
Have fun, Victor.

615
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,400
- Love your dress.
- Thank you. I made it.

616
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Excellent technique, Barbara.

617
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
I'm impressed.

618
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,560
I had a good teacher.

619
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,840
I wish you'd've called ahead.

620
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,480
Does that mean you don't have
the knife?

621
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,120
No. Bruce Wayne has it.

622
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Bruce.

623
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
Really.

624
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,680
How interesting.

625
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,640
- You're not angry?
- No. Not at all.

626
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,120
You see, Barbara,

627
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,840
when I bathed you in the Lazurus Pit
I did it in the knowledge

628
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,000
that you would become
a competent ally of mine.

629
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,680
And so far, you've done
an admirable job.

630
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,920
I'm glad you feel that way.

631
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,080
And I wouldn't worry
about that knife.

632
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,120
Didn't seem all that special to me.

633
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,600
Oh, but you couldn't be more wrong.

634
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:49,400
You see,
that knife is the key to everything.

635
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,240
Well, not everything.
