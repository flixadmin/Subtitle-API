Hey, Gru.

337
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,238
What you doing down here?

338
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,241
In the dark. Alone.

339
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,409
Oh, nothing. Just thinking.

340
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,537
You okay?

341
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,206
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

342
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,208
It's just... [sighs]

343
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,045
I don't know. I guess I just feel like

344
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,672
a failure.

345
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,299
Like I don't have a purpose anymore.

346
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,553
Hey, mister, you are not a failure.

347

If only I could have nailed Bratt.

348
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,434
So many times, I almost had him.

349
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,062
But now I'll never get the chance,

350
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,815
'cause I have been kicked to the curb.

351
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,275
Gru, you've got to let this go.

352
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,235
It's time to look forward.

353
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,487
Things will get better. I promise.

Pardon me, young people?

358
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,809
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

Stop! Kyle, let go!

00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,218
No! No!

371
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,220
You've got to be kidding me!

372
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,304
Lucy, did you...

[Agnes] He helps you
if you have nightmares.

And he's really good to snuggle with.

Oh, no, no, no. Agnes! Agnes!

376

So [sniffles] take good care of him.

Thank you! [chuckles]

Agnes, what are you doing?

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,652
You sold your unicorn?

380
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,198
Well, I just wanted to help,
since you don't have a job.

381
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,158
I got two whole dollars for it.

Yes, but this will only take a...

-Yeah, but...
-[sighs]

Oh, uh, of course.

390

Now, as I was saying, I...

Listen, Agnes, you don't need to worry.
We're going to be fine.

For real?

For real.

Buddy, you're not getting the hint.

Excuse me, Mr. Gru,

401
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,829
but I really must have a word with you.

402
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,580
How do you know my name?

403
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,959
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Fritz.

406
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,842
And I am inquiring
on behalf of your twin brother, Dru.

407
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,302
He needs your help.

408
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,345
What? Twin brother?

409
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,888
-Twin brother?
-[speaking Minionese]

Oh, ja.

He would like to
fly you to Freedonia to meet him.

412
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,730
Your father has recently
passed away and...

413
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,940
[laughs] Okay, cuckoo.

414
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,860
I'm sorry,
but my dad died when I was a baby,

415
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,446
and I don't have any brother.
You got the wrong guy.

416
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,826
Really? Well, then,
how do you explain this?

Oh, hello, Gru.

Hi, Mom.

423
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,510
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,818
Ciao, boys.

431
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,279
[sighs] So, what do you want?

432
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,783
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

433
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,078
Ah! How did you find out? Who told you?

434
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,621
Wait, what? It's true?

435
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,581
You never told me I had a brother!

436
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:58,293
And you told me that Dad
died of disappointment when I was born.

437
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,338
Ja, ja. [stutters] That was the agreement.

438
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,508
Agreement? What are you talking about?

439
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,343
[sighs]

440
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,972
Shortly after you and your brother
were born,

441
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,308
your father and I divorced.

442
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,728
We each took one son to raise on our own

443
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,107
and promised
never to see each other again.

444
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,693
Obviously, [chuckling]

445

I put together some fun activities
for the trip!

Who is up for some gin rummy?

450
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,968
Yeah, um...

451
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,761
We're good.

00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,555
Oh, okay.

453
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,057
I'll just sit here and play solitaire.

454
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,475
I hope I win.

455
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,312
I wonder what Dru will be like. Ooh!

456
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,231
Maybe we'll have the twin thing

457
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,192
when you can read each other's minds, no?

458
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,652
How cool would that be?

459

This is the family business.

Stop it. Sweet talker.

500
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,231
How is my brother finding a wife like you

501
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,983
when he is so bald? [laughs]

502
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,609
-[grunting]
-I'm joking!

503
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,111
[giggling]

504
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:15,240
[whooping] These must be my nieces!

505
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:19,369
[gasps] You're Agnes!
You are small with big eyes.

506
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,413
And it makes me wanna
put you into my pocket.

507
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,956
You can't do that!

508
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,916
I'm too big.

509
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,879
Ah! Edith! I can tell
that you are a little mischievous.

510
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,173
We're gonna have
to make a little trouble later.

511
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,676
I already have! [laughs]

512
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,970
Ow! Ow! Please!

513
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,306
Why are you doing that? Ow!

514
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,226
Fist bump for mischievous behavior!

515
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,438
And Margo. Oh, you are so mature!

516
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,857
I'm guessing... Mmm... 15?

517
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,525
15?

518
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:54,112
She's 12. She looks 12
and will always be 12.

519
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,407
So, Dru, this place is amazing!

520
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,534
I mean, you just walk through
the doors and you're like...

521
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,077
[grunts and laughs]

522
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,830
Oh, it's nice, I guess, sure.

523
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,915
I'm not really into things.

524
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,171
-[Margo] This is so cool!
-[Agnes] Look at that!

525
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,590
[Edith] Oh, my gosh!
He's even got a helicopter!

526
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,216
[Agnes] This is the best!

527
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,136
Yes, the best!

528
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,304
[whispers] All right, let's go home now.

529
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,472
Home? Why?

530
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:24,184
I don't know.
This guy with the mansion and the cars

531
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:28,813
and all of the hair,
with the silky smooth, luxurious hair.

532
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,232
I feel worse than I did before I came.

533
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,402
But he's your brother, Gru.
Give this a chance.

534
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,862
Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I

535
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,739
catch up on some brother stuff,

536
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,492
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you!

537
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,993
-[all] Yay!
-Awesome!

538
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,328
I love surprises!

539
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,538
Oh, this is perfect!
Mother-daughter bonding time.

540
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,831
Let's do it! Woot-woot!

541
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,918
Bye! You boys have fun!

542
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,504
[laughs] Whoopi!

543
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,926
[announcer] Now you can be
as evil as Balthazar Bratt

544
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,387
with the Evil Bratt action figure.

545
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,807
Featuring music-activated breakdance mode.

546
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,811
Also featuring
bubblegum-launching shoulder pads!

547
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,148
And the all-new Mega Diamond Laser!

548
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,610
No more math!

549
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,113
I've been a bad boy!

550
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,447
[laughs]

551
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,575
[announcer] The Mega Diamond Laser
does not actually incinerate books.

552
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,286
[sighs] How could Hollywood cancel a show

553
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,580
that produced toys like this, Clive?

554
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,792
Evil Bratt was a masterpiece!

555
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,628
Does no one value true art anymore?

556
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,005
It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir.

557
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,759
Well, now that I've got the diamond,
it's payback time.

558
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,763
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be around
to try and stop me.

559
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,433
Oh, wait! No, it's not. I hate that dweeb!

560
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,226
And you, Hollywood!

561
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,646
This time, I'm canceling you

562
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,649
and all the losers who rejected me!

563
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,359
[evil laughter]

564
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,656
Oh, piggy, piggy!

565
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,243
So, how are things going
for you career-wise?

566
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,705
[chuckles] Great! So, so great!

567
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,039
Crushing it.

568
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,625
Well, I've got something that I think

569
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,795
you will find very interesting.

570
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,300
Hold onto your face, brother.

What is all this?

585

[Dru] The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

[laughing and speaking Minionese]

Now, feast your eyes on

00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,646
Dad's lair!

589
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,314
Ta-da!

590
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

591
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,570
So, our dad was a villain?

592
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,031
No, no, no, not just a villain.

593
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,368
One of the greatest of all time!

594
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,288
He was known as the Bald Terror!

595
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,042
That's him? Our dad?

596
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,629
He was so proud of you.
And what a great villain you were.

597
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,214
[gasps] He was?

598
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,843
But me, eh, not so much.

599
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,848
To Dad, I was just a failure.

600
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,518
He never thought
I had what it took to be a villain.

601
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,813
But now, you can help me prove him wrong!

602
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,815
Brother,

603
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,068
teach me the art of villainy!

604
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,238
No.

605
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,323
No, no, no. I can't do that.

606
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,159
What? [stuttering]
But it's our family tradition!

607
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,494
You can't say no to that!

608

Look, I'm sorry.

609
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,791
I left that life behind me. End of story.

Oh.

Okay. I understand.

Right, right. Tough. Good one.

is coursing through your veins

Can I count on you?

991
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,763
Yeah.

Ah, I guess so.

00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,310
So, I'll climb up to the cube
and enter here.

994

Then once I'm inside, find the diamond.

I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.

I think we can handle it.

He seems to think you're engaged.

1011

What? We're not engaged.

1012
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:31,082
Look, Niko, you seem
like a very nice boy with a very nice pig.

1013
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,376
Uh... But you're not engaged.

1014
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,338
Okay? It's not happening.

1015

I understand.

1016

Who was I kidding?

with a goddess like you.

1018

But I promise,
I will never forget you, Margo.

Never.

1020
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,897
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I won't forget you either.

1021
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,607
Bye. Bye, Niko.

1022
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,693
Wow! That was crazy. [chuckles] Whoa!

1023
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,987
That was totally humiliating.

1024
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,115
Taking a bite of that cheese
was the stupidest thing I've ever done.

1025
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,784
Why did I listen to you?

1026

You refuse my son's engagement pig?

What?

1031
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:20,423

Nobody curses my daughter! Ya got that?

1037
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,478
Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!

1038
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:37,649
And I promise,
you do not wanna mess with me.

[sighs] I don't understand.

1052

I did exactly what the man said.

that everybody laughed at?
