property, right?

90

97
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,289
It was a mutual mucking up
of things.

98
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,205
I am, however, annoyed that
John poofed his way out of 1925

99
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,033
without making sure
the rest of us were okay first.

100
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,382

102
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,516

- What's it for?

109
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:27,745

"You'll find out,"

with his trademark
dramatic delivery.

111
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,272
In hindsight,
I probably should've gotten

112
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,491
a little more clarification.
- Probably.

113

No, no, no, not a makeover.

00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,057
- Rule 44.
- Yeah.

161
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,581
- I love Rule 44!
- Yeah!

162
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:49,060
- What's Rule 44?

163
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,627
- Uh, it's from
our Time Bureau training.

164
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:53,021
The intent of Rule 44
is to create a diversion,

165
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,023
a cover story, when things
go sideways on a mission.

166
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:58,461
Specifically, Rule 44 states
that our cover story

167
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,854
must be a circus.

168
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,160
- That is oddly specific.

169
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,771
- We talking Cirque?
Sideshow?

170
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,381
Straight up three-ring affair?

171
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,383
- No, research shows
that the general public

172
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,037
is willing to accept
the bizarreness

173
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,995
of any kind of circus
without question.

174
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,475
- So we have
to put on a circus?

175
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,173
- What? No, we--
he's not listening.

176
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:16,566
We just have to make them
think we're in a circus

177
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,959
to allay their suspicions.

178
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,093
Group makeovers.
Yes, I love it.

179
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:25,662
I'm gonna reinvent
each of you as performers.

180
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:27,403
Friends,
you're in excellent hands.

181
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,753
- Well, you heard her,
let's circus up, eh?

182
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,625
- Yeah, I'm not doing that.

183
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:32,800
- Good,
'cause I need your magic

184
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:33,975
to help fix my mom's porch.

185
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,498
- Sure.
- Hey, Nate,

186
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,500
while we are playing defense
as a circus,

187
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,980
you will be playing offense.

188
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,634
Time to use your superpower.

189
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,505
- So, you want me
to turn to steel

190
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,854
and knock around some skulls?

191
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:47,031
- No,
your other superpower.

192
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,512
You are a white man in 1925.

193
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,905
You go sweet talk that sheriff

194
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,255
and get him
to give you the safe.

195
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,083
Ava will go with you.
- What? No.

196
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:56,780
- All right, come on, Gary.

197
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,043
Those period costumes
aren't gonna sew themselves.

198
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:09,401
<i>♪</i>

199
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:25,983
<i>♪</i>

200
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,204
- Okay.

201
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:30,597
Yes.

202
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,424
Tie.

203
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,557
Button, please.

204
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,125
Mm, voilà.

205
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,563
- My mom's not gonna be happy

206
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,738
when she sees
what we've done to her stuff.

207
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,174
- Sorry, it's desperate times.

208
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,220
Oh! Nate borrowed
your dead dad's suit.

209
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:46,787
Hope that's okay.

210
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,397
- He better not ruin it.

211
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,575
- Good afternoon, Odessa!
Come one, come all!

212
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,838
I know you have seen and heard

213
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,753
some peculiar things lately.

214
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,103
Well, I am here to assure you

215
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:02,629
that it is just
business as usual for us.

216
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:03,586
Why, you ask?

217
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,458
Because my compatriots and I,

218
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:08,460
we are members...

219
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:10,680
of the Guggenheim Circus.

220
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,040
- You know,
it's actually a very good fit.

221
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,520
Hey, do I look like a grandma?

222
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,305
- Yeah.
-

223
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,307
- You the sheriff?
- Yes, sir.

224
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,615
I was just finishing up
some paperwork.

225
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,790
How can I help you?

226
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:34,878
- My name's John Edgar Hoover.

227
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,619
I'm the newly appointed
director

228
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,317
of the Bureau of Investigation
in Washington, D.C.

229
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:43,321
This is my trusted secretary,
Ms. Gandy.

230
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,846
- You seem different
in real life.

231
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,021
- You probably saw
an old photo.

232
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:48,805
I've been cocktailing
my hair products.

233
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,633
But that's
neither here or there.

234
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,417
Now listen up, Sheriff.

235
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:55,682
We're here to talk to you
about a very important matter.

236
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:58,641
- There are so many exciting
things to see at our circus.

237
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,512
For example, exotic animals.

238
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:02,732
My cohort and I,
we are animal handlers

239
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,474
from a land far, far, far away.

240
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,171
- And of course,

241
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,696
what circus would be complete

242
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,872
without a little fire?

243
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,834
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
That's hot, that's hot.

244
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:20,010
Ah.

245
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,491
- Now, don't be alarmed,
but several of our creatures

246
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,667
escaped their confinements
last night.

247
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,235
- You may have, uh,
heard some explosions

248
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,238
or seen some mysterious
lights yesterday.

249
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:34,459
That was just me,
testing out some, uh, displays.

250
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,723
- True story, so if
you saw something yesterday

251
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,725
that looked like a dinosaur,
for example,

252
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,901
it was actually
a Komodo dragon,

253
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,859
which is just a big,
smelly lizard,

254
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,035
despite it's terrifying
appellation.

255
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,822
- Pastor Hanson
found this strange box

256
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,693
over by Gloria Cruz's property.

257
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,826
I thought maybe
it belonged to her,

258
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,436
since she's foreign and all.

259
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,133
- Oh, well,
we can tell you for sure

260
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:59,528
that it's not hers, sir,
but it is very dangerous.

261
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,749
- Say, how did you boys
in Washington learn

262
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,141
about the safe so quickly?

263
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:07,144
The pastor only found it
this morning.

264
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,016
-
I mean, if I told you

265
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:10,539
all of our nation's secrets,

266
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,759
they wouldn't be secrets
anymore, would they?

267
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,282
-
Yes.

268
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,414
And who knows, there may even
be a commendation for you

269
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,807
from President
Warren G. Harding,

270
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,417
once the case is declassified,
you know.

271
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,289
- I believe
she means Calvin Coolidge,

272
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,421
'cause Mr. Harding is dead.

273
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:27,425
People always get their
interwar presidents mixed up.

274
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,558
I need you to focus.

275
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:32,822
Are you ready to do the right
thing by your country?

276
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,912
- Mister, mister,
tell us when the circus is.

277
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,131
I want to go.

278
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,176
- When is it, you ask?

279
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,658
Like, uh, exactly what time?

280
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,923
<i>- You told them what?</i>

281
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,446
- I'm sorry, Sara,
I just panicked.

282
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,883
I didn't mean to invite
the whole town over tonight.

283
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,145
- Just take a breath, Gary.

284
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,233
We'll figure something
else out.

285
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,800
- Okay, wait, you're saying

286
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,802
people are coming here
for an actual circus?

287
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:56,890
Gary!

288
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,805
- All right, all right,
everyone!

289
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,111
Just calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine

290
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,853
once we open the safe.

291
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,812
- Ah!
That's right.

292
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,162
When the whole town comes over,
we flash the hell out of 'em,

293
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:11,034
and then we time courier
our butts out of here!

294
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,862
- Yes! All right.
- Classic. Classic.

295
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,995
That's right,
another successful

296
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,344
Legend missions in the books!

297
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,824
- Ugh, it feels so good
to be back on track.

298
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:18,912
All right.

299
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,745
- Hm?

300
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,833
- There's no time courier.

301
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,226
- There's a note.

302
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:34,014
- "Taking courier, beer run.
Rory."

303
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,320
- Classic.
- What?

304
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,670
There's no couriers,
there's no flashers.

305
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,194
There's no--

306
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:44,851
At least there's
a Time Bureau manual.

307
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,940
- And gummy bears.

308
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:51,161
- That's where I stashed
my emergency supply.

309
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,424
- So that's it.
Just a book and some gummies.

310
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,513
No couriers.
- No flashers.

311
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:58,255
No mini-Gideon.
- No breath mints.

312
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,432
- Hey, look, it's okay.
You guys, it's gonna be okay.

313
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,784
Look, as long as the town
keeps buying our cover story,

314
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,916
then we'll come up with plan B.

315
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,744
It's gonna be great.

316
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,839
- That fella wasn't
Mr. Hoover at all!

317
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:20,887
Hair products, my foot.

318
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,324
Is this the Bureau
of Investigation?

319
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,848
This is Sheriff Thomas Wood
of Odessa, Texas.

320
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:29,460
I've got a situation down here
you ought to know about.

321
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:34,552
- Wow, so we're really
doing this?

322
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:37,077
We're living in 1925
for a spell.

323
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,948
- 1925 is a total hayseed year.

324
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,515
These people are covered
in sunspots.

325
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,647
Microdermabrasion,
still decades away.

326
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,040
- Main thing I know
about the '20s is that

327
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,086
they invented a lot
of dance moves.

328
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,696
Maybe we should get out
of this small town

329
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,437
and find the parties--
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

330
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,091
No, that goes against Rule 23,

331
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,006
which states that in order
to limit potential damage

332
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,965
to the timeline, marooned time
travelers should stay in one--

333
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,401
one location.

334
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:00,013
- Okay, then we will stay put.
All right?

335
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:02,015
We'll figure it out.
First things first,

336
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,364
we got the whole town
coming over tonight,

337
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,627
and they are
expecting a circus.

338
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,237
- We have to put on a show
to protect our cover.

339
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,631
- If there is no circus,
they may inadvertently

340
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,459
see the Waverider wreckage--
- Whoa!

341
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,113
Which violates, like,
half of this manual.

342
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,636
That cannot happen.
- Okay, well,

343
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:18,553
I just hope that
we get this done before--

344

You're early!
Hi!

346
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,124
- It looks like the humans
won the War of the Worlds.

347
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,735
We're all still here.

348
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,302
Mija, tell me,
why are people in town

349
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,913
asking about a circus
on my property?

350
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,262
- We need to talk.

351
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,351
- Are those my curtains?

352
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,136
Is that Celso's suit?
- Yes.

353
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,445
- I don't see
how this circus act

354
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,056
gets us any closer
to getting out of here.

355
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,405
- This is just triage, Astra.

356
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,841
Dealing with the problem
at hand.

357
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,973
Without the Waverider,

358
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:48,148
we don't have a lot of options.

359
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,933
So if we are to convince
these town people

360
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,283
that we are actually a circus,

361
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:56,069
we need to practice.
Let's go.

362

Want those juggling skills
on point!

363
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:02,336
- You juggle, right?
- Is it that obvious?

364
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
- They need to distract
everyone

365
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:06,993
from seeing the remains
of the timeship,

366
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,733

attacked the house,

368

00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:32,799
to tell us
how badly we've ruined it.

800
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:34,017
That's it.

801
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,236
I want to die. Goodbye.

802
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,324
I give up.

803
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,108
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

804
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,372
Goodbye!
- Babe?

805
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,503
- Did we break Ava?

806
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:43,462
- Hey, hey, babe, you okay?

807
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,855
- No.
- Yeah, you're okay.

808
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,422
Look, I know I talked you
into this plan,

809
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,685
and it has admittedly
gone sideways.

810
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:52,297
But we are--
we're pretty committed, okay?

811
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,385
So we gotta see
this one through.

812
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:54,386
- I can't--

813
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,648
- Yes, you can, and then

814
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,171
when we get back to 2021,

815
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,391
we are gonna go
on a real honeymoon.

816
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,828
It'll be on the beach,
we'll walk hand-in-hand.

817
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:05,135
We'll--we'll listen to one
of your Stabcast podcasts

818
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:07,225
and watch the sunset.
It'll be like--

819
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,140
- Stabcast.

820
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:13,274
That's it.

821
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,189
There are no witnesses.

822
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,756
We're lucky.

823
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,366
We gotta hit the road, fast.

824
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,282
But first,

825
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:24,285
we gotta get rid of the body.

826
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,418
- Ava?
- Gary, that's your job.

827
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,941
Lose the glasses.

828
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:29,377
- Oh!

829
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:30,726
- You want me to eat

830
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,119
one of the most
important figures

831
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,512
of the 20th century?

832
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:35,296
- We gotta get to New York,
and we gotta there fast.

833
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,819
We gotta find this Gwynn Davies

834
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,343
without messing up
the timeline any more,

835
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,301
and the first thing to do

836
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:41,433
is to eat this body.

837
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,173
- What has gotten into you?

838
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:46,568
- I have been reading true
crime stories my entire life.

839
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:47,569
This is my time to shine.

840
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:51,399
Shut up and eat up, Gary.

841
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,706
You're in
the Bullet Blondes now.

842
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:56,535
- I'm a Bullet Blonde?

843
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:58,493
I swear I take
no pleasure in this.

844
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,321
Beyond just the taste
of human meat,

845
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:03,324
which as you know, I find...

846
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,065
quite delicious.

847
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,458
- Do it, Gary.

You're capable of so much more

You have a terrible

- Tell me, what did you do
to hurt yourself so much?

856
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:42,581
- I tried to perform a spell
that I wasn't ready for,

00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:47,629
My former mentor would be

so disappointed
if he were here right now,

860

saying I have to be willing
to walk alone

00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,723
and risk it all
if I want to succeed.

862
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:05,647
- You know, my mother
was a great healer.

863
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:09,172
She taught me everything
that she knew.

864
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:12,524
But I was terrible at it.

865
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,483
It wasn't until I was able
to cast off her training,

866
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:19,792
start fresh in a way
that reflected who I am,

867
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:22,142
that I truly
became a healer myself.

868
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,405
- Yeah, but...

869
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:27,756
walk alone, sacrifice yourself,

870
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,368
that's what magic is about.

871
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:39,289
- Your mentor taught you
how he did magic, yeah?

872
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,683
But you're not him.

873
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,602
- R.I.P.

874
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:50,475
- So you're just gonna bury
the pieces of the Waverider?

875
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,912
- Well, it ain't
gonna bury itself.

876
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:54,609

00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:58,004
Astra Logue
getting sentimental.

- Look, I'm sorry

880
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,879
I brought the cops
to your mom's place.

881
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:05,533
I don't blame you
for being pissed about it.

882
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:08,580
- No, I get it.
You were trying to help.

883
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,930
- I wasn't just trying
to help you, though.

884
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:15,978
I was trying to prove myself
to replace John.

885
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:18,198
I just wanted to show everyone
that I was worthy,

Astra, I wasn't mad
about the cops.

I wasn't happy about them,

that you almost died.

You're like my best friend.

said that to me.
