I'm the one who's
testifying against you.

3
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:04,908
In a shocking fall
from grace,

4
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:07,150
the Star City council
has voted to impeach

5
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:09,920
mayor Oliver Queen
and remove him from office.

6
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:12,134
I'm thinking about
moving up your trial.

7
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,866
I got a lot of friends
at the courthouse.

8
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:17,912
<i>Speculation
that the former mayor is</i>

00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:20,235
<i>secretly the Green Arrow
has multiplied</i>

10
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,265
<i>in recent weeks
after his decision</i>

11
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:25,105
<i>to terminate two city
officials investigating him</i>

12
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:26,477
<i>led to his impeachment.</i>

13
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:28,918
<i>If convicted, Oliver Queen
could face</i>

14
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,210
<i>a life sentence.</i>

15
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,704
<i>His fate now rests
in Star City's justice system.</i>

16
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,463
John.

17
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:45,254
I'm getting you
out of here.

18
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:49,086
Ha ha! What the hell
are you doing here?

19
00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:51,980
I need your help
in Star City.

22
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:01,918
<i>Mr. Queen, do you
know who the Flash is?</i>

23
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:03,142
<i>What about the identities</i>

<i>of the other vigilantes
working with the Green Arrow?</i>

25
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,372
<i>Mr. Queen, how long
will this trial last?</i>

26
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,420
<i>Will you be acquitted?</i>

27
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:14,818
And the media wonders
why everyone hates them.

28
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,595
Thank you,
officer.

29
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,035
You can wait
outside.

30
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:20,716
I'm right where
Mr. Diaz wants me.

31
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,553
I need to have
a privileged conversation

32
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,697
with my client.

33
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:26,427
Nobody's stopping you.

34
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,227
Since you fired
district attorney Armand,

35
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:33,675
the D.A.'s office has
brought

36
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,368
an outside counsel
to prosecute.

37
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:36,618
Ok, well, that
could be a good thing.

38
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:38,375
I mean, someone who's
not in Diaz's pocket.

39
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:39,996
Have you heard of
Alexa Van Owen?

40
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:41,488
Should I have heard of her?

41
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:44,783
She took down Intergang
and Bruno Mannheim.

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,326
She's prosecuted CEOs
and serial killers,

43
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:49,372
and she has CIA-caliber
investigators that say

44
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,152
they can find anything
and everything.

45
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,265
Her conviction rate is 99%.

46
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:54,616
She called me
last night,

47
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:55,847
and she offered
a plea.

48
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:58,124
Single count of first-degree
manslaughter.

49
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,362
That doesn't sound so bad.

50
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,373
With a 15-year
minimum sentence.

51
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,169
That sounds bad.
We're not taking that, right?

52
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:04,853
We're not taking any deal.

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,603
Look, Van Owen isn't
in Diaz's pocket,

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,124
but we have every
reason to believe

55
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,425
that Judge McGarvey is.

56
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:11,918
I mean, this whole
system is against you.

57
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,994
No deal.

58
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:18,004
Get me an acquittal.

59
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:20,845
I'm not doing it,
Rene.

60
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:22,636
I'm not playing
make believe with you.

61
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:24,626
It's a mock trial,
not make believe,

62
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,296
and we got to get
our stories straight.

63
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,898
Well, I'm planning
on pleading the fifth.

64
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,615
Did you have a different
amendment in mind?

65
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,614
We can't plead the fifth
without looking guilty.

66
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,798
We are guilty,
we are vigilantes,

67
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,705
and we know Oliver
is the Green Arrow.

68
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,775
Which is why we got to lie
through our teeth,

69
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,078
and we got to be convincing.

70
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,425
We got to have
our stories straight.

71
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:41,714
Hoss, you want
to weigh in on this?

72
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,323
You've been
real quiet.

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,837
Why? It's not like I'm
gonna have to testify.

74
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:48,308
Curtis, please don't
tell me you have FOMO

75
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:49,925
because you weren't
subpoenaed.

76
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,824
Yeah, I have major FOMO.
Don't I rate?

77
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,448
You know, maybe you are
just so much better

78
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,520
at maintaining your
secret identity than the rest of us.

79
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:57,533
Guys, can we be real
for a second here?

80
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,475
I mean, Oliver's facing
life in prison.

81
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:00,538
Yeah, and I guess

82
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm just a little
bit surprised

83
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:03,601
that you care,
not that I think

84
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:06,240
you actually want Oliver to go
to prison, Rene, but come on.

85
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:10,267
Oliver's a jerk. My position
on that hasn't changed.

86
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:12,268
But what also hasn't changed
is the position

87
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,441
that he's in right now.

88
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:18,519
He's in it because of me.

89
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,449
You're right.

90
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:23,901
And I think
we can all agree

91
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:26,052
no matter what
our feelings are about Oliver,

92
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,831
none of us want him
to go to prison.

93
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:29,301
Am I right?

94
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:32,832
Damn right.

95
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,441
From where I'm sitting,
it's pretty simple.

96
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:41,277
They've got
the wrong guy.

97
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:43,693
Oliver Queen isn't
the Green Arrow

98
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,013
any more than I am.

99
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,470
And for the record,
I'm not the Green Arrow.

100
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,365
There appears to be
a fair amount of evidence

101
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,224
to suggest the former
mayor is guilty.

102
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,234
What evidence?

103
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,478
That photo from several months ago,
that was doctored.

104
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,835
And I don't know who
they're gonna find

105
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,706
to say "Oliver's the Green Arrow,"
but they'll be lying.

106
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,764
- You sound pretty sure of that.
- I am.

107
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,941
I'm the guy that arrested Oliver
6 years ago, remember?

108
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,348
I watched him pass
a polygraph.

109
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,190
He's not
the Green Arrow.

110
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:08,310
Do you know who is?

111
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,152
I got a few guesses.

112
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:11,932
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

113
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,523
You're welcome.

114
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:15,513
Oh, hey.

115
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,271
Sorry. They told me
I could come in here.

116
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:19,409
Uh, no, that's fine,
right? We're finished.

117
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,801
Actually, maybe we could
just get some b-roll.

118
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,418
As the Black Canary,

119
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,675
you have to know who
the Green Arrow is.

120
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:27,226
I do.

121
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,537
And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.

122
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,652
Happy? Got your
sound bite? Good.

123
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,759
This looks bigger
than the O.J. trial.

124
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,661
How would you know?
You were in, like, fourth grade.

125
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:44,276
Yeah, but I watch
"American Crime Story."

126
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:45,970
I guess John decided
not to show.

127
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,637
I knew he was pissed, but
I didn't know he was that pissed.

128
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,870
Guys. Hey.

129
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:53,173
Thank you so much
for coming.

130
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,191
Well, you know,
they were subpoenaed.

131
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,360
But we also wanted
to show our support.

132
00:05:58,437 --> 00:05:59,674
Yeah, we have
your back.

133
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:03,675
Thank you.
Really, thank you.

134
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,499
Hey.

135
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,595
So many reporters
outside.

136
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:11,579
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. You ok?

137
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:13,840
I always thought the worst thing that
could happen to dad

138
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,481
is he'd get hurt.

139
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,537
I know.

140
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:18,396
Ok. He's been through
something like this before.

141
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:22,308
I mean, not exactly like
this, but something and...

142
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:25,120
It's gonna be ok.

143
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:31,092
All rise.
Docket number 11-19-41-73,

144
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,025
"The People
vs. Oliver Jonas Queen."

145
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:35,554
Status of the parties?

146
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,220
Ready for trial.

147
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,917
Ready for trial.

148
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:41,019
Then let's begin.

149
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,681
Oliver Queen is a hero.

150
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,585
He is.

151
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:49,823
He's saved this city

152
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,112
more times
than anybody can count,

153
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,647
but he's done it all
from behind a mask

154
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:59,144
so that he could take
the law into his own hands.

155
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:03,573
In fact, he's taken
as many lives as he's saved.

156
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,000
So, yes, Oliver Queen
is a hero,

157
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:10,085
but that doesn't mean he's
not also a criminal.

158
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,970
3 weeks ago,

159
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:18,029
Oliver Queen was mayor
of this city.

160
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,128
In that time, he has gone
from being under indictment

161
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,401
to impeachment
to being on trial.

162
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,209
How? How could everything
go wrong so quickly for him?

163
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:32,651
I think intuitively you know
the answer.

164
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:36,540
Corruption. It runs through
this city like a cancer,

165
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:40,554
compromising some city officials
while discrediting others,

166
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,677
like... like the defendant.

167
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,916
Even the anti-vigilante law that
he's being charged under is

168
00:07:46,993 --> 00:07:49,230
the work of the corrupt
men and women

169
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:52,064
who are holding our city
in their grip.

170
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:54,416
This may sound like
a conspiracy theory,

171
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,682
but at the conclusion
of this trial,

172
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,882
I'm going to ask you what is
most likely,

173
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,076
that our city's government
has been compromised

174
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:07,409
or that we elected a superhero
as our mayor?

175
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,467
Ms. Van Owen, please
call your first witness.

176
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:14,776
The people call John Diggle.

177
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:20,167
Where is he?

178
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:23,727
A bench warrant will
issue for Mr. Diggle.

179
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,713
If he's not made to
appear within one hour,

180
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,300
he'll be held in
contempt of this court.

181
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:30,432
Is your next witness
ready?

182
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,972
Yes, your honor.

183
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,038
Please state
your name and occupation

184
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,032
for the record.

185
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:37,743
Dr. Elisa Schwartz.

186
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,135
I'm an attending
physician

187
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:41,273
at Starling General
Hospital.

188
00:08:41,817 --> 00:08:43,419
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.

189
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:45,574
And you've had an occasion
to treat the defendant?

190
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,615
- Yes.
- For various suspicious

191
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:48,829
injuries. Is that correct?

192
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,724
I can't say without
violating

193
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,577
doctor-patient
confidentiality.

194
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:53,583
I understand.

195
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,624
Then let me direct your
attention, please,

196
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,143
to an incident when
Mr. Queen was not a patient.

197
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,296
On the night of
April 6, 2016,

198
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,915
the Green Arrow brought in
the Black Canary.

199
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,615
And according to your
records,

200
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:06,833
she had been stabbed.

201
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,357
Objection. Is there
a question in our future?

202
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:12,791
Yes. That night,
you were close enough

203
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:15,347
to the Green Arrow to
determine his identity.

204
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:19,314
So my question is, whose
face did you see that night?

205
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,002
I was focused on saving
Ms. Lance's life.

206
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,879
I wasn't the least
bit concerned

207
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,723
with who
the Green Arrow was.

208
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:29,143
Concern or not, whose face did you see
underneath that mask?

209
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,242
Well, it's not bad.
Oliver might just pull this one off.

210
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:34,442
You want to put
money on that?

211
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:37,245
Diaz wants Oliver
in prison.

212
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,463
You think he'd
want to kill him.

213
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,492
I mean, at least try.

214
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,411
What, so the Green Arrow
can become a martyr?

215
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,219
Diaz is smarter
than that.

216
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,396
I have to go.

217
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:49,194
Diaz yank your leash?

218
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:50,639
Something like that.

219
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,594
You know, you don't
have to go.

220
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,705
The first step to
standing up to him

221
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,101
is to stand up to him.

222
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,437
Sounds like
the first step

223
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,762
to getting
myself killed.

224
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,594
Not for nothing,
but apart from your face,

225
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,017
there is one thing
you've got in common

226
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,172
- with my Laurel.
- And what's that?

227
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:08,564
Neither of you would let
somebody else tell you

228
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,429
what to do or have
you running scared.

229
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:13,325
You think your Laurel
would stand up to Diaz?

230
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:14,598
I know it.

231
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:17,358
Well, maybe if she
were a little smarter,

232
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,133
she wouldn't have gotten
herself killed.

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,765
It's been one hour.

234
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:28,429
Mr. Diggle having not yet appeared,

235
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,887
he is hereby in
contempt of this court.

236
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:33,727
I'm sorry I'm late,
your honor.

237
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:37,883
I had some business to take
care of out of town.

238
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,703
Oliver Queen is not
the Green Arrow.

239
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,393
I can't make it any
plainer than that.

240
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,921
How can you be so sure?

241
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:49,867
From 2012-16, I was
his personal bodyguard.

242
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,657
If he was running around
with a bow and arrow,

243
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,988
I would've known it.

244
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:55,517
But would you admit
knowing it?

245
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:56,316
Why wouldn't I?

246
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,679
Because you were aiding
and abetting a vigilante?

247
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,402
I absolutely was not.

248
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,968
In fact, I had very limited interaction
with Oliver Queen.

249
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:03,980
How can that be?

250
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:06,282
You were head of his
security at city hall.

251
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,258
And my job was to keep
him safe.

252
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,349
And that included not
jumping off of rooftops.

253
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:13,978
Well, Mr. Diggle, you can't
even keep yourself safe.

254
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:15,476
I mean, in the past 4 years,

255
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:17,470
you've been abducted by
Damien Darhk,

256
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,564
your own child was
also kidnapped.

257
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:22,564
You were hospitalized
for nerve damage caused

258
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,485
by severe trauma.

259
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:27,562
Mr. Diggle,
either you travel

260
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,641
in some very dangerous
circles,

261
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,844
or you have
the worst luck ever.

262
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,238
Who was Sean Sonus?

263
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,646
Objection. Relevance.

264
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:38,973
- Overruled.
- Your honor?

265
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,871
I said, overruled.
Answer the question.

266
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,818
He was a drug dealer
I investigated

267
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:47,022
while undercover in the Central
City police department.

268
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,226
And he was shot and killed
in Hub City last year.

269
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:52,417
Your honor, I renew my
objection as to relevance.

270
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,295
Well, if Ms. Drake
is a murderer,

271
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:55,470
it would certainly
undermine

272
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,386
her credibility,
now, wouldn't it?

273
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:00,326
Objection overruled again.

274
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,935
Sit down, Ms. Loring.

275
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,357
So you were not
with the Central City police department

276
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,764
when Mr. Sonus was killed.

277
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:07,574
Is that correct?

278
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:09,278
- That's right.
- Did you murder him?

279
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:10,719
Your honor!

280
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,768
Answer the question.

281
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:20,194
I'm exercising my
fifth amendment right

282
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,320
against
self-incrimination.

283
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,680
You beckoned?

284
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:38,742
I saw something
interesting on TV.

285
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,891
And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.

286
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:46,078
Is there a problem?

287
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:48,256
Not yet,
there isn't.

288
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,009
You know, this would move
a lot faster

289
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,285
if you would stop
talking in circles.

290
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:56,247
You were given the
gift-wrapped opportunity

291
00:12:56,512 --> 00:13:00,610
to say that Oliver Queen
was the Green Arrow.

292
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,296
You didn't do it,
baby.

293
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,145
I was unaware
I was supposed to.

294
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,078
Well, that's why
we're here

295
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,504
having this
little meeting,

296
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,883
so we can set
expectations.

297
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,851
The prosecution
is holding you

298
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,852
as a rebuttal
witness.

299
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,667
So when they call you,

300
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:21,459
you're gonna be
the final nail in the coffin.

301
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:24,190
If I go in and try
and convince a courtroom

302
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:27,711
that I'm Laurel Lance,
I'm gonna get made.

303
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,883
Maybe you're right.

304
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:35,777
You don't have
a poker face.

305
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:39,691
For example...

306
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:44,121
The way you've been
acting lately, hmm?

307
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,855
Ever since I torched
Fredericco

308
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,559
on that rooftop,

309
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,181
you've been keeping
your distance from me.

310
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,691
I don't know what
you're talking about.

311
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:57,290
It's ok.

312
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,508
You're ok.

313
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,382
I just want to be
a little clearer.

314
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,835
When you take
the stand,

315
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:13,224
I want you to give
the jury

316
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:15,522
a much better
performance

317
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:18,186
than the one
you're giving me.

318
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,350
You know what I'm
talking about now?

319
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:27,850
Good.
That's a good girl.

320
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,202
Got to go
to the courthouse.

321
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,602
It's not going
too good, is it?

322
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,629
Hey. No, it's going fine.
It's fine.

323
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:47,787
That was just
the prosecution's turn.

324
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:51,113
So when it's our turn, we're
gonna kick some major ass.

325
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,452
That's a legal term.

326
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:56,856
Why don't you go and get
yourself something

327
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,912
that's not too unhealthy from
the vending machine, ok?

328
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:00,253
Ok.

329
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,623
What will happen
if Mr. Oliver goes to jail?

330
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,538
He's not going
to jail, Raisa.

331
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,311
He's not
the Green Arrow.

332
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:13,702
I think we both know better.

333
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:19,994
I tanked it.

334
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:22,061
I did exactly
what you said not to do.

335
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:23,533
The lawyer's
good, D.

336
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,279
Don't worry.
I'll bring it home.

337
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:27,635
How? You got immunity
from the prosecution.

338
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:29,704
If watching every episode
of "Law & Order" ever

339
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:30,828
has taught me anything,

340
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:32,471
it's that you can't
plead the fifth.

341
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,185
If you get cornered and you
refuse to testify,

342
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:35,435
you could go to jail, Rene.

343
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:37,428
Well, then I'll go
to jail, Hoss.

344
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:40,133
But I'm not screwing
Oliver over again.

345
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,283
Hey, guys, the clerk
is calling court

346
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,788
back into session.

347
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,866
I worked in the mayor's
office close to a year,

348
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:52,826
side by side with
Mr. Queen

349
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:54,647
every single day.

350
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,865
If he was running around
pretending to be

351
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:00,148
Robin Hood,
I would've known.

352
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,796
And did you know it?

353
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,061
Mr. Ramirez?

354
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,858
Mr. Ramirez, did you have
occasion to determine

355
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:19,350
whether Oliver Queen was
the Green Arrow?

356
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:26,280
Rene.

357
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,225
He's the Green Arrow.

358
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:38,490
Oliver is.

359
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,399
And you know
this because you were

360
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:43,033
a member of his vigilante
team, weren't you?

361
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:44,826
Yeah.

362
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,794
And as a member
of that team,

363
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:48,696
did you ever see
the defendant

364
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,908
kill or maim anyone
as the Green Arrow?

365
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:53,677
Yeah.

366
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:56,408
How many people did he
kill or maim?

367
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:00,834
I don't know.

368
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:02,095
Ballpark it for me.

369
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:03,978
I don't know.

370
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,025
It's too many
to count.

371
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,841
Order. Order!

372
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:14,314
The prosecution
rests, your honor.

373
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,245
Are you ok?
Are you hurt?

374
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:31,747
I'm fine. He picked
me up from school.

375
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:33,607
He was with
a police officer.

376
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,314
They said you were hurt.

377
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:38,501
He was here, and we
just let him walk?

378
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,426
We're not
letting him walk.

379
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,791
Let's get out of here.

380
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:54,722
Hey, look at you.

381
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,148
Maybe you don't care
about people

382
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,509
finding out
the truth about you.

383
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,368
That's right. I don't care.

384
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,296
Whatever it takes
to stop you.

385
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,133
How about taking on
the entire police force?

386
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,240
How does that sound
to you?

387
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,403
You want us to
light 'em up, boss?

388
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,450
That depends
on them.

389
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:13,508
My man.

390
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,410
What do you want us
to do with them?

391
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,071
Nothing.

392
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,099
If they had
an accident

393
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:23,187
I'd have to testify,
and it'd be awkward.

394
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,384
Hey.

395
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:28,290
Smile. It's your
lucky day, baby.

396
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,105
Ok. Is this as bad
as it looks?

397
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,970
Arguably worse.

398
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:41,305
Can... can we prove

399
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:44,424
that, uh, Diaz was putting
pressure on Rene?

400
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:45,871
No, no, no.
I mean, even assuming

401
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,896
we could, the jury has

402
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,411
no idea
who Ricardo Diaz is.

403
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:53,629
Conventional wisdom says
you never ask a client

404
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:56,019
if they are guilty
because the more I know,

405
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,746
the more it might tie
my hands,

406
00:18:57,823 --> 00:19:00,825
but I am gonna ask.

407
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,708
Are you the Green Arrow?

408
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,701
Yes.

409
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:14,699
Then I'm gonna propose
a new strategy.

410
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:15,827
Ok.

411
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,373
- Jury nullification.
- Hmm?

412
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,953
You're going to admit to
being the Green Arrow.

413
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,347
We are then going
to highlight

414
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:24,315
every single thing you
have done for this city,

415
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:25,632
all the times you have
saved it.

416
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:28,372
We will argue you do not
deserve to go to prison.

417
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:31,892
This is a legitimate
chance, Oliver.

418
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,283
I can't do it.

419
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,575
Why not?

420
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,239
I'd be putting a target
on my back,

421
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:38,707
I'd be putting a target

422
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:41,723
on my wife and son's back.

423
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:45,793
I have been the Green Arrow
for 6 years.

424
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,471
I didn't plan on doing it
forever.

425
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:50,965
I thought that one day,
my mission would end

426
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,789
and I would finally,
after all this time,

427
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:57,391
get a chance to actually
live my life.

428
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,750
That will never happen...

429
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:07,954
If I tell the whole world
that I'm the Green Arrow.

430
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,998
You don't have
to testify.

431
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:20,413
Jean doesn't have
to call you.

432
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,829
Yes, she does,
and I want to testify.

433
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,422
I don't want you
in a position

434
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:26,315
where you perjure
yourself because of me.

435
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,190
Oh, well, let me just add it
to the long list of felonies

436
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,276
I've already committed
for you.

437
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,477
Look, John has
something planned.

438
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:35,037
You don't have
to take the chance.

439
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,686
I will take any chance
if it keeps you

440
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,797
from being taken away
from me and William.

441
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:41,657
Court is back
in session.

442
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:43,579
Here we go.

443
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:50,887
I graduated
Summa Cum Laude

444
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,096
from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology

445
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:54,343
with master's degrees

446
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,438
in Cyber Security
and Computer Sciences.

447
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:59,228
From 2015-16,
I served as the CEO

448
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,264
of Palmer Tech,
Incorporated.

449
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:02,545
Thank you.

450
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,046
The defense moves to have
Ms. Smoak accepted

451
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:06,155
as an expert witness.

452
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,508
I don't see the point
of this, Ms. Loring.

453
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:08,887
I want the witness
testify

454
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,757
as to the validity of
this photograph.

455
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,882
Fine, but make it quick.

456
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:17,077
Ms. Smoak, this appears
to be a photograph

457
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:19,180
of your husband,
Oliver Queen,

458
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,110
dressed as
the Green Arrow.

459
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:23,985
Yes. The key words
being "appears to be."

460
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:25,608
This photo
has been doctored.

461
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,421
A pixel level analysis
will show

462
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:29,423
almost undetectable
light shifts

463
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,270
and resolution
inconsistencies

464
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:33,326
that would not be present
in a natural photo.

465
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:34,405
Objection, your honor.

466
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:35,680
What is the point
of showing us

467
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,895
an allegedly doctored
photograph at all?

468
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:39,735
The better question
would be who,

469
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,575
and why would they
doctor a photo

470
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:43,526
to make Oliver Queen look
like the Green Arrow

471
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,040
if he were the Green Arrow?

472
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,653
I mean, which he's not. He's
my husband. I would know.

473
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,611
No further questions.

474
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,875
When was Mr. Queen arrested?

475
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,495
November 21, 2017.

476
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:57,284
And when were
the two of you married?

477
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:58,435
November 28th.

478
00:21:58,512 --> 00:22:00,458
- Just a week later.
- Yes.

479
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,318
Is it possible that you
rushed the wedding

480
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:04,497
so that you could claim
spousal privilege

481
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,303
just in case you had to
testify against Mr. Queen?

482
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,530
I have been in love
with Oliver for 6 years.

483
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:12,499
Trust me, it felt
anything but rushed.

484
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:13,895
Let's change the topic.

485
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,992
Your father's Noah Kuttler,
the alleged Calculator.

486
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,870
- Objection.
- Overruled.

487
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:19,086
He's reformed.

488
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:20,616
But before he was,

489
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:21,805
did you know that he was

490
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,294
a notorious computer hacker
and cyber criminal?

491
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:25,472
No. I had no idea.

492
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,796
Doesn't say much about your
ability to see criminality

493
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:29,471
in people close to you,
does it?

494
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,133
- I w...
- And under the heading

495
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,028
"apples falling from trees,"

496
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:35,951
have you yourself ever
engaged in cyber crime?

497
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:37,951
No, I haven't.

498
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:41,134
Good luck proving
otherwise, Ms. Van Owen.

499
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:45,150
Roy Harper is not
a vigilante.

500
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,769
He sacrificed himself
to protect the identity

501
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,805
of a man that the city
at the time

502
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:54,045
referred to as the Hood
or the Arrow.

503
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,487
I've since come to learn
that the Green Arrow is

504
00:22:56,564 --> 00:22:57,729
the same person.

505
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:58,997
But that's not you.

506
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:00,616
It's absolutely not me.

507
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,433
And do you know who it is?

508
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,724
Yes, I do, but I will not
reveal his identity...

509
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,213
Not even if it sends
me to prison.

510
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,662
Pass the witness.

511
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,554
Well, that's convenient.

512
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,241
You're not the Green Arrow.

513
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:17,431
You know who is
the Green Arrow,

514
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,575
but you're not saying.

515
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:20,505
Well, I keep my promises,
Ms. Van Owen.

516
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:22,227
When did you meet
this mystery man?

517
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:24,374
Shortly after I returned
to Star City.

518
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:26,542
As you know, I was
marooned for 5 years

519
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:28,417
on an island named Lian Yu.

520
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,612
This photograph was taken
during that 5-year period.

521
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:31,625
I'm just curious.

522
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,821
Why does Lian Yu look
a lot like Russia?

523
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:35,691
- Objection.
- Overruled.

524
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:37,323
We obtained this photograph

525
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,048
from a reporter by the name
of Susan Williams.

526
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:43,493
I have not been
entirely forthcoming

527
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,251
about that period of time
in my life.

528
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:50,970
Parts of it were spent
in Hong Kong,

529
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:54,446
and, yes, parts of it
were spent in Russia.

530
00:23:54,523 --> 00:23:59,329
So you lied repeatedly
and publicly.

531
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,958
You lied about being on
Lian Yu,

532
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:04,736
and you lied about
5 years of your life,

533
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:07,251
which begs the question,
Mr. Queen,

534
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,907
what else have you lied about
lied about?

535
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,025
Quiet! Quiet,
or I'll clear the courtroom.

536
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:33,988
Please state
your name for the record.

537
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:37,593
Thomas Merlyn. Tommy's
fine if you want.

538
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,844
Mr. Merlyn,
you were declared dead

539
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:41,793
May 15, 2013.

540
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,496
That night,
my father destroyed

541
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:45,417
a large portion
of the city.

542
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,641
With the heightened
scrutiny on my family,

543
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,788
I took the opportunity
to fake my own death

544
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,981
to protect my identity
as the Hood.

545
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:57,409
Three years ago, Roy Harper
confessed to being the Hood.

546
00:24:57,486 --> 00:24:59,130
To protect me.

547
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:02,001
And then he was
attacked in prison.

548
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,470
I have lived with
that guilt for 3 years.

549
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:11,180
I am not about to let
Oliver take the blame

550
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:14,025
for me the same way
that Roy did.

551
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:16,719
And that's why
I'm here...

552
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:18,679
To set the record
straight.

553
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:22,189
Thank you. Your witness.

554
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,537
If you're the Green Arrow,
how come Rene Ramirez

555
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:30,000
testified under oath
that Oliver Queen is?

556
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:34,023
Well, I would suspect that
he was being pressured to.

557
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,749
Are you saying he
perjured himself?

558
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,931
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a lawyer.

559
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:39,767
I'm just
the Green Arrow.

560
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:43,456
And I am telling you
I am the only man

561
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,579
that has ever worn
this hood.

562
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:48,218
Mr. Merlyn,
you're under arrest

563
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:50,133
on suspicion of
murder, assault,

564
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,465
and violation of the
anti-vigilante act of 2017.

565
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:56,118
The bailiff will remand
Mr. Merlyn into custody.

566
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,379
Objection, your honor.

567
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,443
It's the people's contention
that Mr. Merlyn here is

568
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,684
not the Green Arrow.

569
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:01,754
Be that as it may,

570
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:03,864
I can't just let him walk
out of my courtroom.

571
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,572
You know, if it's
any consolation,

572
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,474
my team is
going to extract me

573
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:09,739
before I ever get
to prison, so...

574
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:11,745
Get him out of here.

575
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:14,918
Your honor, the defense
moves for a dismissal.

576
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:17,305
Nice try, but it's
the jury's job to sort out

577
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:18,653
this kind of mess,

578
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,953
and that's what
I'm gonna let them do.

579
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:31,278
Guys, on the way
to Iron Heights,

580
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:32,994
you think we could stop
at a drive-through?

581
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,010
I am starving.

582
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,646
We're not going to
Iron Heights.

583
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:38,053
Mr. Diaz really wants
to meet you.

584
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,987
All right. So where did we
land on the drive-through?

585
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,218
It's my treat.

586
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,693
Ha ha ha!

587
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:45,288
You know,
6 against one.

588
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:47,024
That's not
really a fair fight.

589
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:50,103
You should've brought
backup. I did.

590
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:00,907
You're cutting it a little close there,
aren't you, John?

591
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:04,072
What's your
exit strategy?

592
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,069
Sitting right there.

593
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:10,291
Well, let's go.

594
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:17,083
- Thanks for doing this.
- My pleasure.

595
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,939
I always wanted to say,
"I am Spartacus."

596
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:24,605
Christopher Chance.

597
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:25,874
Rene Ramirez.

598
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:28,323
Hey, I think I bought
you a perjury charge back there, Rene.

599
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,314
A small price to pay
for a clear conscience.

600
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:31,743
You think it worked?

601
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,464
At the very least,
we've created

602
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,509
some very serious
reasonable doubt.

603
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:38,002
Yeah. Let's hope so.

604
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:45,160
So...

605
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:47,882
When you said
I didn't have

606
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,101
to take the chance of
lying, that was a pun.

607
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:52,159
- I don't do puns.
- Well, that was Christopher Chance

608
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,385
I did just see in
there, right?

609
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:55,862
Yes. I'm sorry that
I couldn't loop you in.

610
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:57,828
We had officer Parks
listening

611
00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:00,318
to every word that
we said, and I...

612
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:07,895
I didn't know Chance was
gonna use Tommy's face.

613
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:09,683
Well, yeah, I mean,
I guess they were thinking,

614
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,151
"What's more compelling

615
00:28:11,228 --> 00:28:13,777
than a testimony from
a dead guy," right?

616
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:16,437
Excuse me.

617
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:18,892
- Mr. Mayor.
- We've got a problem.

618
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:21,498
Not anymore.
Chance just saved our bacon.

619
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,523
Laurel told me.

620
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,370
She also told me
that Diaz is making

621
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:26,879
her testify as
a rebuttal witness.

622
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:28,628
He's sending her
in there

623
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:31,086
with Chance's
entire CIA file.

624
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:33,534
She will be telling
the jury everything

625
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,371
about what you guys
just pulled in there,

626
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:39,340
or Diaz is going
to kill her.

627
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:41,862
How does Diaz
even know about Chance?

628
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:44,026
Because Diaz has access
to everything

629
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:46,683
that Cayden James learned
from his...

630
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:50,626
It's the bug in the bunker.

631
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:52,527
I'm sorry, Oliver.

632
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:54,702
We'll think of something.

633
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,559
I'll give you guys
some room.

634
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:04,684
Ok. Ok. So...

635
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:08,687
Ok, what's the something
that we're gonna think of?

636
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:11,002
Jean suggested that I just
admit I'm the Green Arrow

637
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,982
and we go for some sort
of jury nullification,

638
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,935
but I explained to her
that I would like

639
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:17,814
to have a life after
being the Green Arrow,

640
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,738
but, more
importantly, I...

641
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,479
I cannot put a target
on you and William.

642
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:24,767
Let me worry
about me and William.

643
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:25,737
Let me at least

644
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,418
take that off your plate.

645
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:30,414
That's not
how wedding vows work.

646
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:32,466
Well, we didn't
exchange vows.

647
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:35,933
But if we did, exchange
means "goes both ways."

648
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:39,970
So we fight for
each other, Oliver.

649
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:42,191
We protect each other.

650
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:45,588
We're gonna save each other.

651
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:47,234
I can't save anyone
from behind bars.

652
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:49,035
We'll get you out,
just like we got John out.

653
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:50,878
I could break out of
prison, Felicity,

654
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,691
but then what,
you know?

655
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,762
I... I'm not abandoning
the two of you.

656
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,605
I can't make the two
of you fugitives.

657
00:29:58,682 --> 00:29:59,987
Oh, we're gonna be ok.

658
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,550
John and I have been
talking,

659
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:06,137
and, uh, if I go
to prison, I need...

660
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:09,082
You and William
to go

661
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,928
into A.R.G.U.S.
protective custody.

662
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,047
Oliver...

663
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:16,447
We're not...

664
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,491
We're not there yet.

665
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,707
We cannot live in
denial, all right?

666
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,543
We have to have a plan.

667
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,770
I can handle
losing my freedom.

668
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:33,824
I cannot handle losing
you and William.

669
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:51,240
I solemnly affirm
to tell the truth,

670
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,784
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.

671
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:56,392
Ms. Lance,
the defendant here

672
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:58,615
has publicly acknowledged
that you were

673
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,039
the vigilante known
as the Black Canary.

674
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:03,691
Is it fair to take
Mr. Queen at his word?

675
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,602
On that, at least.

676
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,774
And being that
the Black Canary is

677
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:10,723
a known associate of
the Green Arrow,

678
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,369
is it fair to say you know
his true identity?

679
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:16,559
I do. I know who
the Green Arrow is.

680
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:18,727
Good girl.

681
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:20,821
Over the course of this trial,

682
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:25,127
we heard Rene Ramirez testify
that Oliver Queen was

683
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:29,299
the Green Arrow, but a man
calling himself Tommy Merlyn

684
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:30,931
claims that identity.

685
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:32,354
Ms. Lance,
if you would, please,

686
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:34,348
just help me out here.

687
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:36,946
Who's telling the truth?

688
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:41,296
I got an idea, Hoss.
Help me out?

689
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:42,695
Let's go.

690
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,294
Ms. Lance...

691
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:55,652
Who is the Green Arrow?

692
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,926
Tommy Merlyn.

693
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:07,842
Oliver Queen is not
the Green Arrow.

694
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:09,549
Order!

695
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:11,469
Testimony being closed,

696
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,972
we'll take a short recess

697
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:15,238
and resume
for closing arguments.

698
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,959
No comment. No comment!

699
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:24,573
Hey, back up. Give her
a break, please.

700
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,964
Hey, hey. Listen...

701
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,332
Are you ok?

702
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:29,851
Until Diaz gets a hold
of me, yeah.

703
00:32:29,928 --> 00:32:31,699
I thought you said you
were gonna bury Oliver.

704
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:32,833
That was the plan.

705
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,643
Well, what made you
change your mind?

706
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,022
You did.

707
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:39,526
"The first step to
standing up to him

708
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:41,229
is to stand up to him."

709
00:32:43,788 --> 00:32:45,199
You can't stay in town.

710
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:47,896
Don't worry.
Thanks to you, I now know

711
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:49,818
exactly what I have to do.

712
00:32:55,671 --> 00:33:00,430
Earlier, Judge McGarvey said
it fell upon you, the jury,

713
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:04,038
to sort out what he deemed
to be "a mess."

714
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:07,770
True, we have contradicting
witnesses.

715
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:10,633
And, yes, we have
conflicting testimonies,

716
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,536
but that is not a mess,
ladies and gentlemen.

717
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:18,530
That is the textbook definition
of reasonable doubt.

718
00:33:27,628 --> 00:33:31,400
15 minutes after being taken
into custody, Tommy Merlyn

719
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,856
was freed by members of
the Green Arrow's team.

720
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:36,129
Now, you might take that
as evidence

721
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,310
that he is, in fact,
the Green Arrow,

722
00:33:38,387 --> 00:33:40,048
but I would like to offer you

723
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,580
a much more
plausible explanation,

724
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:47,044
and that is Oliver Queen
has people and resources

725
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:51,270
at his disposal to do whatever
it takes to keep his secrets.

726
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:53,205
And don't think that
doesn't mean

727
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,094
someone falling out of the sky
into this courtroom

728
00:33:56,171 --> 00:33:58,623
with a false face
and a made-up story.

729
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,247
Because Tommy Merlyn is
just another Roy Harper.

730
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:05,806
He's just another man
willing to go to prison

731
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:09,176
to cover up the crimes that
that man committed.

732
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:13,577
Don't let him get away with it.
Not again.

733
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:18,311
Not ever again.

734
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,397
What happens now?

735
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:25,188
It's up to the jury.

736
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:30,048
Yeah, but what if Diaz
got to them, too?

737
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,831
Dad!

738
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,240
Hey. Ha ha!

739
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:44,428
William, I love you
very much.

740
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,452
I love
both of you very much.

741
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:48,277
And whatever happens,

742
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,484
nothing is
gonna change that.

743
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:50,505
What do you mean?

744
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:54,216
I mean that the man who
wants me in prison

745
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,345
controls the judge,

746
00:34:56,422 --> 00:35:00,215
and we think it's a pretty
good bet that he has

747
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:03,024
a strong influence
over the jury.

748
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,154
What does that mean?

749
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:09,319
It means I might be
going to prison, ok?

750
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:17,098
If that happens, Felicity
has assured me that she

751
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:21,131
is going to make sure
you grow into the man

752
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,543
that I know you can be.

753
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,361
I don't want you to go.

754
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:27,389
I don't want to go either.

755
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:31,113
Ok? I don't...

756
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:35,317
I wish it was up to me,
but it's not.

757
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:40,108
You are strong like me,

758
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,147
stronger even.

759
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:48,467
So whatever happens
and wherever I am...

760
00:35:53,214 --> 00:35:58,373
You need to know that I am
always right here with you.

761
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,174
- What is it?
- The jury's back.

762
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,108
They have a verdict.

763
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:14,522
Will the defendant
please rise?

764
00:36:15,113 --> 00:36:17,208
Please publish the verdict.

765
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:19,355
In the matter of the
"People v. Oliver Queen,"

766
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,524
on all 26 counts
of the indictment,

767
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:25,081
we find the defendant
guilty.

768
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:28,053
Members of the jury,

769
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,799
the court thanks you
for your service.

770
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:30,989
You're dismissed.

771
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,357
The defense moves

772
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:34,801
for judgment notwithstanding
the verdict.

773
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:36,828
Ms. Loring,
as you know,

774
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,952
the standard for granting
a JNOV requires a verdict

775
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:42,663
that no reasonable jury
could arrive at.

776
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,780
I find
such a circumstance here.

777
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:52,056
Your honor...

778
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:55,017
The evidence presented
was so conflicting

779
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:57,215
that it created
reasonable doubt.

780
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:58,316
The defense motion

781
00:36:58,393 --> 00:37:00,224
for a judgment
notwithstanding the verdict

782
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,540
is granted.

783
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:04,025
Mr. Queen, see probation.

784
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,288
Then you're free to go.

785
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,354
Oh, my God. How
is this possible?

786
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:15,999
I don't know.

787
00:37:23,414 --> 00:37:25,154
Congratulations, man.

788
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:26,626
Thank you.

789
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,794
I'm surprised Judge McGarvey had
it in him, you know?

790
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,862
I totally thought
he was in the tank for Diaz.

791
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:32,550
I absolutely am.

792
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:35,427
And Mr. Diaz isn't
the forgiving type.

793
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,556
Surprise.

794
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,786
Wait. Wait, wait.
When did you...?

795
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:45,577
During jury
deliberation.

796
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:48,391
You know, the judge
can argue that he got rolled,

797
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,194
but no one's gonna
believe him.

798
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:51,911
Thanks again, man.
I owe you another one.

799
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:53,411
Yeah, well,
after Kasnia,

800
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,184
let's just
call it even.

801
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:56,674
Chris...

802
00:37:57,186 --> 00:37:58,502
Thank you.

803
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,090
Yeah. Always happy
to help.

804
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:02,115
Just try not to
need me again

805
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,875
for at least
another year.

806
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,678
That was a brilliant move.
Thank you.

807
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,068
Well, I wish I could
take the credit, Oliver,

808
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:15,380
but it wasn't my idea.

809
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:19,278
Dad, you might want
to close your eyes for this part.

810
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:21,325
Th... that was just one time
I was scared.

811
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:24,115
That's not cool.
That's not cool at all.

812
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,863
Go to your room
and lock the door.

813
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,482
- Is it the guy from the courtroom?
- I said, go now.

814
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,448
You can take a shot
at me if you want to.

815
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:59,212
Just, it's gonna ruin
me saying thank you.

816
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:01,021
You can't be too safe.

817
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:08,386
Thank you.

818
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:10,036
Don't mention it.

819
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,610
When I rolled over on you
last November,

820
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:15,085
I was thinking about my kid,
even though I knew it meant

821
00:39:15,162 --> 00:39:17,060
it'd take you away
from yours.

822
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,290
I'm really sorry.

823
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,060
Apology accepted.

824
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,919
Look, I'm sorry if I...

825
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,446
made you feel like you
couldn't come to me

826
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:31,779
when Watson put you
in that position.

827
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:34,736
I'm very sorry

828
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:36,903
for everything that
happened afterwards.

829
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:47,112
It wasn't me.
I never did it.

830
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:48,694
Listen to me. It wasn't...

831
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:49,783
Uh!

832
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:53,997
It wasn't me, I swear.

833
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,610
The only law
that I abide by

834
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:00,661
is following through
on my word.

835
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:03,411
You failed at that.

836
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:06,266
So what would you
have me do?

837
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:08,929
These two men, they broke
into my chambers.

838
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,880
They knocked me out.
You have to...

839
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,693
The legal system
in this country,

840
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,833
it's going to hell.

841
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:26,529
You really must be
stupid,

842
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:29,326
showing your face...

843
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,153
After the crap
you pulled in court.

844
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,079
No. I'm smart enough to know
there's no place I can run

845
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:39,789
where you can't find me.

846
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:54,971
I am so sorry, Ricardo.

847
00:40:57,386 --> 00:40:59,776
Fool me once.

848
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:06,128
Couldn't get it out
in time.

849
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,734
Come on.

850
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:12,018
I had a plan.

851
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:15,583
Get Oliver Queen
discredited,

852
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:17,659
imprisoned.

853
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:22,774
I worked for months
to make that happen.

854
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,838
I'm so sorry
to disappoint you.

855
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,182
Oh, I'm not
disappointed, baby.

856
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm moving on
to plan B...

857
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,885
Killing
Oliver Queen...

858
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:41,596
And anyone and everyone
he cares about.
