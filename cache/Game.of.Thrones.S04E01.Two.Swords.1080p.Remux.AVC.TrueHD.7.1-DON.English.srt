It is.

00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:59,031
No one's made a Valyrian steel sword
since the Doom of Valyria.

8
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:02,743
There are three living smiths
who know how to rework Valyrian steel.

9

The finest of them was in Volantis.

Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.

11
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,501
Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?

12
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,087
From someone who no longer had need of it.

13
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,634
You've wanted one in the family
for a long time.

- And now we have two.
- Two?

The original weapon was absurdly large.

it doesn't matter.

You can't serve in the Kingsguard

The King is never safe.

How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

You'll return to Casterly Rock
and rule in my stead.

You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.

I am the King's Hand. My place is here.

I don't expect to see the Rock again
before I die.

You know what they call me?

36
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,286
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honour.

37
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,998
Now you want me to
break another sacred vow.

38
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,875
You won't be breaking anything.

39
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,086
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

40
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,923
The King will exercise that prerogative.

41

No.

comes before your...

46

My bloody honour is beyond repair,
but my answer is still no.

I don't want Casterly Rock, a wife, children.

48

Go.

is the sum of your ambition, go serve.

00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,689
Why are you wasting a woman like this
on a Dornishman?

163
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,068
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

167
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,873
You think your gold

168
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,671
and your lions and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

169
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,383
May I tell you a secret?

170
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,886
You're not a golden lion.

171
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,891
You're just a pink little man
who is far too slow on the draw.

(SCREAMING)

Longsword is a bad option in close quarters.

174

When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

175

Quite a lot, I'm afraid.

to make your stay at King's Landing...

It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.

192

How did that come to pass?

Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

Prince Oberyn, a word in private?

199
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,399
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel
by mistake.

200

- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

201

TYRION: The King is very grateful
that you travelled all this way for his wedding.

202
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,575
Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted.

203
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,703
I am only the second son.

204
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,122
Well, speaking as a fellow second son,

205
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:17,250
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

Why did you come to King's Landing?

I was invited to the royal wedding.

209

I thought we were speaking truth.

210
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,346
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.

211

Another wedding.

212
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:36,269
My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

213
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,609
My sister loved him. She bore his children.

214
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,196
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

215
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,616
Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.

216
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,620
And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen

217
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,789
left her for another woman.

218
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,085
That started a war,
and the war ended right here,

219

when your father's army took the city.

I wasn't actually present.

221

My nephew and niece.

and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.

00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,646
And my sister,
you know what they did to her?

225
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,234
I'm asking you a question.

226
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,111
- I've heard rumours.
- Hmm.

227
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,738
So have I.

228
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,993
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain

229
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,330
raped Elia and split her in half
with his great sword.

230
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,207
I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

231
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,086
If the Mountain killed my sister,
your father gave the order.

232
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,423
Tell your father I'm here.

233

And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

She was a strong woman.

00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:01,024
Oberyn Martell wants to murder
everyone whose last name is Lannister.

324
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,361
You need to relax.

325
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,247
Don't you want to relax?

326
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,421
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

327
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,965
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

328
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,260
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

329
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,304
Do you love her?

330
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:35,892
Love her? I barely know her. She's a child.
She despises me.

331
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:36,976
That's not an answer.

332
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,436
I don't love her.

333
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,814
You tried to ship me away.

334
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,399
Ship you away?

335
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,320
Give me diamonds and make me disappear.

336
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,030
What are you talking about?

337
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,907
If you want me to leave, just say it.

338
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:53,910
- Say it!
- Shh.

339
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,704
I don't know what you're talking about.

340
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,415
You want me to stay?

341
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:27,735
(GROANS)

342
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,779
A work of art.

343
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,532
The craftsmanship is excellent.

344
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,243
You like it so much, you're welcome
to chop off your own hand and take it.

345
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,327
You're such an ingrate.

346
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,663
I spent days with the goldsmith
getting the details just right.

347
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,164
Days?

348
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:42,625
Better part of an afternoon.

349
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,044
There, how does that feel?

350
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,629
Uh...

351
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,424
A hook would be more practical.

352
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,008
Elegant, I think.

353
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,052
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

354
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,016
CERSEI: Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

355
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,810
- QYBURN: The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

356
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,812
I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.

357
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,649
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help whenever I can.

358
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,492
(DOOR OPENS)

359
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,494
- Odd little man.
- I've grown fond of him.

360
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:19,662
(DOOR CLOSES)

361
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,497
He's quite talented.

362
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,082
- What symptoms?
- (CHUCKLES)

363
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,127
Symptoms that are not your concern.

364
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,337
You let him touch you?

365
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,381
You jealous?

366
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,758
I'm surprised.

367
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,259
You never let Pycelle near you.

368
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:37,513
(LAUGHS) You think I'd let that old lecher
put his hands on me?

369
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,475
He smells like a dead cat.

370
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,977
I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.

371
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,979
Well, they smell like Pycelle.

372
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,230
You drink more than you used to.

373
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,067
- Yes.
- Why?

374
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,486
Hmm. Let's see.

375
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:56,157
You started a brawl in the streets with
Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital.

376
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,785
My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.

377
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,536
It must have been traumatic for you.

378
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,038
My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.

379
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,456
We suffered through a siege.

380
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,791
A rather short siege.

381
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,627
That I didn't expect to survive.

382
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,423
And now I'm marrying my eldest son
to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden,

383
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:16,803
while I'm supposed to marry her brother,
a renowned pillow-biter. So...

384
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,305
Father disowned me today.

385
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,766
He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

386
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,851
- You're forgetting Tyrion.
- (SCOFFS)

387
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,231
You don't really plan on staying
in the Kingsguard, do you?

388
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:37,323
Staying in the Kingsguard means
I live right here in the Red Keep with you.

389
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,993
- Not now.
- I want...

390
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:44,080
Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

391
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,087
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

392
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,507
You come back after all this time
with no apologies and one hand

393
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,551
and expect everything to be the same?

394
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:57,760
What do you want me to apologise for?

395
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:58,928
For leaving me.

396
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,596
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

397
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,557
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

398
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,768
You left me alone.

399
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,563
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

400
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:09,647
Every day.

401
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,191
I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

402
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,151
- You took too long.
- I...

403
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,948
- What are you saying?
- You took too long.

404
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,032
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

405
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,784
- Come in.
- JAIME: Go away.

406
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,954
Forgive me, Your Grace.

407
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,416
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

408
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,258
(BLOWING)

409
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,105
You plan on killing all the crows yourself?

410
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,151
Do you plan on sitting here,
scratching your balls till winter?

411
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,361
We wait for Mance's orders.

412
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,405
You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon.

413
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,407
If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

414
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,825
And what is it you want?

415
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,078
March on Castle Black with just this lot?

416
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,497
Your pretty crow said
a thousand men are nesting there.

417
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,124
He's a liar.

418
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,375
He is?

419
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,045
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

420
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,006
You said you put three arrows in him.

421
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,257
I did.

422
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:22,345
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

423
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,348
If that boy's still walking,

424
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,557
it's 'cause you let him go.

425

00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,045
I fucking hate Thenns.

428
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,349
Mance sent you?

429
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,559
- (GRUNTS)
- How did you find us?

430

(CAWS)

431
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,150
You came from the south, not the north.

432
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,987
Took a detour.

433
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,031
Got some supper
from a village down that way.

434
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:29,120
Why does the meat down here
taste so much better

435
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,163
than it does on our side of the Wall?

436
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:32,999
Help yourself.

437
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,583
(CHUCKLES)

438
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,171
Maybe everything's just better fed down here.

439
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,631
Fat and lazy.

440
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,261
Easier for us. (CHUCKLES)

441
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,181
You didn't see us coming?

442
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,392
Lost your warg?

443
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,105
And that baby crow you had with you,

444
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,899
lost him, too?

445
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,945
I'll answer to Mance.

446
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,072
I won't answer to you.

447
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,616
She yours?

448
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,787
I'm not anybody's.

449
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,798
Too scrawny.

450
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,469
Not like those crows at Castle Black.

451
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,056
Think of them stuck in their larders,

452
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,809
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

453
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:38,856
and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

454
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,985
I know we've had our differences, Tormund,

455
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,156
but just one time before you die,

456
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:50,993
you really ought to try crow.

457
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,289
MAN: Draw.

458
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,333
Loose.

JON: Last time I saw him,
he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.

460
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:14,683
He said, "Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black."

461
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:20,731
I was jealous of Robb my whole life.

462
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:21,816
(GROANS)

463
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,653
The way my father looked at him,
I wanted that.

464
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,532
He was better than me at everything.

465
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,702
Fighting and hunting

466
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,788
and riding

467
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,374
and girls.

468
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,918
Gods, the girls loved him.

469
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,214
I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

470
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,761
Sometimes I want to hate you.

471
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,225
You're better than me at everything.

472
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,020
Except reading.

473
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,355
(LAUGHS)

474
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,275
They're, um...

475
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,277
They're ready for you.

476
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,325
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

477
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:17,037
No one's going to hang you.
You've done nothing wrong.

478
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,039
I've done plenty wrong.

479
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:23,085
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

480
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,964
- JON: I didn't murder him.
- No?

481
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,050
You put your sword
through a brother of the Night's Watch.

482
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:32,052
What do you call that?

483
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,346
He wanted me to kill him.

484
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,224
A bastard son of a traitor.
What would you expect?

485
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:41,604
The Halfhand believed our only chance to
stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

486
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:44,940
Don't talk about the Halfhand
as if you knew him. He was my brother.

487
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,818
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

488
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,571
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

489
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,781
JANOS: The free folk? Listen to him.

490
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,159
He even talks like a wildling now.

491
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,870
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

492
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,873
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I...

493
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,001
I laid with a wildling girl.

494
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,672
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

495
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,133
I do.

496
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,135
The law is the law.

497
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,304
The boy must die.

498
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,225
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

499
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:22,853
the Wall would be manned by headless men.

500
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:27,149
There's a difference between
sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel

501
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,360
and sleeping with the enemy.

502
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:33,614
While we sit here
debating which rules I broke,

503
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,409
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

504
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,411
Impossible.

505
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:42,748
You can't get 50 wildlings together
before they start killing each other.

506
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,041
100,000.

507
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,878
He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots,
the ice-river clans.

508
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:49,296
He has giants fighting for him.

509
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,589
(LAUGHS) Giants?

510
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,802
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

511
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,304
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

512
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:58,430
And now you're here.

513
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,848
You must not have been
very good at your job.

514
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,225
How dare you?

515
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:06,105
There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall
already, led by Tormund Giantsbane.

516
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,524
I killed their warg and three others.

517
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,734
They shot me full of arrows.

518
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:16,824
Their orders are to attack Castle Black from
the south when Mance hits it from the north.

519
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,702
The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.

520
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,579
Mance said it would be the greatest fire
the North has ever seen.

521
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,082
That's the truth.

522
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,084
All the truth.

523
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,967
Do you intend to execute me,
or am I free to go?

524
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:37,386
None of us are free.

525
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,179
We are men of the Night's Watch.

526
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:43,434
But we won't be taking your head today,
Jon Snow.

527
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:44,893
Go on.

528
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,282
I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.

529
00:35:58,699 --> 00:35:59,742
Yes, you are.

530
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,077
And I don't trust the bastard.

531
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,747
He told the truth.

532
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,291
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

533
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,085
How did you acquire this magical power?

534
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,006
I grew up in King's Landing.

535
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,845
OLENNA: No.

536
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,972
You're a queen, not an ox.

537
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:28,354
Your grandfather gave me a necklace
just like this one for my 51st nameday.

538
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,900
The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother.

539
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,860
You can't say no to everything.

540
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,196
Nonsense. My little dears,

541
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:40,532
go and speak
to the jewellers of King's Landing.

542
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,160
Tell them who you are, who sent you.

543
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:47,956
The one who brings me the best necklace
will get to keep the next best.

544
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,541
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

545
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:56,799
The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the Sept
a fortnight from now

546
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,717
will inspire a thousand songs.

547
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:02,096
How sad it will be
if she's wearing rubbish like that.

548
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,307
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey
choose it for me.

549
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,935
End up with a string of dead sparrow heads
around my neck.

550
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,105
You watch that. Even here, with me.

551

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

552
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,526
My word.

553
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,070
My lady.

554
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,615
Please pardon me for interrupting.

555
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,075
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

556
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,701
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

557
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:27,204
But hearing is one thing.

558
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,957
Aren't you just marvellous!

559
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,043
Absolutely singular.

560
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:38,590
I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt,
like the silly little boy he is.

561
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:43,262
My lady, I know this is a very busy time
for you, but if I could just have a moment.

562
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,224
You dare not refuse.

563
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,687
A shadow?

564
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:54,773
With the face of Stannis Baratheon.

565
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,319
I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis.

566
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,824
He plunged his sword through Renly's heart
and disappeared.

567
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,953
One day, I will avenge our king.

568
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,038
Joffrey is our king now.

569
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,084
- I meant no offence.
- And you've given none.

570
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,762
All the Kingsguard will be on duty.

571
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,764
Ser Boros will be stationed here.

572
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:32,728
Ser Preston will be stationed here,
beside the primary entertainment.

573
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,064
- Your Grace?
- Huh?

574
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,777
One guard at the thing. Go on.

575
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,281
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

576
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:49,119
I've always guarded the King himself,
my lord. Ever since your absence.

577
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:50,662
And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn.

578
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,582
All very good. I don't expect any trouble.

579
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,336
The people love their King.
They know who keeps them fed.

580
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,087
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

581
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,257
By my leave.

582
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,511
They know I saved the city. I won the war.

583
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,429
The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.

584
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,932
I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.

585
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,518
Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.

586
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:15,103
My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.

587
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,231
Busy getting captured.

588
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,652
So this is the famous Book of Brothers?

589
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,821
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.

590
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,410
Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning.

on the Kingswood Brotherhood.

Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat.

00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,629
Ser Duncan the Tall.

Four pages.

- He must have been quite a man.
- So they say.

Ser Jaime Lannister.

599

Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

all your great deeds.

- There's still time.
- Is there?

602
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,154
For a 40-year-old knight with one hand?

603
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,741
How can you protect me with that?

604
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,118
I use my left hand now, Your Grace.

605
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,996
Makes for more of a contest.

And?

610
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:41,732
They say a thousand slaves died
building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

611
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:45,444
And now an army of former slaves
is marching to her gates.

If they're smart, Your Grace.

614

You were told to ride at the back of the train.

00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,874
Yes, My Queen.

616
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,794
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

617
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,671
A matter of strategy.

618

00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,183
All right, what is this matter of strategy?

620
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,063
A dusk rose.

621
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,316
Would you like to walk at the back of the train
instead of riding?

622
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,027
And this one's called lady's lace.

623
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,571
Would you like to walk without shoes?

624
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,239
You have to know a land to rule it.

625
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:35,911
Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its people.

626

Dusk rose tea eases fever.

627

Everyone in Meereen knows that.

628
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:42,584
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

629
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,671
If you want them to follow you,
you have to become a part of their world.
