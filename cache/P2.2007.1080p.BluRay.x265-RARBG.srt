1
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,776
Yes, sir. I redrafted the contracts
to include the new stipulations.

2
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,376
-Then where are they?
-I'm faxing the revisions now.

3
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,011
Did you make all the changes I asked for?

4
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,523
Yes. I included the four percent increase
and the extra 2 million.

5
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:42,824
No, no. If it's a four percent increase then
you have to add at least 3 million dollars.

6
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,294
That's not what I was told.

7
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,898
-Who told you that?
-Their lawyers.

8
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,869
They're all idiots! I don't understand
this total lack of communication.

9
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,202
It's okay. I just had no way of knowing, sir.

10
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,738
Look, this is what I need you to do.

11
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,209
-Sir, could I put you on hold for a second?
-Okay.

12
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,441
-Thanks. Hi, Jody.
-Mr. Harper wants to see you in his office.

13
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,117
-Great. Of course.
-Still want me to fax those?

14
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,621
You don't have to. I'm not even done yet.
You should go home.

15
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,247
-Are you sure?
-It's late.

16
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,292
I don't want your parents to worry.
Get out of here.

17
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,852
-Okay. Merry Christmas, Angela.
-Merry Christmas, Jody.

18
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,167
Hi, Lorraine. Of course I'm going to make it.

19
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,609
Just let me call you back. Okay?

20
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,449
In a few minutes, I promise. Okay.

21
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,147
Still on the Morgan deal?

22
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,113
What can I do for you, Jim?

23
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,153
I...

24
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,594
I don't know how to...

25
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,296
Angela, I feel terrible about what happened.

26
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,899
It's fine. Let's just not worry about it, okay?

27
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:03,338
No, it's not okay. I acted like a real jerk.

28
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:08,811
I had too many drinks and... You know
how these Christmas parties can be.

29
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,711
We had a baby last year, and...

30
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,517
It's been a hard year.

31
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,957
I'm sure that it has.

32
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:22,358
I simply want to tell you
that I'm really, really sorry. Okay?

33
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,661
Apology accepted.

34
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:29,728
Thanks. Merry Christmas, Angela.

35
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,499
You too, Jim.

36
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,543
You calling me from work?
Thought you were going home first.

37
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,416
-I brought everything with me. Don't worry.
Get over here, Angie.

38
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,515
God, I am
so late with this dinner.

39
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,186
Did you pick up the Santa Claus costume?
I hope you didn't forget it.

40
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,162
It's in the car.

41
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,757
I think Dad is more excited than the kids.

42
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,330
I can't wait to get out of here
and see you guys.

43
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,667
Jimmy, put that back.
We're having dinner soon.

44
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,969
-You want Santa to come tonight or not?
Mommy, I want Santa to come.

45
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,067
Then help me set the table.

46
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,443
-Please don't be late.
-I won't. I promise.

47
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,175
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

48
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,747
Okay.

49
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,221
-Oh, Jesus!
-My God!

50
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,762
-Sorry, Angela...
-It's okay.

51
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,530
I was just locking up the floors.
I didn't know anybody would be working

52
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,265
this late on Christmas Eve.

53
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,170
-Me neither.
-Sorry.

54
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,300
I'll come back later, all right?

55
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,140
Actually, if you wouldn't
mind waiting, I'll lock my office

56
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,476
-and take the elevator down with you.
-Sure.

57
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,845
Two seconds.

58
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,477
Do you work all night?

59
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,715
Yeah, but they're closing the building
for the next three days.

60
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,480
-Besides, I get New Year's Eve off.
-That's good.

61
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,823
I hope to get home in time
for the girls to open up the presents.

62
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,056
-How are they?
-Great.

63
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,228
-Your parents can't stand me.
-You're wrong. They love you.

64
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,760
-So, where are you going this evening?
-I'm going to my sister's house in Jersey.

65
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,172
I thought of you more as
an Upper East Side girl.

66
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,208
Upper east side of Maine, actually.
I grew up on a farm.

67
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,847
Now, I'm having trouble believing that.

68
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,648
Hey, don't let the fancy clothes fool you.
I keep it real.

69
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,248
Is that what you call it? Keeping it real?

70
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,517
-Goodnight, Karl.
-Merry Christmas, Angela.

71
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,118
You too. I'll see you soon.

72
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,872
I promise you I'm leaving right now.

73
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,139
I know. I'm sorry, but I'm in the elevator.

74
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,208
Twenty-five minutes, tops.

75
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,777
I can't hear you. What?
Lorraine, you're breaking up.

76
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,182
Hello?

77
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,078
You have got to be kidding.

78
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,522
Come on.

79
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,027
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

80
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,040
I'm getting out of the car
is what I'm gonna do.

81
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,731
Oh, shit.

82
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,781
Hello?

83
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,048
Jesus!

84
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,290
Rocky, what are you doing? Heel.

85
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,330
Stay. Down.

86
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,934
-Sorry about that.
-It's okay.

87
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,203
Look, can you unlock the door
to the elevator room?

88
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,571
My car won't start, and I need to
get upstairs and get a cab.

89
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,738
Yeah, I can.
I've just got to find my key cards.

90
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:18,416
Sorry. Where are those darn keys?
I'm about to do my rounds anyway, so...

91
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,079
-Okay, great.
-What happened to your car?

92
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,351
-I have no idea.
-You probably left the lights on.

93
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,291
I don't think so. I'm usually pretty good
about that kind of thing.

94
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:31,761
People do it all the time. It's instinctive.
You drive down here, it's dark... It happens.

95
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,823
Here we go.

96
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,959
-Great.
-You know, actually...

97
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,267
I have a charger in the back, so if it is
your battery probably you could use that.

98
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:45,201
Thank you, but... I really should
just take a cab. I'm so late as it is.

99
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,078
No, no. It would probably take longer
to get a cab. It's Christmas Eve.

100
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:53,008
So... I don't know. Up to you.
Whatever you want.

101
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,982
-How long will it take?
-Just a few minutes.

102
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,120
Now with beautiful Metropolitan
Opera House in the background,

103
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,031
let's check out
the temperatures in the Tri-State Area.

104
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,804
-Which way to your car?
-Over there.

105
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,031
Okay.

106
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,044
Working late, huh? I know how you feel.

107
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,606
These are pretty reliable cars
for the most part, right?

108
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,813
They're supposed to be.

109
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,284
All right. Positive...

110
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,054
Negative.

111
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,530
-All right, try it. Turn her over.
-Okay.

112
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,896
Strange.

113
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,597
Hang on. Can you turn your headlights on?

114
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,769
Weird. Try turning the keys again.

115
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,473
-Damn it.
-All right. I guess turn the headlights off.

116
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,878
You know what?

117
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,218
That's it.
You've been a great help, but I give up.

118
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:09,353
Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I thought I could do something.

119
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,958
You've been great. Could you just
let me in the elevator room now?

120
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,690
I was just trying to help.

121
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,270
I know. And I appreciate it. Thank you.

122
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,948
Hey, I know you're upset
about your car not starting, but...

123
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,019
It's the holidays. It's time to be thankful.

124
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,012
You know what? You're right.

125
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,682
-Yeah?
-I should be thankful.

126
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,097
I, uh...

127
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,498
I prepared
a small Christmas meal for myself.

128
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,035
You could join me if you want.

129
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,509
-I'm just kidding.
-Oh, sorry. I'm exhausted.

130
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,545
But thanks for your help.

131
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,517
You're welcome. Maybe some other time?

132
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,622
Sure.

133
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,720
All right.

134
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,890
Here you go. You sure
you don't want me to call you a cab?

135
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,227
-No. I've got a number in my bag.
-Suit yourself. Merry Christmas.

136
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,492
Merry Christmas.

137
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:41,911
Karl?

138
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,340
Hi. Can I get a car
at 2370 Park Avenue, please?

139
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,048
Are you sure? No, that's okay.
I'll wait. Thanks.

140
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:28,190
Lorraine, you won't believe what happened.
No, my car wouldn't start.

141
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:34,266
Just start without me, and I'll be there
within the hour and I'll make it up to them.

142
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,442
Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye.

143
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,960
Hello? Oh, great. Thank you!

144
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,037
Okay. Okay.

145
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,472
Oh, come on.

146
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:50,971
What?

147
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:58,221
This is not happening. Is this a joke?
God, no, you gotta be kidding me.

148
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,654
Karl? Where are you? Is anybody here?

149
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,628
Come on, come on, come on.

150
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,571
What?

151
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,706
One second, okay? I'll be right back.
Just one second.

152
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,830
Hello, can you hear me?

153
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,995
I've got a cab waiting for me.
Can you open the front gate, please?

154
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,965
Hello?

155
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,201
No... Wait!

156
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,816
No! Damn it!
Why would you leave me here?

157
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,285
Wake up! The cab just left.

158
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,943
Hey! I'm still in here! Wait!

159
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,192
Great.

160
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,471
It's okay.

161
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,983
Hello?

162
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,184
Stop being paranoid.

163
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,464
Go down to the office.

164
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,734
Hello?

165
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,616
Oh, fuck!

166
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,372
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
You've been a good little girl.

167
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,049
Wait. It's okay. You're all right. Okay?

168
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,351
All right?

169
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:05,060
You're not looking so good. Are you okay?
Take it easy. It's okay.

170
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:13,937
-What happened to me? What time is it?
-You just fell. You'll be all right.

171
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,601
I don't feel good. I'm going to be sick.

172
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,206
I'll get you some water.

173
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,913
Be careful! You're gonna hurt yourself.
Try to stay calm.

174
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,788
Okay.

175
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,823
It's okay. Here. Okay?

176
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,966
I'm going to help you up, okay?

177
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,669
Here we go.

178
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,569
There you go. It's okay.

179
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,413
All right. Try to relax while I clean this up.

180
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,109
Okay.

181
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:09,486
Clean this up. Okay.

182
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,094
All right. I'll be right back.

183
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,283
Hungry? I've got turkey,

184
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,256
mashed potatoes, cranberries,
and I've even got some cornbread.

185
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,133
Oh, man. I'm sorry about this.
I was just teasing.

186
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,162
I didn't mean to scare you.

187
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,902
I hope it's still warm.

188
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,378
If not, I have a microwave.

189
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,155
Are you feeling any better?

190
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,088
What happened to my clothes?

191
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,856
Like I said, you fell
and your clothes got dirty...

192
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:28,838
Maybe you'd like some wine.

193
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,609
Help you relax a little bit, you know?

194
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:36,079
I don't know what you're doing,
but you'd better just fucking untie me.

195
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,619
This is a California wine.

196
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,249
It's Sonoma County. That's where I'm from.

197
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,923
It's beautiful up there.

198
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,022
Where are you from?

199
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,168
-What do you want?
-I want to know where you're from.

200
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,205
I'm from Readfield.

201
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:11,945
-Readfield. Where's that?
-Please, tell me what you want.

202
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:18,114
I just want to know where Readfield is.
And I want you to relax.

203
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,336
Cheers.

204
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,938
I'll make a toast.
Here's to good friends and hometowns

205
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,140
and Readfield. Wherever that is.

206
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,082
-Listen...
-Tom.

207
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,353
Tom.

208
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:01,362
I have someplace to be. I have obligations.

209
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,563
Yeah. I know. Way too many.

210
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:10,502
You need time for yourself. You don't need
to be at everyone's beck and call.

211
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,271
Then maybe we should
get a drink in the new year.

212
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:24,517
I've already prepared everything.
It's all here.

213
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,291
I know, and it looks really good.

214
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,984
Yeah? Great. Well, let's eat.

215
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,796
I'm starving.

216
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,800
Tom, this is really sweet of you,
and I mean that.

217
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,359
But my whole family is expecting me.
I have plans.

218
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,632
I guess some plans are made to be broken.

219
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,674
Do you want to say grace or should I?

220
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:54,114
Hell, let's skip it.
I've never been religious anyway.

221
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,984
Bon appétit.

222
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,322
What do you like to do?

223
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,669
After work and stuff? I guess, hobbies.

224
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,603
That's a mundane question,
but I guess people ask that

225
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,075
just to get to know each other, right?

226
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:24,081
I read. Right now I'm reading Hemingway,
The Sun Also Rises.

227
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:29,917
And you really should eat.
It's gonna get cold.

228
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:36,121
Anyway, in the book
this guy loves this girl so much

229
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:40,693
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

230
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,934
Even her infidelities.

231
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,665
That's a pretty intense story, but...

232
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,602
That's what love is supposed to be, right?

233
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,816
My boyfriend is gonna get worried
and come looking for me, Tom.

234
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,298
If I don't show up,
he'll come looking for me.

235
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,832
He knows where I work.

236
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:22,839
How long have you guys been
dating or hanging out?

237
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,209
-Two years.
-Two years?

238
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:32,377
-Do you live together?
-That's none of your fucking business.

239
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,751
That's not very nice dinner talk.

240
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,950
Yeah, we live together, okay?

241
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,196
Two years...

242
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:53,901
That's more than a boyfriend.
That sounds like wedding bells.

243
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,031
Do you have any plans?

244
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:00,843
-Yes.
-What does your fiancé do?

245
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,342
He's a journalist.

246
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:07,146
I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist?

247
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,619
-Sports.
-What paper?

248
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,822
-Post.
-I read The Post.

249
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,120
-What's his name?
-Mark Clayton.

250
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:18,254
Clayton. I don't remember that name.

251
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,361
-I have one over here.
-It's The Post online.

252
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,307
It's amazing

253
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:40,612
that you're able to keep a relationship
with the amount of hours you work.

254
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:45,054
He must get really lonely
when you have to work late, right?

255
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,258
Do you love him?

256
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,254
Does he love you?

257
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:02,231
I'm only asking because I'm worried about
how quickly he's going to get here.

258
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,207
I'm sure he's already on his way.

259
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:14,852
Right. He's probably
on the Harlem River Drive as we speak.

260
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,150
-What kind of car does he drive?
-I don't know.

261
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,383
You don't know what kind of car
your fiancé drives?

262
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,895
-Toyota, I think.
-Toyota. That is a fast car.

263
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,030
He can be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

264
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,624
He could be coming down
this ramp right now.

265
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,579
You haven't been very talkative
since we met.

266
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:50,279
But now you're telling me all about

267
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,017
your boyfriend. Oh, sorry, your fiancé.

268
00:29:56,762 --> 00:30:01,790
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

269
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,699
I'm guessing

270
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,294
you're lying to me.

271
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,241
You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?

272
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,805
But you want one.

273
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:22,283
You want somebody who cares about you...

274
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,618
-Worries about you...
-Please, don't.

275
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,026
You've got a great family.

276
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,022
You've got Lorraine.

277
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,427
Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

278
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,667
They're probably getting worried about you.

279
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,902
Maybe we should give them a call. Yeah?

280
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,809
Tell them you're okay.

281
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,679
What do you think?

282
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,098
What should we say?

283
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,708
I know.
We should say you made other plans.

284
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,905
No. You probably already said that one.

285
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,375
You know what?
You should think of something.

286
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,241
You're a good liar.

287
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,353
Go ahead.

288
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,651
Go!

289
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,519
No.

290
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,970
Hello? Hello?

291
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,741
Hey, Rosie.
Can you get your mommy on the phone?

292
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,473
Who's calling, please?

293
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,881
-It's Auntie Angie.
-Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.

294
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,049
Give me a second, okay?
Hey, where are you?

295
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,720
-Angela?
-I'm not feeling well.

296
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,622
What do you mean?
We're all waiting for you.

297
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,389
She says she's not feeling well.

298
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:19,528
That's what she said the last time.
Can I talk to my sister, please?

299
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,968
Where are you, Angie?

300
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,007
She's got a real job. It's not like...

301
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,035
Angela?

302
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,145
I went home.

303
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,340
What's wrong? Where is she?

304
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,407
I don't understand.
Last time I talked to you,

305
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,283
you were on your way.
What about the costume?

306
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,380
Let's just eat.
You should know your sister by now.

307
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:40,952
It would be nice if you'd try

308
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,891
and put your family
ahead of your work sometimes.

309
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,825
That's enough. Give me the phone.

310
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,958
Angie, what's wrong?

311
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,561
Hello? I can't hear her.

312
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,528
Sweetie? Can you hear me?

313
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,766
-Hi, Mom. I'm here.
-Honey, what happened? Where are you?

314
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,310
I don't know.

315
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,575
I think it's the flu.

316
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,710
You really sound terrible.
Are you sure you're okay?

317
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,087
Yeah. I just need some rest.

318
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,483
Okay.

319
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,497
Rest up and hopefully you'll
feel better for lunch tomorrow.

320
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,498
And don't worry about the costume, okay?

321
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:28,162
-Merry Christmas, angel. I love you.
-I love you too, Mom.

322
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,454
That was the best Christmas present
anyone's ever given me.

323
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:46,984
Thank you.

324
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,791
And now I have a present for you.

325
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,413
Go ahead.

326
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:16,979
Open it.

327
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,689
Aren't you even curious?

328
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,458
Open it.

329
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,200
Yes.

330
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,770
Bet you're curious now.

331
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,444
Okay. Enough torture.

332
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,519
Watch. It's all cued up.

333
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,291
-Why are you showing this to me?
-Wait.

334
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,588
You fucked up now, asshole.

335
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,998
Sorry you had to see that.

336
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,000
You want to go for a stroll?

337
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:56,111
These guys always do whatever they want.

338
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,955
Here we go.

339
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,831
Rocky, sit down!

340
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,945
Why did you do that?

341
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,455
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

342
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,650
-Let me help you up.
-Don't.

343
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,458
-Don't touch me!
-I'm not gonna hurt you. All right?

344
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,555
You're hurting my arm.

345
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,157
That's because you won't
relax your arms. Okay?

346
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,170
-Come on.
-Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

347
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,642
Yeah, I believe you.
I just need to show you something.

348
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,553
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

349
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,926
Here we go.

350
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,546
Uh-oh.

351
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,984
I think I drank too much wine.

352
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,482
I really shouldn't be driving.

353
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,458
I'm just kidding.

354
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,832
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

355
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,595
Strange being in the car with you.

356
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,064
It's great, actually.

357
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,535
-I thought you said we were taking a drive.
-We are.

358
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,605
Then why are we going down, Tom?

359
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,547
It's freezing out there.

360
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,780
Besides, this is gonna be much better.

361
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,097
Why are we down here, Thomas?

362
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,728
Tom?

363
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,015
Oh, my God, Tom.

364
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,923
What is this?

365
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,591
This is my present to you.

366
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,808
I want you to take this and show him.

367
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,638
Show him what?

368
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,944
Show him you're not a slut.

369
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,279
Take this and teach him he can't be
touching every woman he wants.

370
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,586
Are you talking about
what happened in the elevator?

371
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,530
Oh, Tom, no. You don't understand.
That was a mistake.

372
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,527
A stupid mistake.

373
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,070
-What? He tried to rape you.
-No.

374
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,241
He got a little out of hand at a party, Tom.
He hardly tried to rape me.

375
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:41,074
Look, he was drunk. He apologized.

376
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,273
Oh, he apologized.

377
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,451
You think you're the first woman
he tried to do this to?

378
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,043
I've seen him try to touch
every woman in the building.

379
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,522
-He's a pervert. A degenerate.
-No.

380
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,893
He's a good man, Tom.

381
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:02,095
Look at him. He has a family.
He has a wife. Tom, please don't.

382
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,363
Tom, Tom...
Stop calling out my name, all right?

383
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,994
I know what you're trying to do.

384
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,596
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victim.

385
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:13,474
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you!
All right?

386
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,876
Stop calling out my name!
Enough's enough!

387
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,882
Tom, Tom, Tom!
How many times can you say it?

388
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,710
Okay.

389
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,129
I know you're a person, okay?

390
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,263
I'm a person, too.

391
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:39,135
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

392
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,772
I care about your feelings.

393
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:48,635
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

394
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,215
So if you want to help him,

395
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,845
take this and teach him a lesson.

396
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,653
I told you, he apologized.

397
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,231
What? He can just apologize
and then he can do it again?

398
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,165
And then he's just gonna
apologize again and then...

399
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,567
You've got to stop letting these assholes
have their way with you!

400
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:18,507
Tom, please believe me.
It was just a misunderstanding, Tom.

401
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:23,070
Tom, Tom!
Just stop calling out my name! I told you!

402
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:27,007
-Didn't I?
-Yes! Yes.

403
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,146
-I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
-Jesus! When are you gonna understand?

404
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,551
I'm here to help you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

405
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,539
Okay.

406
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:57,642
I'll do it.

407
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,818
You untie me and I'll do it.

408
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,962
No. Oh, no. Whoa.

409
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,656
You're a good person.

410
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,963
You're a good person, too.

411
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,799
I should have never asked
you to do this. I'm sorry.

412
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:24,831
No. It's okay because I want to.

413
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:29,642
You just have to untie me
and I'll do it for you.

414
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,382
No, no. It's my job to protect you.

415
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,328
No, Tom, listen to me. It's not.
Please don't do anything.

416
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,456
Don't try to run away, okay?

417
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,931
Can I trust you?

418
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,998
-Can I trust you?
-Yes.

419
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,835
You can trust me.

420
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:05,543
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry.

421
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:09,945
So...

422
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:13,487
You like to touch girls, do you?

423
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:17,059
No? Look at her.

424
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,556
I said look at her.

425
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:25,527
Does she look happy to you? Huh?

426
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,198
Yeah.

427
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,469
You messed with the wrong girl.

428
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,475
What makes you think
you deserve her? Huh?

429
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,844
What gives you the right?

430
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,384
You're something else, you know that?

431
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:48,050
You pretentious Ivy League piece of shit.

432
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,718
You don't own the world and everyone in it.

433
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,290
What is a guy like you thinking
when he puts his hands all over a girl

434
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:59,427
who obviously is not interested?
Who is obviously not a slut?

435
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,732
Because that's what
you think they are, right?

436
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:07,505
Yeah? I can't hear you. What did you say?

437
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,376
What? Can you speak up?

438
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:14,179
Because you can't talk your way
out of this one, can you?

439
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,978
-Why am I even wasting my time with you?
No!

440
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,855
-What? Angela, he deserves it!
-Don't do anything, Thomas, please!

441
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,436
No!

442
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,980
Stop it! Stop it!

443
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,230
Way to ruin Christmas, asshole.

444
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,479
Well, he won't be bothering you again.

445
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,520
Where are we going?

446
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:32,385
We can't just leave him here.
You have to get him.

447
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,654
What? Why are you defending him?

448
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,199
I'm not. I'm not.

449
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,862
Do you like this?
Do you like to get touched?

450
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,962
You like it when he touches you
in the parking garage?

451
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,633
-Do you want to get laid here?
-You know that's not true.

452
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:48,145
So what is it? A career thing?

453
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,913
Did you fuck him to get a promotion?

454
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,043
We can't leave him here.

455
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,582
You're right. I'm sorry.

456
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:05,253
We shouldn't leave him here.

457
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,830
Wait! Thomas, stop!

458
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,864
-What are you doing?
-We're gonna just take him for a little drive.

459
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:21,507
What are you doing?
Tom, stop the car! Please!

460
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,807
Please stop! Please!

461
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:28,383
Stop it! What are you doing, Tom? No!

462
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,750
No! No!

463
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,351
Oh, my God!

464
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,997
No, please! Oh, my God! Don't do this.

465
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,202
Please don't! No!

466
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:55,672
Thomas, no.

467
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,113
You're a good person, Thomas.
Please don't do this.

468
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,719
No! God, no! Stop it!

469
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,922
Hey! Hey!

470
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,023
Where are you going?

471
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:20,536
Angela! Come back!

472
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:24,140
You fucked him, didn't you? Liar!

473
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,401
Hey! Down here!

474
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,866
Can you hear me? Help!

475
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,813
Down here! Can't you hear me?

476
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,566
Good boy.

477
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,318
Sit. Good boy.

478
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,222
Stay right there, Rocky.

479
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,282
Stay there.

480
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,782
Help me! Help me, please!

481
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:09,699
Help me, please!
Someone's trying to kill me! Help me!

482
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,101
Help me!

483
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:17,672
Somebody's trying to kill me!

484
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,034
Oh, Karl. Where are you?

485
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,505
Oh, my God.

486
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,706
Angela?

487
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:29,178
Please.
If anyone can hear me...

488
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,041
I'm trapped in the underground parking
structure of the Arcadia Building.

489
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:35,608
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

490
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,213
Someone's trying to kill me.

491
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,584
Angela.

492
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,649
Angela, come out.

493
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:44,992
Shit.

494
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:47,060
Angela?

495
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,030
Can we talk about this?

496
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:01,711
Looks like somebody's
playing games, huh, Rocky?

497
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,415
Angela?

498
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,213
Come on.

499
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:24,792
Come on. Lobby.
Come on. Lobby. Come on.

500
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,960
Why is it fucking locked?

501
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,194
Angela!

502
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,604
Hello?

503
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,508
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

504
00:55:14,378 --> 00:55:16,573
Please, hello?

505
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,376
Answer, please?

506
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,616
Yes?
Five Brothers Security here. Hello?

507
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:28,491
Yes. I'm here. Can you hear me?

508
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,158
I can hear you fine. How can I help you?

509
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:34,686
I'm being kidnapped.
I work at Brieter, Smith and Steinberg.

510
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:36,426
It's 2370 Park Avenue

511
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,832
and I'm hiding in the elevator.
Please can you call 911?

512
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:42,133
Calm down, miss.
Is there someone with you right now?

513
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:46,567
No, he's outside in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

514
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:48,105
Did you see him do it?

515
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,511
Yes! His name is Thomas and he's
the parking attendant in my building.

516
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:53,812
If you'll just please hurry. I'm in danger.

517
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:56,910
Ma'am, you have got to relax
and take a deep breath.

518
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,285
How do you fucking expect me to relax?
This man is trying to kill me!

519
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,723
Can you please try to understand
and call the cops?

520
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,819
Please just call 911!

521
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,093
The police?

522
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:14,660
No. I'm sure he's just trying to help you.

523
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,200
Right?

524
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:20,668
Angela?

525
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,844
Are you still there?

526
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,046
Listen you fuck-face, I called the cops
and I'm gonna stay down here

527
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,056
as long as it takes until they get here,
so I suggest that you get the fuck out!

528
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,653
I just wanna talk to you.

529
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,990
That's why I pretended to be
someone else, okay? So don't be upset.

530
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,792
Will you come out? I was just kidding.

531
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,460
Just go to hell!

532
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:52,272
Don't you understand? I did it for you.
That guy showed you no respect.

533
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,139
Why won't you talk to me, Angela?

534
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,576
Just give me a chance.

535
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,522
If you just give us a chance,
it can work out.

536
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,324
You'll grow to like me.

537
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:11,958
That's usually what happens
when two people

538
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:15,396
are forced to be together
in a stressful situation.

539
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:20,061
They have to depend on one another.
And eventually they support each other.

540
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:24,071
They like each other.
Sometimes they even fall in love.

541
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:28,972
Angela.

542
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:33,574
Please don't do this.

543
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,721
Why won't you talk to me?

544
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,653
You know, I wish you had just
a little bit more respect for yourself.

545
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,893
I'm not coming out! Do you hear me?

546
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:35,133
I'm not fucking moving, you fuck!

547
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,989
Karl! Oh, no, please.

548
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,449
Karl!

549
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,316
Come on, Karl!

550
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:35,586
Angela?

551
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,362
You must be freezing out here.

552
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:44,827
Angela.

553
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,079
What a mess.

554
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,514
Angela.

555
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,622
I think Karl is hurt.

556
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:15,427
Angela? Should we call him an ambulance?

557
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:23,270
That way he can go back to his kids
and family, and you can go to your sister's.

558
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,098
And I could stay here! In this parking lot!

559
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:29,404
All by myself!

560
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:32,739
Because that's obviously
what everybody wants!

561
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,448
Angela?

562
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:48,355
I just can't keep
chasing you around all night.

563
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,826
Besides, the whole place is locked.

564
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,172
Angela?

565
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:03,108
Where are you gonna go if you get away?

566
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,745
It's freezing out there.

567
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,912
You can't go out.

568
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,785
Angela?

569
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:15,982
Angela!

570
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:22,859
Angela?

571
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,243
Way to ruin Christmas, Karl.

572
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,475
I'll have a blue

573
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:15,941
Christmas without you

574
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:21,914
I'll be so blue

575
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:26,956
Just thinking about you

576
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:33,963
Decorations of red

577
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:38,497
On a green Christmas tree

578
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,207
Won't be the same, dear

579
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:48,612
If you're not here with me

580
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:52,685
And when those blue

581
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:57,620
Snowflakes start falling

582
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:02,528
That's when those blue

583
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:07,459
Memories start calling

584
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:14,404
You'll be doing all right

585
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,508
With your Christmas of white

586
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:24,777
But I'll have a blue

587
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:28,147
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

588
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:54,480
You'll be doing all right

589
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:59,285
With your Christmas of white

590
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:04,590
But I'll have a blue

591
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,758
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

592
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:12,357
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

593
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,000
Oh, yeah.

594
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:10,683
Do you want makeup?

595
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,818
Okay.

596
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:20,062
You have the most beautiful lips

597
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,139
I have ever seen in my life.

598
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,435
You're beautiful.

599
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,375
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

600
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,213
You have a wonderful body.

601
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,025
It was meant to be, babe.

602
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:50,864
Me and you.

603
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,799
Your skin...

604
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,507
It's soft.

605
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,105
Honey.

606
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:08,913
I love you. Angela, you know that, right?

607
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:29,998
Hello?

608
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:31,462
Shit.

609
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:34,237
I'm down here. Hello? Can you hear me?

610
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:41,343
It's okay.

611
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:10,003
Hello, Officer. Can I help you?

612
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,345
Can you open up the gate, please?

613
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,446
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

614
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:25,727
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

615
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:54,115
Hey.

616
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,956
Sorry about that.
I was on the bottom floor doing my rounds.

617
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,128
What's going on tonight?

618
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:10,434
We got a call about a disturbance
at this address. Know anything about that?

619
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,974
No, it's been real quiet all night.

620
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,336
See anything, hear anything suspicious?

621
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:19,777
Like I said, I was just doing my rounds.

622
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,083
It's been really quiet.
I haven't seen anybody down here.

623
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,517
Any cars in there?

624
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:27,347
Well, it is a parking garage.

625
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,328
There's a few cars scattered
over here in this level.

626
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:36,092
On the second level there's a rental thing.

627
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:40,328
Like I said, there's been no one
around tonight. Except me and Rocky.

628
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,303
Two of you working here tonight.

629
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:46,501
Kind of. He's my dog.
He's down in the office right now.

630
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:50,276
We're gonna take a look around.
Get in the back. We'll give you a ride.

631
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,643
That's a great idea.

632
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:57,750
I've just gotta close this gate.
A lot of homeless people around here.

633
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,253
Thanks for the ride.

634
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:46,098
If you guys wanna
check out the other floors,

635
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:47,830
just keep going around this way.

636
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,702
But be careful on P3.
There's a broken water main, okay?

637
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,037
-We'll come back around.
-Okay.

638
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:03,735
What the hell's going on here, man?

639
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:51,892
Help me! Help!

640
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,112
Help me! Help!

641
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,468
Help me!

642
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,935
Sure you haven't seen
anything weird tonight?

643
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,207
No. Everybody left really early tonight.

644
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,711
You having a party in here?

645
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,376
No, no. It's just me and Rocky, not a party.

646
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,489
Got anybody coming over to visit?
You know, a little action?

647
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,121
Me? No. The company would fire me
if I had anyone down here tonight.

648
01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:03,896
Especially at this hour.

649
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:07,265
Well, we don't want to break any rules.
Right, partner?

650
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,498
Not on my watch.

651
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,129
Come on, let's go.

652
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,944
Help me!

653
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,246
Help me!

654
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:23,816
I've got to open the gate,
so I'll just take the stairs.

655
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:25,581
Let's do it.

656
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,970
Open.

657
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:05,885
Wait!

658
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:16,937
You guys stay warm.

659
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,705
-You keep your eyes and ears open, huh?
-You bet.

660
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:28,048
-Merry Christmas.
-You too, buddy.

661
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:38,454
Wait! Wait!

662
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:46,609
911.

663
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:49,082
-Yes, please, I need your help.
-All our lines are busy at the moment.

664
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:50,140
Please hold.

665
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,346
-Someone will be with you shortly.
-Hello?

666
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:53,752
Thank you.

667
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:28,514
All our lines are busy at the moment.
Please hold.

668
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,620
911. All our lines are busy at the moment.

669
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,135
Rock? Rocky!

670
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:01,990
Why would you do that?

671
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,790
He's just an animal.

672
01:21:09,832 --> 01:21:11,163
Angela!

673
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:14,831
Why would you kill a defenseless animal?

674
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:30,416
After all I did for you? To help you?

675
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,916
This is what I get?

676
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:37,391
You killed my dog!

677
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,695
Answer. Please answer.

678
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,223
Angela?

679
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:46,657
You're really starting to piss me off!

680
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,062
Angela!

681
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:39,851
Hello? Are you there?

682
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,215
Hello? This is the police.
Is somebody there?

683
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,653
Is this an emergency?
If you can hear me, please say something.

684
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:52,530
Tap the phone, let me know
if you're there. Hello?

685
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:59,005
This is the police. This is 911.
Are you okay? Are you there? Hello?

686
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,745
You're trying to get me fired, aren't you?

687
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,743
Bet you'd really like that.

688
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:28,028
But, honey...

689
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:32,204
What are we gonna do then?

690
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,970
We couldn't just live off of your salary.

691
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,969
Angela!

692
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,541
Angela!

693
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,647
Angela!

694
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,344
Shit!

695
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:49,395
Shit!

696
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:03,404
Let's fucking do this.
You want to fuck with me?

697
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:07,910
Come on!

698
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,926
Come on, you chicken shit!

699
01:29:34,636 --> 01:29:35,830
Angela?

700
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,198
Let me help you out, okay?

701
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,852
Help me? You're gonna help me?

702
01:29:56,925 --> 01:30:00,656
Why don't you let me help you,
for a change? Motherfucker!

703
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,751
What the fuck are you doing, Angela?

704
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,623
Come back here, now! Let me go!

705
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:43,029
Come over here
and get me out of this right now!

706
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,071
Why are you doing this, Angela?

707
01:30:49,044 --> 01:30:50,238
Angela.

708
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:56,307
Angela? I just wanted us to be friends.

709
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,249
I'm alone.

710
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:03,315
I'm always alone.

711
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,290
Why can't we just
spend more time together?

712
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,393
Angela? Wait.

713
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:16,868
Why?

714
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:20,134
Why can't we be friends?

715
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:24,577
Why can't we just
spend Christmas together?

716
01:31:25,347 --> 01:31:28,544
Do you hear me? You stupid, fucking cunt!

717
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:43,554
Angela, wait. I didn't...

718
01:31:44,299 --> 01:31:46,028
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

719
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:53,106
No! No! No!

720
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:55,734
No! No!

721
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:55,557
You all right, lady?
