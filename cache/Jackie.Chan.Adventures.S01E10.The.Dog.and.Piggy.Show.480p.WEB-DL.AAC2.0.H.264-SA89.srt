1
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,514
How much is that doggy
in the windmill?

2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,383
Ha!

3
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,118
Hey, good boy!

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,120
Tohru: Chan!

5
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,056
The ta--
talisman?

6
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,758
Uh, what talisman?

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,095
The one the dragons
indicate.

8
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,498
Oh! This talisman!

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,732
Grr!

10
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,134
You know, tohru,

11
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,368
you really
should consider

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,736
coming over
to the good side.

13
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,372
Section 13
has a marvelous
dental plan,

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,674
and every Thursday
is donut day.

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,813
Unh!

16
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,791
Jackie: Whoa! Uhh!

17
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,193
Unh! Grr!

18
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,164
Argh!

19
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,569
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Have a nice day!

20
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,471
(Seeker turns off)

21
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,510
Chan!

22
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,749
Aah! Unh!

23
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,818
(Seeker malfunctioning)

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,519
Hmm?

25
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,062
Time to walk the dog.

26
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,283
(Telephone ringing)

27
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,486
Jackie: Hello?

28
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,489
Jumping jackal? It's
me...Fearless hyena.

29
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,891
Jade?
Shh!

30
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,026
Wise old goat
roams near.

31
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,127
What?

32
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,530
Ancient rabbit has
very long ears.

33
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,898
What are you
talking about?!

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,466
It's uncle's
birthday!

35
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,834
Where are you?

36
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,870
Ugh! My flight
had a layover

37
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,372
in Bavaria.

38
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,108
If I never see
Bavaria again--

39
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,510
jackal, this isn't
about you.

40
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,912
Don't worry, Jade.

41
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,880
My plane will arrive
in plenty of time

42
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,550
for "operation: Surprise"

43
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,319
cool! So, what
did you get him?

44
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,720
Uh--

45
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,656
p.A.: Flight 19
to San Francisco

46
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:11,990
is now boarding.

47
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,059
Uh, that's me!
See you soon! Bye!

48
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,497
Chocolate, cheese...

49
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,366
Lederhosen? Oh!

50
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,136
Bavaria!

51
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,505
(Hip-hop music
playing on radio)

52
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,946
Jade? Jade!

53
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,948
Jade!!

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,116
Ugh!

55
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,085
Uncle, you scared me.

56
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,186
And the rock
and roll noise

57
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,222
is scaring away
the customers.

58
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,390
Tsk! It's hip-hop, duh!

59
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,460
Come on, uncle coolio.
I'll teach you some moves.

60
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,533
Ugh! My hip
does not hop.

61
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,101
Sure it does.

62
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,604
You just gotta move with
the grandmaster groove.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,340
Ohh!

64
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,141
(Uncle moans)

65
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,643
Ohh!

66
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,114
I am like
that antique.

67
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,917
Uh, valuable?

68
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,120
Old and brittle.

69
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,324
Jade & Jackie:
Happy birthday, uncle!

70
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,161
Jade: Heh heh!

71
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,796
I was all possessed
that day

72
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,131
but my hair
looks good.

73
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,066
And, uh, hey,
funny moose!

74
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,869
I will Cherish it,
Jade.

75
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:34,039
What did you bring me?

76
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,008
Jackie: Ta-da!

77
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,078
Oh, chocolate
stains my teeth,

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,880
and cheese makes my--

79
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,816
um, none of your business.

80
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,184
Uh--oh!

81
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,087
I brought you
one more thing.

82
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,858
It's your sign.

83
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,359
So how old
are you, uncle?

84
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,262
Jade!
Er,
in dog years?

85
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,399
I will do research now.

86
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,501
But, uncle,
we have cake!

87
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,102
You have
to celebrate!

88
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,105
When I am
- another year younger,

89
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,509
then I will celebrate.

90
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,382
You failed to retrieve
the talisman...

91
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,419
And you sat on this.

92
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:24,089
Shendu: The seeking device
was forged by magic.

93
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,259
Such things are hard
to come by.

94
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,928
Apologies, master.

95
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,096
Perhaps the time has come

96
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,132
to have a freelancer
lead future missions.

97
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,534
No need, master.

98
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,668
I will do better.

99
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,136
Ahh, too late.

100
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,773
Tohru,
meet hak foo.

101
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,245
Hmm, black tiger.

102
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,615
He does not look
so ferocious.

103
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,317
(Growls)

104
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,954
Angry crow
takes flight!

105
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,055
Hyah!

106
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,324
Emu stands
on mountain top!

107
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,594
Monkey plucks 2 peaches!

108
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,530
Ye-ahh.

109
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,968
Uh, looks can be
deceiving.

110
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:21,446
"The dog talisman
is best friend to man:

111
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:25,984
"It restores youthful energy
to its holder...

112
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:30,122
And grants eternal life."

113
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,923
Hmm.

114
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,192
Immortality.

115
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,339
Jackie, has uncle
always been, like, all,

116
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,241
you know, uncle-y?

117
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,809
No, Jade.

118
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,244
When uncle was young,

119
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,279
he was just like me.

120
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,415
Does that mean
you're gonna be grouchy,

121
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,216
constipated,
and smell like garlic

122
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,152
when you're uncle's age?

123
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,821
Oh, Jade,
respect your elders...

124
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,022
Both of us.

125
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,157
Whaa!

126
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,225
What? What is it?

127
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,794
A talisman...

128
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,695
Made of chocolate.

129
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,233
Jackie: The pig
is one of the signs

130
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,170
of the Chinese zodiac
that we haven't yet located.

131
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,005
And these
ferkel's chocolates

132
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,874
are clearly modeled
after the pig talisman.

133
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:27,446
So once again
I am off to Bavaria.

134
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,981
I could use
a change of scenery.

135
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,083
I will go with you.

136
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,452
Awesome.

137
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,487
No baby-sitter means
I get to go, too.

138
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,056
B-b-b-b-but, uncle,

139
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,691
you never leave the shop.

140
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,660
And what about
the dog talisman?

141
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,462
Bah, research can wait.

142
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,933
Hyah!

143
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,469
Whoa.

144
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,440
Ha-cha-cha-cha.
So...

145
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,542
What are we waiting for?

146
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,081
The mainframe indicates

147
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,684
that one Mr. chan
has purchased

148
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,920
3 airline tickets
to Bavaria.

149
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,858
The dark hand jet awaits.

150
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,093
Uh, tohru, be a sport
and tag along

151
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,897
in the event hak foo
requires your services.

152
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,300
And when you meet
our friend Jackie chan?

153
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,870
(Growls)

154
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,972
Smashing melon fist!

155
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,916
(Oompah music playing)

156
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,386
I will do some sleuthing
at the chocolate factory,
Jade,

157
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,723
but I think it's best
that you stay with...

158
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,924
Uncle.

159
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,093
You know, Jade,

160
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,829
they have hip-hop
here in Bavaria.

161
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:51,897
Really?

162
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,599
Yes.
They call it oompah.

163
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,804
Hmmph!

164
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,107
So, uh...

165
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,476
Where shall we begin
our search for the talisman?

166
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,977
I don't know.

167
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,915
<i>You</i> sat on
- the seeking device,
remember?

168
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,516
Ahem. Well...

169
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,718
The only talismans
left to be found

170
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,020
are the tiger and...

171
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,493
The pig.

172
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,328
Remain here
and stand watch--

173
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,297
and I mean <i> stand.</i>

174
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,266
Less chance
you'll break something.

175
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,235
(Growls)

176
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,138
You see, Mr. chan,

177
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,940
great great
grandpapa ferkel

178
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,408
devised a unique method

179
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,010
of melting mass quantities
of cocoa beans.

180
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,746
But grandpapa was
a superstitious man

181
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,481
and took the secret
to his grave.

182
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,751
So, all the modern equipment
you see around you

183
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,753
performs essentially
the same task,

184
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,723
locking in wholesome
chocolatey goodness.

185
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,725
(Yawns)
Oh, interesting.

186
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,294
Grandpapa was also
a very generous man

187
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,563
and donated the clock tower
to the town.

188
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,633
What can you tell me
about the pig?

189
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,501
Elwin? Oh, ho ho.

190
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,904
Everyone loves elwinschwein.

191
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:09,507
Grandpapa considered pigs
to be his lucky animal.

192
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,043
No one quite knows why.

193
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:16,481
Perhaps because he found
a pig talisman?

194
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,549
I'm sorry?

195
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,584
Uhh, nothing.

196
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,196
And I thought
your hip didn't hop.

197
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,098
Ha-cha-cha-cha.
Uncle.

198
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,933
Hello! Cheese?

199
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,134
Yummy.

200
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,902
But cheese
gums up your...

201
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,338
Something's different
about you.

202
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,974
Eeh, like what?

203
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,542
Well, for one thing,

204
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,745
you haven't said
"one <i> more</i> thing"

205
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:47,912
since we got here.

206
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,381
Uhh...

207
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,149
Come on, uncle,
please.

208
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,651
You can tell me.

209
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,090
No way.

210
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,493
Way.

211
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,361
Uncle,
- that is so cool.

212
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,763
It's giving you
the power to,

213
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,531
uh, be cool
and stuff.

214
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,433
You're gonna
keep it, right?

215
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,501
(Thinking) Hmmm.

216
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,137
(Clock chimes)

217
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,775
Jade & uncle:
The talisman!

218
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,095
Hak foo:
Seeking a talisman?

219
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,399
Only counterfeits here.

220
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,668
Do I know you?

221
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,103
I am hak foo:

222
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,006
The last human
- you will ever lay eyes upon.

223
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,679
Mantis boxing style!
What?

224
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,281
Serpent pounce
technique!

225
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,348
Float like
lotus blossom!

226
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,416
What are you
talking about?

227
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,818
Sting like scorpion!
Aah.

228
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,352
Unh!

229
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,758
Flamingo stance.

230
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,394
Oh, these little piggies
went to the market.

231
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,829
Flying dragon
corkscrew!

232
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,932
Cat lands on feet
and bares claws!

233
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,004
Cat shakes off water.

234
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,639
Cat tears
squirrel's head off!

235
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,941
Aah!

236
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,910
Ooh!

237
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,445
Baboon leave
tuccus exposed.

238
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,546
(Hak foo snarls)

239
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,782
Hungry crane
diving for shrimp!

240
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,861
(Jackie groans)

241
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:46,531
Black tiger
crushes chan.

242
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,100
You, tiger man...

243
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,036
Remove your feet
from Jackie.

244
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,471
What's a Jackie?

245
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,908
Take your leave
or feel the burn.

246
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,476
You talk the talk,

247
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,411
but can you
walk the walk?

248
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,214
Uncle, this guy
beat Jackie.

249
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,816
(Hak foo growls)

250
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:08,319
Monkey plucks 2 peaches!

251
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,021
Huh?

252
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,256
Whoa.

253
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,024
Gorilla snaps frail twig!

254
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,828
Guh-oh, whoo-hoo.

255
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,163
Twig may be frail,

256
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,633
but roots are slippery.

257
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,301
Jackie?

258
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,803
Uncle?

259
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,904
Rabbit punch!

260
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,438
Mule kick!
Lobster claw!

261
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,940
Cobra coil!
Oyster shuck!

262
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,475
Duck stomp!

263
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,743
Ow.

264
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:32,911
(Babbles)

265
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,279
Grrrr.

266
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,880
Angry crow takes flight!

267
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,917
Thank you for sharing,
angry crow!

268
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,329
Jade, uncle just leapt
20 feet into the air.

269
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,098
Go, uncle!

270
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,600
(Growls)

271
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,035
Hmmm.

272
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,972
Elephant thrusts its leg!

273
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,008
Baaah!

274
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,176
Both: Uncle!

275
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,312
Heh heh.

276
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,948
I meant <i> fist.</i>

277
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,223
Both: Uncle!

278
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,457
Jackie: Uncle,
are you ok?

279
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,892
Jade: Say something.

280
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,628
Retire from
talisman hunting, chan.

281
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,898
It is a hazardous
occupation.

282
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,237
Jade & Jackie:
Uncle! Uncle!

283
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,872
Uncle's voice:
Uncle!

284
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,473
Uncle!

285
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,909
Yes, uncle?

286
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,144
What happened?
- You got such a whupping.

287
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,214
Big mouth had a big fist.

288
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,282
One more thing:

289
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,884
There's work to do.

290
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,886
You must acquire
the pig talisman

291
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,521
and discover the power
it possesses.

292
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,891
But I am dead.

293
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,492
Aiyaaa!

294
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,327
How can you be dead?

295
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,464
You are wearing the
immortality talisman.

296
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,799
Oh, right.

297
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,901
One more thing...

298
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:03,968
(Smack)

299
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,236
Ow!

300
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,971
Uncle, you're ok!

301
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,907
Err, see?

302
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,276
Lots of garlic
is good for you.

303
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,911
We must get
the pig talisman

304
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,113
before the big mouth
finds it.

305
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,815
But we don't know
where it is.

306
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,219
Oh, yes we do.

307
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,962
See the oinker
at 12 o'clock?

308
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,935
Elwin's sportin'
a pork pie hat.

309
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,736
We saw it earlier
when the clock chimed.

310
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,971
Huh? Oh, ooh.

311
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,339
Tohru!

312
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,741
Many thanks...

313
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,078
For leading us
to the prize.

314
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,280
You are not welcome.

315
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,481
You!

316
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,016
But elephant fist!

317
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,718
Why so afraid?

318
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,120
He is an old man.

319
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,690
Uh-yuh-uh-
yuh-uh-yuh!

320
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,563
3 against one.
We can take him!

321
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,031
Jade,
the talisman.

322
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,033
Uh, right.

323
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,368
You, family-size,

324
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,970
stop the girl!
Sit on her!

325
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,171
Do something!

326
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,439
Grrrr!

327
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,650
Tiger slaughters 2 lambs!

328
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,994
You've been
working out.

329
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,629
Pfft. Like riding
a bicycle.

330
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,265
Unh!
Uh!

331
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,150
Unh! Uh! Unh! Uh!

332
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,863
Going up.

333
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,631
Whah!

334
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,285
(Gasps) Jackie!

335
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,859
Give me...

336
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,128
That.

337
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,472
The lucky pig was
how grandpapa ferkel

338
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,340
melted his cocoa beans.

339
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,144
Heat-beam eye-blast?

340
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,682
Heat-beam eye-blast!

341
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,151
(Clock chiming)

342
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,976
Time is not
on his side.

343
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,113
(Scoffs)

344
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,447
Freelancer.

345
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,733
Heat-beam eye-blast.

346
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,611
Hak foo: Ow.

347
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,624
Save Jade!

348
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,562
Both: Bwaaaaaah!

349
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,202
Aaaaaaaaah!

350
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,237
Whoa!
Aaah!

351
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,773
Unh!

352
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,375
Huh. Oh.

353
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,943
(Panting)

354
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,012
Whoo-eee.

355
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,614
I will just go fetch
the pig talisman

356
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,183
while I am up.

357
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,852
Uncle...

358
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,787
Explain.

359
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,591
Jackie, thank you
for allowing me

360
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:57,395
to re-experience
my youth.

361
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,232
But being young
is too dangerous

362
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,568
and exhausting!

363
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,970
Uncle needs a nap.

364
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,972
You earned it,
uncle.

365
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,207
See, Jade?

366
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,275
As tohru demonstrated,

367
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:15,546
one cannot turn back
the hands of time.

368
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,720
Jade: Hey, Jackie?

369
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,854
Yes.

370
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,056
Do you know how to cook?

371
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,190
Yes.

372
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:29,727
I know how to cook an egg

373
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,262
and also a lot of fruits

374
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,897
and water and juice

375
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,333
and...Noodles.

376
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,467
Anything quick.

377
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,669
Scrambled eggs,
sunny-side up,

378
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,171
and I can cook toast.

379
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,940
And all kind of eggs.

380
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,543
Actually I am a terrible cook
but I love to eat.

381
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,079
If you ask me that's
my answer.
