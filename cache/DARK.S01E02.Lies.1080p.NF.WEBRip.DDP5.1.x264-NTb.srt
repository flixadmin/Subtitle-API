1
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:20,541
9 HOURS SINCE MIKKEL’S DISAPPEARANCE

2
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,416
Jonas!

3
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,958
LIES

4
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,166
<i>The victim is male,
between 10 and 12.</i>

5
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,541
Time of death... about 16 hours ago.

6
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:49,291
The burns around the eyes are strange.
Like they’re melted.

7
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,541
No signs of sexual abuse,

8
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,500
no sperm, no foreign DNA.

9
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,166
One thing is strange. Take a look.

10
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,541
Apart from the burns,
the ear canals are destroyed.

11
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,750
The inner ear was damaged too.

12
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,625
Both eardrums have burst.

13
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,416
From an
extremely loud sound?

14
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,958
Yes... Or pressure,

15
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,541
caused by a nosedive.

16
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,500
Or by intense rotation,
such as in a centrifuge.

17
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,500
Do you know what otoconia are?

18
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,666
Tiny grains in the ear canals

19
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,125
that help us differentiate
between up and down.

20
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,500
They can get confused.

21
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,500
When the body rotates, for example.
We lose our balance.

22
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,625
With this boy, none of the grains
are where they should be.

23
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,000
Mikkel!

24
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,166
Mikkel!

25
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,583
Mikkel!

26
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,500
Mikkel!

27
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,833
- What were you doing up there?
- Ouch! Are you crazy?

28
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,333
What were you doing?

29
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,375
I heard you guys talking at school.

30
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,041
About the caves...

31
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,083
and Erik’s drugs...

32
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
so I thought...

33
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,125
I don’t know what I thought.

34
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,416
I’m sorry about Mikkel.

35
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:09,333
<i>Monday night in Winden,
another boy vanished without a trace.</i>

36
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,333
<i>According to the police, the 11-year-old</i>

37
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,125
<i>was last seen
with his siblings in Winden Forest</i>

38
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,250
<i>near the nuclear power plant
and the Winden Caves.</i>

39
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:23,250
<i>The police are asking the public for tips
that may help solve the case.</i>

40
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:28,333
<i>Citizens’ groups are also coordinating
searches with local authorities.</i>

41
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:33,416
<i>For two weeks now, a 15-year-old boy
from the Winden area has been missing.</i>

42
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,125
<i>Police have declined to comment on whether
the two missing persons cases are related.</i>

43
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,833
Hello.

44
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,916
It’s Mom.

45
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,083
You’re probably out.

46
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,666
About Mikkel...

47
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,500
I really don’t know what to say.

48
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,125
Are Martha and Magnus okay?

49
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,708
Should we...

50
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,541
Can we help?

51
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,541
Call me when you hear this.

52
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,250
We’re very worried.

53
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,375
Okay.

54
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,041
I...

55
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,291
I couldn’t get hold of Ulrich.

56
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,916
Shouldn’t we go see the kids?

57
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,666
They’ve organized various search parties.
I have to go.

58
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,333
Where were you last night?

59
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,333
I woke up around midnight.
You weren’t there.

60
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,875
Couldn’t sleep.

61
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,875
I went into the garden
to get the bushes ready for winter.

62
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,833
The car wasn’t there either.

63
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,791
We were out of cord.

64
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,750
I had to go to the gas station.

65
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,916
First Mads, now Mikkel.

66
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,791
It’s exactly like back then.

67
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,834
<i>When Dad’s brother disappeared,</i>

68
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,270
- how old was he?
- MOTHER’S DAY 1986

69
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,723
Your father was 15.

70
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,871
Mads was three years younger.

71
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,541
And he was never found?

72
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,083
We talked about Erik.

73
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,416
In the forest.

74
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,958
Mikkel thought that was the worst.

75
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,000
When someone isn’t found.

76
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,750
Mikkel’s coming back.

77
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,458
Definitely.

78
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,041
<i>Hey, this is Martha.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

79
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,750
Hey, Martha.

80
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,875
It’s me.

81
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,250
I, um...

82
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,291
Just call me back, okay? Bye.

83
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,083
<i>The dead boy is neither Mikkel nor Erik.</i>

84
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,541
This kid is disfigured.
The eyes are completely burnt.

85
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,375
There was red soil
all over his clothes.

86
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,666
But none where he was found.

87
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,250
And it looks as if someone
dressed the boy in clothes from the ’80s.

88
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,583
The shoes, the Walkman...
From the ’80s as well.

89
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,125
We found this around his neck:

90
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,791
a one-pfennig coin from 1986
on a red cord.

91
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,083
The cassette contains this.

92
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>We fall through the time stream
Then awaken from a dream</i>

93
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,875
- And Mikkel and Erik?
- Wöller will coordinate the search.

94
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,458
For now, we won’t make
the discovery of the body public.

95
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,083
We’ve got two missing kids
and a dead, unidentified boy.

96
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,708
Contact the central office
for missing persons.

97
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,250
Question everyone in the proximity.
Everyone!

98
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,583
In the cave... there’s a door!
I found a door.

99
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,541
Can I have a word?

100
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,458
There’s a door inside the cave,
leading to the nuclear plant.

101
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,166
We need a search warrant. Maybe Mikkel
accessed the grounds through that door.

102
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,458
That’s a high security area.
You can’t just enter.

103
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,583
- Maybe he climbed the fence.
- The barbed wire?

104
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,190
We checked the fence.
There was no damage to it.

105
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,533
You’re thinking the same thing, right?

106
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,333
That the cases are all connected.
The dead boy, Erik, Mikkel.

107
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,958
Maybe you were right.
It’s just like it was back then.

108
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,208
Mads disappeared at the same spot.
Close to the nuclear power plant.

109
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,644
Something is wrong up there...
I just know it.

110
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:40,958
Okay.

111
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,791
I’ll request the search warrant.

112
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,250
The police will be here soon.

113
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,833
We need to get rid of them tonight,
Jürgen.

114
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,125
Tonight.

115
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,291
They’ll be snooping all over here.

116
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,041
Maybe someone else should do it.

117
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,916
Because of Erik...
They’ll be watching.

118
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,625
Are you blackmailing me?

119
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,416
No, why?

120
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,791
Do you know the difference between
successful and unsuccessful people?

121
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,541
Exactly.

122
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,416
So do it tonight.

123
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,625
And you talk to no one.

124
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,125
Understood?

125

FOREST HOTEL WINDEN

Can I help you?

127
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,333
I need a room.

128
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,333
<i>Must be horrible for you.
First, the thing with your son Mads...</i>

129
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,916
and now your grandson.

130
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,375
But...

131
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,375
the whole town is mobilizing.

132
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,875
We’ll find him.

133
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,750
Maybe.

134
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,833
Maybe not.

<i>And so, at least hypothetically,
because of these gravitational anomalies,</i>

142
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,750
<i>it is possible to bend time and space.</i>

Let me in.

148
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,875
There’s a door in the caves.
Maybe he got through it.

149
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,458
Let me search the slope.
Let me search your section of the caves!

150
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,166
Please.

151
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,041
I can’t just let anyone in there.

152
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,291
It’s a high security area.

My employees patrol it every day.

If Mikkel were here, we’d know it.

You fucking asshole!

156
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,333
Why are you doing this?
Are you trying to ruin me?

157
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,166
We’re talking about my son!

158
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,625
I’m coming back with a search warrant!

159
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:37,083
And then you’ll open this goddamn gate!

160
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,208
You asshole!

161
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,833
Open up!

162
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,166
I’m sorry, Ulrich.

163
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,541
- Honestly.
- Open up, man!

166
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,541
What are you doing here?

167
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,583
- I wanted to see you.
- Come on.

168
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,541
What is this?

169
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,958
Why are you here?

170
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,833
I’m so sorry.

171
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,125
Have you found out anything?

172
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,916
Stop it, please.

173
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,250
Please.

174
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,916
I can’t do this, not now.

175
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,208
I’ll call you, okay?

176
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,125
WHERE IS THE CROSSING?

177
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,833
Car unidentified, unidentified...

178
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,791
“Identification: Van”?

179
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,125
Obendorf has a van...

<i>Jankowski!</i>

182
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,284
Did you question Obendorf?

183
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:42,916
Yes. Why?

184
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,041
The files say he was on duty at the plant
when Erik disappeared.

185
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,375
He works in the storerooms
and as a driver sometimes.

186
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,625
- Did you confirm that?
- Of course.

187
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,750
So he has access
to the power plant grounds?

188
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,250
- I think so.
- Was he at the plant last night too?

189
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,000
No idea.

190
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,916
I haven’t spoken to him yet.

191
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,416
Drop it.

192
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,125
Drop it, I said!

193
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,166
Ulrich!

194
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,666
What is this?

195
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,625
Is this yours?

196
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,750
We did it together.

197
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,666
Erik and I.

198
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,125
We sold some at the school.

199
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,708
Were you at the plant yesterday?

200
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,916
Yesterday? No, why?

201
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:54,666
What’s this?

202
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,458
When people bring their junk here,
you always find something.

203
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,458
Erik was saving up for a scooter.

204
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,000
Where’s my boy?

205
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,916
I don’t know, Jürgen.

206
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,583
Do you think
they’ll find him?

207
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,666
I hope so.

208
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,514
Do you think he had a secret?

209
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,500
Mikkel?

210
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,541
No, Dad.

211
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,958
Do you think
he was keeping something from us?

212
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,833
Why do you say that?

213
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,375
Do you miss him?

214
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,083
I think I miss a notion of him.

215
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,375
I don’t know who he really was.

216
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,541
Maybe we never know that.

217
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,666
What a person is really like.

218
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,291
Did you love him?

219
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,625
Whatever happens,
you’ll tell me the truth.

220
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,958
Don’t lie to me.

221
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,333
Whatever it is.

222
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,333
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

223
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:42,125
WHEN IS MIKKEL?

224
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,333
Who are you?

225
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,208
Why? Who are you?

226
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:40,125
Mikkel.

227
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,291
I live here.

228
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,625
Ulrich. And I live here.

229
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,041
You going to grow roots?

230
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:51,625
- You’re at the wrong house, fool.
- Hey, Ulrich!

231
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,333
Come on, we need to go.

232
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:55,958
Yes, Katharina, I’m coming.

233
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,583
Are you dense? You don’t live here.

234
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,458
Who is that?

235
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,916
The Grim Reaper. Can’t you tell?

236
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,000
Ouch! Katharina.

237
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,958
