655
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,403
{\1c&Hb0f0f0}  {\b(0)}

704
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:08,410
{\1c&Hb0f0f0}  {\b(0)}
Because I don't want to.

There are no statutes capable of controlling

717
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,494
{\1c&Hb0f0f0}  {\b(0)}
Why don't you read about
women's struggle first?

718
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:33,597
{\1c&Hb0f0f0}  {\b(0)}
You know, Lee, there's a long
history of this in Catholicism.

719

720
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:41,772
{\1c&Hb0f0f0}  {\b(0)}
And the nuns, they wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

721
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:45,484
{\1c&Hb0f0f0}  {\b(0)}
Two years ago, when it didn't work out
between us, that was it.

725
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:55,953

Without question, he is the most
isolated man I have ever known.
