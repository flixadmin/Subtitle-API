- She was a test subject

60
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,278
in an old Wayne Enterprises program
called Pinewood Farms.

61
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:17,031
Before she passed, Karen mentioned
you were involved with the program.

62
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,827
- That was a long time ago.
- Try and remember...

If you can.

64
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,460
Pinewood Farms was started by Thomas Wayne
in an attempt to cure

65
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,255
humanity's greatest ailments
on the genetic level.

66

- Old age, disease, even death.
- But that's not what happened, is it?

67
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:42,724
Karen said the program tried to play God,
and you ended up creating monsters.

68
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,517
I was just a researcher,

69
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,353
with no knowledge of that
until it was too late.

70

A man of your skill and expertise,
a lowly researcher?

I find that hard to believe.

72
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,818
But it's true.

73
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:58,364
Mr. Wayne excelled at compartmentalizing
every aspect of his life.

74
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:01,868
Within Pinewood, the left hand often
didn't know what the right was doing.

He lied to us all.

Not many people
would see you as the victim here.

77
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,834
I was one of the ones who forced
Thomas Wayne to shut down the program.

78
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,172
But by then, so many people had been hurt.

- I have a theory.
- Hmm?

80
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,762
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.

81
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,681
I believe you've restarted the program.

82
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,518
- And I would like to know--
- Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?

I'm not here
for a therapy session, Professor.

87
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,658
No, it's more like an interrogation

a police officer,

The only reason you're sitting
in that chair is because I allow it.

91

So let me ask you, why are you here?

92

00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,118
But not for long, my friend.
I'll find my way out.

161
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,121
'Cause this place is just one big puzzle,
and puzzles are my forte.

Nobody beats me.

163
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,254
I did. See you never, Ed.

MS. PEABODY: I have
a feeling he is going to be

166
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,511
more than a simple nuisance.

167
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:15,806
Not the type to be bribed,
nor distracted easily.

168
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,851
- Indeed. If only we...
- Very interesting.

but might knock on your door

170
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,606
and you better open up if it does?

171
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,817
Mr. Gordon's continued interference
threatens to slow us down

172

when we're about to reach
our finest moment.

173

He'll do more than that.

00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:32,990
Mr. Nygma.

175
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,744
Eavesdropping is rude and unwise.

176
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,580
Eavesdropping implies intent,
and I mostly...

177
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,667
- Accidentally overheard.
- Overheard what?

178
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,921
Jim Gordon, the word nuisance.
Sounds familiar.

179
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,092
Probably has something to do with your
releasing Penguin and Gordon's ex-fiancée.

180
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,344
Probably.

181
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,430
I can help you take him down.

182
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,683
I know everything about Jim Gordon.

183
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,602
If you let me out of here we could
probably just sit down in your office--

184
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,897
Mr. Nygma, you can't help me.
I'm here to help you.

Those are the roles that were defined
for the two of us.

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,653
- Now, there's another pressing matter.
- No, listen, I...

187
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:13,572
I can manipulate people.

188
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,825
I did it to Gordon once,
and I can do it again.

189
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,786
See, people's brains are just a mystery.

190

And once you figure it out...

191

Look, Helzinger.

192

Can't stand criticism
because of an overbearing mother.

193

Gets mad when he doesn't get it.

194
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:30,881

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,338
I'm sorry. Was that too far?

209

Everybody has a story.

I have the cure for our prized patient.

- What is an identity?

It is a story

What I had to do?

I chose to kill a man in cold blood.

And it was the wrong choice,
crossing that line.
