Man:
<i>Brace the wind.</i>

4
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,595
The Lord of Light
has made good on his
promise, my king.

5
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,556
His fires have melted
the snows away.

6
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,099
The way ahead is clear.

7
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,726
We ride for Winterfell.

8
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,144
And you will take it.

9
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,982
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

10
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,819
You will receive
what is yours by right.

11
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,591
Your Grace.

12
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,260
Prepare to form up.

13
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,928
Your Grace.

14
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,599
Tell me.

15
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,270
The men, many deserted
before dawn.

16
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,440
Stannis:
<i>How many?</i>

17
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,401
General:
<i>Nearly half.</i>

18
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,404
All the sellswords
with all the horses.

19
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,333
Your Grace.

20
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,714
Speak up.
Can't be worse
than mutiny.

21
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,204
Cut her down.

22
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,969
General:
<i>Your Grace.</i>

23
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,139
The Lady Melisandre
was just seen riding
out of camp.

24
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,528
Get the men
into marching formation.

25
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,491
On to Winterfell.

26
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,079
-<i> ( distant horse neighs )</i>
-<i> ( wind howling )</i>

27
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,248
He raised his hands

28
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,501
and they all stood up
at once.

29
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,966
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

30
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,509
So what are you
gonna do?

31
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,723
I'm gonna hope they don't
learn how to climb the Wall.

32
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,393
But the dragonglass...

33
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,354
No one's ever
getting that back now.

34
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,773
<i>It wouldn't have</i>
<i>mattered anyway.</i>

35
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,274
<i>Not unless we had</i>
<i>a mountain of it.</i>

36
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,111
But you killed
a white walker.

37
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,654
<i>With Longclaw.</i>

38
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,324
I saw them
shatter steel axes
like they were glass.

39
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,119
- But Longclaw...
- Sam:<i> Is Valyrian steel.</i>

40
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,080
How many Valyrian
steel swords are left
in the Seven Kingdoms?

41
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,873
Not enough.

42
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,919
The first Lord Commander
in history

43
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,296
to sacrifice the lives
of sworn brothers

44
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,507
to save the lives
of wildlings.

45
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,055
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man
in Castle Black?

46
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,182
<i>You were friends with me</i>
<i>when I first came here.</i>

47
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,309
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

48
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,438
Here's to us, then.

49
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,148
Long may they sneer.

50
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,366
What?

51
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,537
I wanted to ask
you something.

52
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,082
To ask something of you.

53
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,005
Send me, Gilly,
and the baby to Oldtown

54
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,215
so I can become a maester.

55
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,885
That's what
I'm meant to be.
Not this.

56
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,971
I need you here, Sam.

57
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,640
If you leave, who's left
to give me advice I trust?

58
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,102
Well, there's Edd.

59
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,483
I'd be more use
to you as a maester.

60
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,278
More use to everyone
now that Maester Aemon
is gone.

61
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,239
The Citadel
has the world's
greatest library.

62
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,493
I'll learn about history,

63
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,120
strategy, healing.

64
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,663
And other things,

65
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,750
things that will
help when--

66
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,293
when they come.

67
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,965
If Gilly stays here,
then she'll die.

68
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,845
And the baby
that she named
after me will die.

69
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,140
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

70
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,145
Which means that
the last thing that
I'll see in this world

71
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,107
will be
the look in her eyes
when I fail them.

72
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,989
And I'd rather see
a thousand white walkers
than see that.

73
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,167
( sighs )

74
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,799
Thank you.

75
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,343
You know that
the Citadel will make you
swear off women, too.

76
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,554
Oh, they'll bloody try.

77
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,643
- Sam.
- What?

78
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,731
Sam.

79
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,067
You had just been
beaten half to death.
How did you--

80
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,695
Oh, very carefully.

81
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,865
I'm glad
the end of the world's

82
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,616
working out well
for someone.

83
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,498
I'll come back.

84
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,002
To your return.

85
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,629
To my return.

86
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,508
( clicks )

87
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,523
Man:
<i>Aye, this way.</i>

Podrick:
<i>My lady!</i>

90
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,396
Stannis.

91
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,398
Stannis
Baratheon is coming.
His whole army.

92
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,899
How do you know
it's Stannis?

93
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,901
They're carrying his
flaming heart banners.

94
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,488
From the Blackwater.
I'll never forget it.

95
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,058
( grunts )

96
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,361
Trench here.

97
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,654
Another one 300 yards
from the castle wall.

98
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,782
Hurry them along.

99
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,325
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,618
<i>Dig between those two rises.</i>

101
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,661

- Soldier #2:<i> Archers!</i>
- Soldier #3:<i> Spread out!</i>

103
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,500
And send out
a foraging party
immediately.

104
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,794
Siege begins
at sunrise.

105
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,213
There's not going
to be a siege,
Your Grace.

Bolton has women
fighting for him?

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,179
I don't fight
for the Boltons.

122

I'm Brienne of Tarth.

123
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,479
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

124
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,322
I was there when he was
murdered by a shadow
with your face.

<i>You murdered him</i>
<i>with blood magic?</i>

126

I did.

127
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,347
In the name of Renly
of House Baratheon,

128
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,849
First of His Name,

129

rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

130

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

131
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,484
I, Brienne of Tarth,
sentence you to die.

132
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,868
Do you have
any last words?

133
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,171
Go on, do your duty.

134
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,358
Looks like we're done here.

My lady.

145

I've come to escort you
back to your chamber.

146

Go with her, please.

147
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,774
I know what Ramsay is.

148
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,901
I know what
he'll do to me.

149
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,157
If I'm going to die,

150
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,702
let it happen while there's
still some of me left.

151
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,331
Die?

152
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,000
Who said anything
about dying?

153
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,460
You can't die.

154
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,462
Your father was
Warden of the North.

155
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,338
Ramsay needs you.

156
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,719
Though I suppose
he doesn't need
all of you.

157
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,180
Just the parts he'll use
to make his heir,

158
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,641
until you've given him
a boy or two and he's
finished using them.

159
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:28,316
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

160
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,610
So, shall we wait
for him to come back

161
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,528
or should we begin now?

162
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,866
You're leaving it to me?

163
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,493
Good.

164
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,203
Let's begin.

165
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,707
Reek-- stop!

166
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,751
Stop!
( screams )

167
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,211
( grunts )

168
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,385
-<i> ( horn blows )</i>
- Man:<i> Open the gate!</i>

169
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,436
He's coming back.

170
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,652

171
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,582

-<i> ( whips )</i>

<i>( switch breaks )</i>

174
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,201
I can see I have
my work cut out for me.

175
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,370
You two, out.

176
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,126

( groaning )

183
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,387
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

184
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,640
For killing Syrio Forel.
Remember him?

185
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,934
Probably not.

186
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,981
I've gotten a few
of the others.

187
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,234
The Many-Faced God stole
a few more from me.

188
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,820
But I'm glad
he left me you.

189
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,534
Do you know who I am?

190
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,661
( muffled )

191
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,040
I can't hear you.

00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,718
You know who I am.

195
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,761
I'm Arya Stark.

196
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,683
- ( pierces )
- ( groans )

197
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,398
Do you know
who you are?

198
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,775
( whimpers )

199
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,527
You're no one.

200
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,655
You're nothing.

201
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,076
( gurgling )

202
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,659
A girl has taken a life.

203
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,037
The wrong life.

204
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,999
I was right about her.

205
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,334
You were.

206
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,171
You're not ready.

207
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,549
Not at all.

208
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,969
( gasps )

209
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,764
That man's life
was not yours to take.

210
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,351
A girl stole from
the Many-Faced God.

211
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,313
Now a debt is owed.

212
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,816
( whimpering )

213
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,196
Only death
can pay for life.

214
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,586
( crying )
No! No!

215
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,132
No, you-- don't die!
Don't die!

216
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,430
Why are you crying?

217
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,684
He was my friend.

218
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,395
No, he wasn't.
Didn't you listen to him?

219
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,731
Jaqen:
<i>He was no one.</i>

220
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,987
( gasps )
But if you're--

221
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,866
who's this?

222
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,951
Jaqen:
<i>No one at all.</i>

223
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,663
Just as a girl should
have been before she took
a face from the hall.

224
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,422
<i>The faces are for no one.</i>

225
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,090
You are still someone.

226
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,429
And to someone,

227
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,055
the faces are as good
as poison.

228
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,934
( gasps )

229
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,022
( whimpering )

230
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,904
I can't see.

231
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,787
What's happening?

232
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,831
What's happening?!

233
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,716
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

234
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,761
- Doran:<i> I wish you</i>
<i>a safe journey home.</i>
- Thank you.

235
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,352
Forgive me, child.

236
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:05,189
I wish you
all the happiness
in the world.

237
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,708
Maybe I'll come
visit you sometime.

238
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,752
Maybe I'll come
visit you.

239
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,212
Don't wait too long.

240
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,089
Got a noblewoman
to marry back home.

241
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,800
You want a good girl,

242
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,094
but you need
the bad pussy.

243
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,432
Jaime:
<i>Whenever you're</i>
<i>ready, my lord.</i>

244
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,608
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

245
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,534
Try not to lose it
this time.

246
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,372
I'll never
take it off again.

247
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,375
I know you didn't
want to leave Dorne,

248
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,627
but I'm glad
you're coming home.

249
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,337
Your mother's desperate
to see you.

250
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,840
I'm glad Trystane
is coming with us.

251
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,758
He seems like a nice boy.

252
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,343
You're lucky.

253
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,847
Arranged marriages
are rarely so--

254
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,974
so well arranged.

255
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,935
Do you think Mother
will like him?

256
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,564
If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.

257
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,107
( laughs )
You really believe that?

258
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,901
Have you ever known
your mother to like anyone

259
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,279
aside from her children?

260
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,156
She likes you.

261
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,075
I'm not so sure
about that.

262
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,577
Listen...

263
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,831
there's something
I wanted to tell you.

264
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,419
Something I should
have told you long ago.

265
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,212
So...

266
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,925
now that you've seen
more of the world,

267
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,804
you've learned
how complicated
things can be,

268
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,931
people can be.

269
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,268
The Lannisters
and the Martells have
hated each other for years,

270
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,270
but you've fallen
in love with Trystane.

271
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,273
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

272
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,233
You happen to fall
in love with the man

273
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,319
you were assigned
to marry?

274
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,029
My point is...

275
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,284
we don't choose
whom we love.

276
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,536
It just, well--

277
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,166
it's beyond our control.

278
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,126
- I sound like an idiot.
- No, you don't.

279
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,712
What I'm trying to say--
what I'm trying

280
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,089
and failing to say--

281
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,507
I know what
you're trying to say.

282
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,967
No, I'm afraid you don't.

283
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,552
I do.

284
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,517
I know.

285
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,060
About you and Mother.

286
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,898
I think a part of me
always knew.

287
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,569
And I'm glad.

288
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,242
I'm glad
that you're my father.

289
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,112
Myrcella?

293
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,917

You love her,
don't you?

00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,462
How could you not?

298
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,590
Of course it's hopeless
for the both of you.

299
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:27,302
A sellsword
from the fighting pits,
a disgraced knight.

300
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,555
Neither one of you
is fit consort
for a queen.

301
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,936
But we always want
the wrong woman.

Torgo Nudho.

306
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,863
He should not be here.

No, but he is.

308

Our queen ordered him
exiled from city.

309

Our queen would be dead
if not for him.

Sorry I not there

None of that matters now.

The longer we sit
here bantering,

the longer
Daenerys is out there

He's right.
The dragon headed north.

to help her do it.

00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,714
You've been here
for how many days now?

326
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,341
I've fought
for her for years.

327
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,884
Since she was little
more than a child.

328
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,178
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

329
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,722
And she exiled you.
Twice, I believe.

330
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,307
The second time
thanks to you.

331
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,768
Don't blame me
for your crimes,
Mormont.

332
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,312
He's right.
Our queen exiled Jorah.

333
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,315
And he's right.
Jorah saved her life.

334
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,442
Perhaps she feels
differently about him now.

335
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,153
Perhaps not.
The only way we'll know
is if we ask her.

336
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,740
Tyrion:
<i>Fine, fine.</i>
<i>I suppose he can join us.</i>

337
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,284
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

338
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,704
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

339
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,374
Forgive me,
but why would
we bring you?

340
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,335
Pardon me?

341
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,337
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

342
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,298
Not precisely,
but I have other skills
that would be useful.

343
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,342
Can you fight?

344
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,718
I have fought.

345
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,512
I don't claim to be
a great warrior.

346
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,764
Are you good
on a horse?

347
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,099
Middling.

348
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,142
So mainly you talk.

349
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,436
And drink.
I've survived so far.

350
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,856
Which I respect,
but you would not help us
on this expedition.

351
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,611
You would help us
here in Meereen, though.

352
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,697
None of us have experience
governing a city

353
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,031
except for him.

354
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,950
You want to prove
your value to the queen?

355
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,743
Prove it right here
in Meereen.

356
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:59,037
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks
the language.

357
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,664
Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?

358
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,541
They wouldn't.

359
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,459
They will listen
to Grey Worm.

360
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,294
I'll come with you.

361
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,963
I'll find our queen.

362
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,465
- You are not strong
enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

363
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,051
He is.
He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

364
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,138
But you still can't go.

365
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,764
The people believe in you.

366
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,850
They know you speak
for the queen.

367
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,476
It's true.

368
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,603
Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.

369
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,232
If you leave,
half this city will
consume the other half.

370
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,276
And Missandei.

371
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,446
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

372
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,282
Certainly not me.

373
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,325
The queen's
closest confidante,

374
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,995
the commander
of the Unsullied,

375
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,748
and a foreign dwarf
with a scarred face.

376
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,459
Good fortune,
my friends.

377
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,461
Meereen is ancient
and glorious.

378
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,421
Try not to ruin her.

379
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,008
Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.

380
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,010
Let's find
some good horses.

381
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,512
We have so much
to talk about.

382
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,949
<i>( dragon screeches )</i>

383
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,288
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

384
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,464
Varys:
Hello, old friend.

385
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:37,969
I thought we were
so happy together
until you abandoned me.

386
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,557
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

387
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,185
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

388
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,396
if one knows
how to listen.

389
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,357
They tell me you've
already found favor

390
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
with the Mother
of Dragons.

391
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,195
Well, she didn't
execute me,

392
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,365
so that's
a promising start.

393
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,742
Now the heroes
are off to find her

394
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,744
and I'm stuck here

395
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:06,414
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

396
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,250
Any advice
for an old comrade?

397
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,043
Information is the key.

398
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,420
You need to learn
your enemy's strengths
and strategies.

399
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:16,675
You need to learn
which of your friends
are not your friends.

400
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:20,345
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

401
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,347
If only.

402
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,977
A grand old city

403
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,855
choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.

404
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,774
Who could possibly
have any experience

405
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,819
managing such a massive,
ungainly beast?

406
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,743
I did miss you.

407
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,705
Oh, I know.

408
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,638
<i>( dragon growls )</i>

409
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,145
We have to go home.

410
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,738
Oh, my poor,
sweet thing.

411
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,781
Does it hurt?

412
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,453
We have to go home.

413
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,999
Drogon.

414
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,335
Can you take me
back to Meereen?

415
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,966
How far
did you carry me?

416
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,553
( groans )

417
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,518
Drogon, we need
to return.

418
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,270
My people need me.

419
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,819
( hisses )

420
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,991
( growling )

421
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,577
( gasps )

422
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,638
Well, there's no food.

423
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,724
At the very least,
you could hunt us
some supper.

424
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,528
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

425
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,795
( horse whinnies )

426
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,515
( horses neigh )

427
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,145
<i>( men whooping )</i>

428
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,319
<i>( men whooping )</i>

429
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,367
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

430
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,121
<i>( door opens )</i>

431
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,919
( whimpers )

432
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,633
Confess.

433
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,639
Confess.

434
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,153
I have sinned.

435
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,738
I see that now.

436
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,616
How can I have been
so blind for so long?

437
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,829
I want to be clean again.

438
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,249
I want absolution.

439
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:47,088
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

440
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,715
And by its holy light--

441
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,342
You wish to make
a confession?

442
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,015
Once I've confessed,
will I be free?

443
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:00,101
Your Grace will be
dealt with according
to her sins.

444
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,647
The Mother have
mercy, then.

445
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,903
I lay with a man outside
the bonds of marriage.
I confess.

446
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,529
Name him.

447
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,035
Lancel Lannister.

448
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,163
Your cousin
and the king's squire.

449
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,166
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

450
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,210
A husband off whoring
every chance he--

451
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,213
His sins do not
pardon your own.

452
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,383
May the gods forgive me.

453
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,221
Other men?

454
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,723
No.

455
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,808
No others?

456
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,062
No.

457
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,732
<i>Speaking falsehoods</i>
<i>before the gods</i>
<i>is a great crime.</i>

458
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,275
<i>You understand this?</i>

459
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,902
I do.

460
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,073
There are those
that say your children

461
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,659
were not fathered
by King Robert,

462
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,663
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

463
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,331
A lie.

464
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,500
A lie from the lips
of Stannis Baratheon.

465
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,419
He wants the throne,
but his brother's children
stand in his way.

466
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,881
So he claims they are
not his brother's.

467
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,926
That filth.

468
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,512
There is not one shred
of truth to it.

469
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,597
I deny it.

470
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,101
Good.

471
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,438
But these
are terrible charges.

472
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,191
And the realm must know
the truth of them.

473
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,819
If Your Grace has given
honest testimony,

474
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,029
your trial will prove
your innocence.

475
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,532
Trial?
I have confessed.

476
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,200
To a single sin.

477
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,160
Others you have denied.

478
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,956
Your trial
will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.

479
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,586
I bow to the wisdom
of Your High Holiness.

480
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,882
But if I might beg

481
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,468
for just one drop
of the Mother's mercy.

482
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,557
I haven't seen my son--

483
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,310
I don't know
how long it's been.

484
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,228
