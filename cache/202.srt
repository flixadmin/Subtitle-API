1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,780
If you think I look at you like a trophy,
you're wrong. You're not good enough.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,980
Vilde, you're super pretty.
-But not pretty enough.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,460
If you really want to get rid of me,
go on a date with me.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,720
Remember when I said you weren't good enough?
That was bullshit.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,980
Okay.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,540
Why is it so hard to understand people
can be friends with their ex?

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,920
It's William.
He wants to talk to you.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,360
If you go out on a date with me,
I'll stop using Vilde.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Hi. Hello.
-Hi?

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,740
We were wondering if you know Jonas.
From the first year.

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
I think he's in 1STD.

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,220
Eh, yeah..
-Do you know if he's together with someone?

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,900
No, I don't think so.

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,780
What about the girl with the Head jacket?

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,000
Eh, Eva?
-Yes, Eva!

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,980
No, she's not his girlfriend.

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,440
Okay, great. Thanks!

18
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,220
Hello.
-Hi!

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,180
What's up?

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,100
I didn't do my homework.

21
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,420
Have you talked to Jonas?

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah, why?

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,540
What actually happened on Friday?

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,340
His phone died.

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,280
So.. Did he have fun at 
the Elvebakken party?

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,980
They never even got there. They went to a 
third year party. Do you know whose?

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,780
Apparently it was really awesome.
Lots of people from school were there.

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,080
We should've known and gone there.

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,660
Did he hook up with someone?

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,700
I don't think so. Don't know. Why?

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,380
It seems like the only thing you two talk about
is who he has hooked up with.

32
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,500
That's not the only thing we talk about!
Also about who I hook up with.

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,700
You haven't hooked up with anyone since
you've broken up, have you?

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,740
But if I had..
-Maybe you should.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,980
Hook up with someone?
-Hm-hm.

36
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,780
I'd gladly hook up with someone,
but I just haven't hit on anyone.

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,940
What about Tinder?
-Tinder?!

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,620
Okay.. what happened to you?

39
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,420
I think it'd be good for you to get out
there a little.

40
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,980
I'm not on Tinder.
-Why not?

41
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,600
Are you on Tinder?
-Me? No. Oh my god.

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,820
But you, Noora.. Why don't we ever talk
about your love life?

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,860
We have Spanish now. Clock is ticking,
and you haven't done your homework.

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,340
(Why are you changing the subject?)

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,740
Who did you hook up with last?

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,020
I'm just saying we have Spanish now.
Stop talking about hooking up.

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,040
It's the only thing you care about.
I've never heard you talk about anything else.

48
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
It's really sick.

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,000
Maybe you should get some help.

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,260
With Spanish or hooking up?
-Both!

51
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,900
Should we just be wallflowers then?

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,360
It's not about being wallflowers.
It's about how we present ourselves.

53
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,820
We shouldn't be perceived as
sexual objects.

54
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,680
I don't want to be sexual objects,
I just want us to look pretty.

55
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,840
You use red lipstick.
Because it looks pretty on you.

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,160
That's not why I do it.
It's because I think it's nice.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,920
I don't do it for guys.
-What's the difference?

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,560
<i>[You're really pretty today. Happy Women's Day. 
Looking forward to Friday.]</i>

59
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,320
It's going well. We got "Brun og Blid"
as a sponsor.

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,640
How did you do that?
-I've been doing a little research after school.

61
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,860
I'm not really sure if we should have them 
as our sponsor.

62
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,480
Because I don't think I want us to present 
ourselves as sexual objects.

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,080
That's really important to me.

64
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,700
But at the same time I want us to be seen
as beautiful individuals.

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,400
Above all we will emphasize
our femininity.

66
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,460
I think that "Brun og Blid" is
good for that.

67
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,720
Why is everyone staring at Jonas?
-Didn't you hear?

68
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,540
No.

69
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,480
There are rumors that he got
a third year to come.

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,260
Come to what?

71
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,260
Cum-come..

72
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,960
He slept with a third year?

73
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,980
He went down on her.

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,300
Huh?
-He licked her.

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,580
But Eva, you said Norwegian guys didn't..

76
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,520
Hello.

77
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,080
Happy Women's Day.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,180
What course do you guys have now?
-Eh, Norwegian! Yeah.

79
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,860
Me too. Should we just go now?

80
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,040
It's difficult for Tinder to know that.
It should be in the bio. 14 centimeter.

81
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
Hey you! Look who's on Tinder.

82
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,040
Tinder?
-Yes, Tinder! You have to come with me.

83
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,040
Why should I come with?

84
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,260
Excuse me? Check his friends.
They are fucking handsome.

85
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,140
They are second years at Handels.

86
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,840
His name is Adam. Adam.. Eva..
It's perfect!

87
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,980
Then you can go with her!
-I'm going to Stavanger.

88
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,040
You?
-I have basketball camp.

89
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,440
It's my cousin's birthday.

90
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,360
Noora! Come with me, please?

91
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,300
You said I needed to 
meet more guys.

92
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,760
I can't though. Sorry.
-You can't, really?

93
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Hey, Noora?

94
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,760
I'll just ask you straight out.

95
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,700
Are you lesbian?

96
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,580
There's nothing wrong with being lesbian.
-No, no no no!

97
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,540
Vilde..

98
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,400
It's not weird that I think so! You don't have sex
and you don't want to talk about sex.

99
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,820
Just because I don't go around talking about
being keen on having sex..

100
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,320
.. doesn't mean I'm lesbian.

101
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,200
But what are you doing tomorrow?

102
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,600
It's Eskild's birthday.

103
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,380
Is he having a big party?
-No. A small celebration.

104
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,380
Not even a real celebration. Just..

105
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,440
Maybe we can meet up later
if you're going out?

106
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,840
Who was that?
-Her name is Jamila Bikarim.

107
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,300
Do you know each other?

108
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,640
She's engaged to my brother.
-Engaged?!

109
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,300
How old is she?
-She's 17.

110
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,380
Is it an arranged marriage?
-Huh?

111
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,340
Why would you get married when you're 17?

112
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,580
Because they want to have sex.

113
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,580
That is great.

114
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,760
Hello.

115
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,000
You're so pretty. Where are you going?
-I'm not pretty.

116
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,980
Okay..

117
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,080
I got a Facebook message
from Eva. Your friend.

118
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,860
She wrote: Happy birthday!

119
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
You didn't say that it wasn't your birthday?
-Huh? Not yet.

120
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,500
You can't say that. I had to say it was your 
birthday because I have a date.

121
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,200
You have a date? With who?
-An asshole called William.

122
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,680
William? As in Vilde's William?

123
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,920
He's not Vilde's William.
-Okay. Drama.

124
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,460
He really isn't Vilde's. And you wanna know something?
I'm doing this for Vilde's sake.

125
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,940
You're going on a date with William for Vilde's sake?
-Yep.

126
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,920
Okay, how is that related?

127
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,020
He told Vilde she wasn't good enough.

128
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,720
I have to go on a date with him, 
to get him to apologise to Vilde.

129
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,440
So you're not going on a date with William because
you want to, but to not hurt Vilde?

130
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,200
Yes!

131
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,460
She won't be hurt when she finds out you're
dating him behind her back?

132
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,080
<i>[Outside.]</i>

133
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,700
I'm not dating William. I'm going on one
date to get rid of him.

134
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,700
And anyway, she'll never find
out about it.

135
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,040
Because you won't tell Eva that it's
not your birthday, okay?

136
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,080
Hi.
-Hi.

137
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,920
Are you ready?

138
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,600
Ready for what?

139
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,500
Are you coming out, 
or are you just going to sit here?

140
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,280
Really cool to just sit there
and be pissed.

141
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,560
Cocoa?

142
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,840
Do you see that church down there?

143
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,840
My grandparents lived to the right of it.

144
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,080
In a really big and creepy house.

145
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,340
They had paintings on every wall possible.

146
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,600
My brother said the paintings came alive
and walked around at night.

147
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,520
There was just one room that I liked, the TV room.

148
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,420
Grandma called it the Blue Room.

149
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,020
Walls were blue.
Chairs were blue.

150
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,420
Pillows were blue.
Vases were blue.

151
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,040
You know the wall-to-wall carpet?
Where the carpet covers the entire floor?

152
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,220
Yes I know what wall-to-wall carpet is.

153
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,280
That was blue, too.

154
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,340
You're fucking with me, or what?

155
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,300
Hm? What?

156
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,040
Do you think I fall for that stuff?

157
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
What?

158
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,320
Everything here.

159
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:48,180
With the view, cocoa, carpet, and then you
come with that damn childhood story.

160
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Did you see it in some high school movie
and took note of it, or?

161
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,960
Wow..

162
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,340
You're really cold.

163
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,260
I mean it.

164
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,080
Okay..

165
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,600
I won't talk about my childhood
stories anymore.

166
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,880
What do you want to talk about?

167
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,980
I don't want to talk about anything.

168
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,080
I don't want to get to know you.

169
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,640
I don't even want to be here.

170
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,200
Why are you here then?

171
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,440
Because you pressured me.

172
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,700
I actually didn't pressure you.

173
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,900
How did I pressure you?

174
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,160
Because you sent Vilde messages and you called her,
just to get to me.

175
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
How is that pressuring someone?

176
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,680
Because she shouldn't think there's
something between us.

177
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,240
You're not just saying that?
That there's nothing between us.

178
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,000
You're twisting it. It's much more
complicated than that.

179
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,740
It's not that complicated.
You're lying to a friend and you blame me.

180
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,660
The point is that I'm not
interested in you.

181
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
And I never will be.

182
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,060
Why not?

183
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,060
You're controlling, 
and selfish.

184
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,900
And you use people to get your way.

185
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,300
You're cold,
and selfish..

186
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,100
You already said selfish.

187
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,760
And that time in the school yard when you
said Vilde wasn't good enough.

188
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,600
How can you say something like that?

189
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,620
I didn't want her to like me.

190
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,800
Couldn't you have said it in a better way?

191
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,280
Why should I have said that in a better way?
-To not hurt her.

192
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,420
Hurt her?

193
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,600
There's no point in not hurting her..

194
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:20,500
.. when I don't want her to like me. It's better to be clear
 so there won't be any doubt.

195
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,000
And destroy her self-image?

196
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,360
Do you really think that's how it works?
-What?

197
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,900
It's not possible to destroy her self-image with one comment.

198
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,700
In that case, I think her self-image had already
been destroyed before that.

199
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,120
But if you saw it from my side..
It was Vilde who came to me.

200
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,880
She was keen on me.
She wanted to sleep with me.

201
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,880
I didn't promise her anything.

202
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,480
However, you called me out in the 
middle of the school yard.

203
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,200
Does that make you good?
Does that make you fair?

204
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,180
Shouldn't you have warm cocao?
-No.

205
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,320
I like the cold.

206
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
Then it tastes like chocolate milk.

207
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,920
It's good that you apologised about telling Vilde
she's not good enough.

208
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,480
Is it?
-Hm-hm.

209
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,340
Okay.

210
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,280
I hope it was a smart plan,
because now she likes me again.

211
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,660
I don't like her.

212
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,340
So then we'll end up in the same place,
won't we?

213
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,660
Hello?

214
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,340
Where?

215
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,280
Where are you?

216
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,520
We have to go.

217
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,740
What's up?
-I'll drive you home.

218
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,660
But just so that we're clear,
so that there won't be any misunderstandings.

219
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,840
I've made up for it now.

220
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,520
I don't owe you anything.

221
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,180
No, you don't owe me anything.
