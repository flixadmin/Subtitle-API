Oh, my God. I missed you.

Oh, Mick Rory, you salty bloody bastard,

I can't believe you did it, mate.

You saved her. Well done.

Oh, Mick, I am so proud of you!

Oh, look who it is:
Alien Gary who kidnapped Sara.

No, I can explain. That's not...

818
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:19,945
He didn't kidnap me. He saved me.

819
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,512
Be honest: Rory flew up to the planet,

820
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:26,381
but it was really me
that saved you, right?

00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:28,283
Yeah, yeah, B. Let's go with that one.

All right. You guys,
what do you think, huh?

Let's go home.

- Home!

You know, tonight got me thinking.

What if I don't get my magic back?

- Okay.
- Then I still got you.

You do, but I know you're gonna try.

- Those two sure got serious.

when we get back to the ship.

at the same time.

Yes, but tonight
I'm not leaving you behind.

839
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:19,571
And tonight, I want to
propose to my girlfriend.
