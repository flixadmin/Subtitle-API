1
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:32,692

2
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,182
Master Kaecilius.

3
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:28,915
This ritual will only bring grief to you.

4
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,408
Hypocrite!

5
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,490
The last challenge, Billy.

6
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:10,434
- Come on, Billy, do not joke. - No, Doctor.

7
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,609
"Feels So Good" Lagu
Chuck Mangione tahun 1977.

8
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:18,626
- Geez Billy, do mempersulitnya. - Famous song in 1978.

9
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:21,165
No, Billy "Feels So Good" reached the top of the charts in 1978,

10
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:24,900
This album was released in December 1977.

11
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:27,729
- No, according to Wikipedia it ... - Check again.

12
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,779
- It's not important information. - Not important?

13
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:34,047
The man became famous for reaching the top of the charts with flugelhornnya.

14
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:36,376
- Yeah right, Billy? - In 1977.

15
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,199
Geez. You bitch.

16
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,959
Really good, right?

17
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,089
Let me deal with this, Stephen. Your job is done. Go we'll take care of it.

18
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:51,105
- What is wrong? - His condition is still stable.

19
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:55,331
It was a miracle he was still alive. He was still breathing when the brain is not functioning.

20
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:57,332
He could have suffered respiratory failure because of this.

21
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,417
I think I found the problem Dr. Palmer.

22
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:02,887
- You left a bullet in his head. - Thank you. In the medulla oblongata.

23
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:06,293
I need a specialist. Nick diagnosed that the brain is already dead.

24
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,196
- Because I think there's something wrong here. - Come on, quickly.

25
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:14,310
- Dr. Vest? What are you doing? - Taking her organs, her donor organ.

26
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:14,532
Wait a minute.

27
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:17,901
- I do not agree with it. - I do not need your opinion. His brain is dead.

28
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:20,912
It's too early. Must prepare cranial surgical procedures.

29
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,600
- I will not let dissect dead. - Look?

30
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:26,215
- Ammunition? - Right, bullet.

31
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,261
The pressure is getting stronger with the presence of lead and antimony.

32
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,399
Toxic metals. And that leads directly into the brain fluid.

33
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:35,099
- It makes no functioning central nervous. - We have to go.

34
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:38,149
He's not dead, he's dying. Do mencuru organ.

35
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,912
- I can help. - No. Dr. Palmer will help me.

36
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:01,091
thanks.

37
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,463
- Visualization now. - We have no time for it.

38
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,099
- You can not do it manually. - Sure I can.

39
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,413
Now is not the time for jokes.

40
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:19,313
And what do you think that says he died 10 minutes ago?

41
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,830
Kranialnya not been damaged nerves.

42
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:57,105
Dr. Vest, get rid tangamu hours.

43
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,910
You do not need to embarrass him in front of everyone.

44
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,985
He can not even save patient.

45
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:48,430
- Sometimes I can not help it. - Nick was a good doctor.

46
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:51,299
- But you came to me. - Yes, I need another opinion.

47
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,854
You've got it. All you need is a competent opinion.

48
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,322
That's why I rely neurosurgeon like.

49
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:59,030
- You can make a lot of changes. - I can work at home jagalmu.

50
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:00,825
I just connect the severed spinal fluid,

51
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:03,591
and then stimulates neurons in the central nervous system.

52
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:06,284
My job is to save thousands of people in the years to come.

53
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:09,307
In the ER, we saved a drunk idiot with a gun.

54
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:12,178
Yes you're right. We saved a lot of lives.

55
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,960
There was no praise, no interview on CNN.

56
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,486
Looks like I have to meet with Nick.

57
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:20,308
- Wait a minute. You're not ...? - What?

58
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,875
Sleep together? Sorry, I cringe to think about it.

59
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,749
Of course not. I have...

60
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,842
... Rules are very strict with my colleagues.

61
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:29,711
- Is it true? - I call it "Strange rules".

62
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:32,391
I'm happy if there is something which bears my name.

63
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,274
I who discovered the method laminectomy.

64
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,996
And no one wants to call it 'Strange Method'.

65
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:42,259
- We are discovering this method, - I am very flattered to hear that your rules.

66
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:48,576
I will attend the speech tonight with a group of neuroscientists. Come with me.

67
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:52,026
There was another speech again? It's romantic.

68
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,266
I hope you want to come to events like that with me.

69
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,629
- That is fun. -No! Exciting think.

70
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,551
It's not about us, but dirmu.

71
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:03,306
- I do not want that. - Yes. Stephen. Everything about you.

72
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:08,497
Maybe we could combine. 'Strange-Palmer Method'.

73
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:10,732
Palmer-Strange.

74
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,802
Billy, there is news?

75
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:03,509
There was an air force colonel 35 years old,

76
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:04,726
with lung damage, fortunately he uses protective vests.

77
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,925
Graph lungs pressure is above average.

78
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:10,693
Yes, I can help, as well as others.

79
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,528
Find something fits with my time.

80
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,822
There is a 68-year-old woman with a serious brain tumor.

81
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,918
You want to ruin the record sempurnamu? Better not.

82
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:22,849
What about women 22 years to install electronic implant in his brain ...

83
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:25,884
... To control schizophrenia because the light?

84
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:27,864
That is interesting.

85
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,098
Can you send ... Good.

86
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:36,043
Hello.

87
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:38,938
It is okay. Everything will be alright.

88
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,199
What are they doing?

89
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,036
They mengangkutmu by helicopter. It takes time to find you in the car.

90
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,989
Fatal moment which makes almost suffered nerve damage in the car.

91
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,424
What are they doing?

92
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,406
11 steel needles stuck in your bones.

93
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,704
Ligamenmu damaged.

94
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:20,168
Serious damage to the nerves in your hands.

95
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:22,876
We dissect it for 11 hours.

96
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,610
Look at this.

97
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:29,570
Nobody can do it well.

98
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,848
I could do it better.

99
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:09,062
Yes. Allow time for the healing of your body.

100
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:12,845
You're crushing me.

101
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:15,849
How long the recovery Dr. Strange?

102
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,766
Network to recover faster. Probably faster.

103
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:22,523
Prepare the radial artery surgical procedures.

104
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:25,225
Impossible.

105
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:28,234
The experiment was costly, or may be impossible.

106
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,574
All I need is a possibility.

107
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:56,196
Lift.

108
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,314
Lift.

109
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,015
Show your strength.

110
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,563
- It's useless. - It was not in vain. You can do it.

111
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,479
Answer the question, during a lecture ...

112
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:18,294
... Have you ever met anyone who suffered fatal nerve damage can do this ...

113
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,029
- And healed? - Ever. There was one person.

114
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,630
The accident at the factory, spinal cord is damaged, paralyzed, his legs did not work.

115
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:28,543
His shoulders hurt because pushing a wheelchair.

116
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:31,871
It happens three times a week. One day she stopped coming.

117
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,606
I thought he died.

118
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,964
A few years later, he passed me in the street.

119
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,531
- He walks? - Yes, he's walking.

120
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:41,201
Nonsense. Give me his file.

121
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,266
Until I get the archives ...

122
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,705
... You have to prove kearoganmu first.

123
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,839
Can?

124
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:06,444
I've been reviewing all of your research, I read all the documents ...

125
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,440
... You sent, but it never works.

126
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:12,401
I do not know if you realize just how serious the damage was.

127
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:14,968
- Then I ...
 - At least I've tried.

128
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,009
I understand. That's the problem.

129
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,724
- What you do is impossible, Stephen. - No kidding.

130
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:23,656
- I had to keep my reputation. 
- Wait a minute.

131
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,292
- I can not help. - No, wait!

132
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:34,043
There are!

133
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,523
You do not succeed.

134
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,415
It's futile.

135
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:49,235
There is a new procedure in Tokyo. With increased donor cell ...

136
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:53,605
... And then they collect and print the cells in 3D. If I get a loan ...

137
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:54,663
Stephen...

138
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:55,891
- Loans 200,000 ... - Stephen.

139
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,803
You always spend whatever to make you live,

140
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,580
But now you're willing to spend money that even you do not have.

141
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:03,302
Maybe it's time you stopped to think about it.

142
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:06,400
Now is not the time to stop,

143
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:09,537
You see? I did not improve!

144
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:13,108
But this is not about treatment. It is obsessed name.

145
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:15,628
There are some things that can not be repaired.

146
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:18,095
- Life without a job ... - You're still alive.

147
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,300
This is not the end. Still there are other things that can make your life meaningful.

148
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,060
Like what? You?

149
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,295
It will do you regret later.

150
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,368
Up to you.

151
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,821
Well, I never want to see keegoisanmu own.

152
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,702
- It's too hard for you, right? - Yes, right.

153
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,905
My heart breaks if you like this.

154
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,559
- Do not feel sorry for me. - I do not pity you.

155
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:44,689
Oh, yes? Why are you here?

156
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:47,471
Brought cheese and wine as if we would go on a picnic?

157
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,975
We're not friends, Christine. We are also not lovers.

158
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,122
You like a sad story, is not it? What do you want me to tell?

159
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:56,612
"Stephen Strange poor with social burden. Eventually I needed it."

160
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:59,229
"Got another burden on the improvement of personality."

161
00:17:59,264 --> 00:18:02,942
"You're trying to fix it and get up again with a happy heart."

162
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:06,284
You're so concerned about that, right ?!

163
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:12,567
Good-bye, Stephen.

164
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,858
THIS MEAN.

165
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,812
Pangborn J, therapy Time: 09/12/14. Metropolitan Hospital.

166
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:09,816
Let's break! Where is the competition?

167
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,346
Do not talk too much.

168
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:18,227
Jonathan Pangborn, spinal cord damage.

169
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:22,219
- Who are you? - Paralyzed from the chest down.

170
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:23,961
The second arm partially paralyzed.

171
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,981
- I do not know you. - I'm Stephen Strange.

172
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:28,405
I neurosurgeons, once.

173
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:31,615
Of course I know you.

174
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:35,972
I've come to your office, you refused menanganiku.

175
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,788
I will never forget your assistant.

176
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:42,911
- You're paralyzed patients. - You do not believe in miracles, right?

177
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:47,856
Kesembuhanmu impossible.

178
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,021
I also was looking for a way that I can recover.

179
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,460
Pangborn, you want to play or not?

180
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,420
Good.

181
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,899
I gave up my body.

182
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,174
The only thing that I thought was mengakhirnya.

183
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:18,096
So I follow the rules.

184
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,300
I met the holy women.

185
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:23,531
The stranger who took me to the top of the mountain to meet the saints.

186
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,538
And finally, I found my teacher.

187
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:31,392
That lifts the mind and soul deeper.

188
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:33,512
- And somehow ...

189
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,090
- You're cured? - Yes.

190
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:39,749
There is no secret about that I learned,

191
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,686
But I do not know what power can make me accept them.

192
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:44,703
I decided to accept keajaibanku and return.

193
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:52,384
The place you are looking for so-called room-Taj.

194
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,014
- But it is expensive. - How many?

195
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,672
I do not mean money.

196
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,367
Good luck.

197
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:04,173
Give me the ball!

198
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,549
KATHMANDU, NEPAL

199
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:27,528
Excuse me. Rooms Taj?

200
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:30,133
Do you know where the room-Taj?

201
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:45,374
Treatment of the Himalayas! Find peace! Look who you are!

202
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:55,692
Rooms Taj?

203
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,440
Room-Taj

204
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:28,577
OK.

205
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:34,752
- I have no money. - Clock hands.

206
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:39,188
- No. Do not. I just got this. - Watch your hands.

207
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:44,137
Good.

208
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:26,207
You're looking for a room-Taj?

209
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:59,706
Are you serious? We come to the right place?

210
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:03,925
It seems a little more like Room-Taji?

211
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:07,905
I was once like you.

212
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:12,587
I used to be no respect.

213
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,549
I can give some advice?

214
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,227
Forget all that you have in mind.

215
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:24,615
Good.

216
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,833
This temple chaired a teacher, namely The Ancient One.

217
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:39,667
The Ancient One? Who's real name?

218
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:45,078
Good. Forget all I think about. Sorry.

219
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:58,127
Thank you...

220
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:01,996
I'm just not used to it.

221
00:25:03,189 --> 00:25:04,889
Thank you...

222
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,715
Hello.

223
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:08,416
thanks.

224
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:10,218
I thank you.

225
00:25:10,797 --> 00:25:16,565
-Thank You, Ancient One for having permitted me. - You are welcome.

226
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,403
- Ancient One. - Thank you, Master Mordo.

227
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Thank you, Master Hamir.

228
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,014
Tn. Strange.

229
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:30,640
- Doctors, actually. - Apparently not so.

230
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,655
That's why you come here? You've been through a lot of surgery.

231
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,362
- Seven-time operation, right? - Yes.

232
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:40,432
- The tea was delicious. - Yes.

233
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:48,830
What do you heal a man named Pangborn? Patients paralyzed?

234
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:51,679
- It seems so. - You make it run again?

235
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:53,684
Ya.

236
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:57,578
How can you repair the spinal cord between steps C7 and C8?

237
00:25:57,614 --> 00:26:00,443
I had to do. He can not walk.

238
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,260
I am sure I can.

239
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,668
Jangan bilingual itu psychosomatic?

240
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:08,751
When you reconnect the nerve to break up, how do you connect it to the body?

241
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:14,040
- With a cell. - Cells in shape to form specific tissues are damaged.

242
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:14,693
Correct.

243
00:26:14,812 --> 00:26:17,803
What if your body can ...

244
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:21,241
... Fix itself in a different way?

245
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:24,375
You mean cell regeneration?

246
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,987
It was the most innovative medical technology.

247
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:30,949
That's what you're doing here? Because there is no medical procedure?

248
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,591
Can you explain this eksperimentalmu treatment?

249
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,554
Calm down.

250
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:41,602
You've found a way to regenerate nerve cells themselves?

251
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:43,337
No, Mr. Strange.

252
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,598
I know how to reorient the spirit so that the body could be better.

253
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:53,491
- Spirit in the body? - Yes.

254
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:59,369
OK. How to do it? Where do we start?

255
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:10,423
- You do not like the map? - That is good. I've never seen.

256
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:13,232
In the souvenir shops.

257
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:15,998
How about this one?

258
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:18,144
- Acupuncture, good. - Is it true?

259
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:24,485
- How about this one? - It was like there. I can not believe.

260
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,411
Each sheet of the map that are interesting things that can not be seen as a whole person.

261
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:32,319
I spent all my money to come here,

262
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:35,703
And you tell me about healing through faith?

263
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,164
You're someone who sees the world only through the keyhole.

264
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,323
You spend your whole life just to extend the keyhole,

265
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:46,147
to see everything, to know everything. If you know a lock could be in view,

266
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:49,499
in ways that were impossible to think, then you rejected.

267
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:55,631
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales of fantasy, energy or power of faith.

268
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:58,407
There are no matters relating to the spirit!

269
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:01,650
We are made of matter and nothing more.

270
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:06,357
No more than one point in the universe.

271
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:09,978
- You have to see it for yourself. - You think I would believe it?

272
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:14,520
But not so. Because I can read what people like you!

273
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:35,958
- What did you just do? - I encourage your spirit out of your body.

274
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:38,934
Is that some kind of EA? Psilocybin? LSD?

275
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,026
It's just tea ...

276
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,760
... With a little honey.

277
00:28:42,797 --> 00:28:46,354
- What happened? - At that time, you get into the astral dimension.

278
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:50,510
- What? - The time when the spirit separates from the body.

279
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:55,032
- Why are you doing this to me? - To show you everything that is not you know.

280
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:57,832
Open your eyes.

281
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:06,641
Shit! No!

282
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:09,843
No, no! What happened?

283
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:12,844
It's not real!

284
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:25,637
Rapid heartbeat can be dangerous.

285
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,721
You do not think anything.

286
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:36,992
Do you know how this world works?

287
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,774
Do you think the universe is nothing more than substance?

288
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:47,282
What is real?

289
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:52,382
The mystery of what is hidden beyond the senses?

290
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:59,483
On the ground of being, mind and matter meet.

291
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,965
Which eventually form the reality.

292
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,689
This universe is just one of a number of instruments.

293
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:24,056
World without end.

294
00:30:25,228 --> 00:30:27,391
There are generous and give life.

295
00:30:30,383 --> 00:30:33,450
The other, full of hate and hunger.

296
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:43,399
There is a dark place where there is a lying, greedy ...

297
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,601
I am waiting.

298
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:59,510
Who are you in this vast universe, Tn. Strange?

299
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:22,430
Have you ever seen it in a souvenir shop?

300
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,701
Teach me.

301
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,520
No.

302
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:42,124
No!

303
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,582
No, no, no!

304
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:50,459
No! Open the door! Please!

305
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:55,506
Thank you, Master.

306
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:02,316
Am I wrong because out?

307
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:05,110
After five hours, he was still at the front door.

308
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,282
He's got the power.

309
00:32:08,283 --> 00:32:12,922
Stubborn, arrogant, ambitious. I've never met anyone like that before.

310
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,626
Kaecilius remind you, right?

311
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:18,606
I do not want to teach students like that again,

312
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:20,662
then drove into the darkness.

313
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:27,105
You do not lose me. I want the power to defeat the enemy.

314
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,836
You gave me the strength to defeat evil.

315
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:34,045
I live according to the laws of nature.

316
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,296
We never get rid of the demons, Mordo.

317
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,052
We learn how to survive on their face.

318
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:44,325
Kaecilius still have books in stole.

319
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:48,139
If he can learn it, it could be the undoing of us all.

320
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:51,353
Or maybe in the future.

321
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,056
Perhaps the Taj rooms need people like Strange.

322
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,789
Do not let me out.

323
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,679

327
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,220
Meditate ...

328
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:30,983
... If you can.

329
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:32,989
The Ancient One told me to convey to you.

330
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,113
What is this? A mantra?

Password wi-fi.

332
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:49,491
We are not a violent man.

Spirit of yore, usually call this spell.

336
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,515
But if you think this word inaudible modern ...

337
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,914
... You could call it a "program".

338
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:39,168
A piece of code that make up reality.

339
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:42,427
We control the energy,

340
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,605

341
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:49,885
to make the dimension ...

342
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:53,919

and also weapons,

344
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:59,241
to create a miracle.

345
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:15,954
But I can not even do that because of my finger,

346
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,258
hands will just be like waving in the air.

347
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,612
How do I do like you?

348
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:25,165
How can you connect the human nervous ...

349
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,165

350
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,376
By learning and practicing well over the years.

The private collection The Ancient One.

00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,981
It was forbidden?

374
00:36:58,031 --> 00:37:01,536
Seeking knowledge is not banned in-room Taj. It was just for practice.

375
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:08,060
These books have a very advanced knowledge to those who are interested in him.

376
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,953
There are pages torn here.

then cut off his head.

382
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,096
Now I will keep these books.

383
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:48,232
So if there is an attempt to steal it again, I would know.

384
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:51,912
And he will die before leaving this place.

385
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,446
What happens if I am late to return it?

386
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:01,045
What are the penalties? Mutilation, perhaps?

387
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,945
Many thought I was funny.

388
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,012

I'll keep it, my life at stake.

391
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:51,366
Now we have the power to destroy those who betrayed us.

392
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:55,946
Those who control the world.

393
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,992
Master of the Mystic Arts has a ring,

394

Get a clear picture, quick and easy ...

It will make way for you.

402
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:28,929
Stop.

403
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,132
Can I have a word with Mr. Strange?

404
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:33,867
Certain.

405
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,120
- My hands. - It's not about your hands.

406
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:41,965
How can this not because my hand?

407
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:43,707
Master Hamir.

408
00:40:57,543 --> 00:40:59,243
Thank you, Master Hamir.

409
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,449
You must not only follow the current course.

410
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:07,873
You must relinquish control of your courage, and use its power for you.

411
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:11,318
Control by letting go of control? It did not make sense.

412
00:41:11,353 --> 00:41:14,501
- Nonsense. - Not everything should be reasonable.

413
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,664
Intelligence has seized life,

414
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,399
otherwise it will mterus mengasaimu.

415
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,218
Give it up, Stephen.

416
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:23,504
Soothe your ego ...

417
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,830
And strength will appear.

418
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:28,439
Follow me.

419
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:35,709
- Where is this? - Everest.

420
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,722
- So beautiful. - Yes, you're right, this is beautiful. , Icy, but great.

421
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:41,826
Iceberg frozen.

422
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,462
At this temperature, humans can only survive 30 minutes ...

423
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:51,639
- ... Before finally experiencing organ failure. - Correct.

424
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:55,039
But you may experience a shock in the first two minutes.

425
00:41:55,755 --> 00:41:58,114
- What? - Give it up Stephen.

426
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:58,631
No!

427
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:12,044
- How novice us? - See you later.

428
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,357
A few seconds from now.

429
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,320
No, do not do it again.

430
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,907
Maybe I should ...

431
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:40,661
- Stephen. - Wong.

432
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:43,736
- What do you want, Strange? - Books about astral projection.

433
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:47,289
- You're not ready for it. - Trust me, Beyonce.

434
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:54,329
Come on. You know him. He is a famous artist.

435
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,971
Do you ever laugh?

436
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:00,601
Come on, give her book.

437
00:44:01,256 --> 00:44:02,956
No.

438
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:34,155
Formerly, in this room, you're begging me to teach.

439
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:38,377
Now I'm going to ask you in every time of learning so that you can learn on their own.

440
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:41,333
I n this room, you told me to open my eyes.

441
00:44:41,368 --> 00:44:44,147
Just stupid of me according to the rules unreasonable.

442
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:47,001
As regulations in the library?

443
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:51,043
- Wong betrayed? - Your ability to expand rapidly.

444
00:44:51,446 --> 00:44:54,428
You need a safe place to practice matranya.

445
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:15,102
You are now in a mirror dimension.

446
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:17,143
You're there but unseen.

447
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:20,353
The real world does not affect anything that happens here.

448
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:24,621
Use dimensional mirror for practice, reflection,

449
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,791
Sometimes also to neutralize the threat.

450
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,703
You do not want to be stuck here without sling-ring.

451
00:45:30,738 --> 00:45:33,702
Wait. What do you mean "threat"?

452
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:45,335
Learn about the infinite nature ...

453
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:47,637
... Also includes studying the endless dangers.

454
00:45:47,672 --> 00:45:52,087
If I tell you all, and you're not ready, you're going out of here with fear.

455
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,481
What do you know about it?

456
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:05,038
No one knows exactly what.

457
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:09,102
I know is he was never told of his past.

458
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,865
You follow it even if you do not know who he is?

459
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:13,380
I know him so fast, and I do not think them.

460
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:15,484
Cruel, but good.

461
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:18,512
Because of him, I could be like this.

462
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:22,258
Believe in your teacher.

463
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:25,909
- Do not cheat. - As Kaecilius?

464
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:26,425
Correct.

465
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:33,324
You know him.

466
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:37,267
When she came to us, she lost everything she loved.

467
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:39,015
He was grieving, poor man.

468
00:46:39,016 --> 00:46:41,311
Looking for answers about Mystic Arts.

469
00:46:41,346 --> 00:46:44,806
He's smart schoolgirl, her proud, stubborn.

470
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:47,491
He doubted the Ancient One, and we reject teachings.

471
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:56,426
He left the room-Taj.

472
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:59,266
Supporters follow like sheep.

473
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:01,511
Seduced by false doctrines.

474
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:04,609
- He stole the forbidden ritual, right? - Yes.

475
00:47:05,248 --> 00:47:06,948
What are the do?

476
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,440
There is no longer a question.

477
00:47:11,352 --> 00:47:13,771
- Meaning? - That is the question.

478
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:17,144
It is a relic.

479
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:20,687
Some miracle is too strong to be avoided, you must specify the object.

480
00:47:21,963 --> 00:47:24,253
Sometimes it can absorb the energy that we do not expect.

481
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,096
This is a stick ...

482
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,274
... The Living Tribunal.

483
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:34,296
There are many relics.

484
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,012
Use it as easy as ...

485
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:37,791
... Like a foot.

486
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:41,927
It's easy to say, right? When can I get it?

487
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:44,440
- When you're ready. - I'll definitely be ready.

488
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:47,059
You'll be ready when you decide you're ready.

489
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:49,546
Now,

490
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,241
prepare your weapons.

491
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:54,767
Good.

492
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:04,602
Opponent! Opponent as your life was at stake!

493
00:48:10,438 --> 00:48:12,941
Because one day it could have been me.

494
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:36,397
Christine...

495
00:48:40,474 --> 00:48:45,113
This time I wrote an email only to ...

496
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:25,391
Wong?

497
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:38,861
OK.

498
00:49:38,862 --> 00:49:41,879
First, open your eyes Agamotto.

499
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,019
Good.

500
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:29,133
OK.

501
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:07,734
Dormammu.

502
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:10,903
The dimension of darkness.

503
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:13,238
Everlasting life?

504
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:20,938
Stop!

505
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:26,239
Prohibited from further possibilities that will happen.

506
00:51:26,274 --> 00:51:28,585
I'm practicing what is written in this book.

507
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,919
The contents of the book jeopardize those who perform the ritual.

508
00:51:31,954 --> 00:51:33,821
I have no idea. I have not got to that part.

509
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:36,422
This manipulation will screw up his time.

510
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:38,867
Unstable if it enters another dimension.

511
00:51:38,902 --> 00:51:41,744
That could widen the circle of time!

512
00:51:41,793 --> 00:51:45,062
Do you want to live like this together forever ...

513
00:51:45,097 --> 00:51:46,797
... Or never existed at all?

514
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:49,858
You must give a warning about matranya.

515
00:51:49,928 --> 00:51:51,835
Curiosity could get you killed.

516
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,425
You can not manipulate the dimensions of space and time,

517
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,555
you're bothering her.

518
00:51:56,885 --> 00:52:00,331
Do not change the laws of nature. We defend it.

519
00:52:00,344 --> 00:52:02,044
How did you do?

520
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:06,172
How can you learn the spell? While you do not understand?

521
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,318
I had an image memory I get when studying medicine.

522
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:11,376
- At the same time ... - You just did.

523
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:15,374
Mystic Arts need a good memory. You were born to rule Mystic Art.

524
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,799
- My hands are still shaking. - For now it's like that.

525
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:21,366
- Not always. - We are not prophets.

526
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:23,580
When are you going to stop covering who we are?

527
00:52:28,985 --> 00:52:32,903
Heroes like the Avengers to protect the world from danger,

528
00:52:33,312 --> 00:52:36,213
We protect it from mystical threats.

529
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:41,406
The Ancient One is the legend of the Sorcerer Supreme,

530
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:45,013
returning after thousands of years with his father's ability to Mystic Arts,

531
00:52:45,048 --> 00:52:46,748
Mighty Agamotto.

532
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:51,603
The same people who make the books you borrow recklessly.

533
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,967
Agamotto built three temples in the place of his power,

534
00:52:56,002 --> 00:52:58,555
in a place where they build large cities today.

535
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,646
The door leading to the temple in Hong Kong.

536
00:53:02,005 --> 00:53:03,705
The door leading to the temple in New York.

537
00:53:04,508 --> 00:53:06,208
That one was headed to a temple in London.

538
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,957
Together temples that generate a protective shield around the globe.

539
00:53:11,882 --> 00:53:15,346
The temple was to protect the world, and the Sorcerer ...

540
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:18,760
- ... To protect the temple. - Of what?

541
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,858
Another dimension of creatures that threaten our universe.

542
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:24,401
As Dormammu?

543
00:53:25,186 --> 00:53:26,886
From the name you know that name?

544
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:30,404
I read it in a book Cagliostro, why?

545
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:38,405
Dormammu dominate the dark dimension,

546
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:41,009
namely in the dimension of time.

547
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:45,452
He cosmic conqueror and destroyer of the world.

548
00:53:45,879 --> 00:53:49,258
He was never satisfied ruin the world,

549
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:51,730
Looking every crack in the universe,

550
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:54,625
in order to bring the universe leading to the dimension of darkness.

551
00:53:55,738 --> 00:53:58,062
The most in want it from us ...

552
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:01,390
Weather stolen Kaecilius.

553
00:54:02,036 --> 00:54:05,653
The ritual is the link Dormammu and can also draw strength from the dimension of darkness.

554
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,657
Good. Good.

555
00:54:13,535 --> 00:54:17,663
I quit. I'm here to heal my hand.

556
00:54:18,406 --> 00:54:22,088
Not to fight in the war of the spirits.

557
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:26,149
London.

558
00:54:29,437 --> 00:54:31,144
Kaecilius!

559
00:54:31,145 --> 00:54:32,845
No!

560
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:40,039
Wong? Mordo?

561
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:18,498
No. 177A
Jl. Bleecker

562
00:55:31,086 --> 00:55:32,786
Hello?

563
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:03,351
Hello?

564
00:56:41,394 --> 00:56:44,755
Daniel, I know what's in doing the master in this temple.

565
00:56:46,062 --> 00:56:47,762
You know what I mean?

566
00:56:48,598 --> 00:56:50,298
You will die if to protect him.

567
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,223
Stop!

568
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:21,154
How long have you been in the Chamber-Taj, sir ...

569
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,138
...doctor??

570
00:57:23,991 --> 00:57:27,193
- The doctor? - I'm Strange.

571
00:57:28,605 --> 00:57:31,497
Maybe. Who cares.

572
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,112
You do not know how to use it, right?

573
01:01:43,214 --> 01:01:44,914
What?

574
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:52,304
Oh stop it. I told you to stop.

575
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:55,787
- You can not stop this, sir doctor. - I do not even know what "it".

576
01:01:56,423 --> 01:01:59,481
This is the end and a new beginning.

577
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:02,135
Many are trying to be the only one.

578
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,942
If you do not stop saying things that make sense,

579
01:02:05,977 --> 01:02:08,425
- Then I'll restore it. - Tell me, sir doctor ...

580
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,645
Well, my name is dr. Stephen Strange.

581
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,158
- You're a doctor? - Yes.

582
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:14,710
Scientists?

583
01:02:15,517 --> 01:02:20,372
You understand the laws of nature. Everything will age. Everything will die.

584
01:02:20,595 --> 01:02:24,110
In the end, our sun would be extinguished universe we froze and disappeared ...

585
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,787
... Into a dimension of darkness.

586
01:02:27,183 --> 01:02:28,895
It was time.

587
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:32,356
- Enough. I'll restore it. - The world does not have to be destroyed, Doctor.

588
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:35,324
We can still go on as before ...

589
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,059
... As part of each other.

590
01:02:37,306 --> 01:02:39,006
Become more beautiful.

591
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,689
We can all live forever.

592
01:02:42,003 --> 01:02:43,703
Is it true?

593
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,758
What will you get from the new dimension?

594
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:53,182
Just like you. Like everyone, life. Eternal life.

595
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:56,293
Each person always think what is right and wrong.

596
01:02:56,328 --> 01:02:59,701
If you consider it too long, time will kill them all.

597
01:02:59,702 --> 01:03:01,600
What people did you kill?

598
01:03:01,635 --> 01:03:05,734
Only a small portion, which is not so in this universe perdulikan.

599
01:03:07,698 --> 01:03:09,398
Yes. I understand.

600
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:12,225
Do you understand what we do.

601
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:16,931
The world is not supposed to be like this. Humans lose him,

602
01:03:17,388 --> 01:03:19,825
Our world is just about time, because the time of enslaving us.

603
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,998
That is an insult.

604
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,482
Death is an insult.

605
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:27,228
While ...

606
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:29,986
... Do not try to control the world.

607
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:32,909
We must save it, and handed it to Dormammu,

608
01:03:32,944 --> 01:03:35,494
which is the ultimate goal of evolution

609
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:37,956
The reason this whole civilization.

610
01:03:39,021 --> 01:03:41,738
Sorcerer Supreme who maintain this civilization.

611
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:47,411
What brings you to go to the Taj rooms, doctor? Enlightenment?

612
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:49,821
Power?

613
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:53,433
You've come to cure.

614
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:58,103
Room-Taj is a place to collect a lot of problems.

615
01:03:58,108 --> 01:03:59,936
All come with a promise of healing,

616
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:02,716
But instead, the ancient book of magic gives us strength.

617
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,400
Real magic for yourself.

618
01:04:06,435 --> 01:04:09,806
You're not curious about how you handle it this time?

619
01:04:15,455 --> 01:04:17,421
I saw the ritual in the Book of Cagliostro.

620
01:04:17,456 --> 01:04:20,082
So, you already know.

621
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:25,226
Ritual it gave me the strength to fight against the Ancient One, and destroyed the temple,

622
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,741
and to bring into the dimension of darkness.

623
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:31,652
On appeal The Ancient One, Dormammu promising better.

624
01:04:32,856 --> 01:04:34,556
Eternal life.

625
01:04:35,198 --> 01:04:38,522
He is not the destroyer of the world, Doctor. He is the savior of the world.

626
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,576
No kidding. Look at your face.

627
01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:46,134
Dormammu make you a killer.

628
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:48,804
No matter how his government?

629
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,353
You think that's funny?

630
01:04:52,628 --> 01:04:54,328
No, not that.

631
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:57,015
The funny thing is that you lose the sling ringmu.

632
01:06:05,145 --> 01:06:07,641
- Sir, can I help you? - Dr. Palmer, where is he?

633
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,333
- Oh my god. We have ... - Where is he?

634
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:09,972
Nurse!

635
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:12,505
Christine!

636
01:06:14,102 --> 01:06:18,617
- Stephen? Gosh. - Take me to the operating room. Just you.

637
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:19,139
Wait.

638
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,890
Now! I have no time.

639
01:06:21,242 --> 01:06:24,746
- What happened? - Luka heart. Heart damage.

640
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,825
What are you wearing this?

641
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:38,787
- Part of the chest is fine. - No, prepare a blood bag.

642
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:43,164
No, no. Stephen?

643
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:46,768
Oh, my God.

644
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:13,444
Pick up a little more.

645
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:16,710
Please be careful with the needle.

646
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:20,242
Stephen?

647
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,007
Nothing...

648
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:25,013
- ... What I see this? - Body astralku.

649
01:07:26,497 --> 01:07:29,353
- Are you dead? - No, Christine, but I'm dying.

650
01:07:31,696 --> 01:07:33,826
Good. Good.

651
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:38,548
Yes. OK. Good.

652
01:07:47,655 --> 01:07:49,375
I have never seen such wounds.

653
01:07:49,902 --> 01:07:51,602
What stab you?

654
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:53,743
I have no idea.

655
01:08:12,814 --> 01:08:15,516
- Now I have to disappear. - What?

656
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,758
Save me.

657
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:22,723
Good. Good.

658
01:08:47,385 --> 01:08:49,085
Shit.

659
01:09:19,374 --> 01:09:21,074
Filling voltage of 200 joules.

660
01:09:32,136 --> 01:09:33,836
Stephen, come on.

661
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,174
- Implanted heart again. - Stop doing that.

662
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,054
Raise the voltage and do it again.

663
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:43,400
- No, your heart beat! - Just do it!

664
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,260
Gosh.

665
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,929
Filling voltage 360 ​​joules.

666
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:16,910
Gosh!

667
01:10:17,011 --> 01:10:18,781
- You are okay? - Yes.

668
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:21,941
Good.

669
01:10:27,213 --> 01:10:30,859
After all, you show up here like this,

670
01:10:32,743 --> 01:10:36,297
- I recognize your body. - Yes I know.

671
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,710
By the way, I miss you.

672
01:10:40,406 --> 01:10:42,856
I sent you an e-mail, but you never responded.

673
01:10:42,891 --> 01:10:44,591
Why should I respond?

674
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,473
Christine, I'm so sorry.

675
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:50,448
For all. You are right.

676
01:10:50,483 --> 01:10:54,303
I was a jerk treat you like that.

677
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:58,532
- You deserve to be treated much better ... - Enough. You're still in shock.

678
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:02,021
What happened?

679
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:04,650
You anywhere?

680
01:11:04,915 --> 01:11:08,100
Well ... After baratku style treatment failed,

681
01:11:08,135 --> 01:11:11,050
I went to the east and ends in Kathmandu.

682
01:11:11,085 --> 01:11:13,560
- Kathmandu? - Yes.

683
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:18,653
- It's a song of Bob Seger? - Released in 1975 before the song Beautiful Loser.

684
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:21,495
I went to a place called room-Taj and I ...

685
01:11:22,218 --> 01:11:25,866
... Met someone named The Ancient One.

686
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:30,352
- You join their sect. - No. Not really. No. I mean ...

687
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:33,461
They taught me to learn the strengths you never would have thought.

688
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:35,811
- Yes. It sounds like a sect. - This is not a sect.

689
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:39,119
- Well, especially if not a cult. - Oh no.

690
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,129
Stop, Stephen. What are you doing?

691
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,864
I was too late to help them.

692
01:11:47,984 --> 01:11:49,784
- This is crazy. - Yes.

693
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:51,825
Do you want to go?

694
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:53,934
Will you tell the truth?

695
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:58,073
There is a force that has submitted itself to a another force,

696
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,741
it could be in violation of the laws of physics, and trying to kill me.

697
01:12:00,746 --> 01:12:02,708
But I am chained in Greenwich Village,

698
01:12:02,713 --> 01:12:05,502
And the quickest way to get back there is through a dimensional portal

699
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:08,961
- I'm going to use that room. - Good. Do not tell me. OK.

700
01:12:19,445 --> 01:12:21,428
I really should go.

701
01:12:22,095 --> 01:12:23,795
Ya.

702
01:13:08,711 --> 01:13:10,411
Strange!

703
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:16,199
- You are okay? - But, but yes, I'm fine.

704
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:18,730
Cloak of levitation.

705
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,450
Be yours.

706
01:13:21,886 --> 01:13:23,586
No matter the size.

707
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:25,975
It's weird.

708
01:13:26,051 --> 01:13:28,206
- He got away. - Kaecilius?

709
01:13:28,244 --> 01:13:28,744
Ya.

710
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:32,007
He could damage the room and also the elements present.

711
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:37,368
- She broke a mirror dimension elements in the real world? - Yes.

712
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:39,703
- How many? - Two.

713
01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:44,095
- I left one in the desert. - The other one?

714
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:45,354
In a body in the room.

715
01:13:45,396 --> 01:13:49,193
- Master Dram where? - He returned to the room-Taj.

716
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:50,894
Holy shrine in London has been destroyed.

717
01:13:51,523 --> 01:13:55,708
The remaining live in New York and Hong Kong that protects us from the dimension of darkness.

718
01:13:56,685 --> 01:13:58,936
You defend the holy shrine of the New York attacks.

719
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,484
But the master had been killed, and it took his successor.

720
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:03,499
Master Strange.

721
01:14:05,976 --> 01:14:07,676
No.

722
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:10,049
I'm a doctor Strange.

723
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:12,389
Strange is not the Master. Not even Mr. Strange.

724
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,329
I'm Doctor Strange.

725
01:14:15,589 --> 01:14:18,933
When I became a doctor, I swore that I would never harm others.

726
01:14:18,968 --> 01:14:22,035
And I've killed someone! I will not do it again.

727
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:24,718
Being a doctor is to save lives, not take it.

728
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:28,882
You'll be a doctor who would save all those lives ...

729
01:14:28,938 --> 01:14:30,711
... Also yourself.

730
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:34,514
- I can still read the character. - I saw what I always see.

731
01:14:34,549 --> 01:14:36,703
Your ego.

732
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,907
What do you want to go back to the illusion where you can control everything,

733
01:14:40,487 --> 01:14:43,479
even death can not be in control of anyone.

734
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:46,202
Even that can not be controlled terrific Doctor Stephen Strange.

735
01:14:46,618 --> 01:14:48,828
Even Dormammu?

736
01:14:50,262 --> 01:14:51,962
Which offers immortality?

737
01:14:52,227 --> 01:14:54,199
Our fear of death will give life to Dormammu.

738
01:14:54,234 --> 01:14:57,576
- Same thing with the feed. - As you feed him?

739
01:14:57,577 --> 01:15:01,068
You're talking about controlling death. I know how you do it.

740
01:15:01,103 --> 01:15:04,089
I've seen of the ritual in the Book of Cagliostro.

741
01:15:05,138 --> 01:15:08,310
Be careful with your words then, Doctor.

742
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,201
Because you probably would not like it?

743
01:15:10,236 --> 01:15:12,949
Because maybe you do not know what you're talking about.

744
01:15:12,984 --> 01:15:15,723
- What does it mean? - The point of a long life,

745
01:15:15,758 --> 01:15:17,733
The origin of immortality.

746
01:15:20,076 --> 01:15:22,890
He drew strength from Dimension well in order to stay alive.

747
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:28,649
- That's not true. - I saw the ritual.

748
01:15:29,565 --> 01:15:31,265
I know how to do.

749
01:15:32,614 --> 01:15:35,505
And when it comes back, the fanatics will be back.

750
01:15:36,612 --> 01:15:38,312
You must set the pace.

751
01:15:45,823 --> 01:15:49,552
- It's not what you think. - You have the right to say it.

752
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:54,264
You do not understand about our responsibility. No, I do not want to know it.

753
01:15:54,629 --> 01:15:57,442
- You're a coward. - Because I am not a murderer?

754
01:15:57,465 --> 01:15:58,965
You're too fanatical to us,

755
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,809
And you do not dare to become a Master Strange.

756
01:16:01,844 --> 01:16:04,795
- What do I do? - You just saved yourself!

757
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:09,853
- You complain as a wounded dog. - You think it's easy?

758
01:16:09,888 --> 01:16:12,868
You do not know anything.

759
01:16:14,552 --> 01:16:16,252
And the answer is yes.

760
01:16:16,783 --> 01:16:19,789
- Without hesitation. - No matter the other way?

761
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:23,232
- No other way. - You live with your imagination.

762
01:16:23,237 --> 01:16:24,737
No, Stephen.

763
01:16:24,767 --> 01:16:28,218
You do not have the courage.

764
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,997
They're back.

765
01:16:41,309 --> 01:16:43,266
We must put an end to this. Now!

766
01:16:49,117 --> 01:16:51,733
Strange! Come and fight!

767
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:54,367
No!

768
01:16:57,957 --> 01:16:59,657
Mirror dimension.

769
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:02,063
You can not go back to the real world here.

770
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:05,494
Who's laughing now? Asshole.

771
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:09,403
I.

772
01:17:22,273 --> 01:17:24,763
I had a sling-the rings I do not have to run, right?

773
01:17:26,148 --> 01:17:27,848
Run!

774
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,707
They are associated with Dimension good, it makes them stronger in the mirror dimensions.

775
01:17:47,742 --> 01:17:50,701
It can not affect the real world, but they can kill us.

776
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,013
This is not a smart choice. This is suicide!

777
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:11,501
This is funny.

778
01:18:58,139 --> 01:18:59,839
This is a mistake.

779
01:20:32,218 --> 01:20:33,918
Correct.

780
01:20:34,798 --> 01:20:37,259
I actually drew strength from the dimension of darkness.

781
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:43,058
Kaecilius ..

782
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:48,232
I have come to me with destruction,

783
01:20:48,398 --> 01:20:50,617
lost, miserable.

784
01:20:50,652 --> 01:20:54,223
I believe you to be my teacher, and telling lies.

785
01:20:54,258 --> 01:20:57,157
- I'm trying to protect you. - The truth?

786
01:20:57,222 --> 01:20:58,022
From yourself.

787
01:20:58,092 --> 01:21:02,581
- Now I've got a new teacher. - Dormammu tricked.

788
01:21:03,295 --> 01:21:05,542
You do not know who he was.

789
01:21:05,577 --> 01:21:10,570
Eternal life is not heaven, it's misery.

790
01:22:06,997 --> 01:22:10,770
- Christine! - Oh no kidding.

791
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:13,593
Geez.

792
01:22:15,206 --> 01:22:16,942
Do not do fibrillation. Her heart went into shock.

793
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:19,171
- Neurogenik?
- Ya.

794
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:29,468
Nick?

795
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:33,347
We must reduce pressure on his brain.

796
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:39,150
- Pulse down. - We're losing him!

797
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:40,246
Prepare extra oxygen.

798
01:22:40,251 --> 01:22:43,312
I need a pump for emergencies!

799
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:47,047
There was no reaction. There was no brain activity.

800
01:22:57,796 --> 01:22:59,496
What are you doing?

801
01:23:00,052 --> 01:23:01,752
You're going to die!

802
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:13,302
You should go back to your body now. You do not have time.

803
01:23:13,337 --> 01:23:17,291
Time is a relative thing. Your body is not touching the floor.

804
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:22,531
I spent many years peering through time ...

805
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:25,017
... Looking forward to this moment.

806
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,317
But I could not turn away.

807
01:23:27,528 --> 01:23:30,897
I saw the dreadful future.

808
01:23:30,932 --> 01:23:33,473
I always follow what happens next.

809
01:23:34,019 --> 01:23:35,983
Everything here,

810
01:23:36,654 --> 01:23:39,426
- Never continue. - You think you're better off dead?

811
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:43,925
- You wonder what I see in your future? - No.

812
01:23:46,179 --> 01:23:49,324
- Yes. - I've never seen your future.

813
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,810
There are only possibilities.

814
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:54,899
You have a great capacity to do good.

815
01:23:54,934 --> 01:23:56,857
You're always the smartest.

816
01:23:56,892 --> 01:23:59,050
But not because you wanted to be successful,

817
01:23:59,085 --> 01:24:01,344
but because you're afraid to fail.

818
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:03,806
That's why I became a great doctor.

819
01:24:03,841 --> 01:24:06,663
It makes you become arrogant,

820
01:24:07,549 --> 01:24:09,837
arrogant, your fears still dominate you.

821
01:24:09,872 --> 01:24:12,937
You must learn the simplest and most important of all.

822
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:15,080
What's that?

823
01:24:16,462 --> 01:24:18,162
This is not about you.

824
01:24:22,428 --> 01:24:24,153
When you first came to me,

825
01:24:24,188 --> 01:24:27,074
You asked me how I heal Jonathan Pangborn.

826
01:24:28,038 --> 01:24:29,738
I do not heal.

827
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,802
He channeled his energy on the dimensions directly into his body.

828
01:24:35,995 --> 01:24:38,544
- She uses magic to walk? - You could say so.

829
01:24:39,228 --> 01:24:40,928
She had a choice,

830
01:24:41,893 --> 01:24:43,663
to come back to life,

831
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:46,521
or do something bigger than himself.

832
01:24:46,556 --> 01:24:49,053
So, my hands can heal ??

833
01:24:49,562 --> 01:24:51,262
Life?

834
01:24:51,706 --> 01:24:53,406
Of course you can.

835
01:24:54,064 --> 01:24:56,829
And the world will be better for it.

836
01:24:58,318 --> 01:25:01,160
I hate the power that comes from Dimension Good.

837
01:25:01,689 --> 01:25:05,093
But as you know, sometimes we have to break the rules,

838
01:25:05,128 --> 01:25:08,935
- For the common good. - Mordo can not realize it.

839
01:25:09,446 --> 01:25:12,096
Mordo has soul stiff and motionless,

840
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:14,255
He forged by fire from his youth.

841
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:18,159
She needs fleksibilitasmu, same as you need strength.

842
01:25:19,556 --> 01:25:23,264
Only with a united, you have a chance to stop Dormammu.

843
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,360
I am not ready.

844
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,830
Nothing is ever ready.

845
01:25:30,049 --> 01:25:32,778
You can not choose your time.

846
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,274
Death is the sense of life,

847
01:25:39,995 --> 01:25:42,015
so you know your days are numbered.

848
01:25:42,646 --> 01:25:44,346
Your time is yours.

849
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:49,306
Do you think you'll have time to be ready.

850
01:25:49,605 --> 01:25:51,388
But look at me.

851
01:25:51,389 --> 01:25:54,113
Think of a time in thousands of time,

852
01:25:54,865 --> 01:25:56,845
only to see the snow.

853
01:26:35,834 --> 01:26:37,534
You are okay?

854
01:26:45,107 --> 01:26:47,645
- I do not understand what happened. - I know.

855
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:51,870
I have to go.

856
01:26:56,982 --> 01:26:59,471
You said to me losing my ability is not the end.

857
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,288
- Yes it could be a new start. - Yes.

858
01:27:04,299 --> 01:27:06,792
Because there are always other ways to save lives.

859
01:27:10,297 --> 01:27:11,997
The hard way.

860
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,950
How complicated.

861
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:19,605
Dr. Palmer, Silahkan ke UGD, Dr. Palmer, silahkan UGD.

862
01:27:24,275 --> 01:27:25,975
I do not want you to go.

863
01:28:14,193 --> 01:28:15,893
Stop!

864
01:28:20,406 --> 01:28:23,670
HONG KONG

865
01:28:45,092 --> 01:28:46,792
Choose your weapons wisely.

866
01:28:50,362 --> 01:28:52,088
There should not be anyone to enter the temple.

867
01:28:54,832 --> 01:28:56,532
No one.

868
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:15,511
- Kaecilius. - You're a part of history, Wong.

869
01:29:28,313 --> 01:29:31,622
- He is died. - You are right.

870
01:29:32,473 --> 01:29:34,894
He did not like that I think.

871
01:29:35,423 --> 01:29:37,123
She is so complicated.

872
01:29:42,086 --> 01:29:43,786
Complicated?

873
01:29:46,628 --> 01:29:48,444
Dimensions darkness is already open.

874
01:29:49,052 --> 01:29:50,752
Dangerous.

875
01:29:51,147 --> 01:29:52,847
What if I handle it?

876
01:29:54,363 --> 01:29:56,404
The Ancient One teaches us that it is forbidden ...

877
01:29:57,505 --> 01:30:01,288
While she herself attractive force them to steal life.

878
01:30:01,323 --> 01:30:03,465
He did what he thought right in.

879
01:30:03,478 --> 01:30:05,178
It all depends on you.

880
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,939
Do not you see it?

881
01:30:09,712 --> 01:30:12,197
Conquering Evil Dormammu.

882
01:30:12,232 --> 01:30:16,203
Kaecilius adalah kesalahan The Ancient One.

883
01:30:16,717 --> 01:30:19,850
And here we are, in the midst of the results of the lie.

884
01:30:23,595 --> 01:30:27,027
- In the midst of the ugliness. - Mordo, destroyed the temple in London.

885
01:30:27,062 --> 01:30:30,940
The one in New York has been attacked twice. You know exactly where the next.

886
01:30:31,535 --> 01:30:35,163
Hong Kong. You told me to fight like my life at stake,

887
01:30:35,169 --> 01:30:37,968
Because one day, it determines our future.

888
01:30:38,571 --> 01:30:40,667
I can not fight it alone.

889
01:30:58,602 --> 01:31:00,302
Temple here has been destroyed.

890
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:09,908
The dimension of darkness.

891
01:31:11,437 --> 01:31:13,137
Dormammu has come.

892
01:31:15,276 --> 01:31:17,023
Too late.

893
01:31:17,024 --> 01:31:18,724
Nothing can stop it.

894
01:31:20,663 --> 01:31:22,363
No one.

895
01:31:26,133 --> 01:31:27,833
No.

896
01:32:08,853 --> 01:32:10,553
The spell worked.

897
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:13,422
We've got a second chance.

898
01:33:52,307 --> 01:33:54,622
No!

899
01:34:04,185 --> 01:34:06,016
Wong.

900
01:34:14,151 --> 01:34:15,851
This violates the laws of nature. I know.

901
01:34:18,332 --> 01:34:20,032
Do not stop there.

902
01:34:21,391 --> 01:34:24,681
When intact temple back, they will attack again. We must defend it.

903
01:34:24,716 --> 01:34:27,100
Come on!

904
01:34:54,744 --> 01:34:57,908
Wake up, Strange. Wake up and fight.

905
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,658
We could resolve this.

906
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:02,450
You can not fight anymore.

907
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,620
Is not it wonderful?

908
01:35:09,123 --> 01:35:11,178
World indefinitely.

909
01:35:14,148 --> 01:35:15,848
Without death.

910
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:21,359
Limitless time...

911
01:35:21,616 --> 01:35:23,316
Strange!

912
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:56,726
He's gone.

913
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:00,583
Strange even chose to go and surrender.

914
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:35,697
Dormammu, I come to negotiate.

915
01:36:35,732 --> 01:36:38,550
You came here to die.

916
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:45,585
Your world is my world now, like all the others.

917
01:37:15,726 --> 01:37:18,691
Dormammu, I come to negotiate.

918
01:37:19,353 --> 01:37:21,743
You came here to die.

919
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,718
Your world is my grief ...

920
01:37:26,555 --> 01:37:28,255
What is this?

921
01:37:28,377 --> 01:37:31,643
- Illusion? - No. This is real.

922
01:37:31,654 --> 01:37:32,154
Good.

923
01:37:43,105 --> 01:37:45,921
Dormammu, I come to negotiate.

924
01:37:46,391 --> 01:37:49,235
You ... What happened?

925
01:37:49,951 --> 01:37:52,598
This way you give Kaecilius strength of dimensimu.

926
01:37:52,925 --> 01:37:55,046
I brought a little strength from myself.

927
01:37:55,705 --> 01:37:57,810
This is the time.

928
01:37:58,376 --> 01:38:01,673
Endless time loop.

929
01:38:02,186 --> 01:38:04,737
How dare you?

930
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:09,779
Dormammu, I come to negotiate.

931
01:38:11,045 --> 01:38:13,314
You can not do this forever.

932
01:38:13,706 --> 01:38:15,406
Actually, I can.

933
01:38:15,528 --> 01:38:17,228
It is happening now.

934
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:22,081
You and I, stuck in this time indefinitely.

935
01:38:22,454 --> 01:38:25,670
Then the time of your death will be eternal.

936
01:38:26,339 --> 01:38:29,903
Yes. But all the people on Earth will live.

937
01:38:30,215 --> 01:38:31,915
But you will suffer.

938
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:33,869
Suffering is an old friend.

939
01:38:36,694 --> 01:38:38,394
Dormammu!

940
01:38:38,507 --> 01:38:41,130
I came to negotiate. Stop it!

941
01:38:41,273 --> 01:38:44,257
Dormammu... Dormammu...

942
01:38:59,695 --> 01:39:02,350
You'll never win.

943
01:39:03,911 --> 01:39:05,611
No...

944
01:39:05,835 --> 01:39:07,535
What do I lose?

945
01:39:08,036 --> 01:39:14,974
Again, again, again, again and forever.

946
01:39:16,646 --> 01:39:19,529
- And it makes you become tahananku. - No!

947
01:39:19,564 --> 01:39:24,006
Stop! Stop it!

948
01:39:24,555 --> 01:39:27,994
- Release me! - No!

949
01:39:28,884 --> 01:39:30,646
I came to negotiate.

950
01:39:32,409 --> 01:39:35,206
What do you want?

951
01:39:36,444 --> 01:39:38,601
Taking kefanatikanmu from Earth.

952
01:39:39,162 --> 01:39:41,176
and also your attacks on my world.

953
01:39:41,712 --> 01:39:43,587
Do not ever come back.

954
01:39:44,005 --> 01:39:47,084
Do that and I'll return lingkaranmu.

955
01:39:56,795 --> 01:39:58,495
Arise, Strange.

956
01:39:58,513 --> 01:40:00,218
Wake up and fight.

957
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:02,343
We could resolve this.

958
01:40:02,842 --> 01:40:04,542
Is not it wonderful?

959
01:40:06,062 --> 01:40:08,109
World indefinitely.

960
01:40:10,873 --> 01:40:12,573
Without death.

961
01:40:24,534 --> 01:40:27,032
- What have you done? - I made a deal.

962
01:40:30,778 --> 01:40:34,951
- What is this? - Its always in want of all people.

963
01:40:36,277 --> 01:40:38,621
Eternal life is one of them.

964
01:40:41,323 --> 01:40:43,283
There will not be like that.

965
01:41:03,244 --> 01:41:04,997
You're supposed to steal the entire book,

966
01:41:05,264 --> 01:41:06,964
As a warning ...

967
01:41:07,377 --> 01:41:10,044
... Warning that appears after the spell was uttered.

968
01:41:19,787 --> 01:41:21,487
This is funny.

969
01:41:47,977 --> 01:41:49,677
We did it.

970
01:41:52,119 --> 01:41:53,819
Ya.

971
01:41:54,039 --> 01:41:55,739
Yes, we are successful.

972
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,147
But we are also against the law of nature.

973
01:42:00,959 --> 01:42:02,912
Look around It's over.

974
01:42:03,514 --> 01:42:06,351
You still think that this is not going to be consequences, Strange?

975
01:42:07,733 --> 01:42:09,490
There was no price to be paid?

976
01:42:10,073 --> 01:42:13,095
We're breaking the rules, just like ...

977
01:42:14,007 --> 01:42:17,790
... When the bill comes.

978
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:20,255
Always...

979
01:42:20,484 --> 01:42:23,807
... In our account.

980
01:42:24,932 --> 01:42:27,762
I'm not going to follow this path again.

981
01:43:01,678 --> 01:43:03,378
Yes, good.

982
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:14,110
A wise choice.

983
01:43:14,489 --> 01:43:18,415
You will keep the Eye of Agamotto, since the master is gone.

984
01:43:18,975 --> 01:43:20,675
Until then,

985
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:24,287
do not roam brought it ..

986
01:43:24,566 --> 01:43:28,443
- What? - You've got the talent to master the Mystic Arts,

987
01:43:28,754 --> 01:43:30,537
... But you still have much to learn.

988
01:43:31,677 --> 01:43:35,159
The Ancient One's death news spread throughout the universe.

989
01:43:35,581 --> 01:43:38,490
There's nothing that can keep Sorcerer Supreme.

990
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:40,971

DOCTOR STRANGE.

993
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:32,078
So, now the world has a witch?

994
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:36,630
- Want some tea? - I did not drink tea.

995
01:46:36,641 --> 01:46:38,341
What are you drinking?

996
01:46:38,546 --> 01:46:40,740
Non tea.

997
01:46:43,745 --> 01:46:46,329
I had a list of people and creatures ...

998
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:48,898
... From other media that could threaten the world.

999
01:46:48,987 --> 01:46:52,493
Foster brother, Loki, one of them.

1000
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:57,515
- One valuable. - Yes.

1001
01:46:58,707 --> 01:47:02,550
So, what brings you here, to New York?

1002
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:06,554
Long story. It may also be a family drama,

1003
01:47:06,555 --> 01:47:08,788
I'm looking for my father.

1004
01:47:09,096 --> 01:47:15,471
Good. So, if you find Odin, you will soon return to Asgard?

1005
01:47:15,515 --> 01:47:18,697
- Oh, yes. Soon. - Good.

1006
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,580
Let me help.
