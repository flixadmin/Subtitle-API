5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,549
Glad we understand each other.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,790
There are other ways

HARVEY: Something's eating at you, Jim.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,280
And you're not gonna feel clean
till you get it off your chest.

9

That's done now.

Nothing.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,399

36

37

Doesn't matter that Maria's gone,
you'll always be my sister.

We're not really here

There's only one neighborhood
in Gotham that hasn't bent the knee.

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,870
The Narrows has never submitted
to an outside boss.

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,635
There's never been someone
like me ruling Gotham.

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
Okay.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,075
What do you want?

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
A tax.

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,840
Thirty percent on all income coming
from The Narrows, legal and illegal.

51

Every family there lives
hand to mouth. They'II starve.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,071
We all have to make sacrifices.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,230
I'll need an answer
by the end of the day.

You want me to kiss the ring?
I'II do it.

To keep the peace. But what you're
asking for is impossible.

You'll find a way.

Thought it was all about family.

58
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,672
Never said it was a happy family.

you want from me?

67

Help.

Figuring this out.
I can't do it alone, I...

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,078
Alfred, I need your help.

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,555
No.

71
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
What?

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,072
Listen, you can't just waltz back
in here and expect me to go

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,913
and clean your smalls and cock
your tea. After what you've done.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,911
Alfred, I'm not asking for that.
I've changed.

You have. have you?

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,396
It's one thing saying
that you've changed.

77
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,278
And another actually changing.

78
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,076
So show me. Show me how you've
changed, and I might reconsider.

79
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,430
Show you how?

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,233
That's for you to figure out, innit?

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,993
I'm asking as a friend.

82
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,310

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,752
Okay. then we'II work on it together.
You can wear the badge.

163
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,832
Get this straight, Jim.
I ain't working for you now or ever.

164
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,636
I got more contacts in The Narrows
than any of you.

165
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,511
I'm gonna find her. Alone.

166
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,998
Once I find my pants.

167
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,189
LEE: Doesn't make any sense.

168
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,794
There's no money here.

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,399
Okay. so it's about power.

170
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,674
I offered to bend the knee.

171
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,239
She's asking for something
she knew I couldn't give.

172
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,750
She wants...

173
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,118
She wants to punish me.

174
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,194
For what?

175
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,994
Idon't know.
But you can't fight an enemy

176
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,509
whose motivations
you don't understand. Lee.

177
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,479
You are the greatest spies
in all of Gotham.

178
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,431
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

179
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,197
The survival of The Narrows
depends upon you.

Whoever learns why Sofia Falcone
wants to destroy Lee Thompkins

a complete set of encyclopedias.

Plus 20 bucks.

- Yes!
- Yeah!

185
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,355
Go get 'em.

OFFICER: We're moving, clear.

188
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,280
She wasn't bluffing.

189
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,638
With this many plants, she could kill
hundreds if not thousands of people.

190
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,400
Search the other room for any signs
of where she's heading.

191
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,189
What are you gonna do to her?

192
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,316
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

193
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,080
Ijust saw the news.

194
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,318
She killed four more people today.

195
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,474
You knew where she was staying.
If you had told me,

196
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,751
- we could've saved lives.
- Or not.

197
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,638
I mean, you couldn't even stop her
from hypnotizing your own cops.

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
S0 why did you come here?

199
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,359
To try to reason with her.

200
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,790
Have you heard a word she said?
She's a fanatic.

201
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
She's my friend.

202
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,154
What do you expect me to do?

203
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,076
She contacts you again, call me.

204
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,116
I'II try and find her,
and bring her in quietly.

205
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,392
Otherwise, stay out of her way.

206
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,675
Harvey?

207
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,510
Hey, I got a lead.

208
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,315
Great.

209
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,400
HARVEY: I knocked some heads.

210
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,831
Heard a hot redhead was poking around
in that dive bar next door.

211
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,150
That is the place in The Narrows
for low-end muscle.

212
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,197
So I figured,
if she was planning something big.

213
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,759
She mighfve gone there to recruit.

214
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,475
That's the back entrance.

215

Harvey, call it in.

219
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,877
She's beautiful,
don't you think, Jim?

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,434
Drop your weapon.

(WHISTLES)

222
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,960
You don't look good.

223
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,760
I think you might be exceeding
your recommended dosage.

224
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,356
Are you experiencing
"trembling extremities"?

225
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,551
Check. "Cognitive impairment"?
Definite check.

226
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,314
Though to be fair,
how would you know?

227
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,029
Shut up!

228
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
Take all the pills you want, Ed.
I'm only getting stronger.

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,789
Soon I'm gonna be out,
and the fun begins.

230
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,998
No. I won't let you.
'Cause I know what you'll do.

231
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,957
Oh, you mean kill Lee?

232
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,910
Yeah, I guess I will do that.
And you can't stop me.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,593
There are things that I can do.

234
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,956
Like what? You need to face it, pal.

235
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,350
The only way you'll get
rid of me is to kill yourself.

236
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,072
I guess you are smarter than me.

237
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,352
- You wouldn't actually...
- Oh, yeah.

238
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,959
Oh, yeah.

239
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,311
I said drop the gun, Jim.

240
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,320
Do you believe in fate.
Detective Gordon?

241
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,954
I went out today to test my plants
on the man who shot my father.

242
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,711
He wasn't there.
That's disappointing.

243
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,913
Then he found me.

244
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,319
And I realized I could make him
deliver his partner as well.

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,274
Fate.

246
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,397
Stay strong, Harvey.
She's controlling you.

247
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,754
I kinda like it, Jim.

248
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,749

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,278

250
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,637
Let me find Selina.
She wants to help.

251
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Quiet.

252
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
I have to go.

253
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,471

Lots of people to kill.

254
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,233
- Detective Bullock?
- Ma'am.

255
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,200
After you kill your partner, be sure
to shoot yourself in the head, okay?

was your fault.

it was a power play. And it failed.

about who she's targeting next?

323

I can't believe I let her get to me.

324
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,873
Hey, you wanna help? Here's how.
Did she say anything?

325
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,110
Something about,
"They get rich by murdering plants."

326
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,832
So she's targeting
a group of rich people.

327
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,519
At her place, she was trying on
fancy clothes, fancy shoes.

328
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,035
A party?

329
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,396
She said she had big plans.
Couldn't be late.

330

- Yeah, black tie.
- No, no, no, come on.

gas masks, nonlethal rounds.

337
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,430
When Ivy got me, she <i>was</i> hypnotizing
a bunch of low-end muscle.

338
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,635
Go.

339

We could really use you there, Harv.

340

I just don't trust myself right now.

Welcome to the third annual dinner

355
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,874
for the Thomas and
Martha Wayne Foundation.

356
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,315
This year we disbursed $4 million...

357
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,873
Um...

358
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,349
We disbursed $4 million and, uh...

359
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,834
My parents spent their
lives helping people.

360
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,556
I was so proud of them, and I always
wanted them to be proud of me.

361
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,878
And then I saw them get murdered.

362
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,074
I survived because someone in
my life kept me going.

363
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,438
He's been everything to me.

364
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,709
A teacher,

365
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,829
a protector.

366
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,634
He's been a father to me.

367
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,555
I hope...

368
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,194
I hope he can see that.

369
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,994
And give me another chance.

370
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,949

Thank you.

373
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,754
That meant a great deal.

374
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,153
But I can't help you.

375
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,272
Not until you accept
who you really are.

376
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,955
I know who I am,
I've seen what's inside of me.

377
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,077
Darkness and anger?

378
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,119
But what's beneath that?

379
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,510
It's a heart that feels pain.

380
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,831
Your heart is what makes you
want to help other people.

381
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,917
Your heart is your strength.

382
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,754
Deny the darkness and you deny that.

383
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,119
But accepting that is something that
you must do on your own.

384
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,674
Do you understand me?

385
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,558
