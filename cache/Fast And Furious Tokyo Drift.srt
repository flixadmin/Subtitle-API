1
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,071
Nice ride.

2
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,701
It does the job.

3
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,550
What job,
delivering pizzas?

4
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,947
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

5
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,805
What the hell
was that?

6
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,943
What?

7
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:05,497
Hey!
You talking to my girl?

8
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,836
Oh, shit. Here we go.
Yeah.

9
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:10,897
She was just
admiring my ride.

10
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,277
"My ride. "

11
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,925
My grandma's Buick
could smoke

12
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,914
that piece of shit,
trailer trash.

13
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,704
Well, what about
your daddy's Viper?

14
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:21,584
This beast's
got 500 horsepower

15
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,810
and a Borla exhaust system.

16
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,719
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds...

17
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,750
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

18
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:29,132
Wow.
You can read the brochure.

19
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:55,377
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

20
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:57,571
What's he gonna do?

21
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,583
Let's make it happen.
Bring it.

22
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,502
I got your...
I got your back.

23
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,051
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

24
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,068
I only race
for pink slips.

25
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,888
This car goes for 80 grand.

26
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,998
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

27
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:33,028
How about me?

28
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,042
Winner gets me.

29
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,917
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

30
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:06,558
Blast-off, baby!

31
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,308
First one out
the other side...

32
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,489
It's time.
Let's go!

33
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,966
Ready, boys? Make it interesting, Clay.

34
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:02,145
Shit!

35
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:14,814
Yeah!

36
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,332
I thought
you loved me.

37
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:35,848
Oh, well.

38
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,066
What the hell?

39
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:00,209
Guess I got
a new date for prom.

40
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:12,274
Clay, stop the car!
Shut up!

41
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,284
Clay, stop the car!

42
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,387
Shut up!

43
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:24,685
Stop it!

44
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,276
Clay, please stop!
Please stop!

45
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:44,383
Can I get
a copy of that?

46
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,678
You think
this is a joke, huh?

47
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,967
You see Ken and Barbie
over there?

48
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,856
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

49
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,377
Mommy and Daddy
are too hooked up.

50
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,416
But I like
screw-ups like you.

51
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:03,950
You know why?

52
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:06,758
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

53
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,900
Where's my car?
I crushed it.

54
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:10,121
You did what?

55
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,351
Sit down! You're done.
Easy, easy.

56
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:12,818
You're done. You
understand me? You're done.

57
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:15,658
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

58
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,090
Sean.

59
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:22,647
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

60
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,584
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

61
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,932
It's, uh, it's Miss.

62
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:35,836
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

63
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,570
It's a tough state.

64
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:47,785
And it's
a pretty clear-cut case.

65
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,610
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

66
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,488
This is our third town
in two years.

67
00:10:57,745 --> 00:10:59,722
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

68
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,786
willful destruction
of property.

69
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,833
This makes it
strike three.

70
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:06,496
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

71
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:09,394
Well, there's
just got to be another way.

72
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,646
So, where are we
moving this time?

73
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,319
We are not
moving anywhere.

74
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:21,561
Sean.

75
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,459
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

76
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,177
Today is the 7th.

77
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,068
Well, look,
just hold on one second.

78
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,790
Come on in.

79
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,192
This is it.

80
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,874
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

81
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:17,007
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

82
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:19,707
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

83
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,885
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

84
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,621
So, how is your mom?

85
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,311
Where do I sleep?

86
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:35,325
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

87
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:38,101
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

88
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:40,976
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away

89
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:43,006
every time
you get into trouble.

90
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,011
Worked for you.

91
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,788
Look, neither of us
asked for this.

92
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:54,298
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

93
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:57,749
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

94
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:59,808
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

95
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,464
Rules?

96
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,075
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

97
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,128
You go to school,

98
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,845
you come back here
right after.

99
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:09,779
And I don't
want to see or hear

100
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,707
about you
anywhere near a car.

101
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:16,185
Here,
the bedroom is yours.

102
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,063
Make yourself comfortable.

103
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,178
Lights out in 10.

104
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:29,682
You got to be kiddin'.

105
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:28,431
Wrong train.

106
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:30,395
I'm new here.

107
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,182
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

108
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,165
Japanese food
is like the Army.

109
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,681
Don't ask, don't tell.

110
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,269
Name's Twinkie.

111
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:47,335
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

112
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:50,405
Yeah?

113
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,098
I'll hook you up.
Half price.

114
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:55,669
No, I'm cool.

115
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,221
60% off. Hmm?

116
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:59,333
Since we're both army
brats and everything.

117
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,939
I ain't got no cash,
man.

118
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:03,847
And I ain't
an army brat.

119
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,301
All right, all right.

120
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:06,953
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

121
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,097
Everybody needs
a cell phone.

122
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,769
No offense,

123
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:13,370
but I'm probably
not gonna be here

124
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,249
long enough
to remember your name.

125
00:19:15,992 --> 00:19:19,290
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

126
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:20,903
You like Michael Jordan?

127
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,502
I love Michael Jordan.

128
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,290
Check this out.

129
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:28,081
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

130
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,357
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

131
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,584
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

132
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:38,094
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

133
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,700
Man, I even paid
retail for it.

134
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:42,644
What you drive?

135
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,355
My ride?
Yeah.

136
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:46,054
My ride's one of a kind.

137
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,308
Show me.

138
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:50,416
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

139
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:52,507
All right.

140
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:15,266
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

141
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,067
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

142
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:25,005
<i>Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

143
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:29,289
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

144
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:30,841
<i>My life be like</i>

145
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:33,265
<i>It's times like these
that make me say</i>

146
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,665
<i>Lord if you see me
please come my way</i>

147
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:38,131
<i>Leavin' bread crumbs
for when I stray</i>

148
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,533
<i>Rely on sacrifice
and the price you paid</i>

149
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,078
<i>Feel me like a fingertip</i>

150
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:47,429
Slamming, huh?
Look at that car.

151
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:49,320
<i>Tryin' not to quench your
fire with the things I do</i>

152
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:51,253
At least let me drive.

153
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,764
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

154
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,903
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

155
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:57,557
Well, all right.

156
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,552
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

157
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,637
You look a little nervous.

158
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:03,725
What up, Tosh?

159
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:24,366
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

160
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:28,787
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

161
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,887
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

162
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:33,901
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

163
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:38,057
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

164
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,533
For when you
blow your wad, man.

165
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,290
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

166
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,247
Hear that?

167
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,120
It's still not right
for the way I drive.

168
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,347
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

169
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,833
Okay.
Then we're done here.

170
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,288
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

171
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:56,444
Boys.

172
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:59,765
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

173
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:02,573
I'm a guy.
It's in my DNA.

174
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,758
So y'all race
with these things, huh?

175
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,189
Cute little toys.

176
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:12,502
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

177
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:14,522
<i>Don't you mean uwabaki?</i>

178
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:17,206
Neela, right?

179
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:19,854
You're a quick learner.

180
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,359
So, where you from,
anyway?

181
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,580
Here.

182
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,693
No, I mean,
not where you live.

183
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:29,395
Where'd you come from?

184
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,542
Does it really matter
where I'm from?

185
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:41,028
Who's the tourist?

186
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,940
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

187
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,530
You're moving up
in the world.

188
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:49,261
You gotta
elevate your company.

189
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,995
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

190
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:52,543
God. Girl.

191
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,527
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

192
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,195
All right, beautiful.
Hold up.

193
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:01,284
Hey!

194
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,945
He was just leaving.

195
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:10,902
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

196
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:17,385
<i>Understand that?
Gaijin?</i>

197
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:18,747
Takashi.

198
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:20,832
We were just talking.

199
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,757
This isn't your scene.

200
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:27,631
<i>That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,</i>

201
00:24:28,404 --> 00:24:30,443
what does that mean
exactly?

202
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,859
Means, turn around,

203
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:36,215
keep walking.

204
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:37,614
That's exactly
what we gonna do.

205
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,786
Come on, man,
let's roll.

206
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:40,314
<i>Yo, look, man,
he's yakuza.</i>

207
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,286
Now, see, that's funny,

208
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:46,405
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

209
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,185
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

210
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,227
You know who I am,
boy?

211
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:59,662
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

212
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,783
Leave.

213
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,005
<i>Damn, man.
You know yakuza? The Mafia?</i>

214
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:13,834
<i>Look, sorry, DK- san.</i>

215
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,860
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

216
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,733
Hey, D, let's go.

217
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:19,182
It's time to race.

218
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,160
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

219
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:37,607
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

220
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,265
Then let's race.

221
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:48,040
With what, huh?
Your skateboard?

222
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:53,089
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

223
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:55,151
Take mine.

224
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,615
Let's race.

225
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:07,197
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

226
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:15,505
Can he drive?

227
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:18,078
Can he drive?

228
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,182
You know what DK
stands for?

229
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:24,585
Donkey Kong?

230
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,387
Drift King.

231
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:29,185
Drift?

232
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,096
What do you mean,
drift?

233
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:46,304
Still need
a dictionary?

234
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,866
You know that
real famous painting?

235
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,309
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

236
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:52,421
<i>The Mona Lisa.</i>

237
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:53,619
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

238
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:55,267
Well, look, man,
this car right here's

239
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,971
<i>like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.</i>

240
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,827
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

241
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:01,414
We talking forged pistons,

242
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:04,675
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

243
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:08,704
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

244
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:13,009
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...

245
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,599
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

246
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:16,825
Hand braking
is the easiest,

247
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:17,957
so the first thing
I want you to do,

248
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:19,255
I want you
to rip that e-brake.

249
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:20,456
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

250
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:22,300
then I want you
to power over.

251
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:25,322
You know what?

252
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:26,905
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

253
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:28,719
All right.

254
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:23,789
Ready.

255
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,291
Set.

256
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,227
Go!

257
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:12,322
I told you.

258
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:54,360
Damn it!

259
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:42,262
Damn it!

260
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:25,415
Don't leave town.

261
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:43,226
Do you know
what time it is?

262
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:45,557
I thought
it was around 7:00.

263
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:48,903
You know,
US is a few hours behind.

264
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,734
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

265
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:59,728
Have you been racing, Sean?

266
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:05,547
You're out of here.

267
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:10,331
Go ahead.

268
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,612
You don't get it,
do you?

269
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:15,794
You have
nowhere else to go.

270
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,564
If it doesn't
work out here,

271
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:19,629
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

272
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:24,594
This isn't a game.

273
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,259
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

274
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,017
if you're gonna
live under my roof,

275
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:31,937
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

276
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:34,163
Understand?

277
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,880
Understand?

278
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,064
Yes, sir.

279
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:30,900
Get in.

280
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:33,475
I'll get you your money.

281
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,673
Why you talking
like you have a choice?

282
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:51,951
There's a guy in there
with a paw

283
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,812
that owes me some money.

284
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:55,068
A paw?

285
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:58,349
Go get me my money.

286
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:02,533
Okay.

287
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:58,595
Han said,

288
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:01,764
<i>okane.</i>

289
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:12,316
<i>Han said, okane.</i>

290
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:42,570
Let's go.

291
00:36:50,595 --> 00:36:53,531
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

292
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,216
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

293
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:57,888
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog

294
00:36:58,027 --> 00:36:59,655
or in bed with Beyoncé.

295
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:01,354
I call, you show.

296
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:04,284
Only if you teach me
how to drift.

297
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:06,282
This ain't a negotiation.

298
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:08,486
I wasn't negotiating.

299
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,718
What's he doing here?

300
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,805
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can

301
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,751
sitting in my garage.

302
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,684
Hope
he's not driving.

303
00:38:07,862 --> 00:38:09,008
<i>Gaijin.</i>

304
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:11,890
When is your next race?

305
00:38:12,098 --> 00:38:13,690
I'd really like to be there.

306
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,704
Why not be in it?

307
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,337
You heard me.

308
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,535
Ready to lose
another car, Han?

309
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:30,095
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

310
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:33,409
All right.

311
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,622
Put up the '72 Skyline.

312
00:38:36,832 --> 00:38:37,879
Done.

313
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:42,005
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

314
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,221
Get him out of here.

315
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,138
We have business
to discuss.

316
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,023
Your shipment's late.

317
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:05,165
Since when are you
so worried about the details?

318
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,556
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

319
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,651
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

320
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:37,329
Hey, Dad, it's me.

321
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:38,812
Uh, I had to
stay after school

322
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:40,725
for some
extracurricular activities.

323
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:43,726
So I'll be home
a little later.

324
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,515
Sir.

325
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,750
You really need to stop
following me around.

326
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:54,853
What are you
doing here?

327
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:57,057
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend

328
00:39:57,204 --> 00:39:58,628
for some drifting lessons.

329
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:00,948
Trust me.

330
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,792
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

331
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,196
It's good enough for you.

332
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,242
You don't know
anything about me.

333
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,606
Well, why don't you
think I know?

334
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:12,069
<i>'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?</i>

335
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,206
Let me guess.

336
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,354
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

337
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:20,922
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

338
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:23,949
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

339
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:27,332
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

340
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:32,890
Zero for one, cowboy.

341
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,645
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

342
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:48,397
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

343
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,222
<i>Mamacita, oh my God,
I think your on fire</i>

344
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,288
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

345
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:56,603
Is everything okay
back there?

346
00:40:57,469 --> 00:40:58,994
I can handle DK.

347
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:01,822
<i>I thought he's yakuza.</i>

348
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:04,227
<i>His uncle's yakuza.</i>

349
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:08,630
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

350
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,131
But I need him.

351
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:17,003
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

352
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:19,230
What do you mean?

353
00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:22,158
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action

354
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:23,865
from everyone
on his turf.

355
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:25,598
We're on his turf.

356
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:28,498
50% of something
is better than

357
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:30,232
100% of nothing.

358
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:34,395
So have you raced DK?

359
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:37,244
Why not? Is he that good?

360
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:39,845
What's the point
of a race?

361
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:43,335
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

362
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,446
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

363
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,009
If I were to race,
it would have to be

364
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:48,956
for something important.

365
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:51,015
Or why else do it at all?

366
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:55,290
Why are you
letting me race?

367
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:57,575
'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.

368
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:00,892
And you owe me a car.

369
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,504
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

370
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,932
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

371
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:19,035
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

372
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,460
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

373
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,688
Oh, shit.

374
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:29,266
<i>I make ya smile right</i>

375
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,381
What the...

376
00:42:33,504 --> 00:42:35,994
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

377
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:37,601
You can do
better than 180 k,

378
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,944
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

379
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:42,624
<i>'Cause its just nice you lookin
different sayin' to yourself</i>

380
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:44,269
You know what?

381
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:46,194
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

382
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:48,576
<i>When my chain keep linkin'
like Christmas lights</i>

383
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,932
<i>Mamacita, oh my God
I think your on fire</i>

384
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,858
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

385
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,349
Danny!

386
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,027
You're looking good.

387
00:43:09,277 --> 00:43:10,389
Disco.

388
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:18,550
We gotta catch up.

389
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:20,104
Get you a drink on me, huh?

390
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,448
Let's go.

391
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:37,622
Aha. Easy now, ladies.

392
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:41,885
Come on.

393
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:45,488
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy</i>

394
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,978
What's up?
How you doing?

395
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:49,417
Hey, baby.

396
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,261
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy</i>

397
00:43:52,443 --> 00:43:54,349
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

398
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:55,782
<i>Can I get that number</i>

399
00:43:55,906 --> 00:43:57,504
<i>Big hot pockets,
feya, ugly</i>

400
00:43:57,645 --> 00:43:59,619
<i>Corny, busted,
chopped, straight fugly</i>

401
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:01,368
<i>British guys playing rugby</i>

402
00:44:01,507 --> 00:44:02,939
<i>Brooklyn boys
who wanna thug me</i>

403
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,767
<i>Skanky, cranky,
foogly, oogly</i>

404
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,502
<i>Slammin dudes
that wanna do me</i>

405
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:07,853
<i>G'Doonk G'Doonk,
skoonky, flavors</i>

406
00:44:07,975 --> 00:44:09,603
Keep your hands
off the kid, girls.

407
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:11,171
He's underage.

408
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:13,220
<i>Country boys and them boys
in the city</i>

409
00:44:13,377 --> 00:44:15,134
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

410
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:17,201
Disneyland
for grownups, huh?

411
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:18,719
All these girls, man,
they look like...

412
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:20,185
What, models?

413
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:21,325
Check it out.

414
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:23,130
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital

415
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:24,585
on this side of the planet,
all right?

416
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:26,082
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

417
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:27,551
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

418
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:29,203
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

419
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:30,770
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't

420
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:32,815
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

421
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:34,347
And most of
the guys around here are

422
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,134
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

423
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:37,870
So what do you do?

424
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,907
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

425
00:44:42,108 --> 00:44:43,154
Yeah.

426
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:46,151
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

427
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,770
I tear it up.

428
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:49,438
That's my thing.

429
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,592
Yo.

430
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:55,235
<i>You should
slow it down papi</i>

431
00:44:55,378 --> 00:44:57,101
<i>You sound like
a carbon copy</i>

432
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,758
Sean!

433
00:44:58,944 --> 00:45:00,952
<i>But you're
just plain sloppy</i>

434
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:04,404
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

435
00:45:07,077 --> 00:45:08,671
<i>It's dipset Bitch</i>

436
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:13,576
<i>There it go
Baby don't stop now</i>

437
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:19,984
<i>There you go
Damn shorty look good</i>

438
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:21,605
<i>And I'm thinkin' about
gettin' at her</i>

439
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:23,238
<i>Okay,
time to whistle at her</i>

440
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:28,112
<i>Ay girl,
you make my whistle blow</i>

441
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:30,037
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

442
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:32,236
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

443
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,604
<i>Top down
and I'm at it again</i>

444
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:36,404
<i>It's hot now
and I'm at it to win</i>

445
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:37,788
<i>You heard me</i>

446
00:45:37,912 --> 00:45:38,894
<i>Who want it with me</i>

447
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:40,988
<i>Nobody wanna it with me
Oh, I'm so fly</i>

448
00:45:41,146 --> 00:45:42,193
<i>Oh, Mami, Back up</i>

449
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,653
<i>Move it till you feel
something hard on your back</i>

450
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:45,434
The red Evo's yours.

451
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:47,815
<i>If u want it come and get it
I ain't kiddin' I'm with it</i>

452
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:49,570
<i>Here it go, go</i>

453
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:54,350
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

454
00:45:54,614 --> 00:45:56,554
<i>There it go
Yeah, just like that</i>

455
00:45:57,512 --> 00:45:59,071
What do you mean?

456
00:45:59,943 --> 00:46:01,503
You're representing
me now.

457
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:04,066
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

458
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,833
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

459
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:31,624
Oh, man.

460
00:46:37,215 --> 00:46:38,165
Damn it.

461
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:45,790
My mother,
she's blind in one eye

462
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,704
and she can drift
better than that.

463
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:52,418
Han,
where did you find this guy?

464
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:56,331
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

465
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:21,578
Is that yours?

466
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:23,860
Sure is.

467
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,691
What happened?

468
00:47:34,013 --> 00:47:37,275
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

469
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:42,821
It's got potential.

470
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:50,018
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

471
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:57,600
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

472
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:03,221
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered. "

473
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:09,073
You're gonna be late.

474
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:21,862
Sean!

475
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:45,704
Come on, man, you broke it.

476
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:52,031
Hey, whoa, whoa.

477
00:48:53,115 --> 00:48:55,188
There must be
a misunderstanding.

478
00:48:55,952 --> 00:48:58,984
Out of my way,
or you're next.

479
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:00,200
Take it easy.

480
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:02,037
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

481
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:04,388
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

482
00:49:04,783 --> 00:49:06,159
Touch me again...

483
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:10,967
Here.

484
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,059
Try not to break
this one.

485
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:29,465
Say, man!

486
00:49:29,584 --> 00:49:31,078
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

487
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,934
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

488
00:49:34,117 --> 00:49:35,167
Damn!

489
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,022
Not easy saving the day,
is it?

490
00:49:50,883 --> 00:49:53,667
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

491
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:55,443
You're doing
all right.

492
00:49:56,617 --> 00:49:57,766
Thanks.

493
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:02,332
Hey.

494
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:04,635
Yeah?

495
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,758
Sorry about the other night.

496
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:10,691
Your life isn't
any of my business.

497
00:50:12,386 --> 00:50:13,697
It's okay.

498
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:37,100
Foul!

499
00:50:38,057 --> 00:50:39,777
Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.

500
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,263
Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.

501
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:43,812
Hey, Han,
sort this wanker out.

502
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:45,165
A wanker?

503
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:47,427
What do I look like,
a zebra?

504
00:50:54,224 --> 00:50:56,679
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

505
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,224
Well, you know
those old Westerns

506
00:51:01,022 --> 00:51:03,805
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

507
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:08,212
This is my Mexico.

508
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:14,410
Why'd you let me
race with your car?

509
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,796
You knew
I was gonna wreck it.

510
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:18,666
Why not?

511
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,964
'Cause it's a lot of money.

512
00:51:22,157 --> 00:51:23,562
I have money.

513
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:27,704
It's trust and character
I need around me.

514
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,466
You know, who you
choose to be around you

515
00:51:31,624 --> 00:51:33,563
lets you know
who you are.

516
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:37,282
And one car in exchange
for knowing

517
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:39,081
what a man's made of,

518
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:41,794
that's a price
I can live with.

519
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:48,546
Look at all those
people down there.

520
00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:51,561
They follow the rules,
for what?

521
00:51:52,924 --> 00:51:55,127
They're letting
fear lead them.

522
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,164
What happens if they don't?

523
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:01,997
Life's simple.

524
00:52:02,424 --> 00:52:04,598
You make choices
and you don't look back.

525
00:52:19,257 --> 00:52:20,851
<i>So,
if you don't drift to win,</i>

526
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:22,880
<i>what do you drift for?</i>

527
00:52:23,425 --> 00:52:24,603
<i>You really
want to know?</i>

528
00:52:24,794 --> 00:52:26,002
<i>Yeah.</i>

529
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:28,352
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

530
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:48,181
<i>There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.</i>

531
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,068
Learn by doin' it.

532
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,522
The first drifters
invented drifting

533
00:53:52,661 --> 00:53:54,353
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

534
00:53:55,563 --> 00:53:56,874
So feel it.

535
00:54:09,461 --> 00:54:10,575
Again!

536
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:14,141
What's in this bag?

537
00:54:14,763 --> 00:54:15,777
You'll see.

538
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:17,703
How much you got?

539
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:19,204
Keep going, keep going.

540
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:27,883
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

541
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,911
Again.

542
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,211
Again.

543
00:55:06,698 --> 00:55:09,415
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

544
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:17,131
Go, go, go, go!

545
00:55:28,562 --> 00:55:30,383
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

546
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,644
Hey, Han.

547
00:56:22,065 --> 00:56:25,362
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

548
00:57:40,268 --> 00:57:41,892
Pleasure doing business.

549
00:57:45,803 --> 00:57:48,671
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

550
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:30,259
It's actually not bad.

551
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:32,295
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

552
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:35,477
<i>See,
I'm not a total gaijin.</i>

553
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:38,797
I hate that word.

554
00:58:39,304 --> 00:58:41,279
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

555
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,977
I thought
you were born here.

556
00:58:45,137 --> 00:58:48,103
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

557
00:58:53,536 --> 00:58:55,477
My mom died when I was 10.

558
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,500
She came out here
from Australia

559
00:58:58,638 --> 00:59:00,230
when she
finished high school.

560
00:59:00,505 --> 00:59:01,781
And all I know
about her is that

561
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:04,489
she went to work
in a hostess bar.

562
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:09,778
DK's grandmother took me in.

563
00:59:13,004 --> 00:59:15,786
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

564
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,800
Me and Mom
moved around a lot.

565
00:59:19,674 --> 00:59:21,364
Mostly 'cause of me.

566
00:59:22,438 --> 00:59:24,676
Well,
it was all 'cause of me.

567
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:29,070
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

568
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:31,605
without even
thinking about it.

569
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:34,917
But I realize now,

570
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,340
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

571
00:59:38,602 --> 00:59:41,571
All that matters is knowing
what you really want

572
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:44,331
and going after it.

573
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:07,190
We used to come up here
when we were kids.

574
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,969
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

575
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:13,629
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

576
01:00:20,439 --> 01:00:22,380
Things were different
back then.

577
01:00:26,508 --> 01:00:29,223
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

578
01:00:29,939 --> 01:00:32,396
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

579
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:33,885
You know, we just made do.

580
01:00:34,076 --> 01:00:35,283
No one bothered us.

581
01:00:36,774 --> 01:00:38,235
The day I got my license

582
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:40,762
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

583
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:43,245
The day after that,
I won my first race.

584
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,297
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

585
01:00:47,408 --> 01:00:50,026
I gotta admit, it felt good.

586
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,185
It felt like...

587
01:00:53,508 --> 01:00:55,650
Like everything else
just disappears.

588
01:00:57,739 --> 01:00:59,169
No past and no future.

589
01:00:59,777 --> 01:01:01,239
No problems.

590
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:04,802
Just the moment.

591
01:01:28,372 --> 01:01:29,937
Boy needs to chill.

592
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:34,615
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

593
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:36,950
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

594
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:39,796
No. Look, that was
your third set today.

595
01:01:39,977 --> 01:01:41,916
I mean,
them tires ain't cheap.

596
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,467
DK, grab a chair.

597
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:55,334
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

598
01:01:56,442 --> 01:01:58,101
Yo, come on, man, look...

599
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:12,168
Stay away from her,

600
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:15,609
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

601
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:23,502
Find yourself a new driver.

602
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,458
I'm all right.

603
01:02:37,946 --> 01:02:39,060
What'd you expect?

604
01:02:39,612 --> 01:02:40,920
You didn't just
play with fire,

605
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:42,735
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

606
01:03:06,646 --> 01:03:07,923
It's over.

607
01:03:28,716 --> 01:03:30,242
<i>All this over a gaijin?</i>

608
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:31,971
<i>I am a gaijin.</i>

609
01:03:34,948 --> 01:03:36,606
You've changed, DK.

610
01:03:42,046 --> 01:03:43,771
You say I've changed.

611
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:48,697
But we're not so different,
you and I.

612
01:03:50,078 --> 01:03:52,797
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

613
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:02,044
They say your mom
was the best trick

614
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:04,668
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

615
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:06,875
Leave my mother
out of this.

616
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:10,277
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

617
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:13,257
doing anything
for a buck.

618
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,138
Think anyone would take
a second look at you

619
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,690
if it wasn't
for your uncle?

620
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:33,838
We're the same, Neela.

621
01:04:37,815 --> 01:04:40,847
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

622
01:04:46,885 --> 01:04:48,769
Do you know
who you are?

623
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:55,031
Do you know
where you belong?

624
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:15,432
Hey.

625
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:21,692
Come on.

626
01:09:06,491 --> 01:09:07,699
Hey, brother.

627
01:09:08,757 --> 01:09:10,002
I vouched for you!

628
01:09:10,124 --> 01:09:12,012
Put my reputation
on the line for you!

629
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,498
We were partners!

630
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:16,706
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

631
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:19,674
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

632
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:21,701
This is what we do.

633
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,007
Takashi!

634
01:09:30,228 --> 01:09:32,266
What about now? Hmm?

635
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:35,551
Is this what we do?

636
01:09:37,157 --> 01:09:38,716
Man, you need me.

637
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:40,781
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses

638
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,354
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

639
01:09:52,294 --> 01:09:53,405
Get in!

640
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:54,802
Go! Go! Go!

641
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,101
Come on.

642
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:22,940
Sean. Sean!

643
01:16:08,571 --> 01:16:09,520
Takashi.

644
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,977
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

645
01:16:31,471 --> 01:16:32,519
Okay.

646
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:35,114
I'll go with you.

647
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:36,786
Neela.

648
01:16:47,872 --> 01:16:50,107
See you when
Daddy's not around.

649
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:14,848
I'm putting you
on a plane tonight.

650
01:17:14,972 --> 01:17:15,987
Dad...

651
01:17:16,105 --> 01:17:17,480
Sean, don't argue with me.

652
01:17:17,605 --> 01:17:20,288
I did this.
I can't run away.

653
01:17:21,572 --> 01:17:22,554
I can't.

654
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:24,233
Sean,
I'm your father.

655
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,229
I'm responsible
for your well-being.

656
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:28,848
And I'm responsible
for my mess.

657
01:17:32,071 --> 01:17:33,794
I gotta do this.

658
01:17:36,075 --> 01:17:37,961
Can you understand that?

659
01:17:54,075 --> 01:17:56,691
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

660
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:27,168
You all right, man?

661
01:18:31,142 --> 01:18:32,670
We're leaving town.

662
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,970
Look, I know some people...

663
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:38,265
I can't do it, Twink.

664
01:18:39,276 --> 01:18:42,244
Look, DK wants your head.

665
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:44,520
All right?

666
01:18:45,008 --> 01:18:46,983
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

667
01:18:48,277 --> 01:18:50,251
You're done here, bro.

668
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:53,401
Maybe I should
talk to Kamata.

669
01:18:54,705 --> 01:18:56,269
What?

670
01:18:56,808 --> 01:18:58,402
DK answers to him.

671
01:19:01,244 --> 01:19:03,448
I know I just
didn't hear that.

672
01:19:05,545 --> 01:19:08,803
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

673
01:19:09,009 --> 01:19:10,920
What, are you crazy, huh?

674
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,735
Han is dead, all right!

675
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:15,747
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

676
01:19:19,006 --> 01:19:20,472
It's all I got.

677
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:30,176
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

678
01:19:44,879 --> 01:19:46,218
What's this?

679
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:49,039
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it

680
01:19:49,246 --> 01:19:51,319
out of Kamata's place
alive.

681
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:57,005
Don't you need it?

682
01:19:58,776 --> 01:20:02,126
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

683
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:13,161
Sean.

684
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,509
You need to leave.

685
01:21:19,914 --> 01:21:21,953
You came to the wrong place.

686
01:21:22,213 --> 01:21:24,352
I didn't come here
to see you.

687
01:21:24,845 --> 01:21:26,022
Takashi.

688
01:21:54,683 --> 01:21:55,893
You think

689
01:21:57,016 --> 01:22:01,358
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

690
01:22:03,683 --> 01:22:05,509
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you

691
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:07,537
in the first place, sir.

692
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,319
But that's not
why I really came.

693
01:22:12,114 --> 01:22:14,024
I came here
to apologize.

694
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,832
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

695
01:22:31,953 --> 01:22:35,564
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

696
01:22:38,351 --> 01:22:40,716
How do you plan
to accomplish that?

697
01:22:42,251 --> 01:22:43,363
A race.

698
01:22:48,653 --> 01:22:51,432
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

699
01:22:51,748 --> 01:22:53,158
for us.

700
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:56,719
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

701
01:22:56,884 --> 01:22:58,829
once and for all.

702
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:01,463
We race

703
01:23:03,284 --> 01:23:05,289
and the loser leaves town
for good.

704
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:08,165
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

705
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:09,500
Good.

706
01:23:10,517 --> 01:23:12,850
Then it should be easy.

707
01:23:51,153 --> 01:23:53,163
The cops
took all the cars.

708
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:54,766
Hey!

709
01:25:11,554 --> 01:25:13,179
That's why she's spitting.

710
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:38,013
We almost there, Twink.

711
01:25:38,223 --> 01:25:39,846
Couple more tweaks.

712
01:25:41,454 --> 01:25:43,724
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

713
01:25:45,219 --> 01:25:47,109
DK picked this road
for a reason.

714
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:49,213
This is his mountain.

715
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:54,188
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

716
01:29:48,063 --> 01:29:49,178
Yeah!

717
01:29:56,128 --> 01:29:57,179
Yeah!

718
01:29:57,296 --> 01:29:58,341
Yes!

719
01:30:56,567 --> 01:30:57,550
Come on.

720
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,009
Yeah! Come on!

721
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,310
Come on, Sean.

722
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,710
Let's go! Let's go!

723
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:14,655
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

724
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:45,038
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

725
01:33:55,074 --> 01:33:56,021
Yeah, baby!

726
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,252
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

727
01:33:57,372 --> 01:33:58,681
I told you!

728
01:34:42,673 --> 01:34:46,058
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

729
01:34:46,275 --> 01:34:49,790
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

730
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:52,109
<i>Fast and furious</i>

731
01:34:52,273 --> 01:34:53,736
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

732
01:34:53,873 --> 01:34:56,111
<i>Fast and furious</i>

733
01:34:56,276 --> 01:34:58,129
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

734
01:35:03,274 --> 01:35:05,283
Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!

735
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,698
Hey, check this out, man.

736
01:35:08,075 --> 01:35:10,791
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

737
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:14,594
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

738
01:35:14,774 --> 01:35:16,531
Not tonight, Twinkie.

739
01:35:20,075 --> 01:35:21,635
Said he knew Han.

740
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:30,003
Said Han was family.

741
01:35:44,074 --> 01:35:45,355
All right.

742
01:35:45,809 --> 01:35:46,855
Let's race.

743
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:15,389
Nice ride.

744
01:36:15,911 --> 01:36:18,778
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

745
01:36:20,973 --> 01:36:23,560
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

746
01:36:23,741 --> 01:36:26,131
He was when
he was rolling with me.

747
01:36:28,846 --> 01:36:31,208
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

748
01:36:31,776 --> 01:36:33,599
I got nothing but time.

749
01:36:37,276 --> 01:36:38,739
You ready, kid?

750
01:36:49,681 --> 01:36:51,270
Come on, Sean! Come on!

751
01:36:53,378 --> 01:36:54,493
Ready!

752
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:58,657
Set!

753
01:37:03,012 --> 01:37:04,126
Go!
