1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,726
To understand what I'm about to
tell you, you need to do something first.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,770
You need to believe in the impossible.
Can you do that?

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,764
Good. You see that red blur? That's me.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,041
That too.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,601
There I am again.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,524
My name is Barry Allen.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,808
I am the fastest man alive.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,004
My story is pretty simple.
My whole life, I've been running.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,286
Usually from bullies.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,851
Sometimes I escaped.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,967
Sometimes I did not.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,360
Tell me what happened.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,528
Those guys were picking on kids...

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,843
...just because they thought
they weren't cool. It wasn't right.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,651
- I know.
- I guess I wasn't fast enough.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,043
No. You have such a good heart, Barry.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,806
And it's better to have a good heart
than fast legs.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,687
Hello? I'm home.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,127
- Barry got into a fight.
- Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,248
And he won.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,925
Way to go, Slugger-

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,245
Oh, and no more fighting.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,529
But after that night, I was running
from something much scarier.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,331
- Henry! Henry!
- Something I could never explain.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,289
Something impossible.

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,005
- Mom! Morn!
- Barry, don't!

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,441
- Get back!
- Mom!

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,561
- Mom!
- Ah!

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,484
MQfn!

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,290
- Nora!
- Stay back!

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,010
Nora, hold on!

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,405
Run, Barry. Run!

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,491
Mom?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,081
Dad?

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,206
Sorry.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,404
Second robbery this week.

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,961
The teller lD'd Clyde
Mardon as the shooter.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,044
What? Oh, jeez,
the Mardon brothers are back?

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,480
What do we got?

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,007
Perps took the bank,
shot out the cameras...

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,089
...and killed the security guard there.

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,891
I got unis kicking in doors
of their known associates.

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,050
- CSI been over it?
- No.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,567
Where's Allen?

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,484
Unh! Sorry, 80")'-

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,001
- You can't keep covering for him.
- Coming through.

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,369
- I have to carry on without him.
- Sorry I'm late, Captain Singh.

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,370
What was it this time?
Forget to set your alarm clock?

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,530
Before you answer, the excuse you gave
last time was car trouble.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,762
Wanna know why that one was memorable?

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,890
- I do not own a car.
- He was running an errand for me.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,929
Barry, did you get me what I asked for?

53
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,969
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

54
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,164
I have it right...

55
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,607
...here.

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,091
I had a few bites of it.

57
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,089
Getaway car is a Mustang Shelby GT500.

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,562
Shelbys have a rear super-wide tire
specific to that model.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,643
Twelve inches with an asymmetrical tread.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,768
And there's something else.

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,480
Thanks.

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,567
Fecal excrement. Animal, I'd guess.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,927
My dad gave me that pen...

64
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,923
...before he died.

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,330
Sorry.

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,526
Okay, I am ready to see this
atom smasher... Smashing.

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,330
There was a shooting today.

68
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,568
Your dad needs me
to process some evidence.

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,690
I don't know if we're gonna make it
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,047
Seeing this thing turn on is, like,
your dream.

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,562
Your sad little, nerdy dream.
Besides, I canceled a date for this.

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,643
Hands off my fries.

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,211
Unbelievable.

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,284
I'm stress eating over my dissertation.

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,125
We started selling cronuts at Jitters.
I ate two today.

76
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,443
If I don't graduate soon,
I'm gonna be more muffin top than woman.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,965
You look amazing.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,282
What is so important
about this particle accelerator, anyway?

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,809
Harrison Wells' work in Quantum Theory
is light-years ahead of anything at CERN.

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,440
You're not speaking English.

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,681
Okay.

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,604
Just imagine...

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,290
...that that dot is everything the human
race has ever learned until this moment.

84
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,566
That include twerking?

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,849
That is everything we could learn
from the particle accelerator.

86
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,769
It's a new way of looking at physics.

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,606
It will literally change the way
that we think about everything.

88
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,569
You've gotta get a girlfriend.

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,246
- Hey, leave him alone. He's working.
- Hi, Dad.

90
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,483
Your test thingy is done.

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,642
The Mardon brothers are hiding on a farm.

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,451
The fecal matter I found on the street
was cow manure...

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,962
...which contained traces of
Oxytetracycline. It's an antibiotic.

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,847
There are only four farms in the area
that still use it in their feed.

95
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,244
Bet you find a really sweet Shelby
parked at one of them.

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,807
Dad, seeing as how Barry solved
your poop problem...

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,247
...how about letting him
go to S.T.A.R. Labs?

98
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,049
- Fine, go.
- Yes.

99
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,807
Thank you, Joe.

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,442
So, Barry, how was your trip? Did you find
proof of the impossible in Starling City?

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,888
Or did you just make my dad mad
for no reason?

102
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,682
Actually, while I was away,
I had a chance to think about...

103
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,241
...you know, relationships.

104
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,246
How I'm not in one...

105
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,728
...and you're not in one, either.

106
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,566
- And you're my best friend, Iris.
- You're mine too.

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,006
Why else would I be here?

108
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,204
- That's not what I meant. What...
- I know what you're gonna say.

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,566
I'm not sure you do.

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,929
Even though we pretty much grew up
in the same house together...

111
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,487
...and we're kind of like
brother and sister...

112
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,644
...because we're not brother and sister,
it can get really...

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,609
...weird to talk to me about girls.

114
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,525
But I just want you to know
that it shouldn't be awkward.

115
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,889
There is nothing I want more
than for you to meet the right person...

116
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,364
...that totally loves and adores you
for the amazing guy that you are.

117
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,529
Took the words right out of my mouth.

118
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,490
Aren't you glad I know you so well?

119
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,004
Thank you.

120
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,563
My name is Harrison Wells.

121
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,008
Tonight, the future begins.

122
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,686
The work my team and I will do here...

123
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,968
...will change our understanding
of physics...

124
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,282
...will bring about
advancements in power...

125
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,365
...advancements in medicine.

126
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,570
And trust me, that future
will be here faster than you think.

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,846
No! Hey, my laptop.
It's got my dissertation.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,490
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,091
All right, kid,
you don't have to do this, all right?

130
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,449
Just give me back my friend's bag,
and we'll call it even.

131
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,770
Okay?

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,161
Barry.

133
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,081
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

134
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,325
Freeze! Police!

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,201
Or do you want to find out the hard way
you're not faster than a bullet?

136
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,808
Who is that guy,
and what is he so proud of?

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,930
- So he caught a mugger.
- He's a transfer from Keystone.

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,321
Started a few weeks ago. Eddie Thawne.

139
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,802
Oh, that's Detective Pretty Boy.

140
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,603
That's what my dad calls him.

141
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,923
Says he actually keeps score
when it comes to arrests.

142
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,486
He is pretty, though.

143
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,848
This is the last farm on Barry's list.

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,925
Look, I know the kid's smart,
but you said it yourself...

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,004
...sometimes he's chasing flying pigs.

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,401
Well, let's check it out anyway.

147
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,291
I'm Linda Park,
and we're live outside S.T.A.R. Labs...

148
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,966
...despite the weather,
which will only get worse.

149
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,567
The torrential downpour has in no way
affected the particle accelerator...

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,123
...which is running smoothly according to
S. T.A.R. Lab CEO Harrison Wells.

151
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,323
- Whoa.
- Mardon.

152
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,009
I've got a plane to catch.

153
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,925
What the hell?

154
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,331
- Unh.
- Chyre, hang in there.

155
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,850
Wait, we are now being told
to evacuate the facility.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,844
The storm caused a malfunction
to the primary cooling system.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,288
Officials are now trying to shut down
the particle accelerator...

158
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,171
...but so far have been unable
to regain control of the...

159
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,729
- What happened to him?
- Hit by lightning.

160
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,251
How's he still alive?

161
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,607
Go.

162
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,962
No heartbeat.
CBC Chem 24, type and cross four.

163
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,168
- Bag him.
- You can't be in here.

164
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,970
- I'm family.
- Charge paddles.

165
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,281
- Barry!
- Clear.

166
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,651
What are you doing?

167
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,771
- He likes this song.
- How could you possibly know that?

168
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,730
I checked his Facebook page.
I mean, he can hear everything, right?

169
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,124
Auditory functions are
the last sensory faculties to degenerate.

170
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,887
Can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

171
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,810
- Oh, my God.
- Where am I?

172
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,804
- He's up.
- Dr. Wells, get down to the Cortex now.

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,089
BP 170 over 110, pulse 120.
Pupils equally reactive to light.

174
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,490
Look at me. Look at me
Whoa, whoa. Relax.

175
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,689
Everything's okay, man.
You're at S.T.A.R. Labs.

176
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,444
S.T.A.R. Labs? Who are you?

177
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,649
I'm Cisco Ramon. She's Caitlin... Dr. Snow.

178
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,565
- I need you to urinate in this.
- Not this second.

179
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,361
- What is happening? What is going on?
- You were struck by lightning, dude.

180
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,967
What?

181
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,089
- Lightning gave me abs?
- Your muscles should be atrophied...

182
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,847
...but instead they're in a chronic state
of cellular regeneration.

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,604
Come here. Have a seat.

184
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,845
You were in a coma.

185
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,488
- For how long?
- Nine months.

186
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,168
Welcome back, Mr. Allen.

187
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,646
We have a lot to discuss.

188
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,925
It's hard to believe I'm here. I've
always wanted to meet you face-to-face.

189
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,050
Yeah? Well, you certainly went
to great lengths to do it.

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,487
S.T.A.R. Labs has not been operational...

191
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,487
...since FEMA categorized us
as a Class 4 hazardous location.

192
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,287
Seventeen people died that night,
many more injured...

193
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,249
...myself amongst them.

194
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,524
Jesus.

195
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,485
What happened?

196
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,202
Nine months ago, the particle accelerator
went online exactly as planned.

197
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,445
For 45 minutes, I had achieved
my life's dream. And then...

198
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,251
Then there was an anomaly.

199
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,927
The electron volts became unmeasurable,
the ring under us popped.

200
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,606
Energy from that detonation
was thrown into the sky...

201
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,922
...and that, in turn,
seeded a storm cloud...

202
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,050
That created a lightning
bolt that struck me.

203
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,280
That's right.

204
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,891
I was recovering myself...

205
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,530
...when I heard about you.

206
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,411
The hospital was undergoing
unexplainable power outages...

207
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,927
...every time you were going
into cardiac arrest...

208
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,923
...which was actually a misdiagnosis...

209
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,209
...because, you see,
you weren't flatlining, Barry.

210
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,161
Your heartbeat was moving too fast
for the EKG to register it.

211
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,403
Now, I'm not the most popular person
in town these days...

212
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,400
...but Detective West and his daughter
gave me permission to bring you here...

213
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,921
...where we were able to stabilize you.

214
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,491
- Iris?
- lris, yes.

215
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,369
She came to see you quite often.

216
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,171
- She talks a lot.
- Also, she's hot.

217
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,250
- I need to go.
- No. You can't.

218
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,290
Caitlin's right. Now that you're awake,
we need to do tests.

219
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,649
You're still going through changes.
There's so much we don't know.

220
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,566
I'm fine, really. I feel normal.
Thank you for saving my life.

221
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,246
Really?

222
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,725
Can I keep the sweatshirt?

223
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,089
- Yeah, keep the sweatshirt.
- Okay.

224
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,565
- Right?
- Sure.

225
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,888
- Fill her up?
- Thanks.

226
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,484
Oh, my God.

227
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,724
You're awake.
Why didn't S.T.A.R. Labs call us?

228
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,245
I just woke up.

229
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,368
- Should you even be on your feet?
- lris...

230
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
...I'm okay.

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,570
I watched you die, Barry.

232
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,886
You kept dying. Your heart kept stopping.

233
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,086
It's still beating.

234
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,321
It feels really fast.

235
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,406
Oops.

236
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,722
- Are you okay, Tracy?
- Yeah, I got it.

237
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,331
My dad is gonna be so happy to see you.

238
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,767
Let me get my stuff, okay?
I'll be right back.

239
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,330
Thank you. Thank you so much.
How can I help you today?

240
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,406
"This is a robbery."

241
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,043
- Is this supposed to be a joke?
- You tell me.

242
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,164
Oh, you scared the hell out of us, kid.

243
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,601
That was quite the nap you took there,
baby face.

244
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,127
And you still look 12.
Heh-heh-heh.

245
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,891
You look okay. Are you really?

246
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,449
- Yeah.
- Detective West...

247
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,807
...we got a 550 in progress
at Gold City Bank.

248
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,606
Two dead.
Storm's picking up on the south side.

249
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,603
- I'd grab rain gear.
- Sorry, I gotta run.

250
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,168
- Do you need my help...?
- No, you take it easy.

251
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,210
There'll be plenty for you to do
once you settle in. Let's go.

252
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,970
Hey, Allen...

253
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,360
...glad to see you.

254
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,290
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, Iris.

255
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,603
Detective, you should go.
My dad doesn't like to be kept waiting.

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,048
Glad you're back.

257
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,490
The night of the explosion,
Clyde Mardon shot Chyre.

258
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,484
Mardon and his brother died escaping.
Their plane crashed.

259
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,440
- Iris. Got a minute?
- Hey, Barry. Good to see you.

260
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,641
Screw you!

261
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,365
You okay?

262
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,407
I'm fine. I just need some air.

263
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,688
But I'll call you tonight, all right?

264
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,609
What's happening to me?

265
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,647
Awesome.

266
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,051
You don't believe
he can run that fast, do you?

267
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,331
Well, I believe anything is possible,
and in a few minutes maybe you will too.

268
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,006
How does it fit?

269
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,326
It's a little snug.

270
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,803
At least you'll be moving so fast,
no one will see you.

271
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,289
See, you thought
the world was slowing down. It wasn't.

272
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,490
You were moving so fast, it only looked
like everyone else was standing still.

273
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,045
Dr. Wells will be monitoring
your energy output and Caitlin your vitals.

274
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,645
What do you do?

275
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,041
I make the toys, man.

276
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,807
Check it. This is a two-way headset
with a camera I modified...

277
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,928
...designed to combat
battlefield impulse noise.

278
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,242
Or in your case, potential sonic booms.

279
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,965
Which would be awesome.

280
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,847
What?

281
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,329
Nothing.

282
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,683
I just notice you don't smile too much.

283
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,045
My once promising career
in bioengineering is over.

284
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,362
My boss is in a wheelchair for life.

285
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,763
The explosion that put you in a coma
also killed my fiancé.

286
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,723
So this blank expression
kind of feels like the way to go.

287
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,362
Mr. Allen, while I am extremely eager to
determine your full range of abilities...

288
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,881
...I do caution restraint.

289
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,641
Yeah.

290
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,369
Whoo-hoo!

291
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,325
He passed 200 knots per hour.

292
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,049
It's not possible.

293
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,680
MQfn!

294
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,649
- No, Barry!
- Mom!

295
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,485
Don't! Don't let him touch you!

296
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,686
Ah!

297
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,927
What is all this?

298
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,128
Witnesses from the robbery
at Gold City Bank.

299
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,044
Perp made off with 200 grand.

300
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,521
- Catch these guys.
- The windows blew in.

301
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,126
It was like a hurricane.

302
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,203
Everyone ran for cover.

303
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,802
We're gonna have a sketch artist work
with you, if you feel up to it.

304
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,525
Third robbery in a month
where a freak storm proceeds it.

305
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,684
Sounds like one of those Wide World
of Weird cases Barry's obsessed with.

306
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,081
- He's not obsessed.
- Guess you haven't read his blog.

307
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,130
- Security cameras at the bank?
- Apparently all shorted out.

308
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,442
Well, we got a bunch of witnesses here.

309
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,728
They all have cell phones.

310
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,244
The sky went black and then, boom,
outside was inside.

311
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
It was like there was
a thunderstorm in the bank.

312
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,930
Vukuvich, suspect is driving
a black Mustang...

313
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,731
...partial plate six-kilo-Charlie-three.

314
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,723
- Put out an APB.
- Copy that.

315
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,691
It looks like you had a
distal radius fracture.

316
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,887
Had?

317
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,161
It's healed. In three hours.

318
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,600
How is that even possible?

319
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,882
We don't know. Yet.

320
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,244
You really need to learn how to stop.

321
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,723
What happened out there today?

322
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,362
You were moving pretty well and then
something caused you to lose focus.

323
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,401
I started remembering something.

324
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,683
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

325
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,405
It was late.

326
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,441
The sound woke me up.

327
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,241
I came downstairs...

328
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,931
...and I saw what looked
like a ball of lightning.

329
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,446
Inside the lightning...

330
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,125
...there was a man.

331
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,248
He killed my mom.

332
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,687
They arrested my dad.

333
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,605
He's still sitting in Iron Heights
for her murder.

334
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,965
Everyone, the cops, the shrinks,
they all told me what I saw was impossible.

335
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,921
But what if the man who killed my mom
was like me?

336
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,490
Well, I think I can say unequivocally,
you are one of a kind.

337
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,882
Can I help you, detective?

338
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,487
You can stop acting like you can't stand me
when your dad's around.

339
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,089
Aw. I like having a boyfriend
who isn't shot to death.

340
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,808
You can't tell my dad.
He doesn't know about me and Eddie.

341
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,042
Doesn't seem like anyone's
in on the secret.

342
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,565
I was gonna tell you.

343
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,845
When you were in the hospital...

344
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,004
...Eddie covered my father's shifts
so we could both be with you.

345
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,405
I thanked him with a cup of coffee,
and things just kind of happened.

346
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,046
And it's good.

347
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,686
Dating your partner's daughter.
Isn't that against department regulations?

348
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,050
- Why are you so upset?
- I just don't like having to lie to your dad.

349
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,760
Barry?

350
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,210
Hey! Mardon!

351
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,007
That poor man.

352
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,050
The way that fog came in,
I have never seen anything like it.

353
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,804
Barry! Iris.

354
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,567
I'm all right, Dad.

355
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,808
What were you thinking,
having her out here?

356
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,486
I told you, when you see danger,
you run the other way.

357
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,569
- You're not a cop.
- You wouldn't let me.

358
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,324
- Damn right!
- We need to talk.

359
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,522
- It can wait.
- No, now.

360
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,526
I know who did this.

361
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,450
It's Clyde Mardon.
I know, everybody thinks he died...

362
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,888
...in a plane crash after the S.T.A.R.
Labs explosion, but he's alive.

363
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,364
Something happened to him that night. I...

364
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,168
I think he can control the weather.

365
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,251
The recent robberies, they all happened
during freak meteorological events.

366
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,769
And when I just confronted Mardon,
the street was instantly enveloped in fog.

367
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,530
Of course you don't believe me.

368
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,407
- You never believe me.
- Okay.

369
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,288
You want to do this now? Out here?
Fine. Mardon is dead.

370
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,403
There is no controlling the weather.

371
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,530
Just like there was no lightning storm
in your house that night.

372
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,321
It was your brain helping a scared
little boy accept what he saw.

373
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,005
- My dad did not...
- Yes, he did!

374
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,885
Your dad killed your mother, Barry.
I am sorry, son.

375
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,725
I knew it, the jury knew it.
He's paying for what he did.

376
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,405
- Dad, enough.
- Iris.

377
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,801
I've done my best to take care of you
since that night.

378
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,480
I've never asked for anything in return.
Not even a thank-you.

379
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,488
But what I do ask now is that you for
once in your life see things as they are.

380
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,805
You're not gonna believe this.

381
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,009
We got the eyewitness sketch of the robber
from the bank job.

382
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,605
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

383
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,446
But that's impossible. He's dead, right?

384
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,971
I wasn't the only one affected by the
particle accelerator explosion, was I?

385
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,085
We don't know for sure.

386
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,323
You said the city was safe,
that there was no residual danger.

387
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,960
But that's not true.
What really happened that night?

388
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,170
Well, the accelerator went active.

389
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,203
We all felt like heroes, and then...

390
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,125
...it all went wrong.
The dimensional barrier ruptured...

391
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,328
...unleashing unknown energies
into our world.

392
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,682
Antimatter, dark energy, X-elements...

393
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,083
- Those are all theoretical.
- And how theoretical are you?

394
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,929
We mapped the dispersion throughout
and around Central City...

395
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,607
...though we have no way of knowing
exactly what or who was exposed.

396
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,765
We've been searching
for other meta-humans like yourself.

397
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,127
- "Meta-humans"?
- That's what we're calling them.

398
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,046
I saw one today. He's a bank robber.

399
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,565
He can control the weather.

400
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,088
- This just keeps getting cooler.
- This is not cool.

401
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,287
All right? A man died.

402
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,604
Mardon must have gotten his powers
the same way I did...

403
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,849
...from the storm cloud.
He's still out there.

404
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,321
We have to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

405
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,484
Barry. That's a job for the police.

406
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,086
- I work for the police.
- As a forensic assistant.

407
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,686
You're responsible for this. For him.

408
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,649
What's important is you.

409
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,641
Not me. I lost everything.

410
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,001
I lost my company. I lost my reputation.
I lost my freedom.

411
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,364
And then you broke your arm,
and it healed in three hours.

412
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,969
Inside your body could be a map
to a whole new world.

413
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,331
Genetic therapies, vaccines, medicines,
treasures buried deep within your cells.

414
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,008
And we cannot risk losing everything
because you want to go out and play hero.

415
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,682
You're not a hero.

416
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,006
You're just a young man
who was struck by lightning.

417
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,407
I didn't do it.
I swear to God, I didn't do this.

418
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,406
- Dad, why are they taking you?
- Don't go in the house.

419
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,483
- Where's Mom?
- What will happen to my son?

420
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,926
'Dad!
“Barry!

421
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,809
- Dad!
- Stay out of the house.

422
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,881
Barf)'-

423
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,690
Joe, you know these people?

424
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,323
- My daughter's best friends with their kid.
- I'm sorry.

425
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,404
Mom.

426
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,043
- Barry.
- Mom!

427
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,882
So that's my story. I've spent my
whole life searching for the impossible.

428
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:17,571
Never imagining that I would
become the impossible.

429
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,607
So why come to me?

430
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,084
Something tells me you didn't just run
600 miles to say hi to a friend.

431
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,408
All my life I've wanted...

432
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,881
...to just do more.

433
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,644
Be more.

434
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,081
And now I am.

435
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,687
And the first chance I get to help someone,
I screw up.

436
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,842
What if Wells is right?
What if I'm not a hero?

437
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,685
What if I'm just some guy
who was struck by lightning?

438
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,168
I don't think that bolt of lightning
struck you, Barry.

439
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,206
I think it chose you.

440
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,725
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

441
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,482
I don't know if I can be some vigilante.

442
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,002
You can be better.

443
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,285
Because you can inspire people...

444
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,323
...in a way that I never could.

445
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,001
Watching over your city
like a guardian angel.

446
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,805
Making a difference...

447
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,762
...saving people...

448
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,205
...in a flash.

449
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,842
Take your own advice.

450
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,046
Wear a mask.

451
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,961
Cool.

452
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,730
Cool.

453
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,970
I've been going over unsolved cases
from the past nine months.

454
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,920
And there's been a sharp increase
in unexplained deaths and missing people.

455
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,849
Your meta-humans have been busy.

456
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,362
I'm not blaming you. I know you didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

457
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,931
I know you all lost something.

458
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,446
But I need your help to catch Mardon
and anyone else out there like him.

459
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,886
I can't do it without you.

460
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,327
If we're gonna do this...

461
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,482
...I have something that might help.

462
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,008
Something I've been playing with.

463
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,642
It's designed to replace the turnouts
firefighters traditionally wear.

464
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,121
I thought if S.T.A.R. Labs
did something nice...

465
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,601
...maybe people wouldn't be so angry
at Dr. Wells.

466
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,330
How is it going to help me?

467
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,687
It's made of a reinforced tri-polymer.

468
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,129
It's heat and abrasive resistant to withstand
your moving at high-velocity speeds.

469
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,851
The aerodynamic design
should help you maintain control.

470
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,805
Plus, it has built-in sensors
so we can track your vitals...

471
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,526
...and stay in contact with you from here.
Thanks.

472
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,886
How do we find Mardon?

473
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,489
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
to track meteorological abnormalities.

474
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,166
We just got a ping.

475
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,847
Atmospheric pressure dropped 20 millibars
in a matter of seconds.

476
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,243
I've tracked it to a farm
just west of the city.

477
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,561
I'm not saying Mardon is alive...

478
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,044
...but if he was, this is the last place
him and his brother hid out. Let's go.

479
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,049
Mardon.

480
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,124
On your feet, hands on your head.

481
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,964
You got me. Heh.

482
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,846
The night of the storm,
after S.T.A.R. Labs blew...

483
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,002
...after our plane went down,
and I woke up on the ground alive...

484
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,891
...when I saw what I
could do, I understood.

485
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,527
- I am God.
- Shut the hell up.

486
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,205
Turn around.

487
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,769
Unh!

488
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,241
Do you think your guns can stop God?

489
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,846
Why in the hell
would God need to rob banks?

490
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,043
You're right. I've been thinking too small.

491
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,531
Whoa!

492
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,646
Barry. Barry, this thing's getting closer.

493
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,246
Wind speeds are 200 miles per hour
and increasing.

494
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,483
- Barry, can you hear me?
- Yeah. Loud and clear.

495
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,644
If it keeps up,
this could become an F-5 tornado.

496
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,171
And it's headed towards the city.
How do I stop it?

497
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,891
Guys?

498
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,205
- What if I unravel it?
- How are you gonna do that?

499
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,284
I'll run around it in the opposite
direction. Cut off its legs.

500
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,721
He'd have to clock 700 miles per hour
to do that.

501
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,565
You may not be able
to handle those speeds. You'll die.

502
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,521
I have to try.

503
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,765
- Ha, ha. Suit's holding up.
- But he's not.

504
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,724
He can do it. I know he can do it.

505
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,086
It's too strong.

506
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,650
It's time to think big.

507
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,406
You can do this, Barry.

508
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,730
You were right.
I am responsible for all of this.

509
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,690
So many people have been hurt
because of me.

510
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,811
When I looked at you, all I saw
was another potential victim of my hubris.

511
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,688
And yes, I created this madness.
But you, Barry, you can stop it.

512
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,962
You can do this.

513
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,647
Now run, Barry. Run!

514
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,926
Barry?

515
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,770
Hey.

516
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,881
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

517
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,929
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

518
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,730
Barry?
It's over.

519
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,001
I'm okay.

520
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,602
What you can do...

521
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,490
...it was the lightning bolt?

522
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,441
More or less.

523
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,482
I'm sorry, Barry.

524
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,489
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

525
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,321
And I called you crazy
for chasing the impossible.

526
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,971
But you really did see something
that night your mom died.

527
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,605
And your dad is innocent.

528
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,809
I need you to promise me something.

529
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,647
I don't want you telling Iris
about anything you can do.

530
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,928
Any of it. I want her safe.

531
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,605
Promise me.

532
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,206
Yeah.

533
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,444
Hey. Slugger.

534
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,841
You've been calling me that since I was 11.

535
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,001
Funny thing is
I finally got into a fight today.

536
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,963
You just got out of a coma,
I'm not sure you should be picking fights.

537
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,205
H9)'-

538
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,730
Did you win?

539
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,921
Yeah, I did.

540
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,521
You didn't kill Mom.

541
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,522
You know I know that, right?

542
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,370
You believing me is all I need.

543
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,209
You won't be in here much longer.

544
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,405
Whoever killed Mom...

545
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,244
...whatever killed her...

546
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,486
...I think I finally have a way
to find them, to stop them.

547
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,810
Barry, we've talked about this.

548
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,410
It's time to let it go.
You've got to stop worrying about me...

549
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,805
...and live your life.

550
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,245
For the first time, I
feel like I finally can.

551
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,248
The truth is, since the night Mom died,
I've been stuck in one place...

552
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,082
...missed out on a lot of things.

553
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,609
But I'm different now.

554
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,609
I made some new friends.

555
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,564
They're helping me find my way.

556
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,611
- Why is it shaped like a lightning bolt?
- So it's not boring.

557
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,928
To finally move forward.

558
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,606
You remember when you wanted me
to change my name...

559
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,890
...so I wouldn't have to deal
with people knowing you're my dad?

560
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,441
I'm glad they know.

561
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,286
I'm so proud to be your son.

562
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,562
I love you, son.

563
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,880
I love you too, Dad.

564
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,642
My name is Barry Allen...

565
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,882
...and I am the fastest man alive.

566
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,241
A friend recently gave me the idea
for a new name.

567
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,563
And something tells me it's gonna catch on.
