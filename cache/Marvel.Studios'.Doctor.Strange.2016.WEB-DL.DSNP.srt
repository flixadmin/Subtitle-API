(SOFTLY) Yes.

372
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,440
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

374
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,840

You helped him to walk again.

Yes.

377
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,840
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

378
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,760
Well, I didn't correct it.

379
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,280
He couldn't walk.

380
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,760
I convinced him that he could.

381
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,840
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

382
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
When you reattach a severed nerve...

383
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,440
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

384
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
It's the cells.

385
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,200
The cells are only programmed...

386
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,320
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

387
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,400
Right.

388
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,000
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

389
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,320
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

390
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,480
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

391
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,840
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

392
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Is that why you're working here?

393

Without a governing medical board?

394
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,280
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

395
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,320
Quite.

396
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,160
So, you've figured out a way...

397
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,520
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

398
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,080
No, Mr. Strange.

399
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,560

400
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,360

-Oh, no.

(CHUCKLES)

410
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,080

-Acupuncture, great.
-Yeah?

412

417
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,000

about healing through belief?

418
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,520

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
to see more, to know more.

422
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,400
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

423
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,440
in ways you can't imagine...

424
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,040
you reject the possibility.

425
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,680
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

426
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,400
about chakras or energy...

427
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160

you see through me, do you?

He offers immortality.

1162

It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

He feeds off it.

Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

Because you might not like them?

Because I'm not a killer?

These Zealots will snuff us all out...
