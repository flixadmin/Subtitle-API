1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,799
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:04,436
Cube in a cube. There's another solve.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,030
William and Mia,

4
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,507
give these coordinates to the team,

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,250
and then get the hell out of Star City.

6
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,827
And whatever you do,
don't come looking for me.

7
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:14,110
I know where these lead.

8
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:15,296
That's where.

9
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,666
We're going over the wall...

10
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:21,603
to The Glades.

11
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,930
I love you so much.

12
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,383
I love you so much.

13
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:09,735
I'll love you even more
when this baby's out of me.

14
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,238
Hyah!

15
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:18,619
Hyah!

16
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,979
You're ready.

17
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:43,930

18
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,516
Mom, I'm home!

19
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,691
Mrs. Carver had that
cheese you love so much

20
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,485
at the store,

21
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:54,047
the one that tastes
better than it smells.

22
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:57,217
Mom?

23
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,057
Mom.

24
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,904
- Hyah!
- Oh!

25
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:38,383
- Seriously, mom.
- Good instincts. Hi.

26
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,076
How is Mrs. Carver?

27
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,615
Uh, the usual.

28
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:43,932
She's had to tell me

29
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:45,620
everyone else's business in town,

30
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:48,112
and she's trying to
set me up with her son.

31
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:50,051
- Henry?
- No. The older one.

32
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:51,685
Oh, "Cowardly Lion" Seth?

33
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:53,589
Isn't he more scarecrow,
though? No brains?

34
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,924
Either way, not for you.

35
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,142
Where were you?

36
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:57,586
Well, I was on the phone.

37
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,070
A meeting with Smoak Tech.

38
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,981
Have you ever thought about
actually going in to work?

39
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:05,123
You know, we could get out
of Bloomfield, go to the city.

40
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:06,337
I could go with you.

41
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,928
Oh, you know the city's not safe for us.

42
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,839
If anyone ever found
out who your father is

43
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:10,898
or who you are...

44
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,946
Right. Right.

45
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,825
But I know how much
you love that company.

46
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:17,981
And I know how to protect
myself. You made sure of that.

47
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:19,119
I sure did.

48
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,981
So if dad's as big a hero as you say,

49
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,893
then why can't we just
tell everyone that?

50
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,427
It's not that simple, Mia.

51
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,830
You just have to trust
me on that. I'm sorry.

52
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,918
Hey, I was thinking
a vintage movie night.

53
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:33,629
A Jordan Peele marathon.

54
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,848
Yeah. Sure.

55
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,901
Hand over that cheese.

56
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:51,331
Shoot. Um... okay.

57
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:16,773
What the frak?

58
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,446
Intruder. Access denied.

59
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,508
Initiating self-destruct protocol.

60
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,720
Intruder...

61
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,513
Mia, what are you doing?

62
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,747
What am I doing? What are
you doing with all this?

63
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,592
Uh, I can explain in just one second.

64
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:55,094
7, 6, 5...

65
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:58,005
Access granted.

66
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,340
This is just a little something

67
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,026
that I've been working on on the side.

68
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,235
For Smoak Tech?

69
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,221
No, not exactly. Um...

70
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:08,224
There is a corrupt company in The Glades

71
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:10,684
that I am this close to exposing.

72
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:13,872
You're hacking again like Overwatch.

73
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,242
Oh, well, no, Overwatch
was part of a team, right?

74
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,036
Team Arrow. And this is solo.

75
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:20,242
So no team, no complications.

76
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:21,453
You're a vigilante.

77
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:22,905
No, not exactly.

78
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:26,200
Technically, yes, by definition...

79
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,910
How long have you been
hiding this from me?

80
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:28,961
- Mia...
- How long?

81
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:29,999
Mia, I can explain.

82
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,610
You realize I haven't
left this town ever?

83
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,968
I didn't get to go to
school like a normal kid.

84
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,712
I haven't even been to a real city.

85
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:37,751
I know.

86
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,839
You told me that we had to hide here

87
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:41,215
because dad was the Green Arrow.

88
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:42,319
That's true.

89
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:43,748
And now I find out
that you've been doing

90
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,545
the exact same thing the entire time.

91
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:47,289
No, your father and
I promised each other

92
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,815
that we would keep fighting for the city

93
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:52,035
to make the city better for you

94
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,320
and for... for our family.

95
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,790
I can't sit back and do nothing, Mia.

96
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,775
And yet that's exactly what
you're telling me to do.

97
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,536
No, I'm not. Mia, this is different.

98
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:02,619
- Is it?!
- Yes.

99
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,831
Because I'm starting to
believe what everyone else says,

100
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,067
that... vigilantes are
the opposite of heroes.

101
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,335
That is just propaganda...

102
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:10,929
Oh, says you.

103
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,717
And why should I believe
anything you say again?

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,776
Mia.

105
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,352
You've been lying to me my whole life.

106
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:18,728
I don't even know who you are.

107
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,582
Mom, I'm going to Star City,

108
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:33,309
and this time, you can't stop me.

109
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:36,621
I need to find out the
truth about everything...

110
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,148
About who our family really is,

111
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,335
what I'm meant to do with my life.

112
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:48,874
I can't be held back anymore.

113
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:51,960
I need to forge my own path.

114
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,183
What's the black star for?

115
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:57,429
My mom once told me that
all the starlight we see has

116
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:58,590
so far to travel

117
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:01,860
that the stars might
not even exist anymore.

118
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,314
Eventually, they all just
fade to black, erased.

119
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:11,514
That's where I want to be.

120
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:16,143
What's all that?

121
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,021
Prize fighting.

122
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,528
How much you make on that?

123
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,437
A few grand if you win.

124
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,967
I don't lose.

125
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,975
Of course you can do handstand push-ups.

126
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:41,973
Ready?

127
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:43,333
You mean to risk our lives

128
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,171
by sneaking into The Glades? No.

129
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:46,993
Not at all. You?

130
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:49,570
Don't have anything better to do.

131
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:55,976
Tell me again why we couldn't
just take the tunnels.

132
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:58,522
There's heat on the Canaries right now.

133
00:08:58,524 --> 00:08:59,999
The tunnels could be blown.

134
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,001
So we get to do this the hard way.

135
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:03,669
Are you coming or what?

136
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:07,155
Show-off.

137
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:13,679
This is gonna be a long night.

138
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,682
Great. Only 5 million more feet to go.

139
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,829
Rest up. Once we get in The Glades,

140
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:21,210
we'll have to move fast, find Felicity,

141
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,261
and get her out before
anyone knows we were here.

142
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,882
And here I thought you hated her.

143
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:29,167
No one gets to kill my mom except me.

144
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,032
It'd be easier if we had some backup.

145
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,370
Yeah, well, if you shut up,
you'll catch your breath faster.

146
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,722
I just think it was a mistake

147
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:35,984
to not bring the rest of the team.

148
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:38,703
They're not a team. They're vigilantes.

149
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:41,091
Their kind ruined Star City.

150
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,567
They're not the criminals
you think they are, Mia.

151
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,673
I remember them being heroes back then.

152
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,225
They only want to save the city.

153
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:50,382
- We got eyes on us.
- What?

154
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:53,168
Save the arrow. We're okay.

155
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:55,036
I thought you couldn't hack Archer.

156
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,532
But you can make yourself
temporarily invisible.

157
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:00,695
Show-off.

158
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,230
Watch it.

159
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:10,918
Any luck finding William?

160
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,404
Fight club was empty.

161
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:13,798
Wherever he and Mia are headed,

162
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,074
they're on their own now.

163
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:16,984
And you're okay with that?

164
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,911
He doesn't need my help anymore.

165
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:21,460
And besides, Felicity
wants us to prioritize

166
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:22,666
finding those bombs.

167
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,068
The city's in danger.

168
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,610
And, also, maybe you missed
the vigilante life a little.

169
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:28,903
Working with a team, saving the city.

170
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:30,280
Maybe.

171
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:32,669
Any new leads on locating the bombs?

172
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:34,154
Just a lot of shoddy police work

173
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:35,785
surrounding Felicity's death...

174
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:37,920
Missing evidence,
incomplete scene reports.

175
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:39,581
The case files are a mess.

176
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,499
Well, I have a contact
at the department.

177
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:42,768
If somebody paid to have that done,

178
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,011
he would know about it.

179
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:45,746
What, you talking about Anson?

180
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:46,790
Yup.

181
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,176
I thought he cut you off.

182
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,275
Hmm, he did.

183
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,637
That's why I have you two as backup.

184
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:03,239
You got real balls coming here.

185
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,020
You wouldn't answer your phone.

186
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:06,448
Next time, take the hint.

187
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,358
I told you I can't help you anymore,

188
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:09,444
especially not now.

189
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,779
I need intel.

190
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,113
Intel on what?

191
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,680
The murder of Felicity Smoak.

192
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:17,044
I can't help you.

193
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,888
Wrong answer.

194
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,504
Are you shaking me down?

195
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:29,034
Actually, I was really
hoping to avoid it.

196
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,816
So why don't you tell me
everything you know, Anson?

197
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,651
Eden Corps.

198
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:35,695
They paid the SCPD
to fake Smoak's death,

199
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:37,220
tie up the loose ends.

200
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:38,943
Eden Corps hasn't
been active for months.

201
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,357
Well, they are now.

202
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,828
And they don't want
anyone to know about it,

203
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,643
probably to start nuking cities again.

204
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:46,856
I don't know.

205
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:48,306
Tell us where they are.

206
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:51,536
The Glades. Galaxy One's their front.

207
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:07,895
Roy. Roy!

208
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:11,338
Stop it!

209
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:12,609
Stop it!

210
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:16,219
Come on. It's time to go.

211
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:17,946
It's time to go.

212
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:24,728
So this is how the other half live.

213
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,775
Sadly, Star City used to
look very similar to this.

214
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:30,214
These are the coordinates
from Felicity's tape,

215
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,911
which means she's in there
somewhere, hopefully, alive.

216
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:36,495
Galaxy One is one of the
richest companies in the world,

217
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:37,997
and heavily guarded.

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,016
They're not just gonna
let us walk right in.

219
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,972
Actually, that's exactly
what they're gonna do.

220
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,233
Oh, this is ridiculous.

221
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,236
We need to look the part,
Ms. Executive Assistant.

222
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,307
I am definitely higher
up than your assistant.

223
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,050
And that is not what I'm talking about.

224
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,760
We are the kids of vigilantes.

225
00:12:57,763 --> 00:12:59,346
The second they scan us, we're done.

226
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:01,246
My last name isn't Clayton anymore.

227
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:02,497
And, besides, all the focus is

228
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,984
gonna be on me, the CEO,
anyway, so just play along.

229
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:08,706
Didn't I ask you to send me the
financials on the Brennan merger?

230
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,157
It should be there.

231
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,776
I need you to reschedule
my 12:00 with optics.

232
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,920
- Sir, you need to scan in.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:16,267
So push my 12:00 to 3:00

234
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,570
to make room for Jackson Labs at 1:00,

235
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:18,769
and then clear my morning to review

236
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:19,879
the Jackson Labs R&D.

237
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,452
Prepare for identification.

238
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:25,070
DNA match complete. Proceed.

239
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:28,280
- Hey. You're holding me up.
- She needs to scan.

240
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,992
Don't be ridiculous. She's
just my assistant. Trust me...

241
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,678
Sir.

242
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:38,171
Prepare for identification.

243
00:13:38,174 --> 00:13:40,068
Access denied.

244
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,471
You need to come with us, miss.

245
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:42,659
How about I don't?

246
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:44,748
- Lockdown.
- Hands up, now.

247
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,642
It's cool, fellas.

248
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,144
Lockdown.

249
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:51,481
- She's with me.
- Lockdown.

250
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:54,009
Sorry, Agent Hawke. We didn't
know she was one of yours.

251
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:57,445
I know. That's the point.

252
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,691
DNA match complete. Proceed.

253
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:03,260
Who the hell are you?

254
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:08,702
I have been tailing you
guys since the bazaar.

255
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,323
Once I figured out you were headed here,

256
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:11,922
I started pulling
credentials for clearance.

257
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:13,287
As an agent for Knightwatch?

258
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,034
Which is just what, the
good version of A.R.G.U.S.?

259
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:17,378
Something like that.

260
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,559
Look, I wanted to tell you
the truth, but I couldn't.

261
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:20,755
I didn't have a choice.

262
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,386
- Yeah, you did.
- Mia!

263
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:28,577
I trusted you, but all
you did was lie to me,

264
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,484
- like everyone else.
- Look, I'm sorry.

265
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:34,520
Was any of it real?

266
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,998
All of it.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,442
Okay, as much as I
love relationship drama

268
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,444
when it's not my own, do
you think we could focus

269
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:44,071
on the task at hand and not
blow our cover immediately?

270
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,833
Thank you.

271
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:49,928
All right, secret agent guy.

272
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,312
So what do you know about this place?

273
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,455
All right. I've been doing
recon on the building.

274
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,748
There are hidden sublevels here,

275
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,398
unlisted to the general public.

276
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:58,237
Well, that's where they
have to be holding mom.

277
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,538
How do we get down there?

278
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,921
My badge isn't gonna cut it.

279
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,924
There'll only be a handful
of people with access,

280
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:04,119
all DNA-based.

281
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:06,927
Well, I have a meeting with the
guy who runs this place, Keven Dale.

282
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,096
I mean, if anyone has access, it's him.

283
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:13,108
All we have to do is steal
and replicate his DNA. Easy.

284
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,862
It actually is. Look, I have the tech.

285
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,864
You just have to swipe a sample.

286
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:19,198
Wait. Me?

287
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,201
No, no. Stealing stuff
covertly. I don't do that.

288
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:26,655
Well, lucky for you, your sister does.

289
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,641
Great. I'll locate the sublevels

290
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,062
while you guys are with Dale.

291
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:32,345
I'll find you after.

292
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:36,165
Let's do a deep dive into Galaxy.

293
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,517
We can see if...

294
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,481
Rene?

295
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,341
Dad.

296
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,985
Damn it, Zoe.

297
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,679
I knew you were involved
with the Canaries, but...

298
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:53,140
I didn't think you were one of them.

299
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:55,479
Not only did you not stay
away from my daughter,

300
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:58,029
but you brought Roy into this.

301
00:15:58,031 --> 00:15:59,809
I didn't think you were alive.

302
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:01,407
Nice to see you, too.

303
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,082
What are you doing slumming
it in Star City anyway?

304
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:06,654
I still know you're
looking for the bombs.

305
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,406
And you need to stop.

306
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,377
You already know that Galaxy's
behind all this, don't you?

307
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,662
This is the part where you're
supposed to tell me I'm wrong,

308
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:17,331
that my father, a former vigilante,

309
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,332
is not working with the bad guys.

310
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:20,784
The bomb plans you saw...

311
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:22,687
They're phase one of what we're calling

312
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,027
the Star City reformation project.

313
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,933
- Oh, my god.
- You're part of this.

314
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,601
It's not what you think it is.

315
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:29,858
Really?

316
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,345
Because wiping out an entire city sounds

317
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:32,505
a lot like genocide.

318
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:35,967
Look, this isn't about
destroying Star City.

319
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,075
It's about expanding what
we've done in The Glades.

320
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,788
And with Galaxy's help,
I'll be able to do that

321
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,433
within a fraction of the time.

322
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,952
Everyone will be safely evacuated

323
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,570
before anything happens.

324
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,218
How is it you got all the age

325
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,957
and none of the wisdom?

326
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
They're playing you, Rene.

327
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:55,578
Galaxy is just a front for Eden Corps.

328
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,463
Eden Corps doesn't exist anymore.

329
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,206
And even if it did,

330
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,581
if Galaxy was run by a
terrorist organization,

331
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:02,710
I would know.

332
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:04,513
Just like you knew
Galaxy was paying cops

333
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:06,564
to fake Felicity's death?

334
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,836
Yeah. Yeah, she's still alive, Rene.

335
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,796
Galaxy's not the enemy.

336
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,289
They've been nothing but supportive,

337
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,807
altruistic.

338
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,884
Sweetheart,

339
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,394
you've seen it.

340
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:22,747
Yeah, but I wouldn't allow myself

341
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:24,657
to be blinded by it.

342
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,348
You always told me to
rely on my instincts.

343
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:28,859
What happened to yours?

344
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,737
You need to open your eyes, Rene.

345
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,948
I did...

346
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,758
And I used to believe being a vigilante

347
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,493
helped solve problems.

348
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:39,725
You and I both know
it's not that simple.

349
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:44,627
Please just let this go.

350
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:47,630
The father I knew, the hero...

351
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:50,275
Would not have let this go.

352
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:56,095
You may have forgotten that hero,

353
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,908
but I haven't.

354
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:06,194
Thank you for seeing us

355
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:07,729
on such short notice, Mr. Dale.

356
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:09,949
When the CEO of Harris Consolidated

357
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,568
comes calling, you answer.

358
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:13,171
And please call me Keven.

359
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,969
Can I get you or your
assistant anything?

360
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,081
Actually, I'm his associate.

361
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:23,983
My associate, Ms.
Margo, and I would love

362
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:25,308
some coffee.

363
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:27,040
3 cups of the house favorite.

364
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,815
So how can I be of service?

365
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:33,130
I've heard through the grapevine that

366
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:35,336
you've been working with
halcyon pharmaceuticals.

367
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:36,980
That's supposed to be hush-hush.

368
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,015
I'm evaluating their firm
for a potential acquisition,

369
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,184
and I was hoping for some intel.

370
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,205
Before I share my secrets,

371
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,522
how about you share one of yours?

372
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:48,407
How were you able to
get Harris Consolidated

373
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:49,927
off the ground so quickly?

374
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,182
Oh, I wish I could say
it was some genius plan,

375
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:55,081
but, really, it was luck.

376
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,842
An angel investor backed me.

377
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,993
You have to tell me who.

378
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:02,037
City of emeralds capital.

379
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:06,684
But whoever they are,
they've stayed anonymous.

380
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,712
So now that I've told you my secret,

381
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:12,381
tell me about Halcyon.

382
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,077
We've ended our arrangement.

383
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,135
They didn't align with our philosophy.

384
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:18,104
Which is what?

385
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,180
We want to change the world.

386
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:24,619
You can't do that mired
in short-term thinking.

387
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,385
You know what they say
about fidgeters, don't you?

388
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:31,784
Dreamers with idle hands.

389
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:33,902
I assure you, Mr. Harris,

390
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:36,506
no one has ever accused
me of being idle.

391
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,457
Huh.

392
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:41,287
Mr. Harris, we have an issue

393
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,911
back at the office now.

394
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:46,132
I am so sorry, Keven. The life of a CEO.

395
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,583
I get it.

396
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:49,752
Keep in touch.

397
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:52,188
Oh, he definitely wants to be in touch.

398
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,555
How goes the search?

399
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:04,409
Well, knowing Galaxy's behind everything

400
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,318
really narrows it down.

401
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,905
If the bombs are being
stored in The Glades,

402
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,915
it'll be at headquarters.

403
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:15,266
Your dad being involved in all this, uh,

404
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,269
it can't be easy.

405
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:18,772
I'm fine.

406
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,593
Let me know when you're
ready to go, okay?

407
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:34,140
All right. This is the
access point to the sublevels.

408
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:36,373
It's the only unlisted
elevator bay in the building.

409
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,260
Their random full-body DNA scanner

410
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:39,854
wasn't a dead giveaway?

411
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:42,174
But how's this swab
gonna trick a full scan?

412
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:43,485
Watch.

413
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:53,981
Is that replicating
the DNA signature? How?

414
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:55,293
Secrets of the trade.

415
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,473
You want a cookie or something?

416
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,989
All right. Be ready.

417
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:11,917
There's no telling what we're facing.

418
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,628
Stay back and in the
elevator. Understood?

419
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,806
You know, I'm really enjoying

420
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,839
all these heartfelt
brother-sister moments.

421
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:20,181
You're just more useful to me not dead.

422
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:23,062
I'm sorry. Do you care about me?

423
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:26,849
Yeah. Maybe. I'm also not the only one.

424
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:28,993
You know your angel investor,

425
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,995
city of emerald capital?

426
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,467
I think mom might've had
something to do with that.

427
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,228
What do you mean?

428
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:37,753
Well, emerald for Emerald City.

429
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,864
"The Wizard of Oz" was mom's favorite.

430
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,867
We used to read it all
the time when I was little.

431
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:48,149
I guess she might've been
watching over you after all.

432
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,189
Hi.

433
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,339
Aah! Uh!

434
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,144
Mia.

435
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,942
Mom.

436
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:46,860
You are alive.

437
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:49,365
I told you not to come.

438
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:52,914
Was my message not clear?

439
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,520
I wanted you both out of Star City,

440
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:55,932
not to come to The Glades.

441
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:58,491
Wow. Really? No "Hey, kids,
thanks for the rescue."

442
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,406
Those coordinates were not
supposed to lead you to me.

443
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:02,647
They are the coordinates of a stockpile
of bombs hidden in this building.

444
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,251
That's why I told you to
give them to Roy and Dinah.

445
00:23:05,254 --> 00:23:06,620
Well, since we're here, would it be okay

446
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:08,213
if we got you out of there?

447
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:10,349
Looks like this operates

448
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:12,123
under the same DNA access protocol.

449
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:14,353
Just give me a second.

450
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:25,790
It's so good to see you.

451
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:32,406
I never thought I'd see you again.

452
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:34,540
Oh, I was afraid you wouldn't want to...

453
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,041
After everything.

454
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,301
I'm so sorry, William.

455
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:40,218
Okay, hey, not to interrupt,

456
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,870
but we've really got to get out of here

457
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:42,839
before someone realizes

458
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,116
what we did to those guards.

459
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,976
I can't leave until I disable the bombs.

460
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:47,794
You just got out of danger,

461
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:49,480
and you want to go running back into it?

462
00:23:49,482 --> 00:23:50,981
Typical.

463
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:53,187
You would rather go play hero

464
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,997
than do what's best for your daughter.

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,974
Mia.

466
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,469
- Mia, come on.
- Stay out of it.

467
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,565
For once in your life, mom,

468
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:02,152
put your family first.

469
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:04,161
Being a hero, Mia,

470
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:07,158
means choosing other people's safety

471
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:11,985
above your own, including your family.

472
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:14,238
That's why I hid my work from you

473
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:16,145
so that I could protect
you from having to make

474
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:17,342
difficult decisions like these.

475
00:24:17,344 --> 00:24:19,582
You should've just been honest
with me from the beginning.

476
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:20,818
You were right.

477
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,179
I am so sorry.

478
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:25,182
Being a hero is my purpose.

479
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,352
I can't leave.

480
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:30,312
Then I want to help.

481
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,116
Seriously?

482
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,843
I'm sorry, but she's right.

483
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:37,931
Where to?

484
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,605
The next sublevel.

485
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:42,366
Well, if you're going,
you're gonna need this.

486
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:44,201
Thanks.

487
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:55,261
- Look, Mia...
- Don't.

488
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:05,631
You okay?

489
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:08,416
Yes, I am used to being
a disappointment to her.

490
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:09,968
The explosives are being stored

491
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,303
in the east end of the building.

492
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:12,804
Are there any guards in our way?

493
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:13,810
The coast looks clear,

494
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:18,260
except for 3 heat signatures
headed straight towards us.

495
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:23,429
They should be right on top of us.

496
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,475
Zoe?

497
00:25:34,478 --> 00:25:36,987
You found her.

498
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:44,610
It is so good to see you alive.

499
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,087
You could've told us we
were on the same side.

500
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,428
To infiltrate Eden Corps,
I had to be the Calculator.

501
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,517
It was the only way.

502
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,227
Looks like your plan worked
out a little too well.

503
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:03,169
Well, I'm glad my old
team came to the rescue.

504
00:26:03,172 --> 00:26:05,047
Thank you for helping William.

505
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,391
Where's Mia?

506
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:09,144
Mia is...

507
00:26:09,146 --> 00:26:11,121
So much like her father.

508
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:14,941
Sorry for not telling
you about her, by the way.

509
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:16,212
Guys?

510
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:18,486
The coast is clear
between us and the bombs.

511
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:20,965
Hurry up. We have to move.

512
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:24,451
Didn't you want to go with them?

513
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:27,162
Hey. I am only here to back you up.

514
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:31,809
Right. 'Cause you promised your daddy.

515
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:34,753
You know, I am really
not sure what's worse.

516
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:36,722
The, um, the lying

517
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:39,466
or the fact that you actually
thought I needed protection.

518
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:41,878
Mia, I know that you can
take care of yourself.

519
00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:43,795
Then why the hell do
you keep hanging around?

520
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:45,823
Because I care about you.

521
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:48,183
Okay. I wanted to tell you the truth,

522
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:50,846
but I knew that you would hate me

523
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,590
the minute I did.

524
00:26:52,593 --> 00:26:56,538
And every day, it just
got harder and harder.

525
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,982
So your big idea

526
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,684
is that I would just never find out.

527
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:04,208
Do you have any idea
what it's like to find out

528
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:06,033
that your entire
relationship with someone

529
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:07,487
is based on a lie?

530
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,459
No, okay? But I know
what it's like to have

531
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,070
heroes for parents.

532
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:14,709
It sucks.

533
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:17,521
Man, I used to ask my dad all the time

534
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:20,215
why he even adopted me

535
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:22,934
if he and my mom were
never gonna be around.

536
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:23,773
But you know what?

537
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,529
When I got older, I realized...

538
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:28,681
I was proud of them.

539
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:30,850
You were proud that they prioritized

540
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,611
the rest of the world above you?

541
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:35,539
Okay, no, not that part. But...

542
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:42,862
With great power comes
great responsibility, right?

543
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:44,516
Oh, come on! Spider-Man?

544
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,241
I'm not really into comic books.

545
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:49,865
Okay, my point is that the same applies

546
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,221
to us superhero kids.

547
00:27:51,223 --> 00:27:54,346
And we have to learn
to share our parents

548
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,584
and be a little selfless.

549
00:27:56,586 --> 00:27:58,382
Of course you would say that.

550
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,638
You've been a hero in training

551
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,755
since you were a kid.

552
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,465
Well, so have you.

553
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,852
The only difference is I got to choose,

554
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:07,096
and you never got to make that choice...

555
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:08,989
Until today.

556
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:16,815
There's your ulterior motive.

557
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:18,844
Look, Mia, if you go out that door,

558
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,573
you are doing exactly
what Felicity wants.

559
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:24,246
Okay, you want to go? We will go.

560
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:26,229
You want to stay? We will stay.

561
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:28,608
But do not let her mistakes

562
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:30,803
make your choice for you.

563
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,471
It's on you now.

564
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:38,310
This has to be the place.

565
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:46,366
There's someone coming.

566
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:48,788
So what'd we miss?

567
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:51,032
Ohh, you came back.

568
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:52,844
Don't make a big thing of it.

569
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:13,328
What the hell? Where are the bombs?

570
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,853
They're already onsite.

571
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:17,507
Dad.

572
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,944
What are you doing here?

573
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,797
You are alive.

574
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,507
No thanks to you

575
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:28,510
or your friend... Keven Dale.

576
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:30,202
You were right.

577
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:34,102
You all were right.

578
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,685
The attack on Star City
is happening tonight,

579
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:40,412
and there is zero plan to evacuate.

580
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,801
Dale plans to pin the
blame on a vigilante.

581
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:46,199
I'm guessing that's why
they were keeping Felicity.

582
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,703
I can't say I'm surprised.

583
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:51,033
What opened your eyes all of a sudden?

584
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:54,745
Someone very smart
with impeccable genetics

585
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:56,999
reminded me of who I used to be.

586
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:59,186
And why should we believe you?

587
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,880
Aren't you the evil mayor

588
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,832
who's been trying to destroy Star City?

589
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:03,934
And who are you?

590
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,837
This is Mia. These are mine and Oliver's

591
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,259
impeccable genetics.

592
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:10,417
- You and Oliver have a kid?
- Surprise.

593
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,646
Okay, now that we are all caught up,

594
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:13,931
what time do the bombs go off,

595
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:15,242
and how do we stop them?

596
00:30:15,244 --> 00:30:17,226
They're set to go off
during the fireworks

597
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:19,153
in exactly 38 minutes.

598
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,507
Even if we knew where the bombs were,

599
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,649
that's not enough time to climb
over that wall and stop this.

600
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:23,676
There is another way.

601
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:25,343
The bombs are linked by a Li-Fi,

602
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:27,161
which means there's an
exterior power source.

603
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:28,831
You're talking about a
unified connectivity device.

604
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,312
- Yes.
- It's like the brain of the bombs.

605
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:31,987
Oh, good. Now there are two of you.

606
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,403
So wait. We're just supposed
to break into some server room

607
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:36,442
so you guys can hack into it?

608
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:38,931
"Server room"! How 2019.

609
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,958
The brain is a portable cube
shape. It fits in your hand.

610
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,348
Dale has something like that.

611
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:44,332
I thought it was just a fidget cube.

612
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:46,795
The only way to stop the bombs
is to destroy that device.

613
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,207
Dale's gonna be at the celebration,

614
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,634
but he won't be easy to find.

615
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:51,016
He cut a deal

616
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,966
for a permanent Archer blind spot.

617
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,486
There's always another way.

618
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:56,783
I heard these Glades
parties are pretty fancy.

619
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:58,768
How are we supposed to fit in?

620
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,937
Except for you.

621
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:04,791
Leave that part to me.

622
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:10,488
This is looking for a needle

623
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,522
in a very creepy haystack.

624
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:15,073
I'll take that to mean
you're in position.

625
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,869
Everyone else?

626
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,496
Almost.

627
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:21,499
Looks like Rene's become
quite the celebrity.

628
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:24,186
Overwatch, we are in position.

629
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:25,461
"Overwatch"?

630
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,672
No one's called me Overwatch
in a very long time.

631
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:31,292
Okay, can we save the walk down
memory lane for after maybe?

632
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:33,378
All right. What do we got to do?

633
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:37,146
Everyone here is wearing
functional textiles,

634
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:39,993
so there are tiny computers
embedded in their clothing and yours.

635
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:41,833
When the fabrics touch,
the sensors will send us

636
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:42,996
all their electronic data.

637
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:45,006
Normally, their privacy
settings restrict that,

638
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,192
but I bypassed them.

639
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,076
So you're hacking clothes?

640
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,888
Pretty much.

641
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,696
Your job is to identify Keven Dale.

642
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:53,685
And I can help with that
via the security feed.

643
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:55,550
Let's go save the city.

644
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:04,726
It's not Dale.

645
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:11,047
Okay, Mia, at your 2 o'clock,
there is a man in a blue suit.

646
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,359
He could be a potential match.

647
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:14,668
I don't mean match-match.
I mean target.

648
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:17,346
And I don't even know
what your type is. Is it...

649
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:18,517
Mom, shut up.

650
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,720
Okay, sorry. Rambling. Old habits.

651
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,239
Mia, you just brushed Dale.

652
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:30,400
Got him. I'm following him inside.

653
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:32,069
Hold on. You're gonna need backup.

654
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:33,821
You won't have comms in there.

655
00:32:33,823 --> 00:32:35,548
Isn't this what you trained me for?

656
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,385
I can handle a CEO. I got this.

657
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:46,134
Nobody wants to tell you,
but your festival sucks.

658
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:50,638
Interesting. I was expecting a Canary.

659
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,977
Who the hell are you?

660
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,384
Not a fan of chitchat.

661
00:32:55,394 --> 00:33:00,248
Now, hand that thing
over, or I'll take it.

662
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:03,843
Really?

663
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:15,663
Take her alive. We'll
talk after the festival.

664
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:20,427
Oh, this'll be fun.

665
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:24,807
Guys, I lost him. He's
in the crowd again.

666
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:26,475
Okay, not to freak anyone out,

667
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:27,929
but this is our two-minute bomb warning.

668
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:29,172
We need to thin the herd.

669
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,688
I know how.

670
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,832
Show them what heroes look like.

671
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,411
Help! Vigilantes!

672
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:50,183
Oh, you have 30 seconds, Mia.

673
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,314
Mia!

674
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:22,321
She did it. The bombs are deactivated.

675
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:27,345
Let's get the hell out of here.

676
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,270
Citizens of The Glades,

677
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:34,006
last night, our
independence day festivities

678
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:37,269
were attacked in an
apparent act of terror.

679
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,055
Thanks to the tireless
efforts of The Glades P.D.,

680
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:43,191
we know the identities of the
perpetrators responsible...

681
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:44,813
The vigilantes known

682
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:48,562
as Arsenal, Black Canary,
and the Calculator.

683
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,900
A reward of $10 million will be paid

684
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:56,213
for any info leading to
their capture dead or alive.

685
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:58,880
This was our first
attack within our walls

686
00:35:58,883 --> 00:36:00,959
in over a decade.

687
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:03,053
I vow to you it will be the last.

688
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:06,962
Well, that was disturbing.

689
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,081
I know why my dad had
to make that speech,

690
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,578
but hearing it out loud?

691
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:12,580
We did already have
a target on our backs,

692
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,892
just, well, not quite that big.

693
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:17,476
Well, it's about to get
rougher for everyone.

694
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,144
Including my dad.

695
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,480
I know you're worried, but he is right.

696
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:23,517
The best way to take down Galaxy is

697
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,891
from the inside.

698
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,105
So what now?

699
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,486
So I'm guessing Galaxy's

700
00:36:27,488 --> 00:36:29,270
not just gonna stop at bombing the city.

701
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:33,942
No. The purpose of the
bombing wasn't to rebuild.

702
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:37,139
It was to remake Star
City in The Glades' image.

703
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:38,809
Why would Dale want to ruin a city

704
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:40,478
he spent so much money to fix?

705
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,314
Because he's gonna use
the shiny new Star City

706
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,267
as a proof of concept
to take Archer Global,

707
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,386
and that's too much power
for one entity to have.

708
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:48,339
Well, it's a good thing we
got the band back together.

709
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:50,433
Well, we can thank William for that one.

710
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,355
I sent that signal out
on a hope and a prayer.

711
00:36:57,968 --> 00:36:59,686
And you kept it.

712
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:04,281
After all these years and with
everything that's happened, I...

713
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,898
I know I don't deserve it.

714
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:09,286
Well, I'm glad I didn't
completely hate you.

715
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:11,785
Now I got a sister to hate instead.

716
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:14,004
I need some air.

717
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:16,917
So maybe we don't really have
that type of relationship yet.

718
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,319
It's not you.

719
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,546
- I should go talk to her.
- And it's not you.

720
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:23,634
It's me.

721
00:37:23,637 --> 00:37:26,012
Who needs a drink?

722
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:34,583
Mr. Mayor, impassioned speech you gave.

723
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,099
It really made me believe

724
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:38,389
you want those vigilantes dead.

725
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:41,176
They violated the sanctity of our walls,

726
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,561
not to mention they destroyed

727
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:44,321
our plans for expansion.

728
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:46,806
Yes, I want them dead.

729
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,617
They were your friends once.

730
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,186
Your point?

731
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,813
Well, they seemed to know exactly

732
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:56,776
what we were planning
and how to stop us.

733
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:59,207
Seeing how it was your desire

734
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,506
to evacuate Star City,
I can't help but wonder...

735
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:05,587
You did not tell me about
moving up the bomb timeline

736
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,177
till I pressed you on it.

737
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:10,837
If I'd known, maybe you
wouldn't have kept Felicity Smoak

738
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,599
in the same damn building.

739
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:16,759
The attack by the vigilantes

740
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,837
has provided us an opportunity.

741
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,234
Because a city in fear
desires a solution.

742
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,605
What is that?

743
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:29,533
The tool that will allow
us to take Archer Global

744
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:32,077
and eliminate all vigilantes for good.

745
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:40,068
Oh, wow.

746
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,135
So this is where you have been spending

747
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:45,240
all your time.

748
00:38:45,243 --> 00:38:48,261
Pretty much.

749
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:54,040
Still not a fan of cleaning, I take it.

750
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,821
You want to start by nagging?

751
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,803
Oh, I'm your mother.
Nagging is part of the deal.

752
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:02,399
So what, you probably want
me to come help stop Galaxy?

753
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:06,094
A little mother-daughter
vigilante time.

754
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,788
No. I wish I could take
you away from all this.

755
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,592
I wish that you didn't have
to think about any of this.

756
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:18,606
But I know that that is
not my decision to make.

757
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:21,276
You know, when I first left home,

758
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:25,047
I was so mad at you.

759
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:29,284
I learned everything I
could about vigilantes.

760
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,258
I dug up old news stories

761
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,722
about how they destroyed Star City.

762
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,125
I was convinced...

763
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:40,679
I was convinced it was true

764
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:44,683
that you had lied to
me my entire childhood

765
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:48,211
with your... your stories

766
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:51,097
of the heroism of Team Arrow.

767
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,950
Because you didn't want me

768
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:54,872
to think badly about you.

769
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:59,397
Or about dad.

770
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,834
I spent these past years
hating vigilantes...

771
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,791
Because I hated you.

772
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:11,117
Well, I don't blame you.

773
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,246
I understand why you
wanted to lie to me...

774
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:17,349
To protect me.

775
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:21,922
I can't even imagine what it was like

776
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:24,764
having the entire city turn on you

777
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:26,674
and turn on dad.

778
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:33,514
Mia, you are so much like your father.

779
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,493
Out on that field,

780
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:38,787
so badass.

781
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,788
I'm so proud of you.

782
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,798
Mom, there's, um...

783
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:54,202
It seemed like there is
something really personal

784
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:57,306
about you stopping Galaxy.

785
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,854
Is that about dad?

786
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:05,605
No, it's not.

787
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,051
That one is on me.

788
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:15,390
Holy crap. Did that work?

789
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:18,035
Here goes nothing.

790
00:41:18,037 --> 00:41:21,246
Archer, are you online?

791
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:29,068
Yes, Ms. Smoak.

792
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:31,579
Archer is active.

793
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:33,499
Holy...

794
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:37,742
