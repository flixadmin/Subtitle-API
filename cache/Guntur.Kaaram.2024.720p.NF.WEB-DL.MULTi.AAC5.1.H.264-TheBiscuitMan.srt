Hey!

Ranga, what's that?

26
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,291
It's our warehouse!

27
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,541
Hey!

28
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,000
-Hey!
-Hey, who is that?

29
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,000
-Brother, take this.
-What's going on?

30
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,166
Beat those idiots to a pulp!

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,125
-Catch them!
-Hey, move!

32
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,083
Hit them!

33
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,291
Where are you off to? Come here!

34
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,000
-You…
-Hey!

35
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
How dare you hit my brother!

36
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,250
-Hey!
-Brother…

37
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,041
How dare
you touch my brother-in-law!

38
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,125
You…

39
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,291
Lenin!

40
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,666
Hey, Lenin! Lenin!

41
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,750
Lenin…

42
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,083
Lenin! Hey, Lenin.

43
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,083
Nothing will happen to you.

44
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,833
-What have you done?
-I didn't expect this to happen.

Hey!

46
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,916
I will not spare those bloody rogues
who harmed my brother!

47

Lenin, you will be fine.

If anything happens to my brother,
you will be done for!

00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,083
Brother…

52
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,666
-Lenin, get up! Lenin!
-Don't spare them.

53

00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,500
Come on, my horse, let's go.

61
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,958
-Come on, my horse, let's go.
-Grandpa!

62
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,166
{\an8}AFTER FEW YEARS

63
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,916
-We will look at the files later.
-Just say Kata's here!

64
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,291
Bless me, sir.

65
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,958
{\an8}I have relied on you
for twenty-five years.

66
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,500
{\an8}I have become an MLA twice.

67
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,208
{\an8}I have sold half my assets.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,041
{\an8}I heard we will be getting
the Law Ministry this time.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,416
{\an8}With your blessings…

70
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,958
{\an8}I will get down to the job, sir.

71
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,125
Only someone like him,
who can request without inhibition,

72
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,791
will emerge in politics.

73
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,791
What do you say, Madhu?

74
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,708
-You know me well, sir.
-But only someone like me,

75
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,583
who can decline
without hesitation, will stay on top.

76
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,458
My daughter gets the ministry this time.
You can relax.

77
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,083
What has she
accomplished so far, sir?

78
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,208
{\an8}Married twice, gave birth to two,
and let go of one. Is that it?

79
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,375
{\an8}"Why was her firstborn abandoned?"

80
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,125
"Where is he? What is he up to?"

81
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,333
If I ask such questions
in front of the press…

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,166
you will make the headlines,
and I will make my way to the cabinet.

83
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,375
{\an8}Well, you need to stay alive
for that to happen.

84
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,833
"I, Vyra Vasundhara,
as the Minister of State for Law,

85
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:42,708
{\an8}shall discharge my duties
faithfully and conscientiously.

86
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,583
{\an8}Without fear, bias, or prejudice,

87
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,750
{\an8}in accordance with
the Constitution and Law,

88
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:54,125
{\an8}I shall do right by all manner of people,
and I solemnly swear in the name of God. "

89
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,583
-Did you get the papers ready, Pani?
-Yes, sir.

90
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,041
Why bother him now
after twenty-five years, sir?

91
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,708
I am not keen on doing this either.

92
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,333
Has she asked?

93
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,458
How her is former son and so on?

94
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,500
Actually, I'm overcome with love
for my grandson, and I want him here.

95
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,333
You probably think
you can still carry him.

96
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,666
He is more than six feet tall now.

97
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,166
His name is Ramana…

98
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,291
but he's as hot and spicy
as Guntur pepper to touch.

99
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,750
Pepper bales, loading trucks…

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,250
It's a world in itself.

101
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,500
And he's the king of that world.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,666
He is already in great form, waging wars
and brandishing swords in his kingdom.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,750
We shouldn't dig our own graves, sir.

104
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,125
He might be a king there,

105
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,875
but he is no more
than a son here.

106
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,458
We will manage. Call him.

107
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,375
Should I call him home, sir?

108
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,875
If we call him home, we will have
to entertain him until he leaves.

109
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,916
Call him to the office.

110
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,083
We can get up
and go once our job is done.

111
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,083
Okay, sir.

112
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,791
-Okay.
-Dear…

113
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,750
-Grandpa.
-What is the status?

114
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,125
I just had my breakfast.

115
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,000
I also had my coffee.

116
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,750
In a while, Mom will also leave
for the government office.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,041
Correct? Yeah.

118
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,333
Bye, Grandpa.

119
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,208
He makes me wonder…

120
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,750
Is it necessary to call the other guy?

121
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,791
He makes me feel certain
that it is actually an emergency.

122
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,041
{\an8}SUBURB OF GUNTUR

123
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,833
-Who is it, Dad?
-It's Pani.

124
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,875
He's been continuously calling me
for the past ten days.

125
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,708
"Is Ramana coming to Hyderabad?"

126
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,291
Why don't you go and ask him?

127
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,333
No way!
You know he is short-tempered.

128
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,791
-He will shout at me.
-Why shouldn't he?

129
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,333
He was disowned by his mom
when he was just ten.

130
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,916
Do you expect him to be cheerful?

131
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,458
That's not temper.

132
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,125
That's anguish.

133
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,291
Guntur chili powder.

134
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,958
See… it's red and spicy to look at.

135
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,958
Once it touches your tongue,

136
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,208
there's no way you can stop your tears.

137
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,291
He is no different.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,625
He seems harsh
but is actually sweet.

139
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,375
Ask him yourself.
You'll know how sweet he is.

140
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,625
{\an8}What do we ask him?

141
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,208
{\an8}His mom is calling him.

142
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,625
{\an8}Asking him to meet her is wrong.
Telling him not to is also wrong.

143
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,333
{\an8}I dice with death!

144
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,916
What are you looking at?

145
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,958
We got to move three full loads of chili.

146
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,500
Nerli Route seems to be good.
Take the same route.

147
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,625
-Okay.
-Call me as soon as you get there.

148
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,625
-Okay.
-"We didn't want to disturb you at night. "

149
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,791
If you come up with such lame excuses,
I will flay your skin, morons!

150
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,708
Go! Get going!

151
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,833
Let's go.

152
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,125
What?

153
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,250
Well…

154
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,958
Pani has been asking
if you have started for Hyderabad yet.

155
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,541
Should I go?

156
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,208
I'm not able to say yes
because I know they are not fair people.

157
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,583
Of course, there is nothing
to say about you.

158
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,375
Is that a yes or a no?

159
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,625
If I knew that,
why would I stretch so much?

160
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,875
-Hey, Samba.
-Yes?

161
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,208
Do you think she will recognize me?

162
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,375
Bro…

163
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,208
-Is there enough diesel in the car?
-Tank's full, bro.

164
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,541
What is the address?

165
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,541
Abids, Jandal Party Office, Hyderabad.

166
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,958
I was told that
anyone would guide you there.

167
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,458
{\an8}JANDAL PARTY

168
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,291
-Are the papers ready?
-Yes, sir.

169
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,083
I hope there are no spelling mistakes.

170
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,041
She divorced her husband
and abandoned her son.

171
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,833
She remarried and had another son.

172
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,291
The first son has no right to her assets.

173
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,916
This statement is a mistake in itself and
you're asking me for spelling mistakes?

174
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,375
His name is Ramana.

175
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,750
Show it to everyone.

176
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,875
-Has nobody seen him in all these years?
-We made a mistake.

177
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,416
This is not a mistake, sir.
It's a blunder.

178
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,875
I have had enough of you.
Give it to me. Come!

179
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,500
{\an8}RAMANA

180
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,958
<i>Spicy and pungent!</i>

181
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,791
{\an8}<i>Stinging chili powder!</i>

182
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,791
My left eye is a bit weak, man!

183
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,458
{\an8}Come here.

184
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,500
{\an8}You are…

185
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,041
Are you thrilled to see me?

186
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,416
Did your heart rate go up?

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,208
{\an8}Did you feel like whistling?

188
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,708
It's Ramana.

189
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,250
You look like a hero, sir!

190
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,958
What's the buzz here?

191
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,125
The old man is turning eighty, sir.

192
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,250
You know…

193
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,041
Most useless things last long.

194
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,375
So much hubbub for his birthday!

195
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,666
What will you do when he dies?

196
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,291
Break open the earth?

197
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,791
That was deep, sir.

198
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,333
Where is Pani?

199
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,416
He is waiting in there, sir.

200
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,625
-This is his obligation.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,916
-What else can he do besides wait?
-Yes.

202
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,041
Mom!

203
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,125
Mom!

204
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,583
Sir, that way…

205
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,000
Sir?

206
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,125
Why is he blocking my way?

207
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,750
That way, sir.

208
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,791
Doesn't he know what she is to me?

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,916
Mother?

210
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,458
She was called "sister" when she was
younger. Now, they call her "mother. "

211
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,791
Go, get an appointment first.

212
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,291
He talks a bit too much.

213
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,458
What are you looking at?
Will you hit me?

214
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,833
Just wondering if I should kill you.

215
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,125
Whoa!

216
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,375
Sir!

217
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,875
Son…

218
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,166
This way.

219
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,250
Come.

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,958
Coffee? Tea?

221
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,875
Is there a cup in your hand?

222
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,208
Only papers, right?

223
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,166
Give me a pen.
I'll sign and leave.

224
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,291
You better read it before signing, sir.

225
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,625
I should be killing you.

226
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,833
What could be so disruptive?

227
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,500
"Don't claim a legacy. "
You don't need it.

228
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,958
"Don't use the surname. "
You have your paternal surname anyway.

229
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,166
In short, you have no relation
with this family.

230
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,458
As if it has existed all these years!

231
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,958
In agreement, a signature…

232
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,625
When you part ways from
your husband, it's called a divorce.

233
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,875
When you disown your son,
what's the term for it?

234
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,125
Did you think of a name?

235
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,583
If yes, ask her to come and tell me.

236
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,875
Why just one?

237
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,500
I'll put a thousand signatures.

238
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,583
How is she still his mother?

239
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,625
If he wants, let him see her
when she is on TV.

240
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,333
He doesn't have a mother,
and he won't be getting one now.

241
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,375
Go, tell him.

242
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,500
-What if he doesn't agree?
-Destruction…

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,416
I will destroy him.

244
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,333
Ensure that emphasis
is placed on "destruction. "

245
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,541
If we place emphasis on it,
he'll probably not sign the paper, sir.

246
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,916
No, I mean, why call him here
yourself and then provoke him?

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,416
If he realizes we are in need,
he may raise his price.

248
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,583
We must keep him at a distance
and get the work done.

249
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:55,791
Yes.

250
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,750
When we ask for votes,
we even enter huts.

251
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,833
Once we win, do we allow the voters
to come into our homes?

252
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,125
Correct.

253
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,708
It's the same with him.

254
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:14,041
While he is still under the illusion
of seeing or meeting his mother,

255
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,416
we should get the job done.

256
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,041
Go, tell him.

257
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,416
Which one? About the voters, sir?

258
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,791
-What I told you before that.
-Okay, sir.

259
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,583
I got it, sir.

260
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,875
I got it signed, sir.

261
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,583
Why do you take the trouble, sir?
Let me check this for you.

262
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,708
-Oh…
-Give it here.

263
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,750
Sorry, sir!

264
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,958
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DESTRUCTION
YOU WILL CREATE

265
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,250
It's just a signature.
Why are you laughing?

266
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,750
The old man will kill me. Shut up!

267
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,666
Hey!

268
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,916
-What happened? Tell me.
-Sorry, sir. He wrote,

269
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,291
"Looking forward to the destruction
you will create. "

270
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,708
He has emphasized on the word…

271
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,500
"destruction. "

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,291
What's happening?

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,125
{\an8}JANDAL PARTY

274
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,833
It's falling down!

275
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,375
-Careful!
-Move back!

276
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,458
Get out of here!

277
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,625
Oh, God!

278
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,291
<i>His name is Ramana…</i>

279
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,583
<i>but he's as hot and spicy</i>
<i>as Guntur pepper to touch. </i>

280
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,000
<i>It stings! This boy's chili powder!</i>
<i>Business with him is a roller coaster</i>

281
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:50,583
<i>Hot and spicy is his chili powder</i>
<i>Business with him is a roller coaster</i>

282
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,416
<i>In every nook and cranny</i>
<i>Whispers of his tales abound!</i>

283
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,916
<i>No one dares to step out of line</i>
<i>Because of him</i>

284
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,000
<i>Hey, there's no one who doesn't know him</i>

285
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,708
<i>Hey, he looks all glorious</i>
<i>But is good at battering, mother promise!</i>

286
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,000
<i>When he strikes, brain freezes</i>
<i>And they forget the PIN code</i>

287
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,083
<i>Fair!</i>

288
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,500
<i>Hey, crazy!</i>

289
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,791
<i>Stinging!</i>

290
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,833
<i>Hey, he's like a stinging slap!</i>

291
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,291
<i>Fair in complexion</i>
<i>With mind-blowing speed</i>

292
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,708
<i>A stinging burn</i>
<i>He is highly inflammable</i>

<i>Everybody, make way</i>
<i>Leader on the way</i>

<i>Ain't got no time to play</i>

<i>No one to account for</i>

298
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,250
<i>No one to endorse for</i>

299
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:46,750
<i>A burden loaded by others</i>
<i>Why should I carry it on my shoulders?</i>

<i>A bit of selfishness and a bit of virtue</i>
<i>I am love-matter with a mix of these</i>

306
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,708
<i>Hey, hold it, beauty</i>
<i>Hold the pestle high</i>

307
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,541
<i>Bring it down one after one</i>

308
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,625
<i>Pound it!</i>

309
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,416
<i>Hey, one chili per pound</i>

00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,458
<i>My destiny is a colorful pattern</i>

318
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,458
<i>I may be sad</i>
<i>But won't stop the celebration</i>

319
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:33,458
<i>My own fort of laughter</i>
<i>Why should I destroy it?</i>

320
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:38,291
<i>Slow-cooked spicy biryani</i>
<i>Red chili half tandoori</i>

321
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:43,125
<i>With lemon soda and a cigarette</i>
<i>Make your stamp on Guntur</i>

322
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:47,958
<i>Slow-cooked spicy biryani</i>
<i>Red chili half tandoori</i>

323
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:53,208
<i>With lemon soda and a cigarette</i>
<i>Make your stamp on Guntur</i>

324
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,666
Mom!

325
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,958
Ramana is here!

326
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,166
What?

327
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,208
Ramana is here!

328
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,375
What are you saying?
I can't hear you! Come again!

329
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,125
{\an8}Mom, Ramana is here.

330
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,250
{\an8}If you could shout it from upstairs,
why bother rushing down?

331
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,750
Your wife cannot hear.

332
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,916
{\an8}He's already at the door.
He would come in anyway.

333
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,750
{\an8}If the door is shut,
he will go wherever he wants.

334
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,500
Hey, Ramana. How did it go?

335
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,416
-Count or deal?
-Drop.

336
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,583
{\an8}Hey, you never get a life in cards.
Nor wisdom in life.

337
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,166
{\an8}Does context mean anything to you?

338
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,041
How is your mother?

339
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,333
Has she put on weight?

340
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,375
She is glowing
like a Goddess in a temple.

341
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,083
You should have performed <i>arti</i> then!

342
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,250
I didn't find the matches.

343
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,458
But you find packs of them
for lighting cigarettes.

344
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:53,458
Yeah, right.

345
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,708
I'm famished.
What did you cook?

346
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,291
Nothing special.

347
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,958
I have only made egg curry.

348
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:00,875
Aunty!

349
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,291
Bring the egg here.
I will eat it.

350
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,125
-What?
-One of your eyes doesn't work anyway.

351
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,083
Do these sunglasses
make it any better?

352
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,041
Damn!

353
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,875
You cannot handle my style.

354
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,875
Did she ask you
how you have been?

355
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,208
She broke down as soon as she saw me.

356
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,291
Really?

357
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,125
She said, "Why should you eat
your aunt's awful egg curry?

358
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,083
Stay back. I will make chicken for you. "

359
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,750
-Well, you should have!
-Oh!

360
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,208
I didn't want you to miss me.
So, here I am.

361
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,458
Hey, what is that half-hearted serving?
He's growing up.

362
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,791
-Eat this.
-Hey! You want to kill me with eggs?

363
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,875
Yeah, I cannot let go like your mother.

364
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,000
Hey! Allow him to tell us
what happened there.

365
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,500
You haven't given him a break
since he came back!

366
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,375
He only speaks once a year.

367
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,875
But when he does, he is on the dot.

368
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,833
It's not like they were
overcome with love.

369
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,083
They required my signature,
indicating I was nobody to them.

370
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:49,666
That's why they called me.

371
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,000
Hey, Samba.

372
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:54,416
Yes?

373
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,875
They say we shouldn't claim their assets.

374
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,625
Have we ever?

375
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,750
She won't see her son…

376
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,166
but sits in the office
behind closed doors.

377
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,333
Since she was so busy, I thought
I shouldn't bother. So, I didn't sign.

378
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,291
Hello, Mr. Satyam!

379
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,500
Go and play the right song
on your gramophone on this occasion.

380
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,833
It should suit the estranged husband
as well as the disowned son.

381
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,250
I can't tell who is laying eggs at home!
You or the chicken!

382
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,666
Didn't you like the <i>dosa, </i> sir?

383
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,750
-I don't feel good, Pani.
-Oh!

384
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,083
You never know when Kata Madhu
would create a nuisance.

385
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,750
True, sir.

386
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,250
Why isn't he signing?

387
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:53,791
After all, it's his mother.

388
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,375
In that case, call him,
saying his mother wants to see him.

389
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,458
Hey!

390
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,750
Do I ever drink soda?

391
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,041
Sorry about that.

392
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,416
You use water, right?
I'll get it.

393
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,750
Uncle!

394
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,916
Uncle! That's water.
Here, take this.

395
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,166
One minute.

396
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,583
Hey, I prefer an omelet!

397
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,208
Where is your mind at?

398
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:44,708
What is the problem?

399
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,250
There was a call from Hyderabad yesterday.

400
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,375
He was asked to come home this time.

401
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,416
Your son is drinking like a fish, Uncle.

402
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,250
By the time I took him some water,
he had finished a quarter.

403
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,875
If I take too long with the omelet,
he might even devour me!

404
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,333
-Don't tell him I told you this.
-Wait.

405
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,291
-Let me talk to him.
-Please, don't. He will kill me.

406
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,000
-Hey!
-Uncle…

407
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,208
Ramana.

408
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,083
Are you drinking?

409
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:13,958
Did you get a call
from Hyderabad?

410
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,250
Yeah.

411
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:16,666
What was it about?

412
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,250
They were pleased to see the grandson.

413
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,041
Now, they want to see the son.

414
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,375
You should go then.

415
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,125
For what?
They are closing doors on me.

416
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,583
Break down the doors.
You possess every right as a son.

417
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,958
Is that so?

418
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,583
You sit and gaze out of the window.

419
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,583
But expect me to go there
knocking down doors!

420
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,708
They say when you refuse a meal,
you stay hungry the whole day.

421
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:42,125
But if you reject your mother,
you will cry all your life.

422
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:45,041
She has left him,
but he doesn't let go of her.

423
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,291
He thinks she will scoop me up
as soon as I go.

424
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,500
What did you say?

425
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,083
Are you going there or not?

426
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,583
BASAVARAJU SARANGAPANI
B. A, B. L

427
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,000
ADVOCATE

428
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,083
I'm the boss here.

429
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,666
The moment I enter,
they wet their pants out of fear.

430
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,541
Sir! Welcome, sir.

431
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,666
-You are?
-I'm Mr. Pani's assistant, sir.

432
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,791
Don't you have a name?

433
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,958
I'm Balu, sir.

434
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,958
-This is?
-Mr. Pani's house, sir.

435
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,041
Hey, capture well.

436
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,958
I should have everyone floored.

437
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,041
And that is?

438
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,458
Mr. Pani's daughter.

439
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,166
Today's special is my home tour.

440
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,541
This is our tree.

441
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,208
Sister! That's a plant.

442
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,750
When I don't know it myself,
how would the others know? Keep quiet!

443
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,500
Tomorrow is my father's death anniversary.

444
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,916
It's Grandpa's!

445
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,791
Wasn't something
of Dad's coming up as well?

446
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,041
His birthday.

447
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,916
Both are special occasions.

448
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,458
Jeez!

449
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,958
Pani's daughter is quite ravishing.

450
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,500
Ravishing?

451
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,708
He has come to meet your dad.

452
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:49,791
He is not home.

453
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,041
We will wait.

454
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,625
Sure. Wait outside.

455
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:54,708
Hey, girl!

456
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,666
Look at my complexion.

457
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,583
Won't I get tanned sitting in the sun?

458
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,833
Oh, really?
Just a minute.

459
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,583
As if he is a rose!

460
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,208
Wear it in your hair.

461
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,125
So, is that how you speak to all girls?

462
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,916
Not unless they are extremely pretty.

463
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,625
What's your deal?

464
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:19,958
Not with you.

465
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,375
With your pop.

466
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,875
Pop? What do you mean by "pop"?
Can't you give him some respect?

467
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,291
I guess she is angry.

468
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:28,916
I offered it.

469
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,208
But he refused.

470
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,500
My goodness!

471
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,875
Green really suits her.

472
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,375
Who is this guy flirting so openly?

473
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,083
I spared him because
he's good-looking. Otherwise…

474
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:00,958
-What's the name though?
-Bala Subramanyam, sir.

475
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,500
Who wants yours?

476
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,166
Amukta Malyada, sir.
We call her Amuda out of love.

477
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,708
Why should you show any love?
Leave that to me.

478
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,541
Won't you give me at least that freedom?

479
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,541
Take it, sir.

480
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,708
Why is she in a sari?
What is the occasion?

481
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:16,625
She makes reels on social media.

482
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,166
She was in jeans yesterday.
Today, she is in a sari.

483
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,833
Could she be wearing a skirt tomorrow?

484
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,666
-Why do you ask, sir?
-I'll come again tomorrow.

485
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,875
Tomorrow is my weekly off, sir.

486
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:26,208
Mom! That's him.

487
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,541
Are there burglars in their house, Balu?

488
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,291
They are not allowing anybody in!

489
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,416
They won't even offer tea.

490
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,000
That's not the case, sir. This is
the first time they have seen a rowdy.

491
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,708
Sorry, sir.

492
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,125
What did I say earlier?

493
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,000
You said Mr. Pani's daughter is ravishing.

494
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,458
She's not just ravishing.

495
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,208
-She's delightfully ravishing.
-Son!

496
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,833
-Sir!
-Pani, we were just talking about you.

497
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,500
-Why did you make him sit here?
-Sir…

498
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,541
-Actually--
-Have you any sense?

499
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,041
Please come, sir.
Let's go in and have some coffee.

500
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,166
-Pani…
-Yes?

501
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:04,958
Was it Mom who called me?

502
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,583
Yes, I swear.

503
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,958
We will have coffee there.
Let's go.

504
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,000
One minute. I will reverse the car.
Come with me.

505
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,125
Ammu!

506
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:16,791
The name is Ramana.

507
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,375
Remember it.

508
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,625
It will be of use
when you come to Guntur.

509
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,666
He has given you a nickname already.

510
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,000
Hey, it's done. Lift it.

511
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,250
Did he say
I was going to cause destruction?

512
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,833
Did he say I was waiting?

513
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,000
What did you write?

514
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:26,875
What did you say?

515
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,666
You know I would lie.

516
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,291
You know I am covering up.

517
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,833
He is your uncle.

518
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,375
-My daughter's--
-Second husband?

519
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,208
Boss, if you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

520
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,583
Please.

521
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,333
What did my mother see in you
that she married you?

522
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:57,166
-I condemn. Condemn.
-I don't know.

523
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,708
Grandpa! In what context
can we use "condemn"?

524
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:03,625
Your father can condemn him
for his question.

525
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,625
Who is this guy?

526
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:09,166
To this family and our constituency,
he is the only heir.

527
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,833
-Who is this gentleman?
-Your brother by relation.

528
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:11,958
You can go.

529
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,458
Hey!

530
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,250
Don't walk away in such a peculiar manner!

531
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:18,000
Weren't you taught
how to greet your elders?

532
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,625
-Namaste!
-I see!

533
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,250
You and your stupid
half-hearted greetings!

534
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
I condemn this!

535
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:37,166
I bless you. Now, get going.

536
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,041
All the characters are here.

537
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,083
But where is the main lead?

538
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,041
Have you locked her up inside?

539
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,166
Sign this first.
She will come.

540
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,333
Let her come first.
I will sign.

541
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,500
The other day, while he was at the office,
if only we had disciplined him properly…

542
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,166
You don't have it in you!

543
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,291
Hey!

544
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,458
You don't have to shout.
I can hear properly.

545
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,791
You are old and hard of hearing.

546
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,208
-I should be shouting.
-Who are you calling old?

547
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,208
Who…

548
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:09,875
-Father-in-law!
-Sir!

549
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,083
Be careful…

550
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,541
Who is old here?

551
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,916
Are you going to get up and dance
to prove that you are not old?

552
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,083
You want me to read it?

553
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,166
You want my signature?

554
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,708
I only sign autographs for my fans,
not just anyone and everyone.

555
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,125
Superb!

556
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:40,458
I guess he doesn't need any medicine.
He has stopped coughing all of a sudden.

557
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,958
Why bother the old guy, sir?
Why don't you just sign it?

558
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,875
There is a love story going on here.

559
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,041
I should know whether
it's a one-sided or two-way situation.

560
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,375
I won't sign until then.

561
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,583
Why do you keep provoking him, sir?

562
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,750
In my opinion, it was wrong
to talk to him in the first place.

563
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:02,958
Fine, you did.

564
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,583
She has disowned him for 25 years.

565
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,000
You should have done the same.

566
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,708
That won't do.

567
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,583
He should stop believing
that my daughter is his mother.

568
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,250
Or we should make him stop?
That is why…

569
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:19,541
it's imperative he signs the document
saying he is in no way related to us.

570
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,625
That way, my grandson will have
no hurdles. He will become an MP.

571
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,625
Ramana will confine himself to Guntur.

572
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,041
Madhu will be out of power.

573
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,208
The requirement is yours,
and the signature is his.

574
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,625
How am I concerned?

575
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,000
Because Pani…

576
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,500
Venkat Swamy never takes
no for an answer.

577
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,958
Whoever dared to say no to me is dead.

578
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,458
SHRI KANAKADURGA CHILI YARD

579
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,375
Hi, sir.

580
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,166
Hey, Balu.

581
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,500
What are you doing here?

582
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,333
-Hey, Samba!
-Yes?

583
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,333
Didn't I tell you?

584
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,916
That's Pani's daughter.

585
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,625
Remember me?

586
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,125
Well, you told me…

587
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:15,083
"The name is Ramana. It will be of use
when you come to Guntur. "

588
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,833
That is why…

589
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:18,833
Oh!

590
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,333
-Hey, Yakub!
-Sir?

591
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,333
I'm beginning to blush.

592
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:26,125
-Go, bring three cups of tea.
-Yes.

593
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,750
I refused to sign that day.
Did the old guy trouble this Pani guy…

594
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:36,333
They must have tortured him.

595
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,375
He's not in the
best situation, sir.

596
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,458
-Is he gone?
-Not yet, but…

597
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,666
-Dad!
-Dear, what happened?

598
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,625
Don't cry.

599
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,416
Why are you crying?

600
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,458
-Losing a job is okay.
-Calm down.

601
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,041
But if it costs me my life,

602
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,833
should I laugh instead of crying?

603
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,583
You can always find another job.

604
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:54,958
Don't fret about it.

605
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:59,458
Who will offer a job to a lawyer
ousted from the Law Minister's office?

606
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,375
Don't worry.

607
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,458
When she sneezes, she turns more red.

608
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,458
Very tender.

609
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,583
Yes.

610
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,541
Where are you put up?

611
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,000
Star Hotel.

612
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,958
There are no-star hotels
around here!

613
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,750
Star Hotel is just a name, sir.
It's actually a lodge.

614
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,958
It's difficult to stay in lodges
for someone so ravishing.

615
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,583
I was praising you.

616
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,666
My dad's lost job, monthly EMIs…

617
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,041
I can't handle this, Ramana.

618
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,083
She's in distress.
Why are you crying?

619
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,666
That's what I fail to understand, sir.

620
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,083
I'm not even attached to her family.

621
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,625
And yet, tears seem to flow in streams.

622
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,625
The chili here is pungent.
His eyes must be burning.

623
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,541
Oh! Makes sense.

624
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,291
What is this?

625
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,041
Just one signature.

626
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,916
Do you know
what the old guy has written?

627
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,791
I know, sir.
Actually, I was the one who drafted it.

628
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:25,208
You should forget your mother.
Isn't that all?

629
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,541
Like a boy going to a boarding school…

630
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,750
I don't understand
why you have to act so dramatic.

631
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,750
After all, your mother left you long ago.

632
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:36,958
Am I right?

633
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,083
Hey!

634
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,083
Did he tell you
why he didn't buy it from us?

635
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,250
Some guy offered him a discount
of ten thousand rupees on each load.

636
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,000
Did he say who?

637
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,541
Go, have your lunch.

638
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,916
Before you reach the last course,
he will spill all the beans.

639
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,500
He has been buying red chili
from us for ten years now!

640
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,083
When some guy offered you a discount…

641
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:09,750
"Madam, I have this offer.
What shall I do?"

642
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,500
Shouldn't you have asked me that?
Idiot! Don't let me hit you!

643
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,708
You want to be consulted
about chili in the curry…

644
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:17,666
as well as chili in the truck.

645
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,666
What did you say?

646
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,041
Nothing.

647
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,333
You are playing my mouthpiece as well.

648
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,750
I just wanted
to play the listener this time.

649
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,416
That's it.

650
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,666
Why are you being so gentle?

651
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:34,666
Hit him so hard that he divulges the name
of his mistress in front of his wife!

652
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,250
Give me his phone.

653
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,041
This is the guy who stopped him
from buying chili from us.

654
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,666
-Who is it?
-Hey!

655
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:52,166
Touch him, and I will see your end!

656
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,041
You were saying something, Uncle?

657
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,500
Stay there.

658
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,291
If I don't come there in ten minutes
and burn you all up,

659
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,625
I will change my name from Marx!

660
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,083
Changing name and place at this age
on the Aadhar card and ration card

661
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,250
is a big headache.

662
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,541
Hey, Samba!

663
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,541
Yes?

664
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,166
Put him in the vehicle.

665
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,541
Let's go and say hello to Uncle Marx.

666
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:22,833
Uncle!

667
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,583
You burned down our warehouse
and sent my dad to jail.

668
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,250
You got your elder brother killed.

669
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,875
Don't panic. I got him.

670
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,333
But you are still vengeful.

671
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:32,750
That's why I have come to settle this
once and for all.

672
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,083
The vehicle is here.
Where is the boy?

673
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:45,500
{\an8}Admit that it was wrong
to snatch our business.

674
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,291
{\an8}The boy himself will come to you jumping.

675
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,416
Himself?

676
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:52,416
Are you going to wait
until I fall at his feet?

677
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:53,750
You bloody…

678
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,791
Right!

679
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,333
Hey!

680
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,875
You want to monopolize
the chili business?

681
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,125
Don't we have the load or a truck?

682
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:09,708
Today, Satya is going to lose his son
in addition to his estranged wife!

683
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,125
I want him at my feet.

684
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,916
I will see how he will exit
from my compound.

685
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:30,250
-Let's thrash him! Don't spare him.
-Come on! Let's go!

686
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,083
Hit him!

687
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,666
Excellent!

688
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,083
Hit him!

689
00:42:55,958 --> 00:43:00,375
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

690
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,208
Come here.

691
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,375
Come to this side.

692
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,875
<i>Hey!</i>

693
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:20,750
<i>A warm desire enters my heart</i>
<i>And throws me off my feet</i>

694
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,208
Bravo!

695
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,125
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

696
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,416
Uncle, stop sitting around.

697
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:18,875
Lie down. I will explain.

698
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,458
Uncle!

699
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,458
Something has been bothering me
since I came.

700
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Why have you put up a tent in winter?

701
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,375
Well, it's your money and your pleasure.

702
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:38,541
How dare he?

703
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:40,583
Hey! Why are you walking away?

704
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,625
His father has been
pestering me with calls.

705
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:43,666
Where is he?

706
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,083
Where the heck is he?

707
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,458
Uncle!

708
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,625
-Shut it!
-What?

709
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,333
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

710
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:22,958
Move!

711
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,750
Our car was crushed under the shed.
A shard of tile landed on my head.

712
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:42,791
Oh, God!

713
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:48,875
Is your car insured?

714
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:51,208
The mechanic is my guy.
He will get it ready in two days.

715
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,125
What is your story?

716
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,333
Didn't you say it yourself

717
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:59,291
that girls like me cannot stay in lodges?

718
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:00,833
So…

719
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:01,958
So…

720
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,166
So? You walk in with your suitcases?

721
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:08,166
There are no rooms here.

722
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:09,791
Hey, be quiet.

723
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,458
You are obedient.

724
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,333
You will come up in life.

725
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,500
Listen.

726
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,291
My aunt doesn't appreciate people
standing around.

727
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:23,250
Yes.

728
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,708
Go and stay in the room
under the staircase.

729
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,125
-What?
-Yes.

730
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,375
My clothes are there.

731
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:30,166
Which room doesn't have your clothes?

732
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,250
Burn them up,
and half the problem will be solved.

733
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,166
Sure, set them on fire. It's your
dad's money. She's got nothing to lose.

734
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,541
He has given you a room. Go.

735
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,000
Let's go.

736
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:46,541
What is it?

737
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,083
My accommodation?

738
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,541
-Your accommodation?
-Yes.

739
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,125
-You are a man.
-Yes, sir.

740
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,000
-You can stay anywhere.
-True.

741
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,708
Make sure you don't enter the rooms.

742
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:57,500
Sir?

743
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,958
-This is your bedroom?
-Exactly!

744
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,666
This is my balcony.

745
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,500
What about the toilet?

746
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,875
He said, "It's disgusting
to do it in the house.

747
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,791
Do your business under some tree. "

748
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,291
-Who?
-Who else?

749
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:10,875
My harasser, Ramana.

750
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,833
How come she hasn't called me yet?

751
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,666
Will she take it easy if I relax?

752
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,875
Let me send her a photo.

753
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,666
Is it your dad?

754
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,208
What did he send?

755
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,458
Does he want us to buy this from here?

756
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,458
He says he will hang himself
if he doesn't get the signature.

757
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,458
Cheap! He is not going to sign.

758
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:33,458
He only fines people.
He never signs.

759
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:37,750
Ramu…

760
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,291
I tried to open the window,
but it was stuck.

761
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:44,583
Can you please help?

762
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,208
What did she say?

763
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,916
-Something about the window--
-No…

764
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:55,541
Before that.

765
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,833
Ramu?

766
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:02,291
I never realized
how good my name sounds!

767
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,833
I never knew Ramana could be
shortened as Ramu, sir.

768
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,250
Excuse me!

769
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,583
Can I ask you something?

770
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:13,500
You shouldn't mind.

771
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,458
Do you rip your clothes
before putting them on or afterward?

772
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,625
It's ripped jeans, Ramu.

773
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,541
I guess they are more expensive
than regular jeans.

774
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:24,500
How do you know, sir?

775
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,916
I can tell from where
they are ripped and how much they show.

776
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,708
They are a different category.

777
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,416
Aren't they nice?

778
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,375
You look phenomenal.

779
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,958
Wow!

780
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,333
What did I say about Pani's daughter?

781
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:42,625
First, you said she's ravishing.

782
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,458
Then you said
she's delightfully ravishing.

783
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:45,833
She is not just delightful.

784
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:47,791
She is bloody delightful.

785
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,041
I will note that.

786
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:51,541
-Did you put it to dry?
-Yes, I did.

787
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:52,875
Did you eat yet?

788
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,291
I wasn't offered.

789
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,666
-Don't be shy in your own house.
-That's right.

790
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,041
Go out and eat.

791
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,625
<i>Madam, listen. </i>

792
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:08,625
<i>You became a minister</i>
<i>to make solid money, </i>

793
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,791
<i>not to appoint a Commission</i>
<i>on the double murder</i>

794
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,833
<i>that occurred five years ago. </i>
<i>Note that down. </i>

795
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,500
<i>You probably think Hari Das is the same</i>
<i>old Das who partnered with your father. </i>

796
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,291
<i>That was a tale of the past. </i>

797
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:25,166
Now, you want to call me,
inquire, and throw me in jail?

798
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:27,416
The state will be on fire.

799
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,791
<i>You want to call Das and inquire?</i>

800
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:33,000
Will the judge you have appointed
come to your office?

801
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:46,875
Excuse me, ma'am.

802
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,208
Mr. Alok has a message for you.

803
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:53,791
Due to personal reasons, he has
withdrawn from the Hari Das Commission.

804
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:59,125
Shocking!

805
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:08,083
A judge can be replaced in a week.

806
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:11,500
A minister can be replaced in ten days.

807
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:16,125
But when Hari Das goes to prison,
it will take him twenty years to get out.

808
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,916
Why mess with him?

809
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,791
Listen to me.

810
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:39,083
Even a vile person has some principles,
but he doesn't.

811
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,041
He may not have principles…

812
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,125
but I have responsibilities.

813
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,541
-Narayan…
-Tell me?

814
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:53,458
How did Das know that the judge
was going to come here?

815
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,833
Why do you say that?

816
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,833
We have appointed the Commission.
How would he not know?

817
00:51:56,916 --> 00:51:59,041
Not before we could announce.

818
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:00,708
Kata Madhu must have told him.

819
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:02,541
You can't relax in politics.

820
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,083
Get your son ready.

821
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,375
If his mother is in power,
he'll be an MP or else an MLA.

822
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,833
-Yes…
-Sir?

823
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:10,916
What happened to the signature?

824
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:15,291
-It's not done yet, sir. I--
-You…

825
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:34,791
Hey, where to?

826
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:38,166
There's no specific direction.
Just going with the flow.

827
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,333
Wear these glasses.
Let me see if they increase your glamour.

828
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,416
Oh!

829
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,708
-Great.
-Thank you, sir.

830
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:48,791
Face sideways.

831
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:52,250
Wow!

832
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:54,500
You look smooth and shiny.

833
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:55,625
I feel embarrassed, sir.

834
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:56,833
So do I.

835
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:59,333
Turn that way.
Don't change your posture.

836
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:03,583
Coffee.

837
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,250
You don't use all that, do you?

838
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:14,000
I don't need it.

839
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:15,583
You should learn.

840
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:18,125
Besides the clothes…

841
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,083
Those perfumes and creams…

842
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,541
Stop moving.

843
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,416
Excuse me!

844
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,000
Please groom her as well.

845
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:35,583
If you don't mind,
can I say something?

846
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:37,458
Sure.

847
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:39,958
Your eyes are mesmerizing enough.

848
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,541
Don't wear eyeliner and kohl.

849
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:45,541
Stupid boys like me fall for you.

850
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:47,375
Don't embarrass me, Ramu.

851
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,833
Wow…

852
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,791
Gosh, I never knew
there was so much melody in my name!

853
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,708
What's with those sunglasses?

854
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,000
You look like a pickpocket.
Take them off.

855
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,375
You said they looked great earlier.

856
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:06,708
She was here earlier.

857
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,791
She won't return, I guess.

858
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,333
If we ask him now, he would sign
with his blood instead of ink.

859
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:26,083
Let's find the right time and get it.

860
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:27,125
Yes!

861
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,375
He started drinking.

862
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:34,416
I can see it.

863
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:35,958
Hi, sir!

864
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:39,041
-Why are you peeking like a thief?
-This is your private time, sir.

865
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,916
Oh, wow. Can I join, sir?

866
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:42,916
Is this some school to join?

867
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,416
All you need is a glass.

868
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,375
Well said, sir.
Thank you.

869
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,083
All said and done…

870
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,166
Raji's clothes look more appealing on you.

871
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:58,541
You look great.

872
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,166
Is it scotch, sir?
I didn't expect this.

873
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:04,375
Only the bottle is foreign.
The drink inside is local.

874
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:07,166
-Little. Just a little.
-Okay.

875
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,250
-So, Balu…
-Sir?

876
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,583
-That's enough.
-What is your full name?

877
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,375
Bala Subramanyam, sir.

878
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,083
-S. P. B?
-Just B.

879
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,250
You are named after a legend.

880
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,291
Thank you, sir.

881
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:22,250
-With his inspiration…
-Sir…

882
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,750
Sing a nice song.

883
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:26,791
I have a problem with my pitch, sir.

884
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,250
Why bring up cricket
in the middle of a song?

885
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,625
Not that "pitch. " The tune.

886
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,375
This is not the Indian Idol.

887
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,000
It's just a warehouse.

888
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,291
Forget about making mistakes.
You can try, come on.

889
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,708
Okay, sir.

890
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:39,791
Why are you looking at me like that?

891
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:42,875
Would you like some beer?

892
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:44,583
Sir, you are crossing a line there.

893
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,916
Is this some Kabaddi match
to cross lines?

894
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
She is a kid, sir.

895
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,958
They fill the bars these days!

896
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,041
Let's not touch on a controversial topic.

897
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,083
Do you have vodka?

898
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,208
Hey…

899
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,791
-Soda or water?
-Juice.

900
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,375
Health conscious, I see.

901
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,583
-Hey, Yakub.
-Sir.

902
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,166
What is it?

903
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:15,791
I carried her to school in these arms.

904
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,833
Take her to the bar
tomorrow onwards.

905
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:18,958
No way.

906
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,500
Stop being dramatic and sing a song.

907
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,208
Any specific song, sir?

908
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:26,583
-Any song will do.
-Okay, fine.

909
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,500
Why don't I sing the same song?
To hell with it.

910
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:39,208
<i>I've loved you, and I'll always love you</i>

911
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:46,416
<i>Even after death, I'll keep loving you</i>

912
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:51,375
<i>When I remember you</i>
<i>Then my tears--</i>

913
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,708
I was singing a nice song, sir.
Why did you hit me?

914
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:56,958
Sridevi…

915
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,083
I feel like crying when I think of her.

916
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:04,750
May her great soul rest in peace.

917
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:07,083
Sing a song of someone who's alive.

918
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,833
Sing a happy song.

919
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,875
Sing something that's
soothing and delightful.

920
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:13,958
Idiot.

921
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,083
I'll play it on my phone.

922
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:26,416
<i>-Tell me, oh, cool breeze!</i>
-Wow, what a song!

923
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,125
<i>-Embrace me with your chills</i>
-Wow!

924
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:33,375
How come I hear music with your song?

925
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:34,791
I wasn't singing.
I played it on my phone.

926
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:35,791
Oh.

927
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,083
Play it.

928
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:42,291
<i>Tell me, oh, cool breeze</i>
<i>Embrace me with your chills</i>

929
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:47,583
<i>Where the celebration of joy is</i>

930
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:51,458
<i>Lead me there and tell me</i>

931
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:53,208
Bhumika!

932
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:57,500
Wow! What a girl!

933
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,833
Wow!

934
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,375
What a dancer!

935
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:04,583
He has stopped making them.

936
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,458
They barely have any flesh on them now.

937
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:11,583
Hugging them is like hugging yourself.

938
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:15,000
We don't understand what they say.

939
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,291
They don't understand what we say.

940
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,333
They don't know how to play or to sway.

941
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,791
Don't even get me started
on their language.

942
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,375
Baby…

943
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:33,875
Phone.

944
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:09,291
She looks like Prabhu Deva's dupe.

945
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,708
Are there any bones in her body or not?

946
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,875
Forget about her body.
Where is the cigarette, sir?

947
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:21,750
Updated version.

948
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,000
-Balu.
-Baby?

949
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,625
Go to my library.

950
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,875
-Play song fifteen.
-Done.

951
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:42,708
Volume at twenty.

952
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:56,791
<i>Hey!</i>

953
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:02,500
<i>Hey!</i>

954
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:18,250
<i>Check if it has fallen close by</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

955
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:24,000
<i>Check if it has fallen near you</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

956
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:29,750
<i>Check if it has fallen close by</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

957
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:35,333
<i>Check if it has fallen near you</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

958
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,375
Sorry, sir.

959
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,250
Why was my lungi snatched?

960
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,208
Probably, she got too carried away
by the dance, sir.

961
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:05,791
-What dance was that?
-Right, sir.

962
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,250
You have brought Prabhu Deva's dupe.

963
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,583
Whoa!

964
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:12,958
I couldn't match her energy.

965
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,208
I haven't danced like this
in my entire career.

966
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:17,833
My goodness.

967
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:20,500
Whatever you say…

968
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,000
I have enjoyed a lot, man.

969
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,208
Same here, sir.

970
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:26,708
-Life is all about these small moments.
-True, sir.

971
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:33,875
Why are you pulling a pen
out of your blouse?

972
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:37,458
Why are you pulling out a paper
from your pocket?

973
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:41,791
This small moment calls
for a scribble of your initials, sir.

974
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,541
So, you didn't come here
for entertainment?

975
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:47,958
You clearly have an agenda.

976
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:51,791
-Hold this for me, please.
-Okay.

977
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:57,833
Slowly.

978
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:59,958
He was drunk last night
and spared you with a slap.

979
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,291
If he sees us when he gets sober,
he will kill us.

980
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,375
-Thank God!
-Let's sneak out before he wakes up.

981
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,000
-Let's go.
-We won't ever see him again.

982
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,541
It should just remain a dream.

983
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:09,666
-The garage is that way.
-Yes.

984
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,666
Here's the money.
Is the car ready?

985
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,333
The headlight isn't working.

986
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:15,541
Let it be. Anyway, it is daytime.

987
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,041
The brakes aren't working either.

988
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,541
-We won't use them.
-That's the spirit.

989
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:19,875
-Keys, sir!
-Give it here!

990
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,291
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

991
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:25,916
No looking back!

992
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,250
-What is that?
-Looks like some statue.

993
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,250
Whose?

994
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,500
Who is the scoundrel
that knocked down my father's statue?

995
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:41,291
Who are you?!

996
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,000
How dare you?!

997
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:44,791
Satyam killed my father!

998
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:46,958
Now, his guests won't even
spare his statue!

999
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,416
Get them!

1000
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:51,291
-Sir, it's a mistake. It was an accident.
-Shut up!

1001
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,791
Tell us if you want money.
Madam can give you.

1002
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:53,958
Who wants your money?

1003
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,416
So, what do you expect from us?

1004
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,541
You better fix the head of the statue,
or I will replace it with yours!

1005
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,666
-Hey, hurry up! Fast!
-I'm not a great artist, sir!

1006
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,458
-Fix it. Come on!
-Sir! Hey!

1007
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:04,625
Hey, stop them! Please, sir.

1008
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:05,916
Sir, stop them.

1009
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,875
Don't do this, sir. This is wrong.

1010
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,875
-We didn't do it on purpose, sir.
-Sir…

1011
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,208
Listen to me, sir.

1012
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,541
Madam is in the car. What are you doing?
Listen to me.

1013
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:19,083
-Get her!
-Sir!

1014
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:20,833
Please ask them to stop, sir.

1015
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:22,125
We offered them money,
and they still won't listen.

1016
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:23,708
Was his father some Ambedkar or Gandhi?

1017
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:28,125
My elder brother.

1018
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:32,000
I will pawn my head if need be,
but I will get the statue redone.

1019
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,541
Not this head, sir. My head.

1020
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,666
-Why discuss it with her, Uncle? Come!
-Hey, let her go!

1021
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,708
-Hey!
-Hey, catch him!

1022
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,583
What was that?

1023
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,708
Who did this?

1024
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,666
Who is that?

1025
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,833
What is this brute force against women?

1026
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,250
-Against women, really?
-Hey!

1027
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,291
Let him go.
They have done something wrong.

1028
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:20,708
As if he has done some engineering!

1029
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:23,083
-An offender shall be punished.
-Let me go.

1030
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,208
Really?

1031
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,291
Uncle, please don't act
like Ajay Devgn in <i>Singham. </i>

1032
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:29,791
It doesn't suit you.

1033
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,958
-Limit the issue to the statue.
-Is it so?

1034
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,833
-I heard this statue is a jinx.
-Let go of my hand.

1035
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:37,875
If someone looks at it,
their work seems to go awry.

1036
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,375
-Why don't you tell him, guys?
-He doesn't listen, you know.

1037
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,333
Hey, what are you just watching
and not beating him up?

1038
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:43,541
Hey!

1039
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:48,416
If anyone steps forward,
I will twist this idiot's arm so much,

1040
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,291
-it will get dislodged from the groove.
-Hey…

1041
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:52,791
Let me go.

1042
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:55,000
-I am letting her go. Now, let go of him.
-Let me go.

1043
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:01,250
-Hey, Balu!
-Sir.

1044
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,916
-My hand.
-Go and sit in the car first.

1045
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,250
Come.

1046
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,541
-Call me once the car is ready.
-Sure, sir.

1047
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:25,583
I will let you know.

1048
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,833
<i>The sugar cube in my coffee cup is you</i>
<i>It's you</i>

1049
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:10,041
<i>The tracery of kohl around my eyes is you</i>
<i>It's you</i>

1050
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,333
<i>The blush of chrysanthemum on my cheeks</i>
<i>Is you, it's you</i>

1051
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,375
<i>You wrap around my breath like perfume</i>

1052
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,708
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to pinch your cheeks</i>

1053
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:26,833
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to kiss you many times</i>

1054
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:31,875
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>With my stole, let me make you a tie</i>

1055
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:44,166
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1056
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,125
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1057
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:52,458
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1058
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:56,583
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1059
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,875
Hey, Balu.

1060
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:25,666
<i>You are the sun who is my wake-up call</i>
<i>With his warm touch</i>

1061
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,791
<i>You are the full moon</i>
<i>Jumping over my balcony walls</i>

1062
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:34,000
<i>You are the one among millions</i>
<i>Born only for me</i>

1063
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,833
<i>I became your wife in secret</i>
<i>As soon as I opened my eyes</i>

1064
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:42,000
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to lie next to you</i>

1065
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:46,166
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to watch the stars with you</i>

1066
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:51,166
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to fill the space in your embrace</i>

1067
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:59,250
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1068
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:03,541
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1069
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:07,708
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1070
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:11,166
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1071
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,750
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1072
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:18,250
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1073
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:21,041
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1074
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,500
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1075
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,833
Ramana is heading back.

1076
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,458
Some other time.

1077
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,208
Excuse me!

1078
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,791
Ask your mom to ward off the evil eye.

1079
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:01,875
You look gorgeous in that dress.

1080
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,291
How come you have become so thin?

1081
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,083
-They don't serve rice in Guntur.
-Really?

1082
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,833
I wonder what they served instead.

1083
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:21,791
Sir, the girl has returned,
and he has left.

1084
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,125
Sir.

1085
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:24,750
What is this, sir?

1086
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,333
You call yourself a lawyer,
but where is your clarity?

1087
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:29,000
When you say, "The girl has returned, "
do you mean the neighbor or your maid?

1088
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,791
"My daughter has returned. "
That's clarity.

1089
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,916
Where did she come back from?
From a different city.

1090
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,791
Who dropped her off?
Ramana dropped her off.

1091
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:35,791
More clarity.

1092
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:36,750
Did he come inside?

1093
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:40,458
Since we don't offer any pleasantries,
he took a U-turn and left.

1094
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,666
Utmost clarity.

1095
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,541
You know how relieving
this narrative is, sir?

1096
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:44,750
Who am I talking to?

1097
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:46,333
-I don't need clarity on that--
-Hey, listen!

1098
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,166
I'm talking to Mr. Venkat Swamy.

1099
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:49,416
Why am I talking to him?

1100
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,041
To get Ramana arrested.

1101
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:53,583
This is what you call clarity.

1102
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,916
Why should he be arrested?
Don't we need clarity on that matter?

1103
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,166
You don't need that clarity.

1104
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:58,333
Idiot.

1105
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,166
Why are you blocking the road?

1106
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,291
Have you lost your way?

1107
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:48,208
Bhogineni Veera Venkat Ramana.

1108
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,041
What's your full name, chap?

1109
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,916
You can't call me "chap"
just because you can wag your tongue.

1110
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:00,833
My arm will start acting then.

1111
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,833
I don't know which way I might twist it.

1112
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,375
What can you twist?

1113
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:07,875
There's a case against you for picking up
a fight with Mr. Vyra Venkat Swamy.

1114
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:11,416
You mean the brawl
at the party office?

1115
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:12,708
At home.

1116
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:17,916
How much did you charge the old man?

1117
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,708
Don't cross the line.

1118
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,166
Is this your first time
at the police station?

1119
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:25,166
I'm not an employee like you
to come here regularly.

1120
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,666
How dare you…

1121
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,875
{\an8}Let go of my hand.

1122
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:35,791
I will flay you, bloody fool!

1123
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,791
Let him remove his uniform.

1124
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:40,416
I will break this rogue's leg!

1125
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,791
What makes you so arrogant?

1126
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,125
Arrogant?

1127
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,166
I don't become arrogant
due to others' strength.

1128
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:48,416
I am like Shah Rukh.

1129
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:49,833
The king!

1130
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,541
Let's put you behind bars
for a week and polish you.

1131
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:53,875
We will know what type you are!

1132
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,833
Am I some brass vessel
that he wants to polish me?

1133
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:01,458
Some useless idiot
will come with bail for me.

1134
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:04,791
We will discuss more on polishing
or getting polished.

1135
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,166
-Sir?
-Hey, Balu!

1136
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,958
I just said, "Some useless idiot, "
and you walked in! What timing!

1137
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:11,000
I have got you bail, sir.

1138
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,125
-You have got me bail?
-Yes, sir.

1139
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,083
Why?

1140
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,333
Actually, sir, during my journey with you…

1141
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,291
During your journey?

1142
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:21,833
-Don't say it and kill my feelings.
-Okay, sir.

1143
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:25,750
Your boss files a case, and you
submit bail. Is this your side hustle?

1144
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:27,458
Look who's talking about side hustle!

1145
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,125
Pani filed this case?

1146
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:30,291
Yes, sir.

1147
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,666
What have I done?

1148
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,833
They have written all lies.

1149
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,083
Why don't we make it real?

1150
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:05,791
Well, Pani…

1151
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:06,958
Sir?

1152
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:11,333
Why did your junior choose a losing case
for his first assignment?

1153
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:15,875
Hey, Mr. Spicy Pepper!

1154
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,625
Listen.

1155
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,833
In a powerful household like ours,

1156
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,291
one son is a blessing.

1157
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,791
Two is a problem.

1158
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:29,291
If the second one turns out
to be like you, it's disgusting.

1159
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,750
-Sir, actually--
-I'm old. I might forget.

1160
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:32,791
Let me finish.

1161
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:39,458
Kids leave their parents
in old age homes these days.

1162
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:43,125
Why did you drive so far
to meet your mother?

1163
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:46,875
Get those papers.

1164
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:48,500
Listen!

1165
01:13:49,416 --> 01:13:50,708
The papers are here.

1166
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:53,166
The case is in the court.

1167
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,208
It's a false case, of course.

1168
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:58,291
If you choose a fight, prepare a counter
and go to court.

1169
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:00,916
If you choose peace,
sign the papers and go home.

1170
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,291
-Balu.
-Sir.

1171
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,375
You wrote the FIR, didn't you?

1172
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,250
-Yes.
-Read it without spelling mistakes.

Ramana, son of Bhogineni Satyanarayan,

alias Royal Satya, forcefully entered
my house around 10:20 a. m. today.

1182
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,375
He broke my eighty-five-inch, smart TV…

1183
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:57,958
using the ashtray from the center table.

1184
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:00,333
He smashed it into pieces. "

1185
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:02,291
Hey!

1186
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,875
Hey, what are you doing?

1187
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,166
Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

dining table chair…"

-Stop him!

1193
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:31,041
and smashed the expensive French window.

1194
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:37,500
He threw the Italian silverware
and food kept for guests

1195
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:39,958
onto the ground
without any discrimination.

1196
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,583
He destroyed the cupboard
in the dining hall, along with…

1197

the items inside!

1198
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:58,875
He recklessly
beat up the security on duty,

who tried to stop him.

Mr. Pakka Narayan,

and unmindful of his age,
disrespectfully slapped him. "

Oh, God!

1208
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,125
Where did they raise you?

1209
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:58,083
In their house
or on the streets of Guntur?

1210
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,875
Ask him why he is here.

1211
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,375
What does he want?

1212
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:08,083
Property?

1213
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:11,625
Talk to Pani and take whatever you want.

1214
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,625
If you throw a stone at a tree,
you might get some fruit.

If you throw a stone into a mire,
what will you possibly get?

give me the papers.

1219
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:12,458
Hunger remains unsatisfied
unless the mother herself serves you.

1220
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:13,500
It's a proverb.

1221
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,041
Don't forget to read the last line, Pani.

Why?

1228
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,708
Actually, the reason I signed--

1229
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:07,250
You lied for your father.

1230
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,333
Why should you tell the truth for me?

1231
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,958
You remembered me in Guntur.

1232
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,041
And you sidelined me in the city.

1233
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:18,375
You are justified.

1234
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:25,208
Why did she ask me who raised me?

1235
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:27,875
Ideally, she should have raised me.

1236
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:31,458
But you told me it's a love story
between you and your mom, sir.

1237
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:32,666
Love, my foot!

1238
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,958
The way she glared down
and said, "Clear the trash!"

1239
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,208
Did you see that?

1240
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:42,833
Who do you think the trash was?

1241
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:44,583
It was me, her son.

1242
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:48,833
Did you think she meant
the broken glass and porcelain?

1243
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,916
My mother, who should have hit me
when I was a kid,

1244
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,125
now invites me over
and slaps me in all dignity.

1245
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,208
This chap, Ramana…

1246
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,458
His life is a miracle!

1247
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:10,166
His mother doesn't want him.
His father doesn't remember him.

1248
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,041
On the outside, it's fair and lovely.

1249
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,416
Deep inside, it's all unfair and lonely.

1250
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:32,833
Doesn't light up.

1251
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:34,958
Just like my life.

Bro, he is Kata Madhu.

1254
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,041
He says he doesn't get along
with your grandfather.

1255
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:08,416
What does he want?

1256
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,333
I heard they slapped
a false case against you,

1257
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:12,708
beat you up, and coerced you to sign.

1258
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,458
Are we living in a democracy or a jungle?

1259
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:17,000
Do they think there's no one
to question them?

1260
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:20,583
I will make you contest against her.

1261
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:22,166
I will spend a hundred crores
if necessary.

1262
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:23,916
I will send you to the Assembly.

1263
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,416
All that is fine, boss.

1264
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,666
How do you know about this?

1265
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:31,000
Because their driver is on my payroll.

1266
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,541
-Really?
-Yes.

1267
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:35,208
Hey, Samba.

1268
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,166
I want to have a heart-to-heart
conversation with him.

1269
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,291
Close the shutter.

1270
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,625
I don't think
I need to teach you the ropes of politics.

1271
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,208
I just wanted to meet my mom…

1272
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,208
not win against her.

1273
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:06,916
Son, please let go of me.
I won't trouble anyone. Forgive me.

1274
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:08,083
That boy…

1275
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:13,166
The first emotion I had
when I saw Ramana was pity.

1276
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:17,250
{\an8}I asked him, "I want to make you contest
against your mother. What do you feel?"

1277
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,166
He almost hugged me.

1278
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,416
Trust me, I couldn't even breathe!

1279
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,541
{\an8}He made me his guru.

1280
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,583
He was holding my feet.

1281
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:27,500
I asked him if he had any proof.

1282
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:29,708
That's it.
He immediately went home

1283
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:32,625
and got me a family picture
from a treasured box.

1284
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:36,250
Venkat Swamy!

1285
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,333
I have only one thing to say.

1286
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,333
Your grandson or this one?

1287
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:45,041
If you ask us to choose between
Raj Gopal or Venkat Ramana…

1288
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:47,458
{\an8}<i>we stand with Venkat Ramana. </i>

1289
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:49,583
<i>You better understand this. </i>

1290
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:52,708
<i>Otherwise… the public</i>
<i>will make you realize. </i>

1291
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:59,041
Unlike his dad, he doesn't sit
at home behind closed doors.

1292
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:01,333
He barges into our house,
breaking open all doors.

1293
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,916
Because that is Royal Satyam.

1294
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:05,541
He's an old engine.

1295
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:09,416
And this is Rowdy Ramana,
a new engine of 1800cc.

1296
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:10,583
Right, sir.

1297
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:14,208
If he comes before the public and speaks,
our party won't even get the deposits.

1298
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:19,291
He is a truck without brakes.

1299
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,791
Who can stop him?

1300
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:31,541
{\an8}Why are the cops here, sir?

1301
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:33,458
{\an8}Sir…

1302
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:35,625
{\an8}They are the most prominent family
in this area, sir.

1303
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,541
Please approach with caution, sir.

1304
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,708
I mean, with love.

1305
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,458
Ma'am?

1306
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:55,500
Dussehra is over.
We even gave donations, didn't we?

1307
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:57,583
She's just a kid, sir.
I will make her understand.

1308
01:24:57,666 --> 01:24:59,291
Sir has come from Hyderabad.

1309
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:01,375
It's shocking how people have started
traveling so far for donations!

1310
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,375
Hey! Don't you get derisive!

1311
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,166
Donations? Again?!

1312
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,125
How many times should we give?

1313
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:08,416
Come back next year. Leave!

1314
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:11,750
Hey, don't infuriate me!
I will lock you all up!

1315
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:14,041
{\an8}What? For donations?
Sure, try me!

1316
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:15,541
{\an8}Hey, hold up.
Just wait.

1317
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,250
{\an8}-What is the issue?
-There is no issue.

1318
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:20,166
{\an8}If Venkat Ramana comes,
we need to go to Hyderabad.

1319
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:22,166
If you don't know the way,
we can send someone to guide you.

1320
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,458
Why do you want Ramana?

1321
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,250
{\an8}What is this?

1322
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:27,250
{\an8}No one here
gives a straightforward response!

1323
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:29,000
{\an8}Didn't I tell you to think twice, sir?

1324
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:35,000
Hey, Narayan!

1325
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:38,250
Why have you come with so many cops?
Were you missing me?

1326
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:41,750
With the kind of bail you have, you need
my permission before leaving the city.

1327
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:44,416
{\an8}But you roam as you please.
And why wouldn't I miss you?

1328
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:46,500
{\an8}We have to report to the station.
Let's go.

1329
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:47,875
What will you do if I don't?

1330
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:49,750
{\an8}I'll grab your collar and drag you there!

1331
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:50,875
You will do no such thing!

1332
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:53,750
-Run for your life!
-Grab him!

1333
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,166
Hey!

1334
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,250
-What is he saying?
-What should we do with him?

1335
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:03,666
He is a cop.

1336
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,000
Are you going to crush him?

1337
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:07,291
Let go of him. Leave him.

1338
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:09,791
Mohammed.

1339
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,875
Mohammed!

1340
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,291
Sir, over here!

1341
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:16,250
I have been telling you
to handle it with care!

1342
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,875
-Hey, Samba.
-Yes?

1343
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:20,666
What is the gentleman saying?

1344
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,125
He says he will kill us if we let him go.

1345
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,583
Bravo!

1346
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:26,375
Narayan…

1347
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,416
Venkat Swamy had called you, right?

1348
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:31,958
{\an8}He asked you to pick me up, right?

1349
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:34,666
Go, tell the old man.

1350
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,708
Ramana's collar is not starched.

1351
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:41,041
It is stiff with arrogance.

1352
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:44,000
Tell him if he touches it,
he will burn himself.

1353
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,125
Gun? My gun!

1354
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:51,500
What will you do with the CI's gun?

1355
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,083
You want to play with it?

1356
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,333
Give it back.

1357
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:56,541
You…

1358
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:58,916
Sir.

1359
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:06,000
-Why did you take a picture?
-In case I need it…

1360
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:07,083
To garland?

1361
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:10,250
Hey!

1362
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,958
Escort the CI to his Jeep.

1363
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,541
-Come on, let's go!
-Come on!

1364
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:16,541
Ramana.

1365
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:27,791
What is the matter?

1366
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:29,750
Why were the police here?

1367
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:32,083
Your son went
to Minister Vasundhara's house.

1368
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,458
He beat up their people.

1369
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:35,458
{\an8}He damaged their furniture.

1370
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,250
{\an8}We came to question him,
and he's threatening us!

1371
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:39,125
{\an8}I'm telling you,
I will not spare him!

1372
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:40,083
It's a warning!

1373
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,541
Hey, no!

1374
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:44,041
Move aside!
We will take care of it later!

1375
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,583
Hey, move! Give way!

1376
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:49,208
Are you a rowdy?

1377
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:51,958
-Or some goon?
-Wow!

1378
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:56,583
Mr. Satya has finally opened his mouth
and chided me.

1379
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,208
It's going to rain today.

1380
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:00,750
He only smashed things.

1381
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:03,041
I would have burnt the place down.

1382
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:05,375
You say enough things
to instigate him.

1383
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:07,458
Hey!

1384
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,833
If you have to sign, just go and sign.

1385
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:11,375
Why did you have to fight?

1386
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,166
They filed a case against me.

1387
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:14,666
Do you expect me to honor them?

1388
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,625
Should I sit gazing out of the window,
just like you?

1389
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,958
To believe he's searching for his wife…
Hyderabad is not that way.

1390
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,041
It's this way.

1391
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:23,916
No one knows what he keeps looking at.

1392
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,125
I did what was written in the complaint.

1393
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:30,208
Has he killed anyone
that you're interrogating him?

1394
01:28:30,291 --> 01:28:31,166
Bujji!

1395
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,416
Hey…

1396
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:37,250
Do you even know why she left me?

1397
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:40,083
For you.

1398
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,291
<i>After the blast at the warehouse…</i>

1399
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:48,166
<i>I wanted to get your uncle out of jail. </i>

1400
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:52,666
<i>And she wanted to take you to the hospital</i>
<i>for your eye. </i>

1401
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,916
<i>We had a fight over our priorities. </i>

1402
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:59,458
<i>I was young and arrogant. </i>

1403
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:00,791
<i>I scolded your mother. </i>

1404
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:03,958
<i>I mentioned that I knew</i>
<i>when to get my son treated. </i>

1405
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:05,000
Satya!

1406
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:12,500
When she wanted to take you and leave…

1407
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:17,000
in my state of confusion,
I requested the door to be closed.

1408
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:20,083
Your aunt never disobeys her brother.

1409
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:22,666
She shut the door on your mother.

1410
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:34,750
That broke your mother's heart,
and she left.

1411
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:37,500
Even at the court,

1412
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:39,833
she asked your aunt about you.

1413
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:42,833
Bujji…

1414
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:45,250
please tell me his eye is fine.

1415
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,958
They say it won't go back to normal.

1416
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:52,333
They said it should have been
treated immediately.

1417
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:57,083
<i>Enraged that you had lost your eye, </i>

1418
01:29:57,541 --> 01:30:01,166
<i>though your uncle was the one who</i>
<i>stabbed, she directed her finger at me. </i>

1419
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:03,041
<i>Since his daughter had returned to him, </i>

1420
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,583
<i>your grandfather didn't say</i>
<i>I was innocent. </i>

1421
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:09,583
<i>Marx's elder brother was dead, </i>
<i>and his enemy was convicted. </i>

1422
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:11,083
<i>So, Marx remained silent. </i>

1423
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:12,041
JUNIOR CIVIL JUDGE JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE
FIRST CLASS COURT GUNTUR

1424
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:14,250
<i>I was behind bars for ten years. </i>

1425
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,541
<i>So, I couldn't meet her. </i>

1426
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:19,666
During the ten years I spent in prison…

1427
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,916
there was nobody here
to close the doors on her.

1428
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:25,166
And yet, she didn't return.

1429
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:27,208
Why didn't she take you back?

1430
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:29,333
Isn't that what you should be asking?

1431
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,750
Why do you get into a brawl instead?

1432
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:35,000
I can't come up with a solution
to my problem.

1433
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,916
That's why I keep staring
out of the window.

1434
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,291
You, on the other hand,
don't even know what the problem is!

1435
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:45,166
That's why, instead of talking,
you're trying to become like me.

1436
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:47,916
I'm afraid that…

1437
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,791
in just another four years…

1438
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:51,916
you might sit next to me
in front of the window.

1439
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:57,458
Ramana…

1440
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,458
I know why my wife left me.

1441
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,500
But…

1442
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,750
Do you know
why your mother left you?

1443
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,250
It's not that. Mr. Satya…

1444
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:19,750
Hello! Mr. Satya!

1445
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:23,750
She is the one who left me.
What should I do?

1446
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,416
If I replace the broken furniture…

1447
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:32,291
and ask her,
"Mom, why did you leave me? Tell me, "

1448
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:33,500
will she tell me?

1449
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,500
Or will she hold my hand and come back?

1450
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,500
Can you guarantee that?

1451
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,500
There he goes with his songs.

1452
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,791
She scolds, and he laments.

1453
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:50,291
They don't even give us
a chance to cry.

1454
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,041
But both have dragged me to the curb.

1455
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:58,208
I have found a great caption for my life.

1456
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:01,291
"A father staring out of the window.

1457
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:04,333
A mother shutting the door.

1458
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:06,583
As for me…
A son out and about the streets. "

1459
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:09,583
Why are you holding a spoon?

1460
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:12,666
I am a goon,
that's why she didn't want me.

1461
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,875
Let it be.

1462
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:16,041
Why should I go and ask her again?

1463
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:20,166
Every flirt seems to be getting lucky.

1464
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,458
Not a single sad song is trending!

1465
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:24,458
Yeah, you want others to cry for you.

1466
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:27,375
-Let's go for this one.
-Have you found one finally?

1467
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,833
A little on the side.

1468
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,041
-Is this okay?
-Yes. Perfect.

1469
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,208
Three, two, one!

1470
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:44,333
<i>Your love's eyes caress you</i>
<i>And yet, why do you stay unmoved?</i>

1471
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:52,000
<i>I cast a net and wait patiently</i>
<i>But is this all in vain?</i>

1472
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:55,375
She has made a
reel on Instagram.

1473
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:56,916
I guess it's for you.

1474
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:10,416
{\an8}<i>My darling friend, my heart throb</i>
<i>Look at me once, please</i>

1475
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:17,250
Must be for the video likes.

1476
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:19,958
Not because she likes me.

1477
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:25,375
<i>Sister, your dress is really nice. </i>
<i>Where did you buy it from?</i>

1478
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:27,625
Come and take it when I die.

1479
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:29,791
-Why don't you tell the poor thing?
-Shut up!

1480
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:32,791
<i>Someone who ignores a beautiful girl</i>
<i>like you has to be a fool. </i>

1481
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:33,916
<i>You can always count on me. </i>

1482
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:34,958
<i>Chill. </i>

1483
01:33:35,416 --> 01:33:37,125
He seems to have a lot of free time.

1484
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:41,416
<i>Visit Shirdi once, dear. </i>
<i>Everything will fall into place. </i>

1485
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:52,000
When the CI went to meet him yesterday,
he snatched his gun and threatened him.

1486
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,166
Clashes with the cops
and meetings with Madhu.

1487
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:56,708
He is purposely creating a nuisance
out of sheer vengeance.

1488
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:58,875
I don't want to talk about the past.

1489
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:01,208
What did your son take
in exchange for that photo?

1490
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:03,791
Whatever he had taken from you
for signing the papers.

1491
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:07,000
Talk to him once.

1492
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,833
Ask him to keep quiet,
at least until the elections conclude.

1493
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:30,083
Why have they brought
Mr. Satya's gramophone here?

1494
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:35,166
Play the rhythm.
Let me show you.

1495
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:06,208
<i>Bro, it doesn't matter how big the bill is</i>

1496
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:09,500
<i>I'm feeling low and I will have a full</i>

1497
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:13,666
<i>A thorn pierced through my heart</i>

1498
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:17,416
<i>My pain has worsened</i>

1499
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:21,208
<i>The world has changed</i>
<i>The evil has united</i>

1500
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:25,125
<i>For a sensitive man like me</i>
<i>Every day is a rotting hell</i>

1501
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:28,750
<i>No one to blame</i>
<i>I'm angry with myself</i>

1502
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,833
<i>When the sky remains unreachable</i>
<i>How long can we leap?</i>

1503
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:37,833
<i>Hey, people think they have people</i>
<i>But no one actually belongs</i>

1504
01:35:37,916 --> 01:35:41,416
<i>All relations, and endearments</i>
<i>Are just part of lip service</i>

1505
01:35:41,625 --> 01:35:45,250
<i>Hey, vexed eyes are dry of tears</i>

1506
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:49,375
<i>I look around and find that</i>
<i>I am my only lover</i>

1507
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,125
<i>Brother!</i>

1508
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:29,333
<i>Spicy and pungent!</i>

1509
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:33,041
<i>Stinging chili powder!</i>

1510
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,166
Sir…

1511
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:43,875
Sir!
A contract has been issued to kill you.

1512
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:45,208
Ammu sent me here.

1513
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:51,000
<i>Iron bar, heavy hammer</i>
<i>A single blow and broken by sparks!</i>

1514
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:53,541
{\an8}Hey!

1515
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:56,500
{\an8}Is there a Ramana here?

1516
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:00,416
One second.

1517
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:01,708
Hello…

1518
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:04,333
I see you are with a red light.

1519
01:37:04,916 --> 01:37:06,250
Are you taking us to the area?

1520
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:14,666
Got you!

1521
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,750
{\an8}Hey, come out.
Get down.

1522
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:50,041
Brother, when we asked for Ramana,
two of them had come forward.

1523
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:51,833
We brought them both as a precaution.

1524
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:53,208
Hey, Amazon!

1525
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,583
Stop the chatter and open the parcel.

1526
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,125
Hey, get down!

1527
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,583
Hey, get down!

1528
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:06,666
Sir!

1529
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:08,625
-Can't you hear me?
-Sir!

1530
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:09,958
Please get up!

1531
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:36,333
Sir…

1532
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,416
-Sir…
-Hey, Samba!

1533
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:40,500
I don't think Samba is around, sir.

1534
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:43,083
-Samba!
-Sir! Balu, sir.

1535
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:45,250
Sir, it's Balu.

1536
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
What are you doing here?

1537
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,083
Ammu has sent me.

1538
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,375
-Ammu?
-Yes.

1539
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:54,875
Why did she send you?

1540
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:57,166
Some Babji has been given a contract
to kill you, sir.

1541
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,250
I tried to inform you,
but you got me drunk.

1542
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:00,750
By who?

1543
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,208
Who are all these people?

1544
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:17,583
Are we appointing new drivers
for our trucks?

1545
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,375
They are the contract holders, sir.

1546
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:20,458
-Contract?
-Yes.

1547
01:39:20,666 --> 01:39:21,541
For what?

1548
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:23,833
{\an8}Ammu has sent me
to tell you exactly that, sir.

1549
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:24,791
{\an8}Hey!

1550
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,208
{\an8}We are not on talking terms.
Why would she send you?

1551
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:29,375
{\an8}Spare me your personal issues, sir!

1552
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:31,583
{\an8}Babji has been paid to kill you!

1553
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:33,541
{\an8}I wanted to tell you the same,
but you got me drunk!

1554
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:35,333
{\an8}By who?

1555
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,416
It was you, sir!

1556
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:44,208
For what?

1557
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:48,666
Oh, Go! I curse my fate! Kill me!

1558
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:49,625
{\an8}Hey!

1559
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,708
{\an8}He has swallowed a mic.

1560
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:54,125
{\an8}Idiot.

1561
01:39:58,875 --> 01:39:59,791
Hey…

1562
01:40:00,458 --> 01:40:01,750
are you here to give him a haircut?

1563
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:04,500
I don't want his hair.
I want his head! Get it!

1564
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:21,208
What happened?

1565
01:41:21,666 --> 01:41:22,583
He is sleeping.

1566
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:24,375
So, should I turn on the AC?

1567
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,791
Wake him up, you fool!

1568
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:27,833
{\an8}Hey, get up!

1569
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:34,291
{\an8}<i>Wake up, wake up!</i>
<i>Oh, my king!</i>

1570
01:41:47,166 --> 01:41:48,833
Who took the contract to kill me?

1571
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:50,250
Hey, half-bottle!

1572
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:53,666
I'm the contract killer
tasked with ending your life.

1573
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,375
I am Babji.

1574
01:41:56,583 --> 01:41:57,916
Gelatin Babji.

1575
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:00,791
You are very costly.

1576
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:03,666
I took one crore rupees.

1577
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:06,166
Remember this before you die.

1578
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:08,000
Why would Ammu give you one crore rupees?

1579
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:10,666
Hey!

1580
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:13,416
Is there a queue system now?

1581
01:42:13,833 --> 01:42:14,708
Move!

1582
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:00,916
How audacious of you
to put a price tag on me!

1583
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:03,208
My name is Ramana.

1584
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:05,416
I'm not for sale.

1585
01:43:05,791 --> 01:43:07,041
-Hey, Balu.
-Sir?

1586
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:08,291
Who are all these men?

1587
01:43:08,541 --> 01:43:09,791
{\an8}Why did Ammu send them?

1588
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:12,291
{\an8}Why would Ammu send them, sir?
Do you think she is crazy?

1589
01:43:12,416 --> 01:43:13,583
Ammu has sent me!

1590
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:17,375
You're the one bothering me
by constantly chanting Ammu's name, sir!

1591
01:43:18,041 --> 01:43:19,250
It was Babji who took the contract.

1592
01:43:19,833 --> 01:43:22,500
It's Vyra Venkat Swamy who
wants you dead! Your grandfather!

1593
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:27,041
-Who?
-Your bloody old grandfather.

1594
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:28,666
-My grandfather?
-Yes!

1595
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,625
Hey, what is this meeting about?

1596
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,625
Keep quiet!

1597
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:34,916
Why does the old man want to kill me?

1598
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,875
Oh, God!

1599
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:38,500
Hey! I'm a saint with no enemies.

1600
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,375
A saint?

1601
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,833
Sir! Do you even know its meaning?

1602
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:46,041
Great souls like Yudhishthira and Vidura--

1603
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:47,875
-Hey, shut up!
-Shut up, man!

1604
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:51,541
Whenever you meet them, you threaten them.

1605
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:53,541
Why won't they kill you?

1606
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:54,833
You think they will pamper you?

1607
01:43:58,625 --> 01:43:59,500
{\an8}Hey!

1608
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:00,833
{\an8}Hey, stop!

1609
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:01,875
Hey!

1610
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:04,083
-Hey!
-You might hit us.

1611
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:10,333
Hey!

1612
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:12,083
Are you gone?

1613
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:31,666
-How many fingers are these?
-Whose fingers?

1614
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:35,250
Mine's only one.

1615
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:38,208
I guess he has lost both his eyes.

1616
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:40,000
-Is he blind?
-You doubt it?

1617
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:41,291
Blind? Who is blind?

1618
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,791
-Who is that?
-You! Idiot!

1619
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:46,375
You said your name was some Tin or Can.
What was it?

1620
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:49,208
Gelatin Babji, brother.

1621
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:50,291
Christian?

1622
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:52,291
No, brother. Hindu.

1623
01:44:52,625 --> 01:44:53,583
What is Gelatin?

1624
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,833
That's my profession, brother.

1625
01:44:56,208 --> 01:44:58,625
I use gelatin sticks
and blast rocks in quarries.

1626
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,541
Are the sticks this long?

1627
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:01,791
No.

1628
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:03,000
They are only this long.

1629
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:08,958
Hey!

1630
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:10,333
Where is my grandpa right now?

1631
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,333
How would I know
where your grandfather is, brother?

1632
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:16,833
Tell me.
Where is the old man?

1633
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:18,833
-Surya!
-Brother!

1634
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:21,083
Send him the location.

1635
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:40,583
What's up, Venkat Swamy?
Is the scenery so good?

1636
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:41,791
You seem engrossed!

1637
01:45:42,458 --> 01:45:43,625
Why are you here?

1638
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:45,416
What do you want from me?

1639
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:48,708
I'm done with you.
So why did you still send goons at me?

1640
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:49,916
I sent goons?!

1641
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:52,541
Hey, what is
he talking about, Narayan?

1642
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:55,000
Mr. Narayan!

1643
01:45:55,625 --> 01:45:58,375
Sir! Mr. Narayan! Sorry, sir.
The job is not done.

1644
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,833
Uncle, was it you who sent them?

1645
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:03,666
Who asked you to get him killed?

1646
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,916
Didn't you tell me
he shouldn't open his mouth?

1647
01:46:06,083 --> 01:46:07,500
-I did?
-Yes.

1648
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,166
People like him will only be quiet
when they die. There is no other option.

1649
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,458
-Hey, Babji!
-Brother?

1650
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:15,916
Pass the phone. Let's play them
the sound of Ramana's voice.

1651
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:17,000
Here, brother.

1652
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:18,458
-Hey, I'm here.
-It's okay, brother.

1653
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:19,500
Hey!

1654
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:21,583
Who are you calling?

1655
01:46:22,041 --> 01:46:23,041
Hey, close them.

1656
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:41,750
Before coming here, we loaded the cars
and set the trigger on the phone.

1657
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:44,250
The explosion and cars soaring
amidst the dust were an added bonus.

1658
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:48,375
Madhu and you want to trample on
my daughter's and my political careers?

1659
01:46:48,583 --> 01:46:50,625
Why will I join hands
with that pickpocket?

1660
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:53,333
He came to me, and I thrashed him.

1661
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:55,250
He snatched my wallet in the flow.

1662
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,333
You owe me the five thousand rupees
that I lost.

1663
01:46:59,291 --> 01:47:00,291
Look, Venkat Swamy!

1664
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:02,541
The next time I come, cars won't fly.

1665
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,375
You will fly along with your building!

1666
01:47:05,958 --> 01:47:07,708
-Hey, come on.
-Take me along, brother.

1667
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:11,375
Why do you water those?
Water the dried-up plants.

1668
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,625
He is not home.

1669
01:47:20,916 --> 01:47:21,833
Is that the girl?

1670
01:47:21,916 --> 01:47:22,791
That's the mother.

1671
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:24,083
Come in and sit.

1672
01:47:27,041 --> 01:47:28,750
-Is she the one?
-Her younger sister.

1673
01:47:28,833 --> 01:47:30,625
Someone loves tea.

1674
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:32,833
Ask them if they want some, Balu.

1675
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:35,083
-Is that the mother?
-It's the father with a sore throat!

1676
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,250
-Give it.
-Sir.

1677
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,166
Do you think we should say thanks?

1678
01:47:46,375 --> 01:47:48,666
-Someone seems to be expecting it.
-Drat!

1679
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:51,416
When I heard you were safe,
I wore a sari to go to the temple.

1680
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:53,500
If I weren't safe,
would you be wearing pants?

1681
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:59,875
When will you understand my heart, sir?

1682
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:02,666
You play cricket
and football with my heart…

1683
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:04,750
but I'm supposed to understand!

1684
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:07,500
Why am I being tortured, Balu?

1685
01:48:07,583 --> 01:48:08,583
No idea, baby.

1686
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:09,958
Why do you want to involve him?

1687
01:48:10,791 --> 01:48:11,791
Idiot!

1688
01:48:11,958 --> 01:48:14,250
-What did I do, sir?
-You did nothing.

1689
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:15,916
You are a serpent.

1690
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:19,041
Did you ever let us sit
next to each other?

1691
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:21,083
You would pull her away,
calling her "baby" all the time.

1692
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:22,041
Idiot!

1693
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:26,166
Is sitting next to you enough,
or shall I sit in your lap?

1694
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:33,708
I took her to school with these hands.

1695
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:34,750
What happened, Balu?

1696
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:37,208
She apologizes to him,
and he expresses his gratitude.

1697
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:39,458
What's the color of her skin?

1698
01:48:40,125 --> 01:48:41,833
She must be all red from blushing.

1699
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,000
Eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1700
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:46,666
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen…

1701
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:48,583
Hey, what are you doing?

1702
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:51,041
Why did you go to him?

1703
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,916
She asked me to warn Ramana.

1704
01:48:54,083 --> 01:48:55,833
-This one?
-Who else? This one?

1705
01:48:57,125 --> 01:48:58,000
Hey!

1706
01:48:59,458 --> 01:49:02,250
I had asked you to get his signature.
Instead, you have been spying on me!

1707
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:06,166
What makes you so captivated by him?

1708
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:10,000
His own mother rejected him
and abandoned him.

1709
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:14,458
I'm sure she didn't take a proper look.

1710
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:16,375
And I believe
he didn't step into the house?

1711
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:18,125
I stepped out myself.

1712
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:22,166
He was ready to pick a fight.
Your mom told me.

1713
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:23,541
That's his way of showing love.

1714
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:26,166
You don't seem to understand my situation.

1715
01:49:26,375 --> 01:49:28,916
Continue this, and I will hang myself.
Be warned!

1716
01:49:30,833 --> 01:49:31,750
Balu…

1717
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:35,125
What is this?

1718
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:37,916
Are you threatening me that
you'll kill yourself? Go ahead!

1719
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,375
No, that is meant for you.

1720
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:44,458
If you can't kick the stool, there are
four of us here. One of us will do it.

1721
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:48,208
Hey, silly girl!

1722
01:49:48,291 --> 01:49:51,750
Most Honorable Venkat Swamy
takes care of our needs.

1723
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:56,041
But I am in love with Venkat Ramana.

1724
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:08,166
He visits Hyderabad frequently.
I wonder what's so interesting!

1725
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:10,166
His mother probably
comes into his dreams every day.

1726
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:12,375
The father and son
appear deeply engrossed.

1727
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:14,583
Hey, bring me that cloth!

1728
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:17,666
Just the other day, they filed a case
and forced him to sign.

1729
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,083
Moreover,

1730
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:21,000
unsatisfied, they sent thugs after him.

1731
01:50:21,333 --> 01:50:24,416
Your dad wants you to find out
why a woman like her left you.

1732
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,916
Go and ask her!

1733
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:27,833
You don't pay attention
to the people around you.

1734
01:50:28,458 --> 01:50:29,333
Hey!

1735
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,500
You have been badgering me for hours!

1736
01:50:33,958 --> 01:50:36,208
You closed the door on my mother,
and she left.

1737
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:38,333
It's all your fault.

1738
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:41,458
You are afraid
I would keep this in mind.

1739
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,250
Who told you?

1740
01:50:43,833 --> 01:50:44,791
Did you have a dream?

1741
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:48,041
Going somewhere implies leaving
and returning, not staying there.

1742
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:49,916
I used to think drinking was an addiction.

1743
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:51,541
But a mother is also an addiction.

1744
01:50:51,791 --> 01:50:52,791
I feel that now.

1745
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,291
Don't take her name here anymore.

1746
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:57,250
Hey, your dad will hear.

1747
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:58,250
Let him!

1748
01:50:58,458 --> 01:50:59,958
I have heard why she left.

1749
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:02,666
I have decided I don't want her.
Let him hear it!

1750
01:51:09,541 --> 01:51:11,875
{\an8}<i>All of us support Venkat Ramana. </i>

1751
01:51:35,666 --> 01:51:36,625
Madam!

1752
01:51:37,375 --> 01:51:38,333
Madam!

1753
01:51:40,875 --> 01:51:42,291
What do you have to say about this?

1754
01:51:42,375 --> 01:51:45,541
-Sir, answer us!
-Can you tell us who's responsible?

1755
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:47,000
We want to know!

1756
01:51:47,083 --> 01:51:48,791
Did she have enemies?

1757
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:50,958
What's her condition now?

1758
01:51:51,083 --> 01:51:52,250
Answer us!

1759
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,416
{\an8}<i>Law Minister Vyra Vasundhara</i>
<i>met with an accident today. </i>

1760
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:38,166
{\an8}<i>A truck rammed into her convoy on the way</i>
<i>to the Secretariat, severely injuring her. </i>

1761
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:41,625
<i>She was immediately rushed</i>
<i>to Axis Hospital, close by. </i>

1762
01:52:41,708 --> 01:52:45,625
<i>Doctors have confirmed injuries</i>
<i>to her head and arms. </i>

1763
01:52:45,708 --> 01:52:46,916
<i>We will keep you updated…</i>

1764
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:06,166
<i>Minister Vyra Vasundhara is appearing</i>
<i>before the media in a short while!</i>

1765
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,958
<i>There's a press meet</i>
<i>in the conference hall</i>

1766
01:53:09,041 --> 01:53:10,250
<i>on the first floor of Axis Hospital!</i>

1767
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:14,041
<i>She is expected to give her health updates</i>
<i>and the reasons for the accident. </i>

1768
01:53:14,125 --> 01:53:15,666
<i>We have learned that</i>

1769
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:18,583
<i>Minister Vyra Vasundhara</i>
<i>has been under treatment for two days. </i>

1770
01:53:18,666 --> 01:53:21,500
<i>The entire city…</i>

1771
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,500
The opposition organized this attack.

1772
01:53:25,083 --> 01:53:27,208
They tried their best to kill me.

1773
01:53:27,541 --> 01:53:29,500
But my people's blessings saved me.

1774
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:31,916
Is your hand fractured?

1775
01:53:32,125 --> 01:53:33,541
Just a shoulder injury.

1776
01:53:36,625 --> 01:53:39,875
{\an8}Kata Madhu has criticized
that you have

1777
01:53:39,958 --> 01:53:41,291
-Listen…
-abandoned your elder son.

1778
01:53:41,625 --> 01:53:44,041
-This press meet is for her health.
-Oh.

1779
01:53:44,833 --> 01:53:47,125
Please don't divert the topic. Next.

1780
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:54,125
Kata Madhu has said
that you've abandoned your elder son.

1781
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:55,333
What do you have to say about that?

1782
01:53:56,333 --> 01:54:00,875
Ma'am, would you fight with rivals
like Hari Das and Madhu or let go?

1783
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:24,583
I may let go of what I love.

1784
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:28,916
I don't spare anything
that poses a threat to me.

1785
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:34,333
In Kashi, the way we let go
of our favorite things for Ganga…

1786
01:54:35,541 --> 01:54:38,333
I have also let go
of some of my favorite ones.

1787
01:54:46,333 --> 01:54:48,666
We must somehow get Ramana back.

1788
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,333
I need your help.

1789
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:52,708
Let go.

1790
01:54:54,583 --> 01:54:56,458
I don't insist out of adamance, Dad.

1791
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:59,166
I didn't ask you
to let go of your adamance.

1792
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:02,083
I meant, let go of your son.

1793
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:05,291
Do you find it painful?

1794
01:55:06,541 --> 01:55:07,875
Well, you have raised him for ten years.

1795
01:55:09,291 --> 01:55:11,583
What about my pain
when I was asked to give up my daughter?

1796
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:14,250
I had raised you for 25 years.

1797
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:17,666
Your parenting for ten years is love.

1798
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:21,041
But my parenting for 25 years
is selfishness?

1799
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:26,166
If I am selfish, then so are you.

1800
01:55:27,208 --> 01:55:30,166
If yours is love,
then mine is bigger love.

1801
01:55:31,916 --> 01:55:34,041
If you still insist on going,
I won't stop you.

1802
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:40,000
But this time when the warehouse
catches fire, your husband will be gone.

1803
01:55:40,375 --> 01:55:42,041
This time, it won't just
be an eye like before.

1804
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:43,791
Your son himself will be gone.

1805
01:55:44,583 --> 01:55:46,333
-Dad?
-Yes!

1806
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:49,541
Yes.

1807
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:53,541
The matchstick that ignited
the Guntur warehouse,

1808
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:56,666
the broken petrol bottles,
the expense of five lakh rupees,

1809
01:55:57,083 --> 01:56:00,250
Marx's pockets that held it,
and dead Lenin's blood.

1810
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:01,291
Everything!

1811
01:56:01,541 --> 01:56:04,750
Your dad was the person behind it all.

1812
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:17,833
Mothers may not always be right.

1813
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:21,125
But they never go wrong
in fulfilling their responsibilities.

1814
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:26,250
Madam, one minute.
Mr. Kata Madhu accuses you

1815
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:28,250
-of leaving your elder son like an orphan.
-Enough.

1816
01:56:28,333 --> 01:56:29,458
What's your take on this?

1817
01:56:32,791 --> 01:56:33,833
I am a mother.

1818
01:56:34,833 --> 01:56:37,708
Never ask a mother
what she has done for her children.

1819
01:56:40,333 --> 01:56:42,041
You won't know even if I tell you.

1820
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:44,458
You won't understand
even if you find out.

1821
01:57:02,916 --> 01:57:06,333
The media and we are aware that Hari Das
was responsible for this accident.

1822
01:57:06,416 --> 01:57:07,666
Only you don't know.

1823
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:11,166
But no one has the guts to speak up.

1824
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:14,500
The driver would claim
the brakes were not working.

1825
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:16,458
And he would be out in six months.

1826
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,666
That is Hari Das.

1827
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:23,958
People like you ignore rogues like him
but come and challenge old men like me.

1828
01:57:25,291 --> 01:57:26,666
Tell him if you have the guts.

1829
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:29,916
"I am Vasundhara's son.

1830
01:57:31,208 --> 01:57:32,375
Face me if you can.

1831
01:57:32,708 --> 01:57:34,291
I am called Guntur Chili. "

1832
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:37,958
Don't come up with excuses like
not knowing the address.

1833
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:41,000
Everyone pays a visit after an accident.

1834
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:43,666
Go and see him.

1835
01:57:44,833 --> 01:57:47,375
Then come, twirl your mustache,
and tell your mom, "I am your son. "

1836
01:57:47,958 --> 01:57:49,833
If you can't,
then weep and keep quiet.

1837
01:57:51,625 --> 01:57:53,791
Why do you always meddle with him,

1838
01:57:53,916 --> 01:57:56,916
make it a big issue,
and turn it into a calamity?

1839
01:57:57,750 --> 01:58:00,208
I mean,
you are so wise in political affairs!

1840
01:58:00,333 --> 01:58:03,291
When it comes to family,
why do you get so emotional?

1841
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:04,500
-Pani!
-I don't get it.

1842
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:06,041
-Sir.
-Let me tell you a story.

1843
01:58:06,208 --> 01:58:08,666
-Listen with some patience.
-Yes, sir.

1844
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:12,416
A man built himself a solid fort
only by playing caste politics.

1845
01:58:13,083 --> 01:58:14,750
He won thrice consecutively.

1846
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:18,458
His daughter got into
an inter-caste marriage and left him.

1847
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:22,208
{\an8}<i>People said, "You couldn't make your</i>
<i>daughter marry into your own caste. </i>

1848
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:23,875
<i>What can you possibly do for the others?"</i>

1849
01:58:24,458 --> 01:58:25,708
<i>-And he lost. </i>
<i>-With a huge margin…</i>

1850
01:58:25,791 --> 01:58:29,833
<i>-Mr. Niranjan has won! Congratulations!</i>
<i>-We won!</i>

1851
01:58:29,916 --> 01:58:33,666
<i>To win the election again, </i>
<i>his daughter would have to come back. </i>

1852
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,125
He finally brought her back.

1853
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,166
It was a massive fight!

1854
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:47,208
-Narayan…
-Listen…

1855
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:50,000
He stands a chance
if we take him to a hospital in the city.

1856
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:53,291
What if he gets stuck in traffic
before reaching the hospital?

1857
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:54,708
-What?
-Narayan!

1858
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:57,666
-Let him die.
-Narayan…

1859
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:05,416
He got his daughter married
into the same caste.

1860
01:59:05,666 --> 01:59:07,083
He made her contest elections.

1861
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:09,458
Since she married into the same caste,
they elected her.

1862
01:59:09,541 --> 01:59:10,666
She even became a minister.

1863
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:17,458
Now, he desires his grandson,
born into his own caste, to become an MP.

1864
01:59:17,875 --> 01:59:21,125
Exactly at that moment, here's what
appears on his daughter's phone.

1865
01:59:21,333 --> 01:59:22,250
Here…

1866
01:59:28,375 --> 01:59:31,500
Twenty-five years of control.
Isn't it slipping out of hand?

1867
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:34,583
Where is emotion involved in all this?

1868
01:59:34,958 --> 01:59:36,416
It's all politics, right?

1869
01:59:56,916 --> 01:59:58,541
I haven't seen you before.

1870
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:01,541
I never came here.

1871
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:04,333
What brings you here now?

1872
02:00:06,875 --> 02:00:08,125
To eat some fritters.

1873
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:10,125
Don't you get them in your place?

1874
02:00:11,833 --> 02:00:13,791
Each location
has its distinctive specialty.

1875
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:15,875
What's special here?

1876
02:00:20,291 --> 02:00:21,208
Hari Das.

1877
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,250
What is so special about him?

1878
02:00:26,875 --> 02:00:28,541
He wants to kill my mother.

1879
02:00:29,041 --> 02:00:30,416
Who is your mother?

1880
02:00:31,833 --> 02:00:32,833
Vyra Vasundhara.

1881
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:37,166
My grandfather told me that…

1882
02:00:38,708 --> 02:00:41,291
he'd kill my mother
and I'd have to sit at home and cry.

1883
02:00:43,625 --> 02:00:44,666
Tell me, Uncle.

1884
02:00:45,791 --> 02:00:47,333
How disgusting it would be if I cried!

1885
02:00:49,125 --> 02:00:52,000
As disgusting as a wig
on your bald head!

1886
02:00:53,541 --> 02:00:54,458
That's why…

1887
02:00:55,166 --> 02:00:56,541
I have come to kill him.

1888
02:00:59,833 --> 02:01:01,750
-Are you carrying a knife?
-Yes.

1889
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:04,125
Where are you hiding it?

1890
02:01:04,208 --> 02:01:05,666
Six feet one inch.

1891
02:01:06,208 --> 02:01:07,291
It's not possible to hide it.

1892
02:01:29,041 --> 02:01:31,333
Brother, there's a guy claiming
that he has come to kill you.

1893
02:01:34,875 --> 02:01:38,166
I've been here for the last 42 years.
I'll show you who Das is. Come on.

1894
02:01:41,041 --> 02:01:44,958
They say all the bandits
from Chambal came here and settled down.

1895
02:01:45,583 --> 02:01:48,125
Knives, bombs, you name it!

1896
02:01:48,208 --> 02:01:52,500
Everything needed for survival
and killing is available for sale here.

1897
02:01:52,666 --> 02:01:53,625
These youngsters?

1898
02:01:53,875 --> 02:01:56,416
Only they can act on impulse
without thinking of consequences.

1899
02:01:56,833 --> 02:01:59,250
That's why Hari Das only uses them.

1900
02:02:04,083 --> 02:02:06,291
Is this Hari Das?

1901
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:10,791
That's quite a big head.

1902
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:12,208
But I will pluck it and go.

1903
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:44,875
What is this, Uncle?

1904
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:47,083
Are they ladies or rowdies?

1905
02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:53,375
Even the sweepers are
delivering flying kicks!

1906
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:55,208
You want Das's head, right?

1907
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,416
Yes.

1908
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,916
Hey! Basha, Jani, Khatri, Ahmed!

1909
02:03:01,083 --> 02:03:04,291
His legs, arms, neck, and torso…
hack them into pieces

1910
02:03:04,458 --> 02:03:07,541
and decide whether you
want to cremate or bury them.

1911
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:15,500
While they decide,
could you get me some water?

1912
02:03:20,416 --> 02:03:21,375
Hey, Chotu!

1913
02:03:22,833 --> 02:03:24,625
Have you ever played Thief and Police?

1914
02:03:24,708 --> 02:03:26,291
Police don't come here, brother.

1915
02:03:26,916 --> 02:03:28,250
But the black guard is here.

1916
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:40,458
Do you want to watch the game?

1917
02:04:17,333 --> 02:04:19,125
What are you looking at, sisters?

1918
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,500
I will get him down.

1919
02:04:24,041 --> 02:04:25,333
You please get down to cooking.

1920
02:04:30,083 --> 02:04:31,791
The biryani should be delicious.

1921
02:04:32,333 --> 02:04:33,500
Make it spicy.

1922
02:05:13,916 --> 02:05:15,166
Why do you stare?

1923
02:05:16,708 --> 02:05:18,333
Is the cigarette appearing in 3D?

1924
02:06:06,666 --> 02:06:10,250
Oh, my brother!

1925
02:06:11,083 --> 02:06:13,250
My brother!

1926
02:06:16,666 --> 02:06:17,583
Hey!

1927
02:06:19,333 --> 02:06:21,458
I don't mind holding you by your hair
and smashing you to the ground!

1928
02:06:27,958 --> 02:06:28,916
What is happening, Uncle?

1929
02:06:30,125 --> 02:06:31,041
Are you Das?

1930
02:06:32,416 --> 02:06:33,333
Yes.

1931
02:06:37,708 --> 02:06:40,041
-What about him?
-He sells fritters.

1932
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:41,250
Why were you sitting outside?

1933
02:06:42,625 --> 02:06:45,000
Whenever someone comes,
I sit at the fritter shop,

1934
02:06:45,083 --> 02:06:46,916
and he sits in my chair.

1935
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,291
Oh, my!

1936
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,416
But why?

1937
02:06:50,541 --> 02:06:52,083
To elude.

1938
02:06:58,083 --> 02:07:00,666
I saw such tricks long ago in old films.

1939
02:07:01,583 --> 02:07:03,416
And now, I see you.

1940
02:07:04,791 --> 02:07:06,500
It really hurts.

1941
02:07:06,583 --> 02:07:08,208
I'm not able to bear it.

1942
02:07:09,208 --> 02:07:11,166
What sin have I committed, God?

1943
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:12,166
Shall I tell you?

1944
02:07:13,833 --> 02:07:15,291
Threatening the minister.

1945
02:07:16,375 --> 02:07:18,458
Ramming a truck into their car
while they are inside.

1946
02:07:18,958 --> 02:07:22,958
God may be busy, but sons like me,
who gallivant with no work…

1947
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,541
will come looking for you.

1948
02:07:26,708 --> 02:07:28,791
Why would I kill your mother?

1949
02:07:29,083 --> 02:07:31,000
I have only threatened her.

1950
02:07:31,458 --> 02:07:34,583
My problem is only… with your grandfather.

1951
02:07:36,083 --> 02:07:37,833
What has the old man done to you?

1952
02:07:37,916 --> 02:07:40,166
If I recall that, I will die right away.

1953
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:43,333
Why remember that mess now?
Hey, keep quiet!

1954
02:07:43,416 --> 02:07:45,875
-What are you saying?
-Stop crying and pull this out.

1955
02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:47,458
Brother…

1956
02:07:47,541 --> 02:07:49,333
Hey! Sister!

1957
02:07:50,541 --> 02:07:52,541
-What are you trying to pull?
-Why?

1958
02:07:55,416 --> 02:07:57,166
I think it has pierced
right through the center.

1959
02:07:58,291 --> 02:08:01,458
If you pull it, blood will gush out
like water from a borewell.

1960
02:08:03,083 --> 02:08:05,000
At least suture it.

1961
02:08:05,208 --> 02:08:07,166
If I was so skilled, why would I be here?

1962
02:08:07,791 --> 02:08:10,708
Like AIIMS,
I would have set up RIMS in Guntur.

1963
02:08:13,583 --> 02:08:14,958
Only God can save you now.

1964
02:08:15,041 --> 02:08:16,458
Forget God!

1965
02:08:16,583 --> 02:08:18,750
Call a doctor.

1966
02:08:19,708 --> 02:08:22,458
There's not even a pharmacy nearby.

1967
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:26,000
You are right.
Hey, call the ambulance, at least.

1968
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:28,375
We don't have the number.

1969
02:08:31,041 --> 02:08:32,458
It's all over.

1970
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:34,291
Go and get ready.

1971
02:08:39,875 --> 02:08:40,875
Hey, Balu!

1972
02:08:51,875 --> 02:08:53,750
Have you got a doctor for me?

1973
02:08:53,833 --> 02:08:55,166
No, I have brought him.

1974
02:08:57,166 --> 02:08:59,583
-Are you fine?
-Look who you gave my address to!

1975
02:09:03,416 --> 02:09:05,708
I'm the victim.
Why is the nurse looking at him?

1976
02:09:05,791 --> 02:09:07,000
That's his love, not a nurse.

1977
02:09:08,541 --> 02:09:10,083
She's the nurse. Do something.

1978
02:09:10,291 --> 02:09:11,416
Who did this to you?

1979
02:09:13,625 --> 02:09:15,500
Wow! Great person!

1980
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:17,166
He has given you a second life.

1981
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:20,916
I don't even have to put a stent.
98 percent of the valves were blocked.

1982
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,208
By piercing with a nail,
he opened all of them.

1983
02:09:23,416 --> 02:09:24,750
But you need some blood.

1984
02:09:24,833 --> 02:09:26,000
B positive, doctor.

1985
02:09:26,083 --> 02:09:28,375
I'm definitely positive.
I'm asking for your blood group.

1986
02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:30,750
That's what I told you, doctor.
B positive!

1987
02:09:30,833 --> 02:09:31,916
But who will give the blood?

1988
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:34,458
Hey! One of you come forward.

1989
02:09:34,708 --> 02:09:36,666
-Come on.
-How can we have blood?

1990
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:38,208
-It's all alcohol.
-In that case,

1991
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:39,875
remove the nail during cremation.

1992
02:09:42,291 --> 02:09:44,333
Shut up!

1993
02:09:44,416 --> 02:09:45,375
Oh, my!

1994
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:47,750
Why do you start crying?

1995
02:09:47,833 --> 02:09:49,791
-One of you must donate your blood.
-How did this happen?

1996
02:09:52,458 --> 02:09:55,833
{\an8}The one who stabbed him is donating
his blood. This is a historical moment.

1997
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:00,583
Keep these things aside.

1998
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:03,166
What is your problem with my grandpa?

1999
02:10:03,375 --> 02:10:06,250
Both of us were into business together
25 years ago.

2000
02:10:06,375 --> 02:10:08,375
We got double returns.

2001
02:10:08,916 --> 02:10:10,708
What should the ratio be?

2002
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,875
To be all fair and honest… fifty each?

2003
02:10:15,083 --> 02:10:18,000
He wanted ten percent more
since it was his idea.

2004
02:10:18,416 --> 02:10:19,333
Fair enough.

2005
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:21,208
But you should get at least forty.

2006
02:10:21,541 --> 02:10:22,916
Claiming ownership of goodwill,

2007
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,916
he insisted on an additional
ten percent as interest.

2008
02:10:25,083 --> 02:10:26,000
Fine.

2009
02:10:26,458 --> 02:10:27,708
Did he at least give you thirty?

2010
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,875
Since supply had to continue, he sought
an additional ten percent for investment.

2011
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:33,208
Terrible!

2012
02:10:33,625 --> 02:10:34,875
He should at least give you twenty.

2013
02:10:34,958 --> 02:10:38,416
He said I'd squander the money at once.
So, he wanted to pay in two installments.

2014
02:10:38,583 --> 02:10:39,750
Excellent.

2015
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:40,916
What about the ten percent?

2016
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
He gave me five,
and when I asked him about the rest,

2017
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:47,583
he called me rowdy and kicked me out.

2018
02:10:49,875 --> 02:10:51,916
He showed you fifty percent profit
and gave you only five?

2019
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,833
I wasn't hurt by that.

2020
02:10:54,166 --> 02:10:56,125
Do you know
what he did when I was leaving?

2021
02:10:57,250 --> 02:10:58,625
He gave this to me.

2022
02:11:01,291 --> 02:11:02,833
I knew that the old man was nasty.

2023
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,125
I just didn't know how nasty!

2024
02:11:07,041 --> 02:11:08,000
Don't worry.

2025
02:11:08,833 --> 02:11:10,375
I will be the gun under your pillow.

2026
02:11:10,958 --> 02:11:11,916
Just give me a call.

2027
02:11:12,791 --> 02:11:13,708
I will be there.

2028
02:11:14,625 --> 02:11:15,500
Stop!

2029
02:11:18,041 --> 02:11:20,375
How can you donate blood
and just walk away?

2030
02:11:21,166 --> 02:11:22,666
You can't always have your way.

2031
02:11:23,375 --> 02:11:25,625
Let us at least throw you a party.

2032
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:27,916
Hey!

2033
02:11:28,166 --> 02:11:30,125
Call our Ramola batch.

2034
02:11:36,791 --> 02:11:38,875
Young lad, pass me the chilled water.

2035
02:11:43,375 --> 02:11:45,875
<i>Salutations to the theater!</i>

2036
02:11:46,166 --> 02:11:49,500
<i>A grand welcome to connoisseurs!</i>

2037
02:11:49,875 --> 02:11:53,875
<i>The time is seven o'clock</i>
<i>The evening is dusky</i>

2038
02:11:54,125 --> 02:11:56,666
<i>The cool breeze begins to tickle</i>

2039
02:11:56,875 --> 02:12:02,833
<i>Daring Das seated on that couch</i>
<i>And the elegant prince on this one</i>

2040
02:12:03,166 --> 02:12:09,291
<i>Ramola dancing party's performance</i>

2041
02:12:09,666 --> 02:12:11,291
<i>Why don't we make it scintillating?</i>

2042
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:12,916
Hey, Ramola!

2043
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,750
Why don't we drape this girl in a sari?

2044
02:12:32,791 --> 02:12:34,708
<i>Ragamanjari from Rajahmundry</i>

2045
02:12:34,958 --> 02:12:38,416
<i>There's no one</i>
<i>Who doesn't know the mother of me</i>

2046
02:12:38,625 --> 02:12:44,291
<i>All are artists in the family</i>
<i>With our dance, we commit sleep robbery</i>

2047
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:55,583
<i>Stylish, dream girl!</i>
<i>Your velvety look is a bed of jasmines</i>

2048
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,833
<i>My breath is on fire</i>
<i>Looking at you makes my heart go crazy</i>

2049
02:13:07,708 --> 02:13:13,166
<i>Loading bullets in your curves</i>
<i>You fired shots, my belle</i>

2050
02:13:13,250 --> 02:13:15,375
<i>Seducing the entire male race…</i>

2051
02:13:16,458 --> 02:13:18,041
<i>Folding the chair…</i>

2052
02:13:18,375 --> 02:13:22,625
<i>Folding the chair…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2053
02:13:22,708 --> 02:13:25,583
<i>Folding it…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2054
02:13:54,666 --> 02:13:57,458
<i>To her…</i>

2055
02:13:57,583 --> 02:14:02,916
<i>To her, you gifted the goats</i>
<i>And gave me broken rice</i>

2056
02:14:03,416 --> 02:14:09,791
<i>The goats grew into hundreds and herds</i>
<i>And my broken rice melted in titbits</i>

2057
02:14:12,125 --> 02:14:17,791
<i>You gave her emerald earrings</i>
<i>You gave me dotted, checkered saris</i>

2058
02:14:17,958 --> 02:14:23,708
<i>Her earrings shone with sparkles</i>
<i>My saris turned into tatters</i>

2059
02:14:23,791 --> 02:14:29,333
<i>What sort of patron are you, Mr. Das?</i>
<i>You are always with prejudice!</i>

2060
02:14:29,583 --> 02:14:35,250
<i>What sort of patron are you, Mr. Das?</i>
<i>You are always with prejudice!</i>

2061
02:14:35,416 --> 02:14:36,791
<i>Folding the chair…</i>

2062
02:14:36,875 --> 02:14:39,708
<i>Folding it…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2063
02:14:39,791 --> 02:14:42,708
<i>Folding it…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2064
02:14:58,708 --> 02:15:02,958
<i>-Such a stylish, beautiful lady</i>
<i>-Folding it…</i>

2065
02:15:03,041 --> 02:15:05,875
<i>-Your velvety look is a bed of jasmines</i>
<i>-Folding it…</i>

2066
02:15:05,958 --> 02:15:08,791
<i>-My breath is on fire</i>
<i>-Folding it…</i>

2067
02:15:08,875 --> 02:15:11,916
<i>Looking at you makes my heart go crazy</i>

2068
02:15:23,416 --> 02:15:24,625
What are you looking at?

2069
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,916
Each one is a lyric writer
of his own anguish.

2070
02:15:27,291 --> 02:15:29,166
Write it, fold it, and throw it.

2071
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:32,041
<i>Folding it…</i>

2072
02:15:32,125 --> 02:15:34,958
<i>Folding it…</i>

2073
02:15:35,041 --> 02:15:39,333
<i>Folding it…</i>

2074
02:15:39,416 --> 02:15:40,833
<i>Folding the chair…</i>

2075
02:15:42,416 --> 02:15:43,833
<i>Folding it…</i>

2076
02:15:45,208 --> 02:15:46,708
<i>Folding it…</i>

2077
02:15:48,083 --> 02:15:49,666
<i>Folding it…</i>

2078
02:15:54,458 --> 02:15:55,833
Just one word.

2079
02:15:56,166 --> 02:15:58,291
There's no one like you!

2080
02:15:58,666 --> 02:16:00,791
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2081
02:16:00,875 --> 02:16:03,083
{\an8}-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2082
02:16:03,166 --> 02:16:05,416
{\an8}-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2083
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:07,791
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2084
02:16:07,875 --> 02:16:09,250
-Long live…
-Sir.

2085
02:16:09,333 --> 02:16:11,583
-Jandal Party!
-Stop.

2086
02:16:11,666 --> 02:16:13,583
-Long live…
-Please wait.

2087
02:16:13,666 --> 02:16:16,166
-Enough. Okay.
-Jandal Party!

2088
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:18,125
-Sir…
-Wait.

2089
02:16:18,208 --> 02:16:19,666
-Okay. Move.
-Long live…

2090
02:16:20,458 --> 02:16:22,625
-Where is Raja Gopal?
-Didn't he come with you, sir?

2091
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:25,416
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2092
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:28,791
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2093
02:16:28,875 --> 02:16:30,041
-Mr. Gopal.
-Gopal.

2094
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:31,583
Where's Gopal? Have you seen him?

2095
02:16:31,833 --> 02:16:33,291
-Gopal!
-Okay.

2096
02:16:33,375 --> 02:16:34,250
Mr. Gopal!

2097
02:16:34,375 --> 02:16:35,291
Mr. Gopal.

2098
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:37,083
-Mr. Gopal!
-Narayan!

2099
02:16:38,333 --> 02:16:40,000
-Where are you?
-Narayan!

2100
02:16:41,875 --> 02:16:43,125
Drunkard…

2101
02:16:43,291 --> 02:16:44,583
Get up!

2102
02:16:45,375 --> 02:16:46,625
-Father-in-law?
-Where is he?

2103
02:16:47,791 --> 02:16:49,166
-Who?
-Who else?

2104
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:50,958
-Your own son!
-My son…

2105
02:16:51,125 --> 02:16:52,208
He has left home.

2106
02:16:52,375 --> 02:16:53,791
But he's nowhere to be found.
Where is he?

2107
02:16:54,875 --> 02:16:56,750
He must be somewhere around.

2108
02:16:56,958 --> 02:16:58,375
Oh, there he is!

2109
02:17:01,375 --> 02:17:02,375
What did you do?

2110
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:03,916
Actually…

2111
02:17:04,166 --> 02:17:05,500
He has joined the Party.

2112
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:07,291
He's also getting the MP ticket.

2113
02:17:07,458 --> 02:17:08,875
He said he was feeling nervous…

2114
02:17:09,041 --> 02:17:09,958
So?

2115
02:17:10,791 --> 02:17:13,875
To pep him up,
I gave him a glass of juice.

2116
02:17:14,291 --> 02:17:15,166
Oh, no!

2117
02:17:16,541 --> 02:17:17,541
Hey, Gopal!

2118
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:19,916
I think he's in a stupor.

2119
02:17:20,041 --> 02:17:22,291
Father-in-law, I will get him ready
in ten minutes.

2120
02:17:22,375 --> 02:17:25,166
-Hey! Someone get some curd--
-You should be killed, wastrel!

2121
02:17:25,250 --> 02:17:28,875
What are you doing?
Why are you hitting me?! Father-in-law!

2122
02:17:29,041 --> 02:17:29,916
I was…

2123
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,958
I was going to make him join the Party,

2124
02:17:32,041 --> 02:17:34,666
-but you organized your own party!
-Don't hit me!

2125
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:36,583
-And today of all the days!
-What did I do?

2126
02:17:36,666 --> 02:17:39,250
He is the future of this family
and politics!

2127
02:17:39,416 --> 02:17:40,958
-Not a wastrel like you!
-Don't hit me!

2128
02:17:41,333 --> 02:17:43,750
He is Vyra Venkat Swamy's heir!

2129
02:17:44,041 --> 02:17:45,791
-You--
-Who? Who is the heir?!

2130
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:47,833
He is not even my son!

2131
02:17:48,708 --> 02:17:50,291
I don't even have a son!

2132
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,708
I don't even have a son!

2133
02:18:01,416 --> 02:18:04,500
Whether you like it or not,
you have only one heir!

2134
02:18:07,958 --> 02:18:09,875
Bhogineni Veera Venkat Ramana!

2135
02:18:17,166 --> 02:18:18,833
He is your real heir!

2136
02:18:34,958 --> 02:18:37,166
Are you so drunk
that you are blabbering?

2137
02:18:38,791 --> 02:18:39,708
I am sober!

2138
02:18:42,875 --> 02:18:44,500
Exactly 25 years ago…

2139
02:18:45,666 --> 02:18:48,208
your daughter married a man
from a different caste.

2140
02:18:49,166 --> 02:18:50,666
Then you got her married to him.

2141
02:18:51,708 --> 02:18:55,375
By the time the next elections occurred,
you pulled the strings.

2142
02:18:56,833 --> 02:19:00,541
Now, just as your grandson
is about to enter politics,

2143
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:02,625
your daughter is pulling the strings.

2144
02:19:04,833 --> 02:19:09,416
Your daughter didn't marry me
because she thought I was handsome.

2145
02:19:10,875 --> 02:19:12,750
She married me to make a fool of you.

2146
02:19:15,875 --> 02:19:18,250
Fortunately, since our bedroom
is on the first floor,

2147
02:19:18,416 --> 02:19:20,166
you're unable to climb the stairs.

2148
02:19:20,833 --> 02:19:23,791
Let me tell you
that there are two beds in there.

2149
02:19:24,583 --> 02:19:27,000
You can place a net between them
and play badminton.

2150
02:19:27,250 --> 02:19:28,291
That's the situation.

2151
02:19:29,625 --> 02:19:32,458
As soon as you began to wonder
why there were no children yet,

2152
02:19:32,541 --> 02:19:33,541
she announced her pregnancy.

2153
02:19:34,166 --> 02:19:36,916
She said she would be more comfortable
delivering the baby abroad,

2154
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,833
and went to Aunt Rani in Australia.

2155
02:19:38,958 --> 02:19:40,000
Once she reached there,

2156
02:19:40,083 --> 02:19:42,833
she said she didn't want to trouble them
and stayed alone.

2157
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:47,125
Have you ever seen her photograph
when she was pregnant?

2158
02:19:50,291 --> 02:19:51,166
No.

2159
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:52,625
I knew it.

2160
02:19:53,416 --> 02:19:54,333
She came back with him.

2161
02:19:55,333 --> 02:19:56,541
You took him.

2162
02:19:56,625 --> 02:19:57,750
Carried him on your back.

2163
02:19:58,333 --> 02:19:59,666
When he cried, you called it music!

2164
02:20:00,083 --> 02:20:01,416
When he peed, you called it perfume!

2165
02:20:02,458 --> 02:20:06,250
If you gave him my surname,
you thought he wouldn't get any votes.

2166
02:20:06,416 --> 02:20:08,500
So, you call him Vyra Rajagopal!

2167
02:20:09,041 --> 02:20:10,291
You are making him an MP now.

2168
02:20:11,166 --> 02:20:13,250
If all goes well,
you would make him the PM as well.

2169
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:19,416
But if you realize
he is not your daughter's son…

2170
02:20:21,666 --> 02:20:22,583
what will you do?

2171
02:20:26,083 --> 02:20:28,041
Your daughter is not boastful like you.

2172
02:20:28,291 --> 02:20:29,250
No way!

2173
02:20:30,291 --> 02:20:31,666
She sent her husband to jail.

2174
02:20:32,291 --> 02:20:33,791
<i>You trusted her 25 percent. </i>

2175
02:20:34,375 --> 02:20:36,958
She married me.
You trusted her 50 percent.

2176
02:20:37,208 --> 02:20:38,541
She said she gave birth to him.

2177
02:20:38,750 --> 02:20:40,166
<i>You trusted her 75 percent. </i>

2178
02:20:40,416 --> 02:20:41,750
She abandoned her own son.

2179
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:44,750
You trusted her a hundred percent!

2180
02:20:46,583 --> 02:20:51,208
She has proved that a mother would go
to any extent to protect her son. Wow!

2181
02:20:52,666 --> 02:20:54,208
Your daughter is not an ordinary woman.

2182
02:21:01,583 --> 02:21:05,250
She can easily manipulate three men
like you into following her plan!

2183
02:21:05,875 --> 02:21:07,708
-You should have told me this earlier…
-Relax.

2184
02:21:07,958 --> 02:21:11,291
Actually, once you cross 70,

2185
02:21:12,166 --> 02:21:14,041
people like you
shouldn't stay alive.

2186
02:21:14,458 --> 02:21:15,625
You must make your exit.

2187
02:21:16,666 --> 02:21:17,583
You should.

2188
02:21:17,833 --> 02:21:19,416
That would do good to everyone.

2189
02:21:20,166 --> 02:21:21,083
Please die.

2190
02:21:21,416 --> 02:21:23,083
-Heed my advice.
-Grandpa, don't be angry!

2191
02:21:23,375 --> 02:21:25,541
Hey! Who is your grandpa?!

2192
02:21:27,833 --> 02:21:29,041
Who is your grandpa?

2193
02:21:32,083 --> 02:21:34,708
All of you are playing a game
behind my back, right?

2194
02:21:35,333 --> 02:21:36,458
I'm going to kill you.

2195
02:21:37,375 --> 02:21:39,000
She's the one behind all this, right?

2196
02:21:39,541 --> 02:21:41,666
She should be killed first!

2197
02:21:43,458 --> 02:21:45,708
In that case,
you should be killed a hundred times.

2198
02:21:48,875 --> 02:21:50,083
I couldn't stop him, sir.

2199
02:21:53,666 --> 02:21:54,708
When did you get here?

2200
02:21:56,125 --> 02:21:58,291
Did you walk in quietly like a thief?

2201
02:22:02,333 --> 02:22:03,500
I was missing you.

2202
02:22:05,291 --> 02:22:06,333
So, I have come to talk.

2203
02:22:06,416 --> 02:22:08,500
I would also like to talk.
Come. Let's talk.

2204
02:22:08,666 --> 02:22:10,125
Hey, get a chair. Come on.

2205
02:22:10,375 --> 02:22:14,791
Normally, people discuss their kids'
future. We'll discuss your mom's past.

2206
02:22:16,916 --> 02:22:18,958
Is your mom some goddess in a temple?

2207
02:22:19,166 --> 02:22:20,458
You want to visit her all the time!

2208
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:22,541
She's a demon!

2209
02:22:24,083 --> 02:22:25,375
Really?

2210
02:22:25,791 --> 02:22:27,291
Why did you orchestrate the accident?

2211
02:22:27,375 --> 02:22:28,375
Which accident?

2212
02:22:28,583 --> 02:22:30,833
The one in which you made a truck
ram into her car?

2213
02:22:34,916 --> 02:22:36,541
Hey, get me some water.

2214
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:38,416
That accident.

2215
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:39,833
Ask Hari Das!

2216
02:22:43,208 --> 02:22:44,125
Hey!

2217
02:22:47,291 --> 02:22:48,708
Give him the glass, Dasu.

2218
02:22:50,666 --> 02:22:51,916
Why are you shocked?

2219
02:22:53,458 --> 02:22:54,458
It's our very own Das.

2220
02:22:54,916 --> 02:22:57,041
That water is not going
to wash away your sins.

2221
02:22:59,666 --> 02:23:00,833
Whose truck was it?

2222
02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:02,500
Aren't there enough rogues?

2223
02:23:02,750 --> 02:23:04,375
If not him,
it must have been Kata Madhu's job!

2224
02:23:05,541 --> 02:23:07,000
You could fall. Sit down.

2225
02:23:18,791 --> 02:23:20,708
Have you joined hands with him?

2226
02:23:23,041 --> 02:23:24,875
As a precaution, I have brought him along.

2227
02:23:25,666 --> 02:23:27,166
Please don't say
he was behind the accident.

2228
02:23:27,625 --> 02:23:29,500
Because he himself is ramming
into things and falling.

2229
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:32,583
Why did you do it?

2230
02:23:34,541 --> 02:23:37,583
Do you think it is easy to win
the fourth time after three terms?

2231
02:23:38,208 --> 02:23:39,833
There has to be some magic.

2232
02:23:42,291 --> 02:23:45,041
I organized a murder attempt.
I created sympathy.

2233
02:23:45,416 --> 02:23:46,541
Go, check the surveys.

2234
02:23:46,875 --> 02:23:48,291
They confirm her victory.

2235
02:23:49,166 --> 02:23:50,625
Anyway, what is the problem now?

2236
02:23:52,041 --> 02:23:53,041
She is not dead…

2237
02:23:53,791 --> 02:23:55,583
Hey! Let him go!

2238
02:23:58,166 --> 02:24:02,791
A little harder, and there won't be
any need for surveys.

2239
02:24:03,416 --> 02:24:05,583
She's sure to secure victory
through sympathy.

2240
02:24:20,375 --> 02:24:22,458
As soon as you discovered
he was not your grandson,

2241
02:24:22,541 --> 02:24:23,666
you discarded him.

2242
02:24:24,125 --> 02:24:27,041
But she raised him
like her own son for thirty years.

2243
02:24:27,125 --> 02:24:29,375
Hey, I'm not jealous of you.
Please don't feel bad.

2244
02:24:32,166 --> 02:24:34,166
Her action was betrayal,
and yours was sacrifice?

2245
02:24:36,958 --> 02:24:40,083
Shall I give you a list of her sacrifices?
Your heart will stop.

2246
02:24:41,291 --> 02:24:42,666
A pointless wedding.

2247
02:24:43,625 --> 02:24:44,916
A meaningless marriage.

2248
02:24:47,375 --> 02:24:48,583
A son who's not her own.

2249
02:24:49,791 --> 02:24:51,291
And an unsolicited rank.

2250
02:24:52,416 --> 02:24:53,541
For whom did she do all this?

2251
02:24:54,583 --> 02:24:56,125
She did it so that Ramana
could live like a king!

2252
02:24:58,166 --> 02:24:59,291
I failed to understand it then.

2253
02:24:59,875 --> 02:25:00,833
I'm a dunderhead!

2254
02:25:02,541 --> 02:25:03,958
I'm not sure if you said it
knowingly or not…

2255
02:25:04,166 --> 02:25:05,083
but she is truly a goddess.

2256
02:25:05,666 --> 02:25:06,875
Any place she is becomes a temple.

2257
02:25:08,083 --> 02:25:10,041
When she leaves tomorrow,
you will know…

2258
02:25:10,708 --> 02:25:12,375
Forget about a sacred offering,

2259
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:14,458
no one would even pay you a visit.

2260
02:25:27,708 --> 02:25:29,625
With so much love in your heart,

2261
02:25:30,375 --> 02:25:31,541
you choose to fight.

2262
02:25:32,625 --> 02:25:34,750
Is shouting Ramana's way
of expressing love?

2263
02:25:35,541 --> 02:25:36,416
Come.

2264
02:25:37,375 --> 02:25:40,833
You have done whatever you want,
and now look at you talking!

2265
02:25:41,291 --> 02:25:42,750
What have I done, Dad?

2266
02:25:43,416 --> 02:25:44,833
Did I set the warehouses on fire?

2267
02:25:45,375 --> 02:25:46,708
Did I organize murders?

2268
02:25:47,833 --> 02:25:49,458
I just wanted him to do well.

2269
02:25:49,625 --> 02:25:50,750
Is that a crime?

2270
02:25:52,291 --> 02:25:55,958
You've arranged for a survey
on election result trends if I die.

2271
02:25:56,375 --> 02:25:58,833
Now that I'm leaving,
get a fresh survey done.

2272
02:25:58,916 --> 02:25:59,875
Where will you go?

2273
02:26:00,791 --> 02:26:01,708
If you go,

2274
02:26:01,791 --> 02:26:04,875
I'll kill everyone in that place!

2275
02:26:05,166 --> 02:26:07,583
You're threatening me
even after you saw him?

2276
02:26:08,625 --> 02:26:10,541
Back then, he was as tall as your knee.

2277
02:26:10,916 --> 02:26:13,125
Now, he has made you kneel!

2278
02:26:13,208 --> 02:26:14,208
What the heck?

2279
02:26:14,625 --> 02:26:16,375
Why are you talking nonsense like him?

2280
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:19,666
Why would I talk like him, Dad?

2281
02:26:20,208 --> 02:26:22,208
He talks like me.

2282
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,416
Because he is my son.

2283
02:26:27,833 --> 02:26:28,708
Son?!

2284
02:26:29,041 --> 02:26:30,375
I will show you…

2285
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:35,708
Can you say that again?

2286
02:26:37,875 --> 02:26:39,166
You are my son.

2287
02:26:45,833 --> 02:26:47,166
Why didn't you tell me all these years?

2288
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:51,166
Feelings aren't beholden to words, Son.

2289
02:26:57,083 --> 02:26:58,291
When I came home, I was kicked out.

2290
02:26:58,875 --> 02:27:00,500
But I watched you from upstairs.

2291
02:27:04,583 --> 02:27:05,791
Why did you slap me?

2292
02:27:06,375 --> 02:27:07,875
I wanted to touch you.

2293
02:27:11,666 --> 02:27:13,166
At the hospital,
you said you didn't like me.

2294
02:27:14,250 --> 02:27:16,791
Before that, I mentioned
my favorite things, didn't I?

2295
02:27:17,583 --> 02:27:18,500
Before what?

2296
02:27:19,750 --> 02:27:20,625
Son…

2297
02:27:21,625 --> 02:27:23,500
When you were a child,
you used to bother me about food.

2298
02:27:24,541 --> 02:27:26,375
Now, you want to trouble me
about talking?

2299
02:27:28,125 --> 02:27:30,875
Only death can separate
a mother from her son.

2300
02:27:43,208 --> 02:27:44,833
Bloody hell, Venkat Swamy!

2301
02:27:45,958 --> 02:27:49,125
Waiting another 25 years
to hear this again would be worthwhile.

2302
02:27:50,875 --> 02:27:52,958
When she speaks,
it's not just my ears that listen,

2303
02:27:53,708 --> 02:27:55,166
but my entire body.

2304
02:27:55,875 --> 02:27:56,958
-Hey!
-Hey!

2305
02:27:57,083 --> 02:27:58,708
Why do you want to talk to him?
Come on.

2306
02:28:00,041 --> 02:28:00,958
Hey!

2307
02:28:01,250 --> 02:28:02,125
Wait!

2308
02:28:03,166 --> 02:28:05,416
Hey, wait!

2309
02:28:07,416 --> 02:28:09,333
Hey!

2310
02:28:12,833 --> 02:28:13,750
Hey!

2311
02:28:17,958 --> 02:28:19,083
Long live…

2312
02:28:20,166 --> 02:28:21,375
Long live…

2313
02:28:22,208 --> 02:28:23,458
Long live…

2314
02:29:33,625 --> 02:29:34,541
What is it?

2315
02:29:38,541 --> 02:29:39,875
As soon as I saw you…

2316
02:29:41,125 --> 02:29:42,500
I wanted to pick a big fight.

2317
02:29:44,208 --> 02:29:46,041
But the moment you touched me,
I forgot everything.

2318
02:29:49,875 --> 02:29:50,750
What?

2319
02:29:51,375 --> 02:29:52,666
You are so handsome.

2320
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:55,500
-Why the beard?
-This?

2321
02:29:58,041 --> 02:29:59,000
Love failure.

2322
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:01,375
Hey!

2323
02:30:01,833 --> 02:30:02,750
Who is the girl?

2324
02:30:06,375 --> 02:30:07,250
You.

2325
02:30:14,083 --> 02:30:15,791
Hey, when did you get here?

2326
02:30:28,541 --> 02:30:29,458
Bujji…

2327
02:30:36,458 --> 02:30:37,458
How are you?

2328
02:30:44,083 --> 02:30:45,041
Bujji!

2329
02:30:45,166 --> 02:30:46,583
Bujji… Bujji!

2330
02:31:01,875 --> 02:31:02,958
Sister-in-law…

2331
02:31:40,791 --> 02:31:42,208
How are you, Satya?

2332
02:31:44,291 --> 02:31:45,208
How are you?

2333
02:31:49,875 --> 02:31:50,875
My room…

2334
02:31:53,750 --> 02:31:54,791
your memories…

2335
02:31:57,958 --> 02:31:59,708
Here… like this…

2336
02:32:22,750 --> 02:32:24,083
Old songs…

2337
02:32:25,083 --> 02:32:26,458
Old bike…

2338
02:32:28,833 --> 02:32:29,833
Old wife…

2339
02:32:33,208 --> 02:32:34,208
I didn't give up anything.

2340
02:32:40,166 --> 02:32:44,708
Did it take you so long
to stop being angry with me?

2341
02:32:47,583 --> 02:32:52,625
It took me so many years
to stop being afraid of my dad.

2342
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,833
You were so hurt
that you had shut the door on her.

2343
02:33:21,083 --> 02:33:22,375
Today, you opened
the door to her yourself.

2344
02:33:23,166 --> 02:33:24,208
It's even now.

2345
02:33:37,166 --> 02:33:38,333
-Hey, Samba!
-Yes?

2346
02:33:39,083 --> 02:33:40,791
Shall I give you a nice caption?

2347
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:43,416
"Ramana is rebellious…

2348
02:33:44,416 --> 02:33:46,000
because he has two mothers. "

2349
02:34:09,083 --> 02:34:11,000
{\an8}Hey, Venkat Swamy is calling.

2350
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,458
Cut the call and block him.

2351
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:25,208
All this while you have been sharpening
a needle instead of a knife.

2352
02:34:25,791 --> 02:34:27,583
I will start sharpening
the knife then.

2353
02:34:28,666 --> 02:34:30,583
My constituency should not be orphaned.

2354
02:34:31,291 --> 02:34:32,500
We need Ramana.

2355
02:34:32,916 --> 02:34:33,916
He won't come.

2356
02:34:34,166 --> 02:34:35,458
What would bring him to us?

2357
02:34:35,875 --> 02:34:36,833
Father-in-law…

2358
02:34:37,208 --> 02:34:40,000
during every festival, we decorate
with festoons made of mango leaves.

2359
02:34:40,541 --> 02:34:42,166
It's considered auspicious, right?

2360
02:34:42,375 --> 02:34:43,958
After a few days, the leaves dry up,

2361
02:34:44,041 --> 02:34:47,916
and the rustling sound they make
becomes irritating to the ear.

2362
02:34:48,041 --> 02:34:51,375
We can't discard it
due to sentimental reasons.

2363
02:34:52,375 --> 02:34:53,583
You are just like that.

2364
02:34:53,958 --> 02:34:56,750
Discarding you would be a sin
while keeping you would pose a risk.

2365
02:34:57,416 --> 02:34:58,625
Drop the matter.

2366
02:35:13,458 --> 02:35:14,958
-He isn't home.
-I know.

2367
02:35:15,333 --> 02:35:16,208
Wow!

2368
02:35:16,291 --> 02:35:17,166
Hi, sir.

2369
02:35:17,416 --> 02:35:18,333
-Hey!
-Sir?

2370
02:35:18,541 --> 02:35:20,208
-Are those clothes?
-Yes, sir.

2371
02:35:20,416 --> 02:35:22,208
-Bought or tailored?
-Ready-made, sir.

2372
02:35:23,458 --> 02:35:24,458
Shall we go?

2373
02:35:24,791 --> 02:35:25,708
Where to, sir?

2374
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:26,958
Why do you care?

2375
02:35:27,291 --> 02:35:28,458
When will you be back?

2376
02:35:28,916 --> 02:35:30,708
-Tomorrow evening.
-Tomorrow evening?

2377
02:35:31,083 --> 02:35:32,416
What should I tell Mr. Pani?

2378
02:35:32,625 --> 02:35:33,791
Tell him she has eloped.

2379
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,541
I carried her to school
with these hands, sir.

2380
02:35:37,916 --> 02:35:39,500
Using the same hands,
lead her to the wedding altar.

2381
02:35:42,791 --> 02:35:43,791
Careful, sir.

2382
02:35:44,375 --> 02:35:45,333
Your sari…

2383
02:35:47,666 --> 02:35:49,708
-If it weren't for you, Balu…
-Sir?

2384
02:35:50,458 --> 02:35:53,833
I would have driven her to Guntur
in my Jeep the very first day I saw her!

2385
02:35:54,416 --> 02:35:55,500
First day!

2386
02:35:56,958 --> 02:35:58,416
That's what you are doing right now, sir.
