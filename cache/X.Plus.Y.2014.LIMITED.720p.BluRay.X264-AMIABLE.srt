My son, he's quite picky

261

and he needs the meal number
to be a prime number

and there to be a prime number
of prawn balls.

And, um,

264

if he had nine balls
it wouldn't be a prime number

- Well done, mate.
- JULIE: Oh, well done.

319
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:36,760
Why is that unfortunate?

320
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:37,916
No, I was having a joke, mate.

321
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,770
It says the training camp's
in Taiwan this year.

322
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:42,207
- Have you ever been on a plane before?
- No. He's not.

323
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,381
- Well, that's exciting, isn't it?
- Um...

324
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,178
But...

325
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,264
I should study.

326
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:52,585
- Are you leaving now, or...
- Nathan. (LAUGHS)

327
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,540
He doesn't mean that.

328
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:56,760
Probably, yeah.

329
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,415
- Okay.
- Well...

330
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,710
- I'm gonna go and study.
- JULIE: Okay.

331
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,427
Well done, mate.

332
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,756
- He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

333
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:09,167
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

334
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:10,966
- I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

335
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:12,053
Would you like...

336
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:13,646
I should probably shoot off.

337
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,039
Okay, no, that's fine.

338
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:16,717
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

339
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,046
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

340
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,165
To join us next month,

341
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:31,545
take him to the airport.

342
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,636
I know that would make Nathan happy.

343
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,382
(CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)

344
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:43,102
I should probably tell you before they...

345
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:45,560
I'm taking a bit of a break from work.

346
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,296
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

347
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,583
It's a bit like I'm being fired, basically.

348
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,213
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,583
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm not working

350
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:58,437
for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

351
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,802
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, if that's all right with you?

352
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:03,926
- That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

353
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,457
Oh! Jesus Christ!

354
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:08,803
(GASPS)

355
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:11,928
Oh, my God!

356
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,135
That's a bit of a weird one.

357
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,510
- Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

358
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,175
- Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

359
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,334
- Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

360
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,925
- Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

361
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,181
We were just talking, Nathan.

362
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:40,061
I was looking at Jupiter.

363
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,342
I didn't do it on purpose.

364
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,373
It was just...

365
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:51,626
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

366
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:54,722
For once. For me.

367
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,791
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

368
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,391
Okay.

369
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:35,725
MICHAEL: What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

370
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:39,338
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

371
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,427
(CHUCKLES)

372
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:44,302
353!

373
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:45,801
Whoa!

374
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:47,300
Just in time.

375
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:48,682
Perfect timing.

376
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,459
JULIE: Fireworks night again, is it?

377
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:51,552
(MICHAEL CHUCKLES)

378
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,708
He's letting you hold his hand, isn't he?

379
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:54,968
The sparkler helps.

380
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:56,719
Come on, Nathan.

381
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,561
It's time to change the fish.

382
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:02,352
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

383
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,341
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

384
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:05,800
- You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

385
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:07,833
- You're lucky I'm here, that's all.
{MICHAEL LAUGHS)

386
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,934
- MICHAEL: I'm lucky.“
- Yeah, you get me.

387
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:24,004
- I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

388
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,473
- Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

389
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,097
I told you, you're not getting...

390
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:29,466
- Ice cream, Julie!
- (GIGGLES)

391
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,420
Nathan?

392
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,510
Jesus.

393
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:43,677
Nathan!

394
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:47,468
Oh!

395
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:48,801
Nathan, It's okay.

396
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,804
Nathan, I'm not angry.

397
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,086
Nathan!

398
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:55,539
Michael? Michael?

399
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:15,385
JULIE: Everything all right?
NATHAN: Yeah.

400
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,641
I'm quite looking FORWARD to this
in a weird sort of way.

401
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:18,718
JULIE: Yeah, I know.

402
00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:20,875
Little trip down memory lane.

403
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:23,679
- JULIE: Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

404
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:26,051
This is for you.

405
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:31,218
JULIE: Nathan...

406
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,218
What do you say?

407
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,668
- Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

408
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,044
so they're probably cursed.

409
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:40,467
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

410
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:41,924
JULIE: Very lovely of you.
MARTIN: Right then.

411
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,549
- Shall we get this show on the road?
- JULIE: Yep. Let's go.

412
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:45,801
Nathan?

413
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:48,833
Can you get in the back with me?

414
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:52,344
Nathan, I think Mr. Humphreys will be
more comfortable in the front.

415
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:54,711
It's okay, darling.

416
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,560
Darling, darling, it's okay.

417
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:58,502
I'll drive carefully.

418
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,010
No, It's all right.

419
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,372
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

420
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,758
MARTIN: Christ.

421
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,215
It's Tricky Dicky. Look out.

422
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:30,764
All right, Richard?

423
00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:32,134
Oh!

424
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:35,048
Martin Humphreys. '95.

425
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:37,580
Humphreys! Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

426
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,122
Yes. The last I heard, you were, um...

427
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:42,887
- Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

428
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:45,878
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

429
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:48,544
- It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

430
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:50,221
Wasted opportunity, this one.

431
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,674
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

432
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:57,096
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

433
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,432
No, I'm dropping this one off, actually.

434
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:01,593
Ah!

435
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:03,713
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

436
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:05,602
The dragon. Ah!

437
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,246
And where have you been lying dormant, eh?

438
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:09,788
It's not often we have a mind like yours
spring up off the radar.

439
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:10,884
He's mine.

440
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:13,753
I mean, I'm his...
Um, I've been teaching him.

441
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:17,011
Ah. The plot thickens.

442
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:19,349
Well, we'll get you
signed in, shall we, eh?

443
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,433
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

444
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,300
Oh, well, Nathan, darling. (CHUCKLES)

445
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,872
Um...

446
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,932
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

447
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,134
Yeah.

448
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,163
Make sure you ring me
as soon as you land, yeah?

449
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,212
- All right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

450
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,551
Sorry.

451
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:57,767
RICHARD: Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

452
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:00,642
<i>(STUDENTS CHATTERING)</i>

453
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,643
Mingle. Mingle.

454
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:05,621
Um, watch your step,
there's a chess game going on.

455
00:29:11,923 --> 00:29:13,796
Hey. How do you do?

456
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,835
How do I do what?

457
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,795
I mean, what's your name?

458
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:22,874
- Nathan.
- I'm Isaac.

459
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:26,465
I'm guessing this is your first maths camp?
You'll be fine.

460
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,345
Best thing is just to dive in.

461
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,749
Come. Sit down.

462
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:32,923
I mean, can you believe the Chinese team?

463
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:35,300
They won six golds again last year.

464
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:39,809
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

465
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:43,183
if I'm allowed to split infinitives,
to possibly change.

466
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,455
Which I believe I technically am now.

467
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,256
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time

468
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:52,139
came in the introductory lines
of Star Trek, "to boldly go," and...

469
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,971
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series

470
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,100
can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,004
Don't worry, he's always like this.

00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:12,629
Pav is from India. Pav.

478
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:14,287
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

479
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:17,801
Yes, but of course I meant your origins,
not your birthplace,

480
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,891
before we open that little Pandora's box.

481
00:30:20,006 --> 00:30:21,666
- Oh, dear!
- (ALL CHUCKLE)

482
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,385
RICHARD: Seat belts on, please.
Seat belts on.

483
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,182
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

484
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,052
Right, away you go, driver.

485
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:41,642
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

486
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,085
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks

487
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,751
or whatever the insult du jour might be.

488
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:51,851
But here, you are among kindred spirits.

489
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:55,579
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

490
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:59,726
you'll know that there are six places
available yet more than six of you.

491
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:03,682
Which means that this, to a large extent,
is about whittling you down.

492
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:08,085
Now, we will be training with four other
national teams in Taiwan.

493
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,382
And after some
delicate diplomatic negotiation,

494
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:13,706
I can confirm that the Chinese
will be one of them.

495
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,628
Now we should, of course, be cordial

496
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:20,549
as it falls to us to host
the competition this year, in Cambridge.

497
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,711
But that doesn't mean we can't be ruthless.

498
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,588
Now, I want you up there
with the Chinese, top of the table.

499
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:32,578
And I will consider it an abhorrent
failure to include a candidate

500
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,462
who does not win a medal.

501
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,130
Be under no illusion.
This is all about winning.

502
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,592
Although that doesn't mean it can't be fun.

I like the Fibonacci sequence, too.

508
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:07,718

509
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:10,096

511
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:13,537
How's that going?

512
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,830
Okay, so you're the shy type.

513
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,673
Makes a nice change, to be honest.

514
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:28,006
Most of these weirdos just wanna show off
about how much maths junk they know.

515
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:30,549
What?

516
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:32,424
Nothing.

517
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,932
It's just I'm usually the weird one.

518
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,675
They do all seem good at maths, though.

519
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:41,715
REBECCA: Yeah.

520
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:46,553
Here you are neither weird
nor the best mathematician, I'm afraid.

521
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,426
You are painstakingly average.

I'll need to branch out into

523

to describe a unified field theory

for the four fundamental forces of nature.

525
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:37,048
Are you one of the fundamental
forces of nature, Luke?

526
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:38,882
No.

527
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:41,246
But you are terribly gifted, aren't you?

528
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,889
Yes. Gifted but not arrogant, Isaac.

Can someone help the man, please?

904
01:00:54,871 --> 01:01:00,548

at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

905
01:01:00,912 --> 01:01:02,287
As numbers.

906
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:07,325
We can call face-down cards...

907
01:01:10,496 --> 01:01:11,586
One.

908
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:14,917
Face-up cards... Zero.

909
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:20,406
And initially it would be a sequence
of ones as the cards are all face down.

910
01:01:20,537 --> 01:01:25,954
But after a while it would look
something like that.

911
01:01:27,704 --> 01:01:30,549
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

912
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:35,533
And a move that consists of turning
a face-down card face up

913
01:01:35,662 --> 01:01:38,862
and the card immediately to the right of it

914
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:43,741
could be that a one followed by a one,

915
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:47,585
will turn into a zero followed by a zero.

916
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:54,582
That would be like that.
Or it could be a one followed by a zero

917
01:01:54,787 --> 01:01:58,366
turning into a zero followed by a one.

918
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:05,817
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

919
01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:09,699
And that means?

920
01:02:11,745 --> 01:02:14,211
Which means that the sequence
must terminate.

How did your mum and dad explain it to you?

1110

When they found out.

1111
01:17:48,615 --> 01:17:50,155

1127
01:19:31,906 --> 01:19:36,410
When I speak to people
of a non-mathematical nature,

1128
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:42,315
they always struggle with the notion
that mathematics can be beautiful.

1129
01:19:43,406 --> 01:19:46,748
But if beauty is truth and truth is beauty,

1130
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:50,910
well, then surely mathematics
is the most beautiful thing of all.

Which worries me.

You need to focus

And don't be distracted
