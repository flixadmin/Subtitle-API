1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,963
[retches]

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,801
[Sara] Any chance of getting this thing
running again?

3
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,472
The simplicity of the thermosyphon
cooling is sheer elegance.

4
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,766
The capitalist dictate
of constant improvement

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,186
often pushes us past the pinnacle
of achievement into inferior products.

6
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,189
And this your brain off of drugs?

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,525
Hey, don't weed shame me. I know stuff.

8
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,110
So, is that a yes? Because, soon enough,

9
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,838
someone's gonna see
that J. Edgar Hoover's missing,

10
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:28,964
and the timeline's gonna start changing.

11
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,032
If I can find some water, yes.

12
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,515
Oh, Gary, can you check the back seat
for some water, please?

13
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,411
I think I saw something
under Hoover's coat.

14
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,789
Please don't mention his name.

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,958
This guy is giving me
terrible indigestion.

16
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,573
- [Gary retches]
- It was probably all those cigars. Ugh!

17
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,962
Or all the bigotry.

18
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,131
[Agent Sharpe] Oh!

19
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,718
Uh, I've got some soda. Does that work?

20
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,178
We'll find out.

21
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:53,805
[Sara] How about this?

22
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,099
A radio!

23
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,601
Oh. We can pick up some newscasts.

24
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,744
[man on radio] <i>The lovely and lethal
Bullet Blondes remain at large.</i>

25
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,695
<i>Last seen driving east
on the Bankhead Highway.</i>

26
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,906
<i>Caution advised.
They are considered armed and dangerous.</i>

27
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,242
Huh. I can't believe the name stuck.

28
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,910
Yeah, and they didn't mention Hoover,

29
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,745
which means
they think he's still alive.

30
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:19,706
Well, he's not.

31
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,004
Nate, what's up?

32
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,807
We've gotten out of tighter spots
than this.

33
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,591
Have we?

34
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,551
Mick's gone, Astra's down for the count,

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,554
Zari is nursing a broken heart
in a pocket dimension,

36
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,639
and I killed J. Edgar Hoover.

37
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,159
It was an accident, and it could have
happened to any man of steel.

38
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,183
That's not funny.

39
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,687
I spent my whole life studying history,

40
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,939
making sure
it's preserved and passed on.

41
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,151
By killing Hoover, I personally
messed up the entire 20th century.

42
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,611
Look, we're gonna fix it, okay?

43
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,155
Are we?
Because without Gideon or the ship,

44
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,781
there's no way you can guarantee that.

45
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:54,907
Nate, you are spinning.

46
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,367
I murdered a man, Sara.

47
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,494
And for the first time in our lives,

48
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,414
we have to accept that
that could be permanent.

49
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:02,789
Okay, look...

50
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:05,585
Uh... Wife, Nate,
we've got a big problem.

51
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,480
Hoover was supposed to be on a train to
New York from Midland, this afternoon.

52
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,757
If he's not there,
the whole timeline's screwed.

53
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,259
No, it won't be.

54
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:17,972
Nate, history needs saving,
and you are just the man to do it.

55
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,433
So long as the world thinks
that Hoover is still alive,

56
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,185
then the timeline remains on track.

57
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,354
No, no, no.
I know what you're thinking. No.

58
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:27,106
There's no way I can impersonate Hoover
all the way to New York.

59
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,067
I could barely do it
in some podunk Texas town.

60
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,779
- Gary!
- Huh?

61
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,782
Can you do some kind of spell
and make him look like Hoover?

62
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,159
[retches] Uh...

63
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:44,999
Technically, yes, but I'd need some
of Hoover's spit, or a fingernail.

64
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,835
[retches]

65
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,088
Or hair.

66
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,966
[engine starting]

67
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,344
We're mobile, people.

68
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:01,099
Well, good, because J. Edgar Hoover
has a train to catch.

69
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,310
[theme music playing]

70
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,501
I did a spell to resurrect a machine.

71
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,294
I don't know what this is.

72
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,047
[Spooner] I'd recognize
that smug little smile anywhere.

73
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,548
It is Gideon.

74
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,260
She doesn't look like a machine.

75
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,679
Well, not a machine exactly, <i>Mami.</i>

76
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:44,016
A computer, who speaks. Usually.

77
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,186
Hello, computer.

78
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,441
On the upside, it looks like
you got your magic working again.

79
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,860
My magic is clearly garbage.

80
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,236
Stop that.

81
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,156
She's still Gideon though, right?

82
00:03:58,823 --> 00:03:59,907
What's two plus two?

83
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,285
There you go.

84
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:05,955
[gasps]

85
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,415
[laughs]

86
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:11,335
Wow. Computers are very exciting.

87
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:14,755
Sorry.

88
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,180
Is it ready?

89
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:26,017
Not yet, it needs to fully ferment.
This is just the primary stage.

90
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay, we need to come up with
some kind of distraction or something

91
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,831
because that train leaves in five
minutes and Hoover needs to be on it.

92
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,399
And to the public eye, he will be.

93
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,902
Look, because they're
not gonna be looking at him.

94
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:42,116
No, they are going to be looking
at the most wanted women in America.

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
What?

96
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,163
- Oh, I'm not sure about this.
- Just follow my lead. Come on.

97
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,917
My safe word is "core competency."

98
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,632
Coming through here.
Look out, we've got the Bullet Blondes!

99
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,325
This isn't the last you're gonna hear
of the Bullet Blondes.

100
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,844
That's right, coppers.

101
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,538
[Behrad] Who you calling the cops?

102
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,782
We're the Bureau of Investigation.

103
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,975
[Gary] That's right, and J. Edgar Hoover
always gets his man, or woman,

104
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,520
or gender nonconforming individual.

105
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,272
I'll need four extra tickets
for my associates.

106
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,566
Are those the Bullet Blondes?

107
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,736
Well, we're not a pair
of cancelled stamps.

108
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,781
Mr. Hoover, let me find some seats
for you and your men.

109
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:22,865
[grunts]

110
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,832
Our most secure cabin
is the honeymoon suite.

111
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,501
[knocking]

112
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:39,298
In the name of J. Edgar Hoover,
I am commandeering this cabin.

113
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:42,969
Oh, no. No need to commandeer.
We don't wanna spoil your honeymoon.

114
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,846
Spoil? Phonus balonus.

115
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:49,350
After them Palmer Raids, we'd be proud
to help out a patriot like Mr. Hoover.

116
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,895
[all muttering indistinctly]

117
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,775
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, best wishes.

118
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,615
Phew! That was close.

119
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,409
Can you please take these off now?

120
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,741
What were the Palmer Raids?

121
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,166
After World War I, America
was freaking out about communism.

122
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,796
So Hoover and the DOJ arrested thousands
of immigrants, union workers,

123
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,715
anything that smelled like
organized labor.

124
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,800
A real champion of civil liberties.

125
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,220
Oh, he pretty much codified racial bias
into our judicial system.

126
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:29,390
Okay, but morally, he's repulsive.

127
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,434
Historically, however,

128
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,729
he's one of the most important men
of the 20th century.

129
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,481
He founded the FBI.
He ran it till he died.

130
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,026
Yeah, well, great men
aren't usually good guys.

131
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,445
[train rumbling]

132
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,405
And that is our cue to disappear.

133
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,282
Oh, B, key me.

134
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,454
The key, Time Bureau manual
and some honeymoon chocolates.

135
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,582
Say hi to Z for me.

136
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,636
<i>Capitáns,</i> hey.

137
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,012
Are we home yet?

138
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,931
How did your bank robbery go?

139
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,391
Did we figure out
who blew up the <i>Waverider</i> yet or no?

140
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,727
Am I talking too much?
Am I talking not too much?

141
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,938
- I think she's a little high.
- I'd say very.

142
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,272
We're still in 1925.

143
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,815
And now we're on a train.

144
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,152
What? Where are we going?

145
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:27,323
But really, where is
anybody really going?

146
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,700
You okay, Z?
I thought you didn't partake.

147
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,243
[speaking gibberish]

148
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,039
See, I found myself on a journey,

149
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,584
and that journey
is with these tiny little bears.

150
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,755
And I'm going on that journey
à la carte.

151
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,052
Allah carte!

152
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,971
Allah... carte.

153
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,639
Okay, well, we'll be upstairs.

154
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,517
Yeah, if you need anything, please don't
hesitate to come and find us.

155
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,560
Actually, hesitate a little.

156
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,854
- Oh. Hesitate a lot.
- Mmm!

157
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,274
Ugh. Gross moms.

158
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,657
Hey. Maybe we won't even
need that potion.

159
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,801
We just hide out in the cabin.

160
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,910
- [knocking on door]
- [man] You in there, Speed?

161
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,453
"Speed"?

162
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,515
That was Hoover's nickname.

163
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,139
Only his closest friends
called him that.

164
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,333
It's Francis Baker.

165
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,293
Junior, of course.

166
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:25,297
Oh, the GW boys are gonna go wild
when I tell them I saw you.

167
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,592
- Gary, potion.
- It's frothing ready.

168
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,761
All right, how long does the spell last?

169
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:34,306
It depends upon your metabolism.
Could be an hour. Could be 24.

170
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,435
Hey. It sounds like Hoover
was a supreme douche.

171
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,478
You really sure you want to be him?

172
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,731
I have to clean up my mess, B.

173
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,318
Wait, don't drink it in front of us.

174
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,159
Did it work?

175
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,137
We don't know,
since you drank it in front of us,

176
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,389
we'll only know if the magic works
when someone else sees you.

177
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,414
For the love of...

178
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,832
[knocking at door]

179
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,877
[Baker] This is silly.
Let me see your...

180
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:06,464
face.

181
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,220
- Edgar, there's that handsome mug.
- [chuckles]

182
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,857
Let me buy you lunch, Speed.

183
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,778
The oysters here give Old Ebbitt's
a run for their money.

184
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,280
[both chuckle]

185
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,411
[all laughing]

186
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,372
Director of the
Bureau of Investigation at 29.

187
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,166
Speed indeed.

188
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,463
I think you fellas
will be more comfortable elsewhere.

189
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:53,928
Yeah, sure.

190
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,429
More comfortable.

191
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,274
Ew.

192
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:09,485
No, thank you.

193
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,196
Oh. She made a little doll.

194
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,448
I wish the Legends
would just get back already.

195
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,009
They would know exactly
what to do with her

196
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,618
and her creepy outsider apple art.

197
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,912
They can't find this Dr. Davies guy
soon enough.

198
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,085
[Spooner] Oh! Oh, Gideon!

199
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,923
[sighs] Great, now she's broken.

200
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,057
Hey! You okay?

201
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,103
Yeah, why?

202
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,523
Oh, man. Are you mad
that we're honeymooning in your house

203
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,316
after everything that
happened with John...

204
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,985
Shh, Aves,

205
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,195
I love you.

206
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,780
I love you both.

207
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,074
I love your love.

208
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,827
I love that you're loving each other
right now,

209
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,747
even if that love is happening directly
above me while I eat sugar foam.

210
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,040
[laughs]

211
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:09,170
Okay, well, if you ever want to talk
or anything, just come find me.

212
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:13,299
No, seriously, I am A-okay, golden.

213
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,137
You know what, just hear me out, Z.

214
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,723
No judgment, okay? I'm just...

215
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,493
I think you and Behrad
are very different people,

216
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,895
and I think that maybe
your coping mechanisms

217
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,938
might not be the same
as his coping mechanisms.

218
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,985
You know, honestly, I'm not sure that
I'm doing this stoned thing correctly

219
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:38,657
because I either feel like very hungry,
or tired all of the time.

220
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,618
That can't be it. Can that be it?

221
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,329
I don't know. You're a doer, though,
you know, you're like me.

222
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,372
Oh, it's true, I love a project.

223
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,933
You love a project?
Let's find you a project.

224
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,293
Ooh! Cleaning. Cleaning!
That's a good one.

225
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,818
[gasps] I'm gonna clean this place.

226
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,838
I'm gonna clean this place
clean of John vibes.

227
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:54,506
Yes! Yes, that's my girl.

228
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,841
You know, at minimum,

229
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,053
it will give me an excuse
to leave this room because...

230
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,180
you guys are very loud.

231
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,682
What? Come on, we're not loud.

232
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,188
"Core competency." Boop!

233
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,776
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

234
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,028
God!

235
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,991
[people chattering indistinctly]

236
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,876
So, tell me, is there a Mrs. Hoover?

237
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,003
Oh, no, ma'am. I'm married to my job.

238
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,506
Well, let me give you my card

239
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,092
in case you and your job
ever get divorced.

240
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,013
My purse, it's gone!

241
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,556
Never fear, madam.

242
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,811
You have the nation's finest detective
at your service.

243
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,482
Should we round up the usual suspects?

244
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,533
Those are my men.

245
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:17,298
No one is leaving this car
till we get that purse back.

246
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:18,966
[gasps]

247
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,926
Now, what was in your purse?

248
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:22,927
Jewelry?

249
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,309
Money?

250
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,898
Anything of note?

251
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,486
Hmm...

252
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,156
My calling card, my comb,

253
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,867
and one of those delightful pastries
from the breakfast cart.

254
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,454
You never know when you might get
a flash of the grumblies.

255
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,833
Hmm. Oh, my.

256
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,002
[rustling]

257
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,090
[man] Goldie!

258
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,053
I believe this is
what you're looking for.

259
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,346
Huzzah!

260
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,431
Thank you, Mr. Hoover.

261
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,891
[all applauding]

262
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,579
- [all] Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!
- Thank you. Thank you.

263
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,895
Stop. What are you doing?

264
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,982
[applause continues]

265
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,776
[mouthing]

266
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,943
Oh.

267
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,820
Well, I must get back to work.

268
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:26,200
If only all the bad guys
were as easy to catch as Goldie here.

269
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,828
Marvelous seeing you,
Francis Baker Jr., of course. Okay.

270
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,248
It's working, they're buying it.

271
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,519
Yeah, they're buying that Gary and I
are petty thieves because of our looks.

272
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,962
I'm trying to be as authentically Hoover
as possible.

273
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,048
I wouldn't mind
a little less authenticity.

274
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,802
Why don't we go back to Plan A?
Hunkering.

275
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,031
You're right. We should play it safe
till we get to New York.

276
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,473
- [rumbling]
- [brakes squealing]

277
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,600
Ow!

278
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,435
[steam hissing]

279
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,983
Get off!

280
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,322
Director Hoover.
Thank God. We just got word from HQ.

281
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,116
There's a plot afoot to kidnap you.

282
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,559
We need to get you off this train.

283
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,913
[clears throat]

284
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,039
Give me a minute.

285
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,645
I'm sure we could find a way
to get to New York

286
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,505
that doesn't involve Hoover cosplay,
or kidnapping.

287
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,608
Listen, the real J. Edgar Hoover
was never kidnapped,

288
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,752
so he must have solved this.

289
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,511
No, this is getting
way too out of control.

290
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,197
I mean, I'm sure we can fix this
with a do-over.

291
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,532
What if there's no more do-overs?

292
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,837
What if this is it?
We owe it to history to make it right.

293
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,731
Gentlemen, this sounds like a case
for the Bureau of Investigation.

294
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,116
Has she had anything to drink?

295
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,994
She doesn't need anything to drink,
she's not a person.

296
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,418
I may not know what a computer is,
but I know a heartbeat.

297
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,879
And you made that, Astra.

298
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:08,719
You are not only a very powerful witch,
you're also a mother now.

299
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,014
- I am nobody's mother!
- Dang.

300
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,309
Now, what will the team do
with a human Gideon?

301
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,352
Probably just give her Rory's old room.

302
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,436
There's always space for one more
with the Legends.

303
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,648
Where are your Legends now, anyway?

304
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,151
They went to New York
to meet this time-travel guy.

305
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,320
Once they find him,
they're gonna come get us.

306
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,990
Okay, I'm no expert, but it seems to me

307
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,659
if you have a machine
that can travel through time,

308
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,914
what do you just go back to,
right after the moment you left?

309
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,000
- I mean, unless...
- It didn't work.

310
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,924
What was the word from HQ?

311
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,635
Not a lot of detail.

312
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,804
The Dallas field office
intercepted a telegram.

313
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,518
"Hoover on tren, northbond."

314
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,028
"Train" and "northbound"
are both misspelled.

315
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,898
- So he's a foreigner.
- Or a bad speller.

316
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,276
The men in Little Rock
are gonna alert DC.

317
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,296
Planning to have agents
at every station on the route.

318
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Good.

319
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,288
Mr. Hoover says
we're looking for a foreigner.

320
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,450
- I didn't say that.
- Stay put in here, Mr. Hoover.

321
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,744
We'll turn this train upside down
till we find our man.

322
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,164
Hoover doesn't run an investigation
from behind.

323
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,876
All right, all we got to go on
is this telegram,

324
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,003
which doesn't give us a motive
or a means,

325
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,465
but its timing does narrow down
a list of possible suspects.

326
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,176
Donovan, Rodgers, get me a list

327
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,762
of all the passengers
that got on this train since Midland.

328
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,597
- Go!
- On it, sir.

329
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,618
The three of us are gonna start
at the front of the train,

330
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,185
and we're gonna work our way back.

331
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,105
We're looking for anyone
who has a reason to hurt Hoover.

332
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,068
Who would possibly
want to hurt that guy?

333
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,321
A "please" would have been nice.

334
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,659
Is there anyone on this train

335
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,620
you may suspect
of having anti-government sentiment?

336
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,788
Anti-government?

337
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,456
The government is the only thing

338
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,500
keeping this country
from going to the dogs.

339
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,212
Have you heard anyone
talk about anarchy or...

340
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,591
socialism?

341
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,759
Well, that depends.

342
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,637
Would you call a working wage socialism?

343
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,141
Then, yeah,
I'd say we're all talking about it.

344
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,520
Lovely to see America by train car.

345
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:28,275
Be a lot lovelier if I wasn't
being spied on by a bunch of dicks.

346
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,403
- By "dick," do you mean cop?
- Mmm.

347
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,531
You think someone on this train
is a ne'er-do-well?

348
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,328
Good luck pulling one over
on America's finest lawman.

349
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,829
That's very nice of you.

350
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,498
Hoover? [spits three times]

351
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,000
That man is cursed.

352
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,085
You have no idea.

353
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,340
Hoover? Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

354
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,426
Ugh. Tell me about it.

355
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,222
Everybody on this train loves Hoover.

356
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,183
Yeah, everybody with
first class tickets.

357
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,353
The people we talked to
would be happy to kill Hoover.

358
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,605
If we're looking for motive, we got it.

359
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,273
Lots of it.

360
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,957
Which is as good as finding none at all.

361
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:14,780
We're switching this investigation
away from the why and onto the how.

362
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,532
And with agents in every city,

363
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,345
it would be pretty hard pulling off
a kidnapping in any of the stations.

364
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,620
They'd get caught immediately.

365
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:22,829
Or congratulated.

366
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,792
But if you get the train
off the main route...

367
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,794
No one would be guarding the track.

368
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,339
And if you could redirect the train,
you have control of the train.

369
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,882
Ooh! Inside job!

370
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,342
- Inside job?
- Inside job!

371
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:39,805
Director Hoover, meet Igor Lewandoski,
the train's engineer.

372
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,516
A Russian and a labor organizer.

373
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,959
He wasn't scheduled to work today
but had a change of heart.

374
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,479
He joined the crew back in Midland.
Awfully convenient.

375
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,498
- Did he confess?
- He won't say diddly.

376
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,843
But he's our guy, I'm sure of it.

377
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,985
Trust you can get the confession
we need.

378
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,946
Do your worst, boss.

379
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,364
Yeah.

380
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,251
Boy, a very sad party of one
happened in here.

381
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,086
It doesn't matter.

382
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,881
Zen in ten.
Here I come, starting with the fridge.

383
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,554
See, even I know
you don't keep whiskey in the fridge.

384
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,032
- Aves.
- Hi, Z.

385
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,344
How many bottles of whiskey
are there on the table?

386
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,537
- Um... Two.
- Two!

387
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,125
- The fridge is making whiskey.
- What? That's fantastic!

388
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,085
The <i>Waverider.</i>

389
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,756
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of like the <i>Waverider.</i>

390
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,675
Although, the fridge doesn't
take requests like Gideon.

391
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,219
No, no, no. This bottle,
this bottle is the <i>Waverider.</i>

392
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,264
And this bottle is the mystery <i>Waverider</i>
that blew us up.

393
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,767
So if there's two <i>Waveriders...</i>

394
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,227
who's to say there isn't...

395
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,314
[gasps]

396
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:14,983
A third <i>Waverider.</i>

397
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,280
And a fourth. It will never end.

398
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,283
[Agent Sharpe] Oh, I get it.

399
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,243
You're still really stoned.

400
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,536
So, let's say we go back

401
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,140
and stop the mystery <i>Waverider</i>
from blowing us up, that's great.

402
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,475
But that <i>Waverider</i> came from somewhere,

403
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,584
which means if one showed up,
then another one could

404
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,707
and another and another...

405
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,338
Okay, wait,
let's just slow this train down.

406
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,840
Take this. Remember this?
Here, grab this. Hi, hi, hi.

407
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,426
Look, squirt, squirt. Squirt and wipe.

408
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,805
Squirt and wipe,
and the gummies are gonna wear off,

409
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,408
and then you're gonna be feeling
the natural high of a job well done.

410
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,769
Look, show me. Show me.
I'm watching. Squirt and wipe.

411
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,358
You got this. You got this.

412
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,902
You can be mean.
You can be mean as hell.

413
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,071
[man screaming]

414
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,367
He's all ready for you, sir.

415
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,535
Good.

416
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,663
[Gary] Uh, sir? A quick word?

417
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,291
- How are you gonna swing this, Nate?
- I don't know.

418
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,086
- I don't want to hurt the guy, but...
- No way, man.

419
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,338
Look, those two agents
are expecting Hoover.

420
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,691
They have all the evidence they need.
That's more than enough.

421
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,343
It's not enough! I need a confession!

422
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,388
Look, Nate, I know you feel like
this is the end of the world,

423
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,849
but you're just a good guy
who made a bad mistake.

424
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,904
What was the alternative?
Let him kill you?

425
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,310
You're worth a thousand Hoovers.

426
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,897
By comparison to Hoover,
I am nobody in the timeline.

427
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,899
Come on, Nate, you know that's not true.

428
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,442
You've got to forgive yourself.

429
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,618
This isn't about me.

430
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,751
So, what are we gonna do?

431
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,896
You ever hear the one about
the black lady, the brown lady

432
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,590
and the broken computer
who walked into a bar in 1925?

433
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,216
Uh, no.

434
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,968
Yeah, because it would never happen!

435
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,651
Let's face it,
there's nothing we can do.

436
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,430
The Legends are on their own.

437
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,354
Great, more decapitated apple heads.

438
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,867
I think she's trying
to tell us something, Astra.

439
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,328
Uh... An apple a day.

440
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:33,955
Easy as apple pie.

441
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,584
Don't put all your apples in one box.

442
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,710
That is not a thing.

443
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,088
It's six apples, in a box,
off the table, on the floor.

444
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,757
Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

445
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,718
It's clearly apple...

446
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,555
sauce.

447
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,187
Okay, you know what, enough!
Just stop trying to tell us things!

448
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,749
I wish I could just shove you back
into the wires and the sockets,

449
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,125
or whatever makes you work
on the <i>Waverider,</i>

450
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,318
because then maybe
you could actually help us!

451
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:06,863
[sighs]

452
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,330
So, why are you so mad at Gideon?

453
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,624
She hasn't done anything to you.

454
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,337
Because... she's a constant reminder
of my giant failure.

455
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,757
That's why you don't want to go
after the Legends.

456
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,927
I'm useless to them, Spooner.

457
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,597
You made one mistake, Astra.
Ease up on yourself.

458
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,392
At least you still have magic.

459
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,145
Hey, you have things to offer, too.

460
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,816
Like what? Without aliens,
what do I bring to the table?

461
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,112
Ranch wear.

462
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,573
[chuckles] You know, I guess
we're both pretty useless.

463
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,355
- You mean the three of us are...
- [electricity crackles]

464
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:55,745
What is that?

465
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:56,830
[both gasp]

466
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,088
Gideon, no!

467
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:14,848
Gideon.

468
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,353
[Astra] Why did you do that?

469
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,439
Wires and sockets.

470
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,149
She understood you.

471
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:35,660
Hey, Z, can Sara and I
grab one of those bottles of... whiskey?

472
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,162
Oh. Hey, girl!

473
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,038
Hey, buddy.

474
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,293
Uh, what did we talk about?
More cleaning, no more gummies, yeah?

475
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,670
Oh, no, I'm not stoned. I'm enlightened.

476
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,381
See, I finally realized
why John gave me this key.

477
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,634
To clear my head
and think about the bigger picture.

478
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,386
See, I was so focused on my phones

479
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,346
and skincare sales
and romantic entanglements

480
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,390
that I never stopped to think about
what was really going on with the team.

481
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,019
The team? Our team?

482
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:05,482
Yeah. See, without those distractions,
I was able to dig deep

483
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,859
and really think about how we got here.

484
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,046
So, I read your Time Bureau
agent manual earlier...

485
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,447
What? That thing is over 200 pages.

486
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,617
Yeah, and I started thinking,
it's not about the how they blew us up,

487
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,328
it's about the who.

488
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,590
I made a list of suspects.
Do you wanna see?

489
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:24,167
- Um, yes. Yes, I do!
- Great.

490
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,508
Time to spill the beans, Lewandowski.

491
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,760
[speaking other language]

492
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,387
What did you say?

493
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,849
- Please, you're making a mistake.
- I'm making a mistake?

494
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,851
I'm making a mistake?

495
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,320
Get out. Out!

496
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,620
No, no, no.

497
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:02,997
Please.

498
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,877
- [grunting and thudding]
- [chuckles]

499
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,422
Sounds like he's really
putting the screws on him.

500
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,135
Let me know if he needs backup.
I gotta take a leak.

501
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,891
[sighs] Don't do this, Nate.

502
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,023
[grunts]

503
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,317
What are you doing?

504
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:36,239
[whispers] I'm trying to tell you
that you don't [shouts] have to tell me

505
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,950
[whispers] anything you don't
want to because...

506
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,661
[shouts] I will find the answers I want

507
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,413
[whispers] some other way, okay?

508
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,168
This is even worse than last time.

509
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,962
I've interrogated you before?

510
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,381
[spits] Of course, you don't remember.

511
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:59,846
You and your men came after me
and my family and hundreds of others

512
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,975
on your manhunt for Emma Goldman
back in 1919.

513
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,852
I knew nothing about her,

514
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,396
but because of your "Red Scare"
no one believed me.

515
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:14,027
My wife and children had to flee,
and your men beat me for being Russian.

516
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,155
I lost everything because of you!

517
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,705
I'm sorry, Igor.

518
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,377
Makes total sense
why you were planning on kidnapping me.

519
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,756
Me?

520
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,177
I've tried to stay
as far away from you as possible.

521
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,888
But when you're looking for enemies,
that's all you see.

522
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,018
Makes it easy to miss
what's going right in front of you.

523
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,362
Where did those mountains go?

524
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:01,491
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Somebody switched tracks 15 miles back.

525
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,534
Igor.

526
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,037
Thank you, Igor.
I'll untie you in a minute.

527
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:07,789
Grab him!

528
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,625
[clears throat]

529
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,211
The jig is up, Hoover. Get over here.

530
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,006
It's kind of silly, huh?

531
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,943
Put on the right kind of suit
and you can fool anybody you want.

532
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,470
Even America's best detective.

533
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,139
[wheels screeching]

534
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,813
Pretty dumb,
pulling a gun on a Bureau agent.

535
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,690
You think you're the smart guy here?

536
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,192
If you hadn't made such a stink
back in Midland,

537
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,212
we never would have known
you were on this train.

538
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:40,697
Funny thing is, we've been trying
to pinch you for months.

539
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,784
Snorky's offered a nice chunk of cash
to whoever brings you in first.

540
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,621
Snorky.

541
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:50,915
Snorky, Snorky?

542
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,083
Who the heck is Snorky?

543
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,460
These guys work for Al Capone.

544
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,380
[man from outside]
Come out with your hands up, Hoover!

545
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,343
And so do all of them.

546
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,513
You got two minutes!

547
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,393
[goons chuckling]

548
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,610
I ain't got all day, Edgar!

549
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,156
Come out or we start popping passengers.

550
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,413
[Behrad] Oh, we can totally
take these guys.

551
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,124
No.

552
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,286
Without Gideon
it's hard to keep track of the timeline,

553
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,464
but Hoover wasn't killed
by mobsters, right?

554
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,175
So don't we have to fight?

555
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,927
In the real timeline,
none of this happened.

556
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,138
And the world still thinks I'm Hoover.

557
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,808
I'm gonna have to make this right.

558
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,193
[guns cocking]

559
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:05,490
Come on.

560
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:27,970
Well, congratulations.

561
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,515
You got me.

562
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,771
Who are you?

563
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:42,819
Damn it.

564
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,823
I'd give the multi-verse
a low probability.

565
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,325
- I mean, what even is a Paragon?
- Mmm-hmm.

566
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,953
I think we are onto something
very important here, Z.

567
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,079
Me too, Aves.

568
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,802
Okay, so who's left
on our villains' list?

569
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,040
Uh, Damien Darhk.

570
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,918
[Agent Sharpe] Loves us way too much
to kill us, I think.

571
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,629
Mallus, Mallus, Mallus.

572
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:02,879
Big Beebo...

573
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,465
Hmm. David Bowie.

574
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,717
You know, he got
that really great song out of us.

575
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,153
- Yeah, it was very catchy.
- Yeah.

576
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,613
- Let's put him in the "maybe" pile.
- Okay.

577
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,514
What about those guys over there?

578
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,974
These guys over here.

579
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,518
We got time pirates,
time wraiths, time witches,

580
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,604
clones, doppelgängers, ourselves,
time itself.

581
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,399
Okay, let's call that the
"Why the hell not?" pile.

582
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,482
Copy that.

583
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,402
Oh.

584
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,193
And then there's this one.

585
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:31,409
I mean, that's too out there, right?

586
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,120
Sorry. We've been chased by a demon dog.

587
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,806
Who's to say
that we're not being hunted by...

588
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,332
[Gary] Sara? Ava?

589
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,042
- Is that...
- [Gary] Guys?

590
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,254
Hello? Anybody?

591
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:45,423
Hello?

592
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,092
We got a Hoover-shaped Nate problem.

593
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,552
That doesn't sound good.

594
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,471
- Guys.
- Hate to cut it short,

595
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,390
but we could really use
some backup out here.

596
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,018
Yeah, Nate's been kidnapped
by Al Capone's men!

597
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,480
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

598
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,666
We need to find a way to stop this
with zero casualties.

599
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,193
What, with weed gummies and magic booze?

600
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:06,943
Yes!

601
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,029
- Yes?
- Yes?

602
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,699
I ain't gonna ask you again.
We want Hoover, not some nobody clown.

603
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,618
You're right. I am a nobody.

604
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,413
But I'm the nobody
who killed J. Edgar Hoover.

605
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,333
- Killed?
- Yeah.

606
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,503
I'm supposed to bring in the head
of the Bureau of Investigation,

607
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,629
instead I got Mr. Nobody.

608
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,507
This is not the plan.

609
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,883
Yeah, tell me about it.

610
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,636
Ah, Snorky's gonna pop me, for sure.

611
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,179
Doesn't seem fair.

612
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,365
I mean, how could you know
the guy you were supposed to kidnap

613
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,557
ended up getting killed?

614
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,407
Some things are outside of your control.

615
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,287
I could just bump you off
and mess your face up,

616
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,355
real good,
pass you off as Hoover's body.

617
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:45,691
You can do that.
It may work, for a while, but...

618
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,659
But you can't outrun a lie forever.

619
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:58,246
Eventually, you'll just end up
hurting the people you care about.

620
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,925
Sometimes it's easier
just to face the music

621
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,084
and accept the fact
that you made a mistake.

622
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,046
Hey, take a deep breath with me.
Come on.

623
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,508
[inhales and exhales]

624
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,219
Now repeat after me.

625
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,347
I forgive myself.

626
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,308
I forgive myself.

627
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,478
- There. Now don't you feel better?
- No.

628
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:23,896
Oh.

629
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,148
But that makes me feel better.

630
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,318
- You all right there, big guy?
- Better now.

631
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,005
Hoover's death
must have been quite the shock,

632
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,449
so we brought you a little something
to soothe your grieving souls.

633
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,410
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

Oh. Never ending, one could say.

635

Holy smokes!

The Bullet Blondes!
The big fella loves you gals.

637
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:52,675
I would like to formally apologize
for how I treated you both.

638
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,678
And I would like to ask for a do-over.

639
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,471
- Already done.
- My man.

640
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,808
Your photographs don't do you justice.

Another Hoover?

646
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,886
I thought you said you killed him.

647
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,305
I... I did.

648
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:48,773
Okay, two <i>Waveriders</i> and two Hoovers,
that cannot be a coincidence.

649
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,692
Is it me, or does he look
even more pissed off now?

650
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:53,611
We're kidnapping you.

651
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,363
And I'm arresting you.

652
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,490
In fact, you're all under arrest.

Over our dead bodies!

Maybe we should just skedaddle
right over here, yeah?

Everybody, take cover!

Get in there! Come on! Move it! Go!

658
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:24,966
We can't let Hoover die again.

659
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,576
I don't think we need to
worry about that.

Look, guys, this is out of control.

The timeline's
at serious risk of changing.

Oh!

Come on.

Oh, no. Did we kill him again?

There's no blood.

I think he's a...

What are the chances?

Wait, so robots blew up the <i>Waverider?</i>

677
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,393
J. Edgar Hoover, a robot.
That explains a lot.

678
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,145
I ate a robot?

Gary, shush. Shush.

681
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,361
You did not eat a robot,
you ate the real Hoover.

682
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,405
This, this must be his replacement.

I'm sorry.

I'm so used to the old you.

The one who always had all the answers.

698
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,498
I never thought you'd be the one
needing help from us.

00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,544
Do you think we could try again?

I wish we could figure out a way
to communicate with her.

701

I mean, she's obviously trying.

You always did.

704
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:19,024
Esperanza, you didn't speak
until you were six years old.

705
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,236
I don't remember that.

706
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,239
You communicated with me in other ways.

707
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,492
We always understood each other,
you and I,

even if we weren't using words.

709

You would come over and hug me,

00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,001
or hold my hand.

what you're trying to tell them.

The plan's gonna work.

Two weeks, maybe that explains
why they're not back yet.

But we have to get to Dr. Davies fast,
or the Legends will die.
