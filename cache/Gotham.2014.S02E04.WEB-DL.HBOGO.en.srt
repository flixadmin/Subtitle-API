1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,520
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,000
My forefathers were betrayed.
Their legacy erased.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,720
I'm here to punish those
who robbed us.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,960
- We have a deal.
- We do.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,240
I'll do whatever it takes,
I'll train every day.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,800
Yeah, well, you said that before,
ain't you?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,920
I'll even go back to school.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,760
I saved your life.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,800
You wanna do it, too,
you just don't have guts.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,680
Selina, I missed you.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,800
This is not what we rehearsed.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,760
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,400
Enter the hero.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
Gentlemen, ladies, others.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,840
Let us discuss the future
with a little civility, shall we?

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,760
So not one of you knows
who orchestrated

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,880
and/or executed the Arkham breakout?

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
I find that hard to believe.

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,520
I mean, the cop's only lead
is an old blind man, for God's sake.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,360
A blind man!

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,560
Then, who here is to be trusted?

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,000
Because someone knows.

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,200
We thought it was you.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
Why would I do that?

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
We've never had it better.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,840
I gave you all of the freedom
in the world and business boomed,

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,720
for all of us.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,360
A new generation.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,280
Then that ginger maniac
had to spoil everything.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,200
Even now he's dead,
the public's still terrified,

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,480
business is in the can.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,800
And what are we doing?

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,360
Fighting among ourselves.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Is this how any of us want to live?

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,280
Squabbling, brawling, running,
hiding?

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
This city belong to us now.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,280
But kids,
that brings responsibilities.

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,280
We need to restore confidence
in our brand, if you will.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,520
We need discipline and unity, yes?

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,800
There will be no more chaos,
no more gang wars.

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,520
No more blood in the streets
scaring decent folk.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,360
From now on,
if you want to kill someone,

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,960
blackmail, steal or kidnap anyone,

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,000
I need to hear about it first.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Understand?

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,160
Hey, boss, there's a new girl.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
Bravo.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Quite the King Solomon.
You have them nicely in line.

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,680
Who are you?

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,400
My brother would very much like
to talk to you.

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,840
- Alone.
- Why you looking at me like that?

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
You don't know me.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,480
Relax, Butch. He has issues.
Bipolar.

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,440
She doesn't know me, I have to say.

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,400
- Your brother?
- Theodore Galavan.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,560
There's a car waiting for you
outside.

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm sick and tired of your
"Holier than thou" crap, Gordon.

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,240
Yeah, then do some police work.

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,440
The last arrest you made
was your bookie.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,360
My name is Nathaniel Barnes.

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Captain Nathaniel Barnes.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,320
That's right, I'm your new boss.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Ten hut!

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,080
You, clean that up.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
You know when this place was built?

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,520
Over a hundred years ago.

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,480
Can you imagine how many perps
have been booked in here

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
since that time?

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,960
All the murderers, rapists,
thieves have been locked up?

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,360
They don't make them like this
anymore.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,440
Strong, sturdy.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
And yet...

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,240
just days ago...

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,520
an escaped convict just strolls
in here, in to our house.

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,840
Our house.

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,720
And murders your commissioner,

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
and nine of your fellow comrades.

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
I wasn't even here, and I'm ashamed.

79
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,640
Are you all ashamed?

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I hope so.

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,360
Anyone is here that's not ashamed
and angry should resign.

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Right now.

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,960
Some of you are lying to yourselves.

84
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,960
I've got your files here.
I've read them all.

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
Step forward if you hear
your name called.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,120
Pollard.

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,520
Guthrie, Coulson, Dowler, Brooks,

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,000
Perez, Hightower.

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,800
You aren't ashamed.
You have no shame.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
You're not police...

91
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,560
you're low-life criminals.

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,240
Bribery, drug abuse, extortion,
racketeering.

93
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,640
Sons of bitches! You're all fired!

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Drop off your badges and your guns

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,800
with the desk sergeant
on your way out.

96
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,400
Hey, you can't do this.
We got rights.

97
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,280
Yes, you're right,
you do have rights.

98
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,640
You have the right to remain silent,
you have the right to an attorney.

99
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
Take him.

100
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,760
From now on any officer,
detective, rookie or clerk

101
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,000
who breaks the law
will not just lose their job,

102
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,240
they will go to jail.

103
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,560
If you turn a blind eye to a crime,
I will bust you.

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,680
If you fail to help a fellow officer

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,160
because of cowardice or apathy,
I will bust you!

106
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,440
What the hell you still doing here?

107
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,320
Don't make me mad.

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,160
Anyone who didn't hear
their name called,

109
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
get back to work.

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,560
I like to see you in my office,
please.

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
Well, what do you think
about what I said out there?

112
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,560
I agreed with every word, sir.

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Every word, huh?

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
You a sycophant, Gordon?

115
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,000
No, sir.

116
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
No, sir.

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,160
I've read all your files.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
Army, academy, G.C.P.D.

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,040
You're a troublemaker.

120
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
A fighter.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,480
Is that an accurate assessment?

122
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Yes, sir.

123
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,320
Good.

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,840
You're now my second command.

125
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,480
Starting now, Jim.

126
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,240
We're gonna fix this department

127
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,040
and bring respect for law
and order back to this city.

128
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Yes, sir.

129
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
We're kind of short-handed.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,680
Well, you think I cut too deep?

131
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,160
You could have thrown out 20 more
guys and not hit bottom.

132
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,560
Fixing this department
is gonna be tough.

133
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,240
Maybe tougher
than you think, sir.

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,720
Welcome to my unit,
you sad-ass army hump.

135
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Tough is what we eat for breakfast.

136
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
A jarhead, huh?

137
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Who would have guessed.

138
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Sir.

139
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,920
I hope you told him
he made a huge mistake.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,120
I don't think he did.

141
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Come on, Jim.
We've seen his type come and go.

142
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,880
Idealists, always looking
to walk a straight line.

143
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,600
Gotham doesn't have straight lines.

144
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,560
It's got twists and turns
and dead ends.

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,040
Yeah. It doesn't have to be that way.

146
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,400
<i>With Mayor James still missing</i>

147
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,560
<i>and the deputy mayor
recently murdered,</i>

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,520
<i>the need for leadership at City Hall</i>

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,120
<i>is of paramount concern
to Gotham's citizens.</i>

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,560
<i>Today, two more hopeful candidates
have thrown their hats into the ring.</i>

151
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,320
<i>Janice Caulfield is a city councilor</i>

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,720
{\an5}<i>who began her political career
as an environmental activist.</i>

153
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,760
{\an5}<i>Randall Hobbs, the longest
serving teamster boss</i>

154
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,040
<i>in Gotham's history</i>

155
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,520
{\an5}<i>is another candidate
with a strong base.</i>

156
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,400
{\an5}<i>In the latest polls, though,
a surprise surge for a man</i>

157
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,680
{\an5}<i>who has not even declared
his candidacy.</i>

158
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,920
<i>Theo Galavan.</i>

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,720
<i>The dashing billionaire businessman</i>

160
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,280
<i>has not ruled out a bid
for the mayor's job.</i>

161
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,320
<i>But he is considering his options
according to his spokesman.</i>

162
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Mr. Cobblepot, finally, we meet.

163
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Call me Penguin.

164
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
I thought I heard you hated
that name.

165
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,640
It grew on me.

166
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,960
Penguin it is. Please sit.

167
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,000
How's your head?

168
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,240
Healing, thank you.

169
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
Gave me quite the scare.

170
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,360
You were lucky to get out
of there with your life.

171
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
Wasn't I just?

172
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,320
Was it luck?

173
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,360
You are a clever man.

174
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,520
Perfect timing, dear.
Do you two know each other?

175
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
We've met.

176
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Oh, my.

177
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,920
The Arkham breakout...

178
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,000
the G.C.P.D massacre,
Jerome and the Maniax.

179
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
All you.

180
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
Of course.

181
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Guilty.

182
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,800
It was foolish of me to think
I could trick The King of Gotham.

183
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,280
Here, you need this more than me.

184
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
I'll make another.

185
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
My sister tells me
you're doing a stellar job

186
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
of organizing your new empire.

187
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I try.

188
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,960
You're not The King of Gotham,
you're the King of Garbage.

189
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,400
A year ago I held Fish Mooney's
umbrella.

190
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,080
Now she's dead by my hand.

191
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,000
Along with Maroni.

192
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,040
Falcone is in hiding
and all of their businesses are mine.

193
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,520
They all underestimated me.

194
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,520
I suggest you not make
the same mistake.

195
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
My sister is too blunt.
But she is honest.

196
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,280
The foundations of this great city

197
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,840
were laid 200 years ago
by some very dedicated people.

198
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,000
Now, it's an old, crumbling pigsty,
full of human waste.

199
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
It's time to move into the future.

200
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,920
A cleaner, brighter...

201
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
future.

202
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Those are all residential areas,

203
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,280
so thousands of homes would have
to be destroyed, wouldn't they?

204
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,480
Yes, so?

205
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,640
Here's the rub.

206
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,000
In order to rebuild,
I need first to destroy.

207
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
But I can't do that.

208
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,240
I mean, watch the news,
I'm a hero.

209
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,960
But you have a certain flare
for such a task.

210
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,440
You, Penguin...

211
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,320
you will be my destroyer.

212
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Truly, I'm flattered.

213
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,080
Thank you so much for thinking of me.

214
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,640
But, my dear sir,
you have me all wrong.

215
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,400
I have no flare for destruction,

216
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm a builder, a problem solver.

217
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,320
Besides, such a huge project
would need the support

218
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,280
of hundreds of city officials.

219
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,440
Yes. Only the highest authority
could see it through correctly.

220
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,720
Say, a mayor
with a landslide mandate.

221
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,720
- But you're not a candidate.
- Oh, I will be.

222
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,600
By popular demand.

223
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Alas, some of my fellow
candidates

224
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,720
actually stand a chance of winning,

225
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,680
so, they'll have to go.

226
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,640
- Go?
- And I'm gonna need you

227
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,440
to take a crack of me also
and miss, of course.

228
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,680
Don't want anyone to think
that I had anything to do

229
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,800
with my fellow candidates demise.

230
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,600
That's smart thinking.

231
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,360
However, all due respect,
Mr. Galavan, I'm not your man.

232
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
You need an assassin.

233
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,920
This is Gotham, you can find them
in the phone book.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Under A.

235
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,960
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm sorry.
I took you for a man of vision.

237
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,400
Tabitha, do you wanna get
the remote, dear.

238
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,920
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,560
Before you leave,

240
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,960
my sister would like to show you
her favorite reality show.

241
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,440
She's addicted.

242
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,680
She's being kind of dull right now,

243
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,280
but sometimes she cries
and bangs on the door.

244
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,840
<i>- Please.</i>
- Mother.

245
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,240
<i>I swear, I swear, I don't do nothing.</i>

246
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,680
You'll pay for this.

247
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,920
That's the spirit.

248
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,240
They die, your mother lives.

249
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,640
Simple.

250
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,080
<i>Where is my boy? Please!</i>

251
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,600
<i>I swear, I swear, I don't do nothing.</i>

252
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,160
{\an5}- Thompkins.
- Good morning, Dr. Thompkins.

253
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,920
{\an5}Captain Barnes, GCPD.

254
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,040
{\an5}Captain Barnes, hi.

255
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
{\an5}I hear great things about you, Doc.

256
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,640
Get ready to get real busy.

257
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,640
{\an5}We're gonna be sending you
a whole lot of dead bad guys.

258
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,160
Okay, okay?

259
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
May I speak to Jim.

260
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
He wants to talk to you.

261
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
{\an5}This is Gordon.

262
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,160
{\an5}Meet me at the Police Academy
at 0700.

263
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,480
{\an5}The academy? Yes, sir.

264
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,920
{\an5}If you don't mind me asking, sir.

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
{\an5}Everybody knows
you're banging the M.E.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,120
{\an5}See you in an hour.

267
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,720
{\an5}Oldest in your class.

268
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,320
{\an5}Not the strongest or fastest

269
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,720
{\an5}or even the most
academically gifted either,

270
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,720
{\an5}and yet you finished the top
of your class.

271
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
{\an5}How did you do that?

272
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,880
{\an5}I'll tell you how.

273
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,400
{\an5}You were a soldier.

274
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,600
{\an5}You saw combat
while your classmates

275
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,360
{\an5}were still playing with themselves
in their parent's basements.

276
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,520
{\an5}You got blood on your face.

277
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
{\an5}You could say that.

278
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
{\an5}You're a warrior, Jim.

279
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
So am I.

280
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
{\an5}But you can't carry on
the way you been.

281
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,200
{\an5}Going after everyone on your own.

282
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,800
{\an5}You need help that you can rely on.

283
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
With all the respect, sir.

284
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
What if there were a team
of young cops

285
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,760
who haven't been bought yet?

286
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,360
{\an5}Not jaded, not corrupted,

287
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,840
{\an5}still filled with hope and faith
in the system.

288
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,320
Cadets?

289
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,840
{\an5}This is the greatest academy
in the country,

290
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,720
{\an5}graduation is next week.

291
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,240
We can grab a group
of their finest

292
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,000
{\an5}before some precinct kills
their spirit.

293
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,800
Wouldn't hurt to look into it, right?

294
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
- Gus!
- Captain Barnes.

295
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,240
This is Gordon.

296
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,560
Sure, I remember this guy.

297
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,960
He argued a lot.

298
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
I'd like to think
I was raising questions.

299
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,160
- What you got for us?
- This way.

300
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,160
Keep your eye on the little one.

301
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,400
The one getting her ass handed
to her?

302
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Wait.

303
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Patience.

304
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,880
Not your strongest virtue,
if I remember, right, Gordon?

305
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,840
State wrestling champ,
academy running back.

306
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Why this place
and not a sports scholarship?

307
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
People from my neighborhood
don't get scholarships.

308
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,240
They join gangs and sell drugs.

309
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,800
I needed to change the direction
my life was going.

310
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
Mr. Martinez,

311
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,160
says you're the best shot
this school's ever seen.

312
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,480
Where d'you learn to shoot?

313
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,680
Gotham gun range,

314
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,120
one of my mother's three jobs
was cleaning it.

315
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,080
When she died,
the owner let me go there

316
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,160
after hours and practice,
until I worked out my anger.

317
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,920
I still go there.

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,680
You're way too smart
to be here, Garrett.

319
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,600
- Don't tell me, your father's a cop?
- Negative.

320
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,600
My father's family business
was destroyed by armed thugs

321
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,720
who demanded he pay them
protection money.

322
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
When he refused they beat him
half to death.

323
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm here to make sure
that doesn't ever happen again.

324
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Garrett.

325
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,800
Pinkney.

326
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Josie.

327
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,520
Martinez.

328
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,200
Do you swear to honor that badge
with your life?

329
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,400
Yes, sir!

330
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,720
Congratulations.

331
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,000
You are now Unit Alpha
of the GCPD Strike Force

332
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
under the command
of Detective James Gordon.

333
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,720
You will answer only to him,
and him only to me.

334
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Dismissed.

335
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Strike force?

336
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,800
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

337
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
They're good kids...

338
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,800
but facing what's out there
at their age?

339
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
That's a big risk, sir.

340
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,920
True, but what have we got to lose?

341
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,520
For your acts of courage

343
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,360
in the face of overwhelming
uncertainty,

344
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,920
the City of Gotham would like to
give you this token of appreciation.

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,920
The Medal of Valor and Bravery.

346
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,680
Mr. Galavan.

347
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
Please, Theo.

348
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,960
Theo, for Pete's sake,
why aren't you running for mayor?

349
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Get down!

350
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,280
Everybody stay where you are!

351
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,400
Everyone okay? Everyone?

352
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
You know what?

353
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,560
Gothamites don't buckle
under pressure.

354
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
And neither will I.

355
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,560
We will not be intimidated
by the scum

356
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,920
that seeks to reduce this
great city of Gotham to ruin.

357
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
If the bad guys wanna stop me
running,

358
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,720
well, then, I guess I got no choice.

359
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,760
I will run for mayor.

360
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Yes.

361
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,120
Hello, Caulfield for mayor.

362
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
Yes, will do!

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
Excuse me, you can't go in there.

364
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,040
Miss Caulfield, what a pleasure.

365
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,400
Allow me to introduce myself.

366
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,840
I can see what you are.

367
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,000
How did you get in?

368
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,360
I know it's late,

369
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,400
but I'm afraid there's no time
for delay.

370
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,680
Someone tried to kill
Theo Galavan this morning.

371
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,280
Are you here to kill me?

372
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,440
Actually, yes.

373
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,280
Please, no...

374
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm a mother.

375
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Wait.

376
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,640
I have a mother too.

377
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Steady now, folks.

378
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,000
Just think of blue sky
and cornfields.

379
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
That's what I do.

380
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,240
Why are you doing this?

381
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Darling, I've got no freaking idea.

382
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,720
We've been doing crazy stuff
all day long.

383
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,640
Well, we're away, then.
Sorry to ruin your evening.

384
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,360
Now remember...

385
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,520
yeah, I got your names
and addresses.

386
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,880
So think about your families
and keep mum, eh?

387
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,240
Are waiting for someone?

388
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
No.

389
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
That's your job.

390
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
That's for Reggie.

391
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
I know you killed him.

392
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,080
Now I don't know what you want
with Master Bruce,

393
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,720
but I'm certain

394
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,120
that his life is gonna be damn
slight better without you in it.

395
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,200
So you do yourself a favor,
trickle...

396
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
jog on.

397
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
All good.

398
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Oh, Master Bruce.

399
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,720
You know, I could always pull up
front if you want.

400
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,360
No, I... Alfred, I don't want
the other kids to see...

401
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,920
To see that you've got a butler,
yeah, I completely understand that.

402
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,600
I made dinner reservations
as requested for tomorrow night.

403
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,400
Mr. Galavan suggested
the Regal Hotel, very posh.

404
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
You're gonna be forking out serious
dosh for that, I'll tell you that.

405
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
He saved my life,

406
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,960
dinner is the least I can do
to repay him.

407
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
Master Bruce, where are you going?

408
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
Now I clocked Wayne Manor
at exactly six and a half miles.

409
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,560
It should take you 90 minutes
to two hours,

410
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,600
depending on how many times
you stop, of course.

411
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Now you said you wanted to train,
to prepare.

412
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
And this is it.

413
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,760
Wait, you...

414
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,120
You expect me to walk?

415
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,920
No, Master Bruce.

416
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
I expect you to run.

417
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Ms. Kringle...

418
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
ever since I first laid eyes
on you,

419
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,680
I've felt this deep connection.

420
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,200
Perhaps you've felt it too.

421
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Cheesy.

422
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Ms. Kringle, you've perhaps felt
my affections from afar.

423
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,320
Afar? Really?

424
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
God.

425
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Ms. Kringle...

426
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,760
Be quiet.

427
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,880
I don't need your opinion.

428
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,360
What you need is to stop mumbling

429
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
and fumbling and tell her what's up.

430
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, she's been bullied
and taken for granted for too long.

431
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,800
- I want her to understand...
- You saved her life for God's sake!

432
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,680
She owes you.

433
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Take what you deserve.

434
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Ms. Kringle.

435
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,160
Dinner, tonight.

436
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,800
<i>Chez Moi.</i> Eight o'clock.

437
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Okay.

438
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,880
- I'd like that.
- You will.

439
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,680
A wise cop once said,

440
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,320
if you catch a kid smashing
a window, even a small one,

441
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
bust him.

442
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
You let it slide,
and he'll smash another one.

443
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,320
Then he'll tag a wall
or steal a bike,

444
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,520
rob a store, maybe hold someone up.

445
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,880
Crime unpunished
is a crime in itself.

446
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,480
This city is bleeding to death...

447
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,640
from the amount of free passes
we hand out.

448
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,680
Time to put a tourniquet
over that wound.

449
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,360
And from now on,
no one gets a free pass.

450
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,600
What is this strike force for?

451
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,040
To send a message
that this epidemic of lawlessness

452
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,440
will no longer be treated
but extinguished.

453
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,840
With extreme prejudice.

454
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,360
Gentlemen, lady, your new uniforms.

455
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,960
Sir, got a caller

456
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,000
says Councilor Caulfield
has been attacked.

457
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Says she's dead.

458
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,880
No security cameras.

459
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,080
Galavan and now her.
Looks like a damn pattern.

460
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,160
Only she's dead.

461
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,560
Come on, people.

462
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Who knows what.

463
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,920
Just give us a name, a description.

464
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,880
You will not have to testify.

465
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,240
They have our names and addresses.

466
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,280
Ms. Caulfield was stabbed repeatedly.

467
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,160
Probably drowned in her own blood.

468
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Forget it, Jim.

469
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
The man with the knife was short,
fancy clothes.

470
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Walked funny.

471
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,280
Mr. Galavan, thank you
for meeting me.

472
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,960
Oh, it's an honor,
pleasure's all mine.

473
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,400
I'll meet you in the lobby,
Master Bruce.

474
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Oh, why not dine with us?

475
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,720
That's very kind of you, sir,
but I don't think it's appropriate.

476
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,480
And I know that Master Bruce
want to speak to you on his own.

477
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Sir.

478
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Thanks, Alfred.

479
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Enjoy.

480
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Do you like this place?

481
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,880
I've never been here before.

482
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,840
To be honest, I don't go out much.

483
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,680
Well, I hope I can change that.

484
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,120
There's always some tedious function
I could drag you to.

485
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,880
I just, I wanted this opportunity
to thank you in person

486
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
for saving my life.

487
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,520
Oh, you're very kind.

488
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,880
The truth is, I don't know
what came over me.

489
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,720
I don't think I was in
complete control of my faculties.

490
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,960
I also wanted to speak with you
face to face.

491
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,760
Regarding your parent's passing.

492
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,120
I find it astonishing
that the police have failed

493
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,280
to produce any evidence
or any real suspects

494
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,520
in all this time.

495
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,360
It is disappointing.

496
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,200
Even your father's own company,
Wayne Enterprises,

497
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,080
has failed to advance
the investigation in any way.

498
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
It's shocking.

499
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,760
Yes, Mr. Galavan,
it's very disappointing.

500
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
That's Silver.

501
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,360
- I'm sorry?
- Silver St. Cloud.

502
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,840
Her father was my step-brother.
He passed, sadly.

503
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,080
She's my ward now.

504
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,840
Would you like to meet her?

505
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Yes.

506
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,040
Hello, my dear.

507
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Uncle.

508
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,040
I'd like to introduce you
to Bruce Wayne.

509
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,920
- Nice to meet you, Bruce.
- Hello.

510
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,880
I was early so I came out here,
it's such a warm day.

511
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Do you know, I do believe

512
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
that you two will be sharing
a school soon.

513
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,200
Anders Prep, yes?

514
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,400
Silver just got back to Gotham
after two years abroad.

515
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,120
Switzerland, Geneva.

516
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,040
Yes. We have a house there.

517
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
So, what's it like?

518
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,880
- Switzerland?
- No, Prep, silly.

519
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,360
I think it's fine.

520
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,920
I've been homeschooling
for quite a while now.

521
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So I'm virtually a new boy too.

522
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,520
Then we shall brave it together.

523
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,360
I was kind of expecting a restaurant.

524
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,360
Ms. Kringle, I'm so sorry, I've...

525
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,880
I'm sorry, I should have been
more clear,

526
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,080
I like to cook.

527
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,400
I'm a good cook. Is that okay?

528
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,120
It is, it is, and perhaps
you should call me Kristen.

529
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Kristen.

530
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,920
Hobbs' campaign office
is the entire second floor.

531
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,920
You sure about this?

532
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,360
Don't worry, I've got it
under control.

533
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,480
Okay, you gotta tell me
what the hell is going on...

534
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,160
I know I gotta do
whatever you say.

535
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,840
But at least tell me
why the hell we're doing it.

536
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,920
They have my mother, Butch.

537
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,160
- Who?
- Galavan and his sister.

538
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
They have her.

539
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,440
They're making me do this.

540
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,120
Holy smokes.

541
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
We gotta find your mum.

542
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,240
If they find out we're looking,
they'll hurt her.

543
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,440
Don't worry, we'll find her.

544
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
He's here.

545
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Let's go.

546
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,280
Got it. Thanks.

547
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,920
I still think we should move you
somewhere a little more secure.

548
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,800
Forget it. Anyone has the guts
to come for me,

549
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,760
they'll find out real soon
who they're messing with.

550
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
Who the hell are you?

551
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,840
I came here to volunteer.

552
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,200
Well, run back and whoever hired you

553
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
tell them I'm not going anywhere.

554
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,640
This city needs me.

555
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Cool pins.

556
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,960
Count, idiot, there's five of us.

557
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,640
I know, hardly seems fair.

558
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,840
Move, move, move, move, move! Go!

559
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,440
Keep going!

560
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,960
There you go. Right there!

561
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Go!

562
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,680
<i>G.C.P.D! Put down your weapon!</i>

563
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,480
We should fan out.
Flank him from both sides,

564
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,720
catch him in our crossfire.

565
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,280
Yeah, do that.

566
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,560
I'll cover you, go!

567
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,080
Okay, so they move well.

568
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,120
Unexpected.

569
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,760
Move! Move, move, move!

570
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Let's go!

571
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,200
Shooter got away, sir.

572
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,320
You just met Victor Zsasz.

573
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,720
Works for Penguin these days.

574
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
What the hell is Penguin playing at?

575
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,320
No, I feel like I owe you an apology,

576
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,840
I feel as though I've been nothing
but mean to you.

577
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,080
No, I don't think that's fair.

578
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,000
I feel like all I've ever done
is annoy you.

579
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,120
I've been consistently inappropriate.

580
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,960
No, no, no, it's me.
You've been nothing but sweet.

581
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,440
And I ignored your card
and your gift.

582
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,280
Ms. Kringle, I can honestly say
that our interactions

583
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,040
are always the highlight of my day.

584
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,320
Please, Kristen.

585
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,920
Oh, my God, I even accused you
of writing Dougherty's goodbye note.

586
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,920
Right, crazy.

587
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,880
I mean, who knows
what that jerk was thinking?

588
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Jerk.

589
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,120
How I ever let him lay a hand
on me, I'll never know.

590
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
I'm glad he's dead.

591
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,000
Well, he just left town,
he's not dead.

592
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,120
Right, yeah, I know.

593
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Figure of speech.

594
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
He's dead to you.

595
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,520
Out of your life. Not dead dead.

596
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,080
I'm gonna use the restroom.

597
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,520
You blew it, dummy. Nice work.

598
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,120
Leave me alone!

599
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Are you talking to me?

600
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
No.

601
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,480
Honestly, Kristen,
I wasn't talking to you.

602
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,160
Who else is there?

603
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
I talk...

604
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
to myself.

605
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,520
It's crazy, I know, I just,
I have this...

606
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,680
I have this voice inside my head,

607
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,600
a sort of stronger version of me,
that keeps this me in line,

608
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,840
because I'm such a klutz.

609
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,920
I can understand that.

610
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,880
I think that we all have
a voice like that.

611
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
You think?

612
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,200
What was your inner voice saying?

613
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
He was mad at me
for spoiling the mood.

614
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,000
It was, it was a really nice mood.

615
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,640
But my inner voice is telling me

616
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,920
that I think maybe
we can get back there.

617
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,440
You killed Caulfield.

618
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
We have a witness.

619
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,680
And the attempt on Galavan,
was that you too?

620
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,480
- Not now.
- And Hobbs,

621
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,160
- you sent Zsasz there?
- It's complicated, okay?

622
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,640
What does it profit you
to mess with the election?

623
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,360
You have your own sordid empire
to rule over.

624
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,200
Walk away, Jim. Let me be.

625
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,520
The GCPD has new leadership,
no more deals, no more favors.

626
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
If they find out
you're behind these attacks,

627
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,720
we will come after you
with everything...

628
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,000
Rousing speech, really!

629
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Goosebumps.

630
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,080
But you came here alone, Jim,

631
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,960
with no warrant, no cuffs,
no back-up, and why?

632
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,600
Because you would hate
your new captain

633
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,480
to find out about how you gunned
down Ogden Barker in cold blood.

634
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,720
Over a debt.

635
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,840
A debt to me.

636
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,000
He was trying to kill me.

637
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,240
Where are your witnesses?

638
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,880
And just that day before,
I suppose you did not ask me

639
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,840
to run Commissioner Loeb out of town

640
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,800
so that you can get
your old job back?

641
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,640
I'll face whatever's coming to me.

642
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
As will I.

643
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Goodbye, Jim.

644
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,320
- Obviously.
- I don't think so.

645
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,080
- I think...
- I'm serious.

646
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,280
Hey, you shouldn't be joking
about near misses.

647
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,040
Next bullet might get stuck
right in your eye.

648
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,440
Yes, sir.

649
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
No joking.

650
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,280
All right, gather around.

651
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,880
Today I'm giving the strike force
its first real mission.

652
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,200
Build a case to put away Gotham's
enemy number one.

653
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,680
Time to take down The Penguin.

654
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
Bruce?

655
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,280
Hey, Selina, come on, let's go.

656
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
I don't know what you want
with Master Bruce,

657
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,720
but I'm certain that his life's
gonna be a damn sight better

658
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,840
without you in it.

659
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,280
So, what do you think? Red...

660
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
or blue?

661
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
- Red.
- Blue.

662
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,240
- Blue it is.
- I want some fun.

663
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm sick of staying indoors.

664
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,080
Patience, Barbara.
Your time will come.

665
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,640
The wheel is turning.

666
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,480
While the GCPD chase The Penguin

667
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,560
I'll steal the mayor's office right
from under their noses.

668
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Did you find her?
