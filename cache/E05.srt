Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,680
Hey, baby.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,770
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,730
Where have you been?
It's been days.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,850
Yeah. I've been handling business.
It's okay now, it's okay.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,440
You said I had to hide,
you said we were in trouble...

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,360
You know, I think... I
think I got it worked out.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,240
I think I have some good news.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,570
Good news?

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,040
Stillwell. She's open to us going public.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,210
Don't you lie to me.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,290
Hand on a Bible.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,090
Yeah. But, listen,

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,510
for us to go public,
you have to come clean with me.

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,180
Like, I have to know
who you told about Compound V.

16
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,180
Hey, come on.

17
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,020
This is you and me.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,490
I mean, we're Bonnie and Clyde.

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,360
Ride or die, right?

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,530
I...

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,000
Shit.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,590
I told these guys,

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,260
you were running the V
down near the Noodle Palace.

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,970
I'm so sorry, baby.

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,970
I had to. I...

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,890
Why?

27
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,060
What do they have on you?

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,150
I don't know their names,
but there was this British guy,

29
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,900
dark hair, real smug asshole.

30
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,780
Buzz cut French guy,
big black guy with a goatee,

31
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,440
and a skinny white kid.

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,860
I think they were all working together.

33
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,540
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- Nah.

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,870
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,040
- I fucked up so bad.
- It's all right.

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,750
You know what I was thinking about
on my run over here?

37
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
Our first date.

38
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,470
Most first dates order, like, a scallop

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,980
and a bottle of water.

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,730
But you...

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,400
got a dark beer, a New York strip,

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,660
and chocolate chip cheesecake.

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,530
I remember thinking,

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,660
"Here's someone
who isn't afraid to be happy."

45
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,040
And I fell for you, right then and there.

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,590
I love you.

47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,550
I love you, too.

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Why?

49
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,260
Well?

50
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,970
Heroin overdose.

51
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,850
I'm sorry to hear that.

52
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,690
And the V?

53
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,690
- She told some guys about it.
- No, no.

54
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,770
I mean you.

55
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,570
Come on, A-Train.
You've been shooting it up for weeks.

56
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,370
You really think I wouldn't notice?

57
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,450
I'm done, man.

58
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,330
Nah, I'm fucking... I'm fucking done.

59
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,160
- Cold turkey.
- Really?

60
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,540
Yeah.

61
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,380
- Good.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,420
You know,

63
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,380
you really screwed up, kiddo.

64
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,350
But you did the right thing coming to me,
and I'm proud of you.

65
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,440
Thanks, Homelander,
for giving me the chance.

66
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,600
I appreciate it.

67
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,190
Hey. Come on.

68
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,490
I love you.

69
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,530
We're family.

70
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,160
I'll always be
watching over you.

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,750
Always.

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,670
Attaboy.

73
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,090
And the misplaced Asian girl?

74
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,340
I'll find her.

75
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,300
Fuck.

76
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,070
Massage the bird with olive oil,

77
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,240
then a sprinkle of salt and pepper,

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,780
then I bake.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,910
Basting every 20 minutes
to keep it from drying out

80
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,240
is very important.

81
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,960
Till it's crisp, but not too crunchy.

82
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,590
And voilÃ .

83
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,720
I think you understand me.

84
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,480
It's in your eyes.

85
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,980
Can you speak?

86
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,570
Tell me what you know, mon coeur.

87
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,570
So we can find these fuckers
who did this to you,

88
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,660
so I can get you back home.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,700
I like this outfit.
You know, the other one had...

90
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,610
My God.

91
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,950
The other one had kind of like a, you know,
a Nicki Minaj thing going on.

92
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,160
Yeah, the other one sucks.

93
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,830
They're only letting me wear this one

94
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,500
because, apparently, it's family friendly.

95
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,500
You know, I'm surprised you came.

96
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,510
I seem to remember you inviting me.

97
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,300
No, I mean, I'm glad you came.

98
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,510
You just... I don't know,

99
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,220
you don't really strike
me as the religious type.

100
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,850
Well, yeah, lapsed, but I served
my time in Sunday school.

101
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,150
- Hey, Starlight.
- Hi.

102
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,900
Okay, so, do you know everybody here,
or just, like, 99.9 percent?

103
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,610
No. My mom and I,

104
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,160
we would drive coast to coast
in her brown Honda Civic,

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,410
just doing the whole
Christian Circuit thing.

106
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,410
You know, Power Fest, Capes for Christ,

107
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,080
Believe Expo.

108
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,250
We wore the tyres off of that car.

109
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,920
These people are like family to me.

110
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,470
After everything that's happened,
it's actually...

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,220
it's really nice to see them again.

112
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,770
- Sweetheart.
- Mom! Hi.

113
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,770
- How was your flight?
- It was a nightmare.

114
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,690
We sat on the runway for 45 minutes,

115
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,070
and then there was all the,
you know, Flight 37 stuff.

116
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,650
But a Xanax and a couple
of pinot grigio later, here I am.

117
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Hello. Do you want an autograph?

118
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,280
Honey, give him an autograph.

119
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,950
No, no. We... I mean, I know her.

120
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,410
- I mean, I don't...
- Yeah.

121
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,830
We know each other. Yes.

122
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,580
- Yeah.
- Do you work at Vought?

123
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,500
No. No, no, no.

124
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,710
Mom, this is Hughie.

125
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,840
He's a friend.

126
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,550
- Hi.
- How nice.

127
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,840
Starlight. You hydrating?

128
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,560
- Hey, Donna. How was your flight?
- It was perfect...

129
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,930
You have that "Teen Roundtable"
in 15, are you ready?

130
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,560
She was born ready.
I should know, I was there.

131
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,900
Great.

132
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,730
Do you want to come?

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,400
You know what? I'll let you go ahead.

134
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,820
Go roundtable those teens.

135
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,450
- We'll catch up later?
- Yeah, sure.

136
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,370
So, Jesus...

137
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,710
Jesus said, "Hey, bro.

138
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,170
Hey, bro, bring it in.

139
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,880
You shouldn't need proof.

140
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,760
You should just believe because I say so,

141
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,680
because you have

142
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
faith.

143
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,270
People who have faith,

144
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,020
those are my peeps, y'all."
That's what Jesus said.

145
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,060
But I am gonna ask you one question...

146
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,020
Two twats at every entrance,

147
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,280
armed to holy hell. In church.

148
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,990
Well, that's America for you, isn't it?

149
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,620
And God's watching from up above.
Right there.

150
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,330
Over there.

151
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,080
Yeah. Security's tighter
than a choir boy's asshole.

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,130
So let me ask you something:

153
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,050
Why can Jesus walk on water?

154
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,510
Why does Homelander fly?

155
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,140
How about A-Train, why does he get to run
the way he runs?

156
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,230
Or how do I get to hold the whole world
in my loving embrace?

157
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,360
Why were we chosen?

158
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,660
Because of the Lord.

159
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,370
Because we were born with his power.

160
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,750
Because we believe!

161
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,290
Fifteen thousand dollars.

162
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,210
For an exclusive
VIP experience with Ezekiel.

163
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,840
Seriously?

164
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,590
There's not an easier, cheaper way
for us to get to him?

165
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,890
We ain't getting to Ezekiel. You are.

166
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,720
- I am?
- Whoa, wait. What?

167
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,270
Starlight's one of the headliners, right?
She'll get you in.

168
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,940
Look, we've only been on, like,
a date and a half, okay?

169
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,110
I can't just ask her for
a Diamond Club Pass.

170
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,030
What's the matter?

171
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,860
Worried your fake Supe girlfriend's
gonna think you're using her?

172
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,490
Okay, then what?

173
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,260
I go up to Ezekiel,
"What's up with you

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,290
smuggling blue dope into
Chinatown basements?"

175
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,160
Yeah, pretty much. Once you show him this.

176
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,210
Jesus.

177
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,130
This is from that club you took me to?

178
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,170
You remembered our first night.
I'm touched.

179
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,720
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this plan?

180
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
This kid needs to be trained up, Butcher.

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,140
Yeah. Yeah, what he said.

182
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,970
I don't know how to blackmail anybody.

183
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,730
Hughie, you've done a murder.

184
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,980
Comparatively speaking,
this will be a piece of cake.

185
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,690
I know. I know.

186
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,650
We're here today

187
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,700
to remember the victims
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37.

188
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,580
One hundred and twenty-three
brave souls lost in an instant,

189
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,160
in a senseless act of violence.

190
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,590
Carolyn Kozinsky,

191
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,880
a preschool teacher from Skokie.

192
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,800
Dr Julien Barro,

193
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,470
an esteemed French neurosurgeon.

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,480
Susan Lopez from Evanston

195
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,940
and her daughter Maya.

196
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,660
Samuel Brown, a teacher of physics

197
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,570
from Los Angeles.

198
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,580
We are all truly sorry for your loss.

199
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,250
Where'd you go?

200
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,550
The only thing I hate more
than blubbering people

201
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,260
- are boring speeches.
- Right.

202
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,220
You remember that
nutjob in Albany last year?

203
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,060
Killed his wife,
and he came out of the house

204
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,730
with a gun at his daughter's head.

205
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,100
Remember that?

206
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,690
Cops pissing their pants,
didn't know what to do.

207
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,780
And then you... You...

208
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,820
You step up very calmly,

209
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,040
ask for the sergeant's Bic pen
and fling it

210
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,250
26 yards,

211
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,040
right into the asshole's eyeball.

212
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,290
- Dead shot, dead shooter.
- What's your point?

213
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,130
My point is that you took action.

214
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,720
That's what I love about you, Maeve.

215
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,640
Look, Maeve, nobody wanted

216
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,100
that airplane to go down the way it did,
of course not.

217
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,770
And now...

218
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,190
we got to make the best of it.

219
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,280
Otherwise...

220
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,530
Well, otherwise, it was all for nothing.

221
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,460
What did I tell you about boring speeches?

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,720
Mom, when did that happen?

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,300
What are you talking about?
That's always been there.

224
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,350
I know what you're all thinking,

225
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,070
"Holy mackerel, Starlight?
From the Seven? Here with us?"

226
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,780
Well, I knew her when she was still
in pigtails and braces

227
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,240
and she'd sit right where you're sitting.

228
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,700
So don't be shy.
You ask what's on your mind.

229
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,120
Starlight is here for you.

230
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,040
Yeah?

231
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,170
I have this friend
from my soccer team, Sunji,

232
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,670
she's Hindu.

233
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,460
I know it's kind of my
responsibility, I guess,

234
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,630
to get her to accept Jesus,

235
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,220
but it feels weird to me.

236
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,010
Well, Jesus also says
to love your neighbour.

237
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,720
But if you love your neighbour,

238
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,390
don't you want to save them
from damnation?

239
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,150
You have to look at it as good news.

240
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:06,490
You have a chance to help your friend
find eternal life, right?

241
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,150
Yes.

242
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,860
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

243
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,070
Well, yeah.

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,740
Yeah, I was with Drummer Boy for a while,
for almost a year.

245
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,450
Yeah?

246
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,580
Did you have...

247
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,590
sex with him?

248
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,760
Well, I...

249
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,510
you know, I think,
I think everyone hopes

250
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,890
that their first is the one.

251
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,430
And... it's private, but...

252
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,860
I'm a virgin.

253
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,990
Yeah, I'm...

254
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,990
saving myself for my future husband.

255
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,700
See? Hebrews 13:4.

256
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,660
Let the bed be undefiled,

257
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,250
for God will judge the sexually immoral.

258
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,460
Okay.

259
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,040
I think we have time for a few more.

260
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,550
I'm not really sure
what you're saying, son.

261
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,010
I'm saying if there is some geezer up there
with a big white beard,

262
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,050
he's a world heavyweight cunt.

263
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,670
What?

264
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm sorry, did you just
call God a C-word?

265
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,970
Yeah. He's got a hard-on for mass murder

266
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
and giving kids cancer,
and his big old answer

267
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,020
to the existential clusterfuck
that is humanity

268
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,020
is to nail his own bleeding son to a plank.

269
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,480
That is a cunt move.
Even you got to agree with me there.

270
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,730
- Hey, please.
- We should lob

271
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,860
a fucking nuke at him,
get it over and done with.

272
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,160
- You know what I'm saying?
- We're sorry, sir. We apologise. My man.

273
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,830
All right. Good talk. Think about it.

274
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,370
I'm here all day, all right?

275
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,250
You mind piping it down just a little bit?

276
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,710
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend

277
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,210
your inner black Baptist mom
shouting "Praise the Lord."

278
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,790
Fuck you, I'm Episcopalian.

279
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,960
And there's nothing wrong with having
a little church up in you, you know?

280
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,920
Said the bishop to the nun.
What about you, Hughie?

281
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,760
You believe in God?

282
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,050
I mean, I don't know.

283
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,430
- What? Come off it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

284
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,100
I don't think it's Morgan Freeman up there
or anything,

285
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,060
but it can't all be random chaos.

286
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,440
So you think that what happened to Robin
was some kind of divine intervention?

287
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,360
Is that what you're saying?

288
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,780
Hang about. Hello?

289
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,410
So what were you supposed to say?

290
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,200
"Yes, I've had premarital sex, go nuts"?

291
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,870
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't
supposed to lie to them, Mom.

292
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,000
Baby.

293
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,670
You're Starlight of the Seven.

294
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,880
Millions of kids are looking up to you now.

295
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,550
You're a shining light to them.

296
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,260
How am I supposed to live up to that?

297
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,220
Because that's the way God made you.

298
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,100
You're a miracle. You're my miracle.

299
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,350
Hey... Hey, you two. How's it going?

300
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,690
You know what? I'll catch up.

301
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,520
- You sure?
- Don't worry, I'll be right there.

302
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,320
Keep an eye on the lad, all right?

303
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,780
Where the fuck are you going?

304
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,820
Just do it.

305
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,910
Yeah.

306
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,910
- You okay?
- Fine.

307
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,000
It's just... this place
isn't what I remember.

308
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,420
Hey...

309
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,430
Hughie?

310
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,310
Hey, can I ask you something?

311
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,980
Anything.

312
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,770
Is there any way you could
hook me up with one of those

313
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,520
Diamond Club passes?

314
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,690
You know, to see Ezekiel?

315
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,280
I mean, I couldn't get one
unless I robbed a bank.

316
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,150
But... you know.

317
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,990
Ezekiel?

318
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,290
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

319
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,290
Confession time. My dad is,
like, Ezekiel's number one fan.

320
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,250
So what do you think?

321
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,590
Pull a few strings, you know?

322
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,920
Hook me up with some tickets?

323
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
Yeah, yeah.

324
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,350
Sure, of course.

325
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,810
- It's the least I could do.
- Thank you.

326
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,990
Thanks, guys. How are you, girls?

327
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,030
Hey, pal, how are you? How are you?

328
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,120
Great, thanks for coming along.

329
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,620
- God bless you guys!
- Thanks!

330
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,450
God bless you one and all!

331
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,040
Take care now. Keep believing.

332
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,290
Grab Madelyn.

333
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,920
I need to talk to her about
these fucking talking points.

334
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,130
Ms Stillwell isn't here today.
I thought you knew that.

335
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,470
But I'm here to help you with anything,
I'll go through the talk...

336
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,350
Ashley?

337
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,610
Where is she?

338
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,120
What are you doing here?

339
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,490
Skipping work now?

340
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,160
I am taking Teddy to the paediatrician.

341
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,580
Maybe reschedule it.

342
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,170
I've already rescheduled three times.

343
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,710
What is the emergency?

344
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,300
My speech.

345
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,090
- Your speech?
- Yes. My speech.

346
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,180
It reads like corporate fucking mayonnaise.

347
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,390
We're talking Believe here.
These are my people.

348
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,510
But you're not just talking to them.

349
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,850
Every dove and Democrat in Congress

350
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,020
is going to be watching you on CNN.

351
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,980
- You need to appear moderate.
- No.

352
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,190
- Humble.
- No!

353
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,320
There is an opportunity here.

354
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
People are scared.
They don't trust Washington

355
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,660
or the coastal elite,
and they hate foreigners.

356
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,620
What they want is a little
John Wayne frontier justice.

357
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,460
And that is what I do.

358
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,170
Don't forget, it was me
that saved that Flight 37 thing.

359
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,420
I turned that into a win. For us.

360
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,800
You're really gonna talk to me
about "saving" Flight 37?

361
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,390
Well, why wouldn't I?

362
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,060
Look, can I please just talk to you later?

363
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,940
The speech is perfect.

364
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,520
- Trust me.
- Trust you.

365
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,480
Okay. That's what you always say.

366
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,230
You're not even fucking listening to me.
You're so full of shit!

367
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,900
You say you want my input,

368
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,400
but you don't.

369
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,990
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

370
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,530
- And you never did.
- I do. Can we please just talk later?

371
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,750
Why? You gonna run off
and play "strong single mom"?

372
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,500
Please...

373
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,630
That baby is an accessory.

374
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,760
We need boundaries.

375
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,030
Hey, Billy.

376
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,450
Rachel.

377
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,960
Just took a lovely little
stroll around St. John's.

378
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,550
And you'll never guess
what I happened across.

379
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,720
Who told you?

380
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,310
Well, I'll tell you who
didn't fucking tell me.

381
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,640
My own fucking sister-in-law.

382
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,520
Would you like some tea?

383
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,560
I got the English stuff.

384
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,440
When'd you do it?

385
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,610
Last Sunday.

386
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,400
We used your last name.

387
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,780
We said "beloved wife."

388
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,950
You buried an empty fucking coffin?

389
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,200
We didn't bury anything. Just a headstone.

390
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,580
Well, that's a sick fucking joke
then, isn't it?

391
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,580
And you're wondering
why we didn't tell you.

392
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,500
Look...

393
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,000
my mom's getting old.

394
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,220
She just wants a place
to talk to her daughter.

395
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,260
Yeah, well, she's
talking to dirt, isn't she?

396
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,510
- It's something.
- No.

397
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,220
It's fucking nothing.

398
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,930
It's nothing, because there's nothing
fucking down there.

399
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,560
And for all you know, Rebecca's
still out there somewhere,

400
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,140
and you put up a fucking headstone.

401
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,400
Stop!

402
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,940
You need to stop.

403
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,900
It has been eight years since
she's been missing.

404
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,070
The cops never found anything.
You never found anything.

405
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,580
She's not alive.

406
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,830
She got killed or she killed herself.

407
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,710
You watch your fucking mouth.

408
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,750
You're not the only one
whose life was ruined.

409
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,130
She is my sister, and I love her.

410
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,210
But she's gone.

411
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,590
We need this to be over.

412
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,820
Popclaw.

413
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,200
You got the right to remain silent, bitch.

414
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,330
I did not kill your partner.

415
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,870
And I did not kill Dr Robinson.

416
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,830
I wouldn't lie to you. I love you, baby.

417
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,460
Love is just another lie, Donovan.

418
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,920
- You must think I'm stupid.
- No.

419
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,340
But as you can see,

420
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,680
I'm pretty sharp.

421
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,850
Yeah, you've got talent.

422
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,280
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

423
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,700
Yeah, say it.

424
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,000
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

425
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,120
I'm a filthy pig...

426
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,840
Hold up. Easy.

427
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,590
Easy does it. We ain't here to hurt you.

428
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,550
Who are you?

429
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,410
This guy's got 34 addresses
and at least a dozen aliases.

430
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,280
So, who the hell is he?

431
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,370
Something we're running down on our own.

432
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,410
Since when do you guys
run down stuff alone?

433
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,540
- Trevor...
- Yeah?

434
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,000
Shut up.

435
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
- Excuse me.
- Hughie.

436
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,930
Right? You're Starlight's friend.
She got you in here.

437
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,310
- Yeah.
- There you go.

438
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,980
Good to meet you, pal.

439
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,980
Good to meet you.

440
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,690
How do you know Starlight?

441
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,530
You know, we met,
like, a few weeks ago, actually.

442
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,780
- Really?
- Yeah.

443
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,620
- And she got you in here?
- Yeah, I guess she did.

444
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,580
This is a pricey ticket, Hughie.

445
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,540
You must be a special guy.

446
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,670
I... No. No, I'm not...

447
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,040
I just feel lucky to be here. Really.

448
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,710
Ladies and gentlemen,

449
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,760
I would like to welcome you one and all.

450
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,380
And I would very much like to
welcome... Homelander,

451
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,470
our special guest.

452
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,230
So, without further ado,

453
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,110
if you would follow me.

454
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,650
Gather round, everybody.

455
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,320
Now, as many of you may already know,

456
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,290
Homelander is an ordained minister
in Samaritan's Embrace.

457
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:11,290
Together, we will be rebaptising you,
my most loyal followers.

458
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,710
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Saviour,

459
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,550
- and Jesus Christ his son?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

460
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,220
Then I baptise you in the name of
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

461
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,270
Your sins have been purged.

462
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,900
Christ be with you.

463
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,110
On this blessed day,
you will be reborn a Christian.

464
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,820
You will be washed clean of all your sins.

465
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,370
Something wrong, Hughie?

466
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,130
No. No, I'm totally comfortable.

467
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,590
Why would you ask that?

468
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,420
Well, your blood pressure's 150/90.
It's a bit high.

469
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,930
Yeah, sorry. Just...

470
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,180
I'm afraid of water.

471
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,680
Don't panic.

472
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,560
I got you.

473
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,730
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Saviour,

474
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,270
and Jesus...

475
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,940
as his son?

476
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,110
Yes.

477
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,950
Then I baptise you in the name of
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

478
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,680
God bless.

479
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,430
Thank you all once again
for allowing me to be a part

480
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,060
of this beautiful occasion.

481
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,900
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good night.

482
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,480
See you, friend.

483
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,400
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

484
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,650
May the light of God shine in your lives.

485
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Excuse me, sir.
May I speak with you just for a moment?

486
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,700
- Sorry, son, I got a packed schedule.
- All right, I understand, sir,

487
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,540
but it's just, I need your guidance.

488
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,040
I need Christ's guidance.

489
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,290
What is it?

490
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,090
Just hold on... one second.

491
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,590
Let me just show you something.

492
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,970
What's wrong?

493
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,350
You fucked me.

494
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,980
What?

495
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,480
Yeah, in a private Supe club.

496
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,530
You know the one on East 29th?
Secret Lair.

497
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,200
Don't know it. Nope.

498
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,240
- There were three of us?
- You've got nothing...

499
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,780
- Oiled up, and you...
- This...

500
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,410
wrapped your stretchy arms
around me, and it was

501
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,040
so fucking hot, and...
your dick was so... perfect.

502
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,210
And long and... stretchy.

503
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,500
And you... You played my butt like jazz.

504
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,130
With poise and skill and...
willingness to improvise.

505
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,440
You come in here.

506
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,900
You try to talk to me?

507
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,360
Like this?

508
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,110
You are a filthy, filthy liar.

509
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,240
- You are unclean.
- I have a video.

510
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,740
- I have a video.
- What?

511
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,370
I have a video of the three of us...

512
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,790
sucking and fucking.

513
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,870
And if you don't let me go,

514
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,500
my friend puts the video online.

515
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,830
Like that.

516
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,050
What do you want? You want money?

517
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,680
Are you here for money?

518
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,840
You ship boxes labelled as polio vaccine

519
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,720
but they're not really
polio vaccine, are they?

520
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,970
They're Compound V.

521
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,190
- Who the hell are you?
- I want to know everything about them.

522
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,730
Okay? You tell me where they're going.

523
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,820
And you tell me how many boxes you ship.

524
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,940
No.

525
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,570
No, they will destroy me.

526
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,320
Who's "they"? Vought?

527
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,410
Here's how this is gonna go.

528
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,330
You're gonna tell me,

529
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,540
or that video...

530
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,670
trends, number one on Twitter.

531
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,250
Tonight.

532
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,040
And you're also gonna stop

533
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,630
the fucking "pray the gay away" shit.

534
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,510
Anyway, it's your choice.

535
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,180
Hello?

536
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,270
Hey, so that wasn't a piece of cake.

537
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,150
Hughie, that you? You all right?

538
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, sorry.

539
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,900
I had to borrow a phone. Thanks again.

540
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,990
I got baptised.

541
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,490
Yeah. It's a long story.

542
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,160
Blackmailing somebody is not cake, okay?

543
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,120
It is weird, it's scary, you wind up
just saying shit.

544
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,910
Did you get him to talk?
What'd he say?

545
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,500
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know
that charity of his?

546
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,630
Samaritan's Embrace?

547
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,000
- Right.
- All right.

548
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,800
So what they do is they take
boxes full of that stuff

549
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,090
and they ship it to hospitals
all across the country.

550
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,420
And apparently the latest one

551
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,380
is going to the NICU at Mercer Hospital.

552
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,850
It's... It's midtown, I think.

553
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,520
You are a natural, kid.
You're like the fucking...

554
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,140
Rain Man of fucking people over.

555
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,140
Not a compliment.

556
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,430
- Hey!
- Cool your jets, guv.

557
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,640
It's not a hate crime.

558
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,940
M.M., all right?

559
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,900
Fucking brilliant.

560
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,610
I'll meet you at the hospital
in half an hour.

561
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,820
Let's hear it for Jesus.

562
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,280
Yes!

563
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,660
One more for the guy upstairs!

564
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,500
I love you guys.
Let me tell you something.

565
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,380
I am so thrilled to be here.

566
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,840
Truthfully. Are you?

567
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,550
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

568
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,510
A terrible tragedy befell
our nation this week.

569
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,930
Terrible.

570
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,430
And let's not mince words about this.

571
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:43,350
We... were... attacked.

572
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,350
America was attacked.

573
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Some people...

574
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,280
they want me to come out here

575
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,240
and speak empty platitudes to you all.

576
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,070
A little bit of corporate talk.

577
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,330
But I don't want to do that.

578
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,660
I can't do that.

579
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,910
You want to know why?

580
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,210
Why?

581
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,080
Because I believe
that what God wants me to do

582
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,960
is get on over there,
find the filthy bastards

583
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,800
that masterminded this,
whatever cave they're in,

584
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,640
and introduce them to a little thing
called God's judgement!

585
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,970
That's what I think!

586
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,680
Sounds like the American thing to do!

587
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,560
Sounds like the right thing to do.

588
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,610
But no. No, no, no.

589
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,320
Apparently, I got to wait for Congress
to say it's okay.

590
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,240
Right?

591
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,160
I say I answer to a higher law.

592
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,540
Wasn't I chosen to save you?

593
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,420
Is it not my God-given purpose

594
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,130
to protect the United States of America?

595
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,430
Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!

596
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,890
Psalm 58:10!

597
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,930
The righteous shall rejoice

598
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,310
when he sees the vengeance

599
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,520
and he will bathe his feet

600
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,480
in the blood of the wicked.

601
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,570
Homelander!

602
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,030
Homelander! Homelander!

603
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,950
Motherfucker.

604
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,850
Hey.

605
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,810
Maeve, what...?

606
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:52,810
- Sorry, what are you...?
- I was stopping a mugging nearby and I...

607
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,110
It's good to see you.

608
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,820
Can I come in?

609
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,040
Okay.

610
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,540
Where's Freckles?

611
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,380
Freckles died two years ago.

612
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,590
Look, I'm kind of busy,

613
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,840
so, maybe give me a call,

614
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,430
call first, next time?

615
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,720
Elena, you don't have to be like this.

616
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,140
Well, you show up out of nowhere
asking about the goddamn cat, so...

617
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,020
- You've been drinking.
- No.

618
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,690
You're not going to meetings anymore.

619
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,950
Listen... Water under the bridge.

620
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,660
I miss you.

621
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,080
You don't get to say that to me.

622
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,290
Leave, please.

623
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,090
Elena, I haven't seen you in years.

624
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,250
I mean...

625
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,720
- wouldn't it be nice...?
- I see you every day.

626
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,880
Every time I walk through Times Square

627
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,600
or turn on the fucking TV.

628
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,430
I'm out of your life.

629
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,770
You never left mine.

630
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,400
I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry.

631
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,570
- I didn't mean...
- I don't want your apology, okay?

632
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,950
I want you to get out.

633
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,530
Okay? I want you to go back
to your ivory penthouse

634
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,450
where you can drink
and fuck whoever you want.

635
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,830
Go back to Homelander.

636
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,800
I can't go back.

637
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,310
Maeve?

638
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,930
It's too hard.

639
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,600
- What happened?
- It's just too hard.

640
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,190
Tell me what happened.

641
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,820
I keep thinking about all...

642
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,490
- All those people.
- It's okay. You'll figure it out.

643
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,950
Okay? You'll figure it out.
You always know what to do.

644
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,240
You always know what to do, okay?

645
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,870
- I don't know. They don't...
- So just tell me what happened.

646
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,920
Tell me what happened.

647
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,670
I don't know, Maeve, if this is...

648
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,430
- Come on.
- No. No, this is...

649
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,970
You're obviously... No, I said stop it.

650
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,560
All right, just...

651
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,230
Just talk to me.

652
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,240
Okay? Just tell me what happened.

653
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,200
Yeah, this...

654
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,240
This was a mistake.

655
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,620
No, just talk to me. Just tell me what...

656
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,120
If you...

657
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,600
- Hello.
- They're coming. They're on to you, babe.

658
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,650
Black Noir was outside my apartment.

659
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,690
What location?

660
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,020
Which addresses do they have?

661
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,440
If they got to my place, all of them.

662
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,370
So, you want to pay me

663
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,250
the professional courtesy and tell me
where the hell you disappeared to before?

664
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,210
I just had to pop down to the shop.

665
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,090
I was running a bit low
on mind your own fucking business.

666
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,770
This better be good.

667
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,020
I'm burned.

668
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,810
What? Fucking hell, Frenchie. How?

669
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,060
I don't know.

670
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,520
What about the rest of us?

671
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,190
Your concern for me is very sweet.

672
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,940
Maybe, maybe not.

673
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,320
So far, they only seem to be

674
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,900
hitting my places. I'm taking off.

675
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,160
- What about the girl?
- Fucking leave her.

676
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,330
God knows what they'll do to her.

677
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,870
Supe-on-Supe violence
ain't our concern, mate.

678
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Butcher.

679
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,960
I said fucking leave her.

680
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,380
Burnt.

681
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,850
It was the Heartland Beauties
"Luck of the Irish" pageant.

682
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,770
The lights went out on-stage

683
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,860
and this one lit up the room
with the glow from her hands.

684
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,820
The show must go on.

685
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,110
That's so sweet.

686
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,870
- Fifteen minutes, Starlight.
- I'm sorry.

687
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,530
Could you just give us one minute, please?

688
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,790
Starlight will begin shortly.

689
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,620
Please go to the main stage.

690
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,630
Mom, I can't do this.

691
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,090
Are you sick? What's wrong?

692
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,960
No, it just doesn't feel right.

693
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,260
- What does that mean?
- Honestly...

694
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,140
I really thought that being here
would feel like it used to,

695
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,640
but it doesn't.

696
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,600
It's changed, or maybe I've changed.

697
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,180
But...

698
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:26,650
Mom, these past few months...

699
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,990
No, tell them I'm not going on.

700
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,030
Honey.

701
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,160
I've waited 23 years for this.

702
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,250
This isn't...

703
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,580
This isn't about you.

704
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,170
Isn't it?

705
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,590
I mean, I kept your secret,

706
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,210
scrimped by selling houses,

707
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,720
took you to all the Supe events.

708
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,800
Please.

709
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,560
All my friends are gonna be watching on TV.

710
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,350
Please.

711
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,530
They're coming for me, mon coeur.

712
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,980
The Supes.

713
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,990
I've been ordered to leave you here
for them to find.

714
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,740
And Monsieur Charcuter, you know,

715
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,830
he knows I'll comply,
that's how he sees me.

716
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,870
Like this mad bastard,

717
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,460
only good for hurting or killing, you know?

718
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,830
Like a gun, he takes me,

719
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,670
points me in a direction and fires.

720
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,050
It's not who I am.

721
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,380
It's not who you are, either.

722
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,720
We're the same, you and I. Like eggs.

723
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,180
Hard outside, soft inside...
Or pineapples, perhaps.

724
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,060
Whatever those bastards
got planned for you,

725
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,400
you don't deserve it, mon coeur.

726
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,860
The Deep finds himself in hot
water following a hare-brained attempt

727
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,620
to free a dolphin from Oceanland.

728
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,780
Insiders say when police tried to intercept

729
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,120
the hijacked van, Deep lost control
of the vehicle and crashed,

730
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,000
catapulting the dolphin
through the front windshield

731
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,590
onto the road, where it was run over

732
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,010
- by an 18...
- Hello there, Believe Expo!

733
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,350
I am so honoured to be here tonight.

734
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,760
Did you know
that my first public

735
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,890
appearance was right
here on this very stage

736
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,230
with Ezekiel and the rest of the family?

737
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,700
Today, I wanted to share with you

738
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,870
how I accepted Christ...

739
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,000
as my personal saviour.

740
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,290
How his way is the only way...

741
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,890
Just...

742
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,270
Just please stop the music.

743
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,100
Please stop.

744
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,650
What are you doing?

745
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,870
You want me to just suck it up
and do this for you?

746
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,250
You have no idea what you're really asking.

747
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,540
You have no idea what I've been through.

748
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,720
Every single word that I say up here,
I'm reading from a script.

749
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,060
I didn't write any of these words.

750
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,180
I don't even know if I believe in them.

751
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:38,690
I mean, I believe in God,
I love God so much, but...

752
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:45,490
Honestly, it's...
It's just how goddamn certain

753
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,320
everyone is around here.

754
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,870
I mean, tickets start at, what, 170 bucks,

755
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,540
so that these people can tell
you how to get in to heaven?

756
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,790
How do they know?
How does anybody know?

757
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,840
When the Bible was written,
life expectancy was 30 years old.

758
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,590
I mean, I'm not so sure
you're supposed to take it literally.

759
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,100
It also says that it's a sin to eat shrimp.

760
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,310
What, if you're gay or if you're Gandhi,

761
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,560
you're going to hell? I mean...

762
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,850
And if you have sex before marriage,

763
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,770
that's... That's not immoral.

764
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,070
That's human.

765
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,820
What's immoral

766
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,870
is the guy who shoved his dick in my face.

767
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,500
- Shit.
- Shit.

768
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,090
Here's the truth.

769
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,050
Anyone who tells you they know
the answers is lying.

770
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,930
And I know, I know,
I'm supposed to be

771
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,060
this hero-idol-symbol-whatever,

772
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,810
but I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

773
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,360
I'm just as scared and confused
as the rest of you.

774
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,030
I'm done pretending,

775
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,530
and I'm done taking any more shit.

776
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,670
Thank you.

777
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,930
Excuse me.

778
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,400
Jackpot.

779
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,240
Compound V? Yeah, and lots of it.

780
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,660
My God.

781
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,250
Jesus.

782
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,000
That's a fucking baby Supe.

783
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,220
Chosen by God, my ass.

784
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,970
These cunts are made in a fucking lab.

785
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,310
Hey.

786
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,900
Hey, easy.

787
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,110
That was a great speech.

788
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,700
I mean, come on... I mean,
know your audience, but that was, like,

789
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,450
That was Joel at the Garden. That was...

790
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,000
I am so glad you enjoyed it.

791
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,460
I'm so glad.
How was your quality time with Ezekiel?

792
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,290
Any more VIP tickets I can get for you?

793
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,550
Because I'm so here for you.

794
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,300
- It's not like that.
- You sure?

795
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,550
Because I can get you a commemorative cup.

796
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,430
Or I can get you an Ezekiel figurine,

797
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,890
- or a goodie bag.
- My girlfriend died.

798
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,270
What?

799
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,110
Happened not too long ago,
and I came here looking for a way

800
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,320
to get out of the shit
that I'm in right now.

801
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,320
And that wasn't fair to you,
and I'm so sorry.

802
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:24,120
I really don't think there's anything
that can help it anymore or fix it...

803
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,460
or make it better.

804
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,970
And everything I heard here?

805
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,930
Well, that helped a total of jack shit.

806
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,140
Except for what you said.

807
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,060
I mean, you're right,
there's... Nobody knows.

808
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,820
And that's the only fucking thing I've
heard all day that's made any sense at all.

809
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,650
And that is the God's honest truth.

810
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,000
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

811
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,750
I'm sorry.

812
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,650
Okay, easy with that. You get
some air in there, you could kill the kid.

813
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,650
Well, wouldn't that be a crying shame?

814
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,650
All right.

815
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,320
Let's bugger off.

816
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,950
All right.

817
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,990
Hey!

818
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,670
Hey, keep them busy.

819
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,850
Watch and learn, son.

820
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,610
Hey. Hey.

821
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,080
Holy fuck.

822
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,120
That was diabolical.

823
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,290
You little fucking beauty.

824
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,640
You done good, lad.

825
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,140
- Come on, Butcher, it's time to go.
- Yeah.

826
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,270
Now, you keep your nose clean, sunshine,

827
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,310
or I'll come back and stomp you.

828
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,240
Holy smokes, Starlight shocking
the Christian community

829
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,570
during her address at Believe Expo,

830
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,950
when she questioned her faith in...

831
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,250
I see you.

832
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,010
I know you're watching me.

833
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,590
You've been out there quite a lot lately.

834
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,890
Always watching.

835
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,060
So why don't you just come on inside?

836
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,730
You afraid of me?

837
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,320
Come in.

838
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,630
Have I not been paying
enough attention to you?

839
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,050
Are you lonely?

840
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,050
It must be hard, feeling so alone.

841
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,470
I'm sorry...

842
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,600
but you cannot give a speech like that.

843
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,900
You cannot be bad.

844
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,310
Come here.

845
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,210
You have to be good.

846
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,670
And you have to listen to me.

847
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,970
And then we both can get what we want.

848
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,900
That's good.

849
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,610
You're my good boy.

850
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,120
No, no, no.

851
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,430
A miracle.

852
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,430
You are a miracle.

853
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,450
