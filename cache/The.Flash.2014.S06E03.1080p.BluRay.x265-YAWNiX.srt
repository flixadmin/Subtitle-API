1
00:00:01,795 --> 00:00:03,421
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:06,508
- My cure will work.
- Or turn them into meta-humans.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,180
Beginning biopsy examination
on Patient 1-A, Mitch Romero.

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,808
I want to become a defense attorney
for meta-humans.

5
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,078
Babe, do you know how many people
you could help in this city?

6
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,687
Hi, I'm here about the internship.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,770
Welcome to <i>The Citizen.</i>

8
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,898
In order for billions to survive,

9
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,192
Flash must die.

10
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,944
I'm gonna go see this Crisis for myself.

11
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,198
<i>The only timeline
where you all survived,</i>

12
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,449
was if I died.

13
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,659
So, what do we tell them?

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:36,246
<i>Whatever we do,
we can't tell the team I'm gonna die.</i>

15
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,877
Add all these to the inventory, boys.

16
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,921
Tomorrow's bake sale
is gonna be a real treat.

17
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,548
Who died and made you boss?

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,008
Mitch Romero.

19
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,927
Still no word from him?

20
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,596
That makes Romero missing, not dead.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,725
In our line of work,
what's the difference?

22
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:57,934
This is my crew now.

23
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,575
Fan out. Whoever's here, put 'em down.

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,463
Romero?

25
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,303
The Monitor? Where did you see him?

26
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:19,224
We were in the Time Vault,
right after putting Chester in the MAC.

27
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:22,060
The Crisis that he spoke about
last year

28
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,395
is the same one
in the plinth's newspaper.

29
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,689
And it's not coming in 2024.

30
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,983
It's coming December 10th...

31
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,444
2019.

32
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,987
Are you sure about this?

33
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:34,823
The jackass lied to you.

34
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,491
Yeah, well, we thought so, too, but...

35
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,620
Barry went to Earth-3

36
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:44,082
and Jay Garrick helped him
see that it was true.

37
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,335
- How did he do that?
- Uh, Jay projected my mind

38
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,045
forward into the future.

39
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,798
Okay. And? What did you see?

40
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:57,262
I saw a giant wave of anti-matter
sweeping over our Earth.

41
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,931
It vaporized all of Central City
and everybody in it,

42
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,642
including you three.

43
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,853
Great. I'll go mark my calendar.

44
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,480
We still have seven weeks
to make sure none of this happens.

45
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:08,480
Guys, Barry's right.

46
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,901
We've changed the future before,
we can change it again.

47
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:13,736
So, what else did our
Asgardian cosplayer say?

48
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,446
That was pretty much it.

49
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,534
It's Joe.

50
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,203
He needs me at CCPD, but that can wait.

51
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,080
We... we need to get on this.

52
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,100
Yeah. We should spend
every minute we have on this.

53
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:30,461
No, guys, look, what we should do
is take a well-deserved time-out,

54
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,630
and come back tomorrow with clear heads.

55
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,299
Okay. If you think so.

56
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,012
What now?

57
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,813
I have to prepare them
for what's coming.

58
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:50,231
They have to be ready
to go on without me.

59
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,277
I guess I know who I need to start with.

60
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,286
- Mom?
- Ralphy!

61
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:06,289
Ralph. Ralph. Oh, come here, baby.

62
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,584
- These stupid things.
- What happened?

63
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:14,088
Last night, 10:00 p.m., the Avenue M
pawn shop was robbed at gunpoint.

64
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,507
The shop owner ID'd your mom
as the perp.

65
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:20,053
So, we had to hold her, charges pending.

66
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:24,182
Mrs. Dibny, this is Cecile Horton.

67
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,391
Ralph.

68
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,476
Good luck.

69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,482
Look, Cecile, yes,
my mom has an eventful past...

70
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:35,777
Okay. Robbery, larceny, bribery...

71
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,737
Fourteen allegations,

72
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,448
not a single charge,
Miss Perfect Hemline.

73
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,200
Thank you. Um...

74
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,744
Ooh, it says here
that the owner of the pawn shop

75
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,205
personally identified you as the robber.

76
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,875
Okay, I was in the shop,
but not at 10:00.

77
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,835
I left around 5:00.

78
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,713
Okay, so, the robbery
was like five hours later.

79
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,799
So, Mom, where were you around 10:00?

80
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:58,882
Yeah.

81
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,385
Is it really that important?

82
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:04,472
Wait, yesterday was the second Monday
of the month. So, Mom...

83
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,642
Yeah.

84
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:11,062
I was at the Cleaner's Royale on Oak.

85
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,230
Okay. Dry cleaner's.

86
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,732
It's a little bit of a gambling front.

87
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,986
Wow, Mom, the last time
that I was there was when...

88
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,155
when you and Marv Perez were an item.

89
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,991
- Uh-huh.
- May he rest in peace.

90
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,492
Oh.

91
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,703
Well, Ralphy,
I really don't think anyone there

92
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,329
is gonna help with my alibi.

93
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,499
- There's only one way to find out.
- Road trip.

94
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,505
Joe thinks there's a meta-killer
that might be involved,

95
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,799
so, if anybody asks,
you're my meta-human consultant.

96
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,260
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,346
A security guard from a nearby building
heard the gunshots.

98
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,182
Said it sounded like a war zone. Uh...

99
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:52,186
We haven't found enough body parts
to determine which crew did all this.

100
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,565
He's covered in claw marks.
An animal did this. Good to go?

101
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,027
No, we're not. This isn't animal blood.

102
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,487
There's two more bodies,
or what's left of them,

103
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:04,282
and a lot more of whatever that is.

104
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:08,619
I see one arm. Two arms.
Oh, they're from the same person.

105
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,581
I'll analyze this.
Hopefully it'll lead us to our killer.

106
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:15,293
Thank you. Can you analyze
what's going on with her?

107
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,086
Yeah, I'll try.

108
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,588
Frost? What are you doing?

109
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,799
- There's no ammo in these.
- I know these guns.

110
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,928
They're charged with dark matter.
They're all empty.

111
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,099
- Who would kill for dark matter?
- A coward.

112
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:45,697
Gotcha!

113
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,627
What did you do?

114
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,088
Frost! What are you doing?

115
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,815
You're supposed to be
following my lead, not...

116
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,239
Getting a damn murderer to confess?

117
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,426
There's no evidence he's involved.

118
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,970
Ease up. Let him go!

119
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,023
Cait? You're Killer Frost.

120
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:21,067
Actually, she's me, Sad Coffee Guy.

121
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,527
I'm so sorry.

122
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,238
My name is Barry Allen.
I'm a forensic scientist with CCPD.

123
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:29,200
We're investigating a series of
meta-related murders

124
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,370
and Caitlin and Frost
are my meta-human consultants.

125
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,453
Dr. Ramsey Rosso.

126
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,498
What happened to your lab?

127
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,254
Um, somebody broke in
while I was working late.

128
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,758
This same substance
was at our crime scene.

129
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,446
I think the meta that attacked you
is the person we're looking for.

130
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,057
They guy we're looking for
stole dark matter from a stash house.

131
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:57,103
I did have a small amount
of dark matter here.

132
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,705
- Where'd you get it from?
- From an old colleague,

133
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,441
Ted Kord. He was actually willing
to help me with my research.

134
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,986
Well, someone's out there
hunting for dark matter

135
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,531
and he's willing to kill to get it, so,
whatever it is you're working on...

136
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,701
Look, Mr. Allen, my HLH research
is very important.

137
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,494
I lost my mother to this disease.

138
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,122
Now, you mentioned
you found a similar substance

139
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,957
both here and at your crime scene.

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,668
And honestly,
it's unlike anything I've seen before.

141
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:25,339
Well, I am a blood specialist.
Perhaps I could be of some assistance.

142
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:26,567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

143
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,885
You are not actually gonna
trust this guy, are you?

144
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,344
'Cause I don't.

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,306
I'm sorry. Frost, look...

146
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,310
People are dying out there, all right?

147
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,478
If Dr. Rosso can help us in any way,

148
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,398
then, yeah, I'm open to it,
and you should be, too.

149
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,902
Would you help us, Dr. Rosso?

150
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,572
Please, call me Ramsey.

151
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,910
Morning, boss.

152
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,995
I have got the mother of all scoops,

153
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,998
and thanks to your new intern,
it's gonna be a CCC Media exclusive.

154
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,250
Actually, you know, I was...

155
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:04,212
hoping that you would help me
with the new filing system.

156
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,380
Alphabetical is great.

157
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:09,217
So, there was a break-in
at McCulloch Tech last night.

158
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,719
Nothing was stolen,
but you'll never guess who the perp is.

159
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:15,097
Get this. Harrison Wells is alive.

160
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,602
Where'd you get this?

161
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,688
One of the McCulloch security guards
and I go way back.

162
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,232
Nice work.

163
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:28,402
Um, I'll tell you what, I will look
into this, and in the meantime,

164
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,238
I could use some quotes
on that mayor story.

165
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,115
The City Council's wondering how long
this new one's gonna last.

166
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,826
Uh, I'd rather do this.

167
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,620
Allegra, look, I understand, okay?

168
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,039
I was an ambitious
cub reporter once, too.

169
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,960
You know, this is great work.
But I will take it from here, okay?

170
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,003
Fine.

171
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,220
Ralphy boy!

172
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,264
Long time no see.

173
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,890
- Looking trim.
- Thanks, Tony.

174
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,141
Deb.

175
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,226
Howdy, Tone-Loc.

176
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,103
- We need a favor, Tony.
- Uh, yeah.

177
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,064
Hi. The Avenue M pawn shop
was robbed last night,

178
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,942
and the police think that Debbie
was responsible.

179
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,169
We just need the footage

180
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,797
from your security camera, so we can
prove that Mom was here last night.

181
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,407
- Last night? Yeah, Deb was here.
- Great.

182
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,660
But I don't work with the cops.
House policy.

183
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,913
Besides, you know I don't have
cameras in here, Deb.

184
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,748
Potted plant.

185
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,166
Ugly lamp on the bar.

186
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,127
Smoke detectors one, two, three.

187
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,923
I like you, Ralphy.
Guess what, you can have the footage.

188
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,258
Oh, great.

189
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,509
For 5,000 bucks.

190
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm sorry, what?

191
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,765
Come back and see me
when you got the green.

192
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,351
Good to see you, Ralphy boy.

193
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,314
That was a bust. Oh, well.

194
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,017
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on, Mom.

195
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,154
We might not got the green,
but we can earn it.

196
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,822
Right.

197
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,658
Excuse me, down here.
How exactly are we going to earn it?

198
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,035
Watch me, sweetie.

199
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:04,290
So, can I talk to Cait?
Can she hear me right now?

200
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,668
One, it's Frost. I'm rebranding.

201
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,421
And two, sure. She can if she wants to.

202
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,424
Caitlin, I want to explain myself

203
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,594
about purchasing dark matter
from Kord Industries.

204
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,680
I hope you understand, if there's
any chance of saving more lives...

205
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,390
You're gonna take it. Right.

206
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,101
I didn't want to go behind your back,
but you refused to help me.

207
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,394
I'm not listening anymore.

208
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,158
And you never told me
that you were a meta.

209
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,707
I thought we were
closer than that, Cait.

210
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,692
Ah. Guess you two aren't
as good of friends as you thought.

211
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:36,864
Hey, guys, uh, CCPD got back
a DNA match on our meta.

212
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,824
Mitch Romero. Do you recognize the name?

213
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,844
- No.
- Mitch Romero is the head

214
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,579
of Central City's biggest
gun-running operation.

215
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,707
What? I have friends in low places.

216
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,977
Romero must have been
looking for dark matter last night

217
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,812
when he went to
the only place he knew he'd find it.

218
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,836
His own stash.

219
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,298
Why rob yourself
and then kill all your employees?

220
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,135
Someone just broke into Mercury Labs.

221
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,139
A facility like that would have
undisclosed amounts of dark matter.

222
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,057
What did you do?

223
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:53,315
What did you do? Frost!
You just killed him!

224
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,985
We're supposed to cuff metas,
not throw them out windows.

225
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,778
Calm down!

226
00:12:57,862 --> 00:13:00,281
Romero is fine.
He just got up and walked away.

227
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,301
You had no idea that would happen
when you shot him out the window.

228
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,761
You let your anger
get the better of you.

229
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,388
I thought you had a handle on that.

230
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,372
Frost! That cannot happen again!

231
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,124
What? Now you're telling me how to feel?

232
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,042
Look, I have seven weeks

233
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,420
to teach you how to handle
this kind of situation.

234
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,130
You have to start listening.

235
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,973
You have to stop being
such a crappy teacher.

236
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,490
- Make sure she loses.
- Tony's security footage

237
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,016
is on a USB drive in his office.

238
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,285
Buy me as much time as you can.

239
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,603
Okay. It's fine. We got it. Go.

240
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,942
He's nervous.

241
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,195
Go on. Do it.

242
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,740
Pair of tens.

243
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,475
You can't bluff a bluffer.

244
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,876
Boom.

245
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,632
- You're kidding me.
- Debbie's hot tonight.

246
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:09,975
Uh, Debbie.

247
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,602
Oh, Deb.

248
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:15,814
All in.

249
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:24,657
Read 'em and weep.

250
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,745
Ooh, tough break, Deb.

251
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:34,124
I'm sorry, Mom. We tried.
Let's get you home.

252
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,961
Good to see you, Tony.
Keep up the not-so-legal work.

253
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,177
- Hey.
- Oh, where's Killer Caitlin?

254
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,096
Out assaulting another suspect
without cause?

255
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,347
She's taking a breather.

256
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,230
Did you find anything helpful
from the sample?

257
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,476
- More than I ever imagined.
- Yeah?

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,062
Take a look at the pattern
on these gene transcriptions.

259
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,607
Romero's dark matter infused cells
are destroying his normal cells.

260
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,568
He's more monster now than man.

261
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,820
The more dark matter he absorbs,
the stronger he gets.

262
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,532
According to this,
Romero's been dead for over 24 hours.

263
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,537
That's why he can't die. He already has.

264
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,957
Um, thank you for your help, Dr. Rosso.

265
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,750
- Barry.
- Yeah?

266
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,797
If I could observe Romero's genes
interacting with dark matter,

267
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,383
I might be able to find a way
to counteract his condition.

268
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,527
I don't think that's a good idea.

269
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,445
Working with dark matter
can be really dangerous.

270
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,972
Mr. Allen,
I'm the top hematological oncologist

271
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,307
in the Western Hemisphere.

272
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,976
There's a creature out there
with a metastasized blood chemistry

273
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,820
with the strength of ten men,
and he's getting stronger by the minute.

274
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,940
Please. Let me help.

275
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,946
The satellite's facial recognition
spotted our new Wells

276
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,448
less than an hour ago.

277
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,075
According to Miranda,
it's somewhere in this area.

278
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,802
Harrison Wells, welcome to Earth-1.

279
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,054
My name is Cisco Ramon.

280
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,893
- Why are you following me?
- Oh, great. Another angry one.

281
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,495
To get your hands
on this priceless beauty?

282
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,646
Is that why? Go ahead.

283
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,769
It gives nightmare hallucinations to
all of its victims. Would you like that?

284
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,526
- Would you like that?
- No.

285
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,746
So, it's you.

286
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:36,955
What?

287
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,542
- What's your name?
- Iris West-Allen.

288
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,043
Well, I...

289
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,132
And don't you forget it.

290
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:48,801
I had that.

291
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,347
And there you are.

292
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,183
Wait. Oh, no, no, Debbie, um...

293
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,102
That has you leaving at 9:30.

294
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,812
We need to know where you were at 10:00,

295
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,095
the exact time of the robbery.

296
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,774
Went out for air.
Oh, well, we tried.

297
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,657
Hang on,
there's another camera angle outside.

298
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,985
Ralphy, don't...

299
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,569
Did you find her?

300
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,156
I did...

301
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,535
with Marv Perez.

302
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,579
Marv's alive?

303
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,207
Yeah.

304
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,591
You said he died
in a car accident months ago.

305
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:27,047
You were with Marv
when the pawn shop was robbed.

306
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,925
Ralphy, let me explain.

307
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,386
If Marv is alive,
what about your other boyfriends?

308
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,805
How many of them are alive?

309
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,392
Okay, all of 'em.

310
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,729
Ralph, hey, you know what?

311
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:46,984
It's okay, this is... This a good thing,
because Marv is Debbie's alibi.

312
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,986
So, your mom isn't gonna go to jail.

313
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,988
Yeah, let's focus on that.

314
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,907
Marv, Doug, Craig, Nick.

315
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,618
These guys, they were like family to me.

316
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,288
How could you lie about that?

317
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,206
I don't know why
you're so upset, sweetie,

318
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,125
you always moved on so quickly.

319
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,419
I was being strong for you.

320
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,115
That doesn't mean it didn't hurt
like hell every damn time.

321
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,634
- What really happened?
- What always happens,

322
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:16,430
you know, we were happy,
but I knew it wouldn't last.

323
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,931
So, I ended it.

324
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,266
What else did you lie about?

325
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,728
- Did Dad really leave us?
- Yes.

326
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,646
That one is true.

327
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,276
Ralphy, I didn't mean to hurt you.

328
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,945
My name is Ralph.

329
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,949
You need to leave. Get out.

330
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,035
Now.

331
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,713
I can't believe you and Cait
get to work here.

332
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,509
How will all this help?

333
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,806
Dark matter is a miraculous thing.

334
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,601
With gene-splicing,
I can use your dark matter samples

335
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,478
to negatively charge Romero's blood.

336
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,231
That should weaken him enough
for you to make an arrest.

337
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,275
But, um...

338
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:14,863
I, uh...
I will need a second centrifuge.

339
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:19,827
Uh, there's another one downstairs.
I'll get it.

340
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,631
I had a feeling about you.

341
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,177
I hoped that was wrong,

342
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,181
but I know a desperate man
when I see one.

343
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,476
Put 'em back.

344
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:46,936
No.

345
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,313
I can make you.

346
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:49,857
Go on, then.

347
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,360
Like you said, I'm a desperate man.
I have nothing to lose.

348
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,821
I thought you wanted to save lives.

349
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,823
HLH isn't just my mother's disease.

350
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,869
First, it killed her.

351
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,996
And now, it's killing me.

352
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,916
I still can't let you take those.

353
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,461
Look at what it did to Mitch Romero.

354
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,173
I am marking a calendar
every day until I die,

355
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,050
waiting to fall off a cliff,

356
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,053
powerless to grab on to anything,
or anyone.

357
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,476
I watched my mother
dive off that same cliff...

358
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,188
with a smile on her face.

359
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,443
She didn't even fight.

360
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,862
I know what it's like
to lose your mother.

361
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,407
I know you're angry.

362
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,409
This isn't anger.

363
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,746
This is the pain beneath my anger.

364
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,334
It takes courage to fight death.

365
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,755
Maybe it takes more to accept it.

366
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,053
My mum had that same look on her face
when she was first diagnosed.

367
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,805
You're a dead man, too.

368
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,265
Aren't you, Barry?

369
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,768
So, why don't you fight for yourself?

370
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,772
I'm marking my calendar
with the days I have left to live.

371
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,692
And I'm gonna spend them
saving as many people as I can.

372
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,945
You're not a coward.

373
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,073
You're just naive.

374
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,330
Mitch Romero's still out there.

375
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,126
You said you wanted to save lives.

376
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,130
Prove it. Help me stop him,
or get out of my lab.

377
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,242
Let's get to work.

378
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,247
You know, I don't understand you, Barry.

379
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,501
You march towards death without fear,
just like Mum.

380
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,005
Where is it you get your strength?

381
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,340
Probably the same place she did.

382
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,510
People I love.

383
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,636
I see.

384
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,641
Then it must have been
incredibly hard to tell them.

385
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,447
<i>You're a dead man, too.</i>

386
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,614
<i>Aren't you, Barry?</i>

387
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,660
<i>Then it must have been
incredibly hard to tell them.</i>

388
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,205
<i>This isn't anger.</i>

389
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,626
<i>This is the pain beneath my anger.</i>

390
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,771
According to
his techno fanny pack,

391
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:20,901
this belongs to
Dr. Harrison "Nash" Wells.

392
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,492
Easy.

393
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,533
We aren't gonna hurt you.

394
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,536
No.
Let's just try this again.

395
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,622
All right. I'm Iris West-Allen.

396
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,791
- This is Cisco Ramon.
- Iris, Cisco.

397
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,376
And we are friends
of the Council of Wells.

398
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,628
Oh.

399
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,465
Those idiots. Okay, now.

400
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:48,136
Okay. Listen. I tased you once before,
and I'm happy to do it again. So just...

401
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,697
I let you do that. Now, hold still.

402
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:50,721
Uh-uh-uh.

403
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:52,533
What are you doing on our Earth?

404
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:53,868
What am I doing?
I'm searching for an artifact

405
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:58,021
that just happens to contain
the same particles...

406
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,025
I'm currently reading...

407
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,069
- off you.
- What?

408
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,904
Although...

409
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,782
What... What... Particles of what?

410
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,533
Eternium.

411
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,701
Eternium?

412
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,746
Eternium is a multi-versal element.

413
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,000
All right. Although, the readings were
stronger in the alley.

414
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,669
Listen, Indiana,

415
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,754
I don't know how they do things
on your Earth,

416
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,714
- but this ain't <i>Temple of Doom.</i>
- Mmm-mmm.

417
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,843
And what is Eternium
supposed to be, anyway?

418
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,346
Some kind of stolen mystical element

419
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,766
from the Tiki gods
that you suddenly have to return?

420
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,577
Look, there's no such thing

421
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:40,355
as mystical mumbo-jumbo or gods.

422
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,941
What there are are meta-humans, aliens,

423
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,694
and false gods
worshipped by simple-minded people

424
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,904
that find comfort in myths.

425
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,156
I dispel those myths.

426
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:52,117
- You people are no help.
- Hey.

427
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,243
Newsflash, Nash.

428
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,246
We've actually done this dance before.

429
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,206
- Is that right?
- That's right.

430
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,208
- Yeah.
- It usually starts off rocky,

431
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,877
especially between you and me,

432
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,670
but eventually, we bond,

433
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,672
and you learn to embrace
that sensitive side.

434
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:10,343
So, why don't you just drop the act,
and show me that warm, compassionate,

435
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:13,054
smart guy that I know you to be.

436
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:18,018
Let me ask you a question.
Do I look like I want to hold hands?

437
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,396
Interesting.

438
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:26,109
If you want your toys back,
you might just have to.

439
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,277
Hmm.

440
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,920
Well, I have to admit...

441
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,130
- ...that was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

442
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,385
Does she know about the multi-verse?

443
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,803
She kind of does now.

444
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,348
I'll handle it.

445
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,935
I got the quotes for the Mayor story
and I finished your filing.

446
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,058
Everything's alphabetical.

447
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,144
Great.

448
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,105
Also, I quit.

449
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:06,857
Allegra, wait.

450
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,944
You know why I was even out here?

451
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,655
Enjoying the sun. You don't get
much of that in Iron Heights.

452
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,699
I spent five years locked up there,

453
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,344
and it taught me
how to tell the difference

454
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,036
between a snitch and a liar.

455
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,537
You're not a snitch.

456
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,706
Allegra, it's not what you think, okay?

457
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,959
Forget it. I've wasted
enough time behind bars.

458
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,127
I'm not wasting any more
working for a liar.

459
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,547
So, be honest with me
or I'm out of here.

460
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,800
Okay.

461
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,594
You're right. I was lying to you,

462
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:38,807
but I... I can't tell you the truth
about Harrison Wells. Not yet.

463
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:43,186
I do believe in you, Allegra.
I think you have great instincts,

464
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,188
and I think
you're gonna make a great reporter.

465
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,649
That's why I took a chance on you.

466
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:51,611
Now, I'm asking you to take
a chance on me, okay? Trust me.

467
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,030
When the time is right,
I will tell you everything.

468
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,407
I promise.

469
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:01,997
We're journalists. It's our job to
tell people the truth, not control it.

470
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,166
Even if it's tough to say,
or hard as hell to hear.

471
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,086
Just sayin', boss.

472
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,842
See you in the morning.

473
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,278
Come to lecture me some more?

474
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:37,073
Look, I know you think
that you fight better when you're angry.

475
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,701
So why don't you try
and hit a real target?

476
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,259
Stop trying to hit me and hit me!

477
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:59,179
Or why don't you just admit the truth
about what's hurting you.

478
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,144
I don't wanna die
when I've just started living.

479
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,227
Okay?

480
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,814
I finally have the chance
to live a life,

481
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,776
and now this stupid Crisis
is gonna take it all away?

482
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:13,859
I know it's not fair.

483
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:18,448
Do you know that Baskin-Robbins
has 31 different flavors?

484
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:22,160
I might die before I get to figure out
which one is my favorite.

485
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,703
Or what my favorite song is.

486
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,498
Or have my first birthday party.

487
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:29,501
Thirty years of existing,
and I've never had one.

488
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:30,960
That really sucks.

489
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,963
Frost.

490
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,341
There's always gonna be a crisis,

491
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:40,220
or some meta-human that's threatening
to take away the life that you love.

492
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,099
The truth is,
we're all living on borrowed time.

493
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,228
So, what? Everybody feels
this crappy all the time?

494
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,024
That actually does kind of
make me feel better.

495
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:56,361
That's why you can't let the threat
of losing tomorrow

496
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,279
keep you from making the most of today.

497
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,284
I want to spend the rest of today

498
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:06,454
making sure that Mitch Romero
doesn't hurt anyone else.

499
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,897
What are you?

500
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:27,826
Stop!

501
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,124
Let me go.

502
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,148
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

503
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:38,897
Romero!

504
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,150
Ramsey, don't move.

505
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:44,778
You want this?

506
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:47,949
Yeah?

507
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,785
Yeah. Come and get it. Come on.

508
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,459
Come on! Come and get it! Come on!

509
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,090
Frost, Romero is heading
to The Pipeline.

510
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,260
Hey, there! Come on! Yeah.

511
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,511
Come on.

512
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,978
Oh. I missed all the fun.

513
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,522
Next time we have to lock up
an undead meta, he's all yours.

514
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,359
Uh, Barry?

515
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,923
Guess those meta-cuffs
would've been a waste of time.

516
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:04,150
Dark matter fuels his rage.

517
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:08,047
All right. Get back. I'm gonna throw
a lightning bolt at him.

518
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,381
No, no, no. I have a better idea.

519
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,157
Get me all the dark matter
in S.T.A.R. Labs.

520
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Now!

521
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,179
- That's gonna make him stronger.
- No, it's gonna make him angry.

522
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:17,014
And I'm pretty sure
if we give it to him, he'll overdose.

523
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,790
Trust me.

524
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,585
Rage on this, Romero.

525
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:46,525
Huh.

526
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:49,570
You were right.
Anger really does cloud judgment.

527
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,542
No breaks. Just bruising. You got lucky.

528
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,627
I best be off.

529
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,759
Ramsey, hey, um...

530
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,221
I know we didn't see eye to eye today...

531
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:18,057
but thanks for your help.

532
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,560
If you ever wanna talk...

533
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:22,895
Thanks, but I'm fine.

534
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,565
See you in the next life, Barry.

535
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,284
Thanks for coming, Mom.

536
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,910
You kidding?

537
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,580
I'm just so grateful you would see me.

538
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,663
Can I go first?

539
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,125
When your father left,

540
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:48,379
you came into my room
every morning for a week,

541
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:52,049
with your hands on your hips,
and you said, "Where's Dad?"

542
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:57,054
And I did not know how to tell you
he wasn't coming back.

543
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,683
I was so worried
that you would think it was my fault,

544
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,435
or worse, yours.

545
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:07,106
And then when I did tell you the truth,
you were so mad,

546
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:10,485
and so hurt.

547
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,739
You could not believe that he left
without even saying goodbye.

548
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,954
So, a couple of years later,
when my boyfriend Doug and I broke up,

549
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,247
and he left...

550
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:28,544
there was no way I was gonna
put you through that pain again.

551
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,963
You two had become so close and...

552
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:33,382
You lied to protect me.

553
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,718
But, Mom...

554
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,763
why did you break up
with all the others?

555
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:43,893
They always wanted
more than I could give.

556
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:47,021
You get scared.
I know, because I'm the same way.

557
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,565
Which is why I made you something.

558
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,906
An addendum for <i>The Book of Ralph.</i>

559
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:10,753
"22 Steps to Being Open
to the Love of Your Life."

560
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,799
I'm open to love.
I'm just picky.

561
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,301
Mom, give me a break.

562
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,556
Neither one of us
has been open to love since Dad left.

563
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:25,268
And, Mom, by keeping that pain away...

564
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,522
we're also closing ourselves off

565
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,483
from the joy that love can bring.

566
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:38,072
I don't think I'm cut out
for joy.

567
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:43,286
But I want that joy for you, Ralph.

568
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,998
Love, happiness,
the whole kit and caboodle.

569
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,333
I want you to go find that.

570
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,838
And don't worry about me.

571
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,133
Okay, Ralph?

572
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,427
Come on, Mom.

573
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,598
I'll always be your Ralphy.

574
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,367
I now have a new theory.

575
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,954
I believe I have found
an effective cure for HLH,

576
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,499
one that would eliminate
my need for dark matter entirely.

577
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:49,727
Analysis of subject 1-A,
Mitch Romero's blood,

578
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,356
reveals that dark matter
infused with healthy blood cells

579
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:56,275
to create an even stronger
biological substance.

580
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:01,072
This substance appears to heal any
and all weaknesses in the human body,

581
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:05,576
including cells affected by HLH.

582
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,372
I will now commence human trials.

583
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,992
I need more.

584
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,675
What in tarnation!

585
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,971
Hey, sweetie.
We having a little get-together?

586
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,890
So, Frost has never had
a birthday party.

587
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:13,436
So, I offered to throw her one.
She picked the guest list.

588
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,982
It's my party
and I'll rage if I want to!

589
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,089
Hey. You're missing out on all the fun.

590
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,091
Thanks for the party.

591
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:49,263
I'm thinking, next year,
we go whitewater rafting.

592
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,433
You should definitely do that.

593
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,795
You're not gonna be at my birthday party
next year, are you?

594
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,149
Whenever you talk about
life after Crisis,

595
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,984
you never talk about yourself.

596
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,489
You're gonna do more than just
vanish in Crisis, aren't you?

597
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,710
I don't know how to tell them.

598
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:18,229
Try with me by your side.

599
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:24,090
Barry, keeping this secret all day
hasn't felt right.

600
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:29,845
Let's tell them together.

601
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:42,108
Barry and I didn't share everything
that we learned

602
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:44,401
about Crisis, and...

603
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:47,780
you guys deserve to know the truth.

604
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,826
The Monitor didn't just...

605
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,995
warn us that Crisis was coming early.

606
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,749
There was something else
that he said had to happen.

607
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:04,296
When I projected my mind forward,
I saw billions of possible futures.

608
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:10,052
The only timeline
where everyone survives...

609
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,139
was the one where I died.

610
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,852
I have to die in Crisis.

611
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,188
And none of you can try and save me.

612
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:52,011
It's here.

613
00:41:52,035 --> 00:42:00,035
