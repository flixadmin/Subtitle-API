1
00:00:01,025 --> 00:00:03,726
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:06,894
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:09,446
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:11,982
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:16,704
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:21,125
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:26,613
I must be
something else.

8
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:28,716
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:31,835
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

10
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:34,287
You got what you came for!
Time's up.

11
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,973
No!
I guess you made your choice.

12
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:38,175
No!

13
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:40,677
Ivo killed Shado
because of me.

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,846
Nothing good comes from telling
Slade that you think you're responsible

15
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:45,315
for the death
of the woman he loved.

16
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:49,319
The man who killed Shado
is still out there.

17
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,564
Not for long.

18
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:52,513
Because we're going
to take the freighter.

19
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:55,692
We're all going
to die here, just like him.

20
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:59,312
No, we're not. I think I found our way
on to the freighter.

21
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,033
A parachute.

22
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:06,036
I'd like you to meet
Slade Wilson.

23
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:08,205
It's a pleasure to meet you...

24
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:10,340
Mr. Queen.

25
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:17,330
What are you
doing here?

26
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:21,051
Mr. Wilson just made
a sizeable contribution

27
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:23,053
to my campaign.

28
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,390
How generous of him.

29
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:27,858
Well, I felt compelled.

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,060
It was the least
that I could do for your mother.

31
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:33,013
And what this city needs
is a pro-business mayor

32
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:36,700
like Moira to spread growth
through urban investment.

33
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:41,071
And we were just discussing how
to combat the rising wage gap.

34
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:44,691
And the answer lies
in your budget proposal.

35
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:46,877
You know, when I look
at your mother,

36
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,463
I think about everything that you
went through after the quake.

37
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:52,833
All I can say is, you and
I have something in common.

38
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,701
What's that?

39
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:57,171
I know how difficult
it is to pick yourself back up

40
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:59,706
when other people
have written you off.

41
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:03,527
Indeed.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,433
What's wrong, Mr. Queen?
You look a little piqued.

43
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:13,070
I'm fine,
thank you.

44
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:18,442
Ah, thank you, dear.

45
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:21,778
Oliver, Mr. Wilson
was kind enough to bring

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,781
a bottle of authentic
Australian rum.

47
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,237
Will you join us
in a drink?

48
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,406
Yes, of course.

49
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,425
Wonderful.

50
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:37,845
What shall
we drink to?

51
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:43,267
To friendship.

52
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:53,477
Oh, delicious.

53
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:58,282
This here
is a beautiful piece.

54
00:02:58,284 --> 00:03:02,286
Tell me, does your family spend
much time on the water?

55
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:04,488
Uh, no.

56
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,458
Not since my late husband.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,627
I'm sorry, Moira,
forgive me.

58
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:14,631
I do remember reading about that
accident in the paper.

59
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,466
You were a brave soul.

60
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:19,286
I don't like
to talk about it.

61
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:21,288
I can understand.

62
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,090
All that time on that island...

63
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:25,642
It must have been
hell for you.

64
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,618
Shado
would be proud.

65
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,187
Thank you.
But those trees don't move,

66
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,374
or shoot back. Ivo's men
on the freighter will.

67
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,249
Then shoot first.

68
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,250

70
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,054
Ivo's freighter
is located here.

71
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:45,339
He keeps eight men
on deck. Three on the starboard,

72
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:48,208
three on the port
and two up in the bridge.

73
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,711
But our bigger concern
are these GP 25 grenade launchers

74
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,597
that they're walking
around with at all times.

75
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,315
Do they have
night vision?

76
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,734
Not according to blondie.

77
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:02,222
That smells awful.

78
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,940
It'll taste
even worse.

79
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,442
But it'll work?

80
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:07,778
I spent a year
with Anthony Ivo.

81
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,863
I know how he thinks.

82
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,498
It'll work.

83
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,256
Hey, what about
the Mirakuru?

84
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:20,924
Well, what about it?

85
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:22,959
Well, look,
I mean, it can cure,

86
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,595
I don't know,
maybe anything.

87
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:29,800
Maybe...Maybe
it's a miracle drug.

88
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:34,104
But it's also something else.

89
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:36,423
Something that people like Ivo

90
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:39,109
should never be allowed
to control.

91
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,429
What about Slade?
He might not let us.

92
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:46,149
Might not
let you do what?

93
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:48,985
You think we should
destroy the Mirakuru?

94
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:51,788
This thing doesn't
go our way...

95
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,658
We can't let
Ivo have it.

96
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,944
You're right.

97
00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:01,048
We should burn it.

98
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,502
Anthony devoted his
entire life to finding this.

99
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:09,556
Nobody even thought
it was real.

100
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:11,808
It was his dream.

101
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,827
Did he ever say why?

102
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:16,296
He wanted
to save the world.

103
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,302
We need
to talk about tomorrow.

104
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:26,073
About what to do with Anthony
once we take the freighter.

105
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:27,607
What do you mean?

106
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:30,327
Because Slade
wants to kill him.

107
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,978
I'm not going
to let that happen.

108
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,664
No, Slade wants to
kill him for Shado.

109
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:39,202
Oliver, you don't
know him like do.

110
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,154
Look, if he's
given the chance,

111
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:43,006
then he's going
to turn this around.

112
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,458
He's going to make
Slade think

113
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,825
that it's your fault
that she's dead.

114
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,345
That you chose
to save me instead of her.

115
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,566
You can't give him
that chance.

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,904
Sara...

117
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:00,173
I can't.
You've killed before.

118
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,975
That's not what
you are talking about.

119
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:05,195
You are talking about
executing somebody in cold blood.

120
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:07,847
Look, Slade has the Mirakuru in him.
He's unstable.

121
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:10,884
If he loses control;
If he snaps again,

122
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:12,619
then we're both dead.

123
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:17,791
You have to kill Ivo.

124
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:31,221
Who's thirsty?

125
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:32,372
Where'd
you get that?

126
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:33,873
Who cares?
Let's drink it.

127
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,393
Ahh, this is one of the few
precious pieces of cargo

128
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:38,812
to survive the crash.

129
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:42,265
Billy Wintergreen and I were
planning on saving it for a rainy day

130
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:45,268
but considering,
God willing,

131
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,188
this is our last night
on the island...

132
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,241
To taking
the freighter.

133
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:54,561
To getting off
this island forever.

134
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:57,581
To Shado.

135
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:02,786
Mmm.

136
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:07,340
You know, if something
happens to me tomorrow...

137
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:10,160
You can't
think like that.

138
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,599
If I don't make it...

139
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:18,685
I need you to...

140
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,888
To tell my mom and my sister

141
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,592
that I wasn't that same,

142
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:29,279
stupid kid that got
on that boat.

143
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:36,319
Tell them I was different.

144
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,572
Ok.

145
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:41,408
And if I don't
make it...

146
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,328
Tell my family that I died
on "The Gambit."

147
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,946
Why?

148
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:49,833
Let them remember me
the way that I was.

149
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,792
We should all
get some sleep.

150
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:11,521
I've missed you.

151
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:17,143
Shado?

152
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,732
How are you
still alive?

153
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,551
I'm not alive.

154
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:27,203
Remember?

155
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:29,973
I'm dead.

156
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:33,810
Because you chose Sara over me.

157
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:40,634
Why didn't you choose me?

158
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,802
Why didn't you choose me?

159
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:47,006
Why didn't you choose me?!

160
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:52,279
Rise and shine,
kid. It's time.

161
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:53,278
Glaza zmei!

162
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:57,816
Better luck next
time, Hendrik.

163
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:01,035
You cheat!

164
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,821
He cheats!

165
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:05,640
So do you.

166
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,609
He just cheats better.

167
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:10,512
Get up,
preacher boy.

168
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,715
I said get up,
coward!

169
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:44,863
Ivo wants
to see you.

170
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:47,815
Have faith, my friend.

171
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,817
God will protect you.

172
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,586
There is no God.

173
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,622
If there was...

174
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,157
He's not on this ship.

175
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,658
How is she?

176
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,344
I'm sorry, Anthony.

177
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,512
I wish I had better
news to give you,

178
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:05,516
but her condition is progressing
quicker than we anticipated.

179
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,686
Have you tried
upping her dosage?

180
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:11,189
Twice already,
but we both know

181
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:13,858
modern medicine
has its limitations.

182
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,945
Oh, yes, I know quite well.

183
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:19,564
Thank you, Doctor.

184
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,825
No. No, wait.
Wait, Mr. Ivo.

185
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:33,962
My family is Bratva.
Russian mafia.

186
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,881
They pay millions for me.

187
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:39,584
I'm sorry, I have very
little use for money.

188
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:43,922
I do, however,
require an eye

189
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:46,224
for my research.

190
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,094
Well, we don't have all day.

191
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:26,331
There's a breeze.

192
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,692
They're
on the beach.

193
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:56,494
Take them.

194
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:58,279
Alive.

195
00:13:58,281 --> 00:13:59,797
What about him?

196
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:06,170
They're coming.

197
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:08,456
Two men, armed.

198
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:12,293
You know, when
we first tried

199
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:14,262
to get off
this island,

200
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:17,098
it was as strangers.

201
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,634
But now it's
as brothers.

202
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,973
See you on the freighter.

203
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:40,705
Right over there.

204
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,602
Ohh!

205
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:01,509
You're lucky
Ivo wants you alive.

206
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,166
I told you
I'd come back.

207
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,734
Fantastic.

208
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,786
We're saved.

209
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,386
He likes you.

210
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,706
Don't worry,
he won't bite.

211
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,543
Reverend Thomas Flynn.

212
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,229
Oliver Queen.

213
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:42,617
This is Abraham.

214
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:45,319
I remember you from
before. You escaped.

215
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,822
With that blonde whore.

216
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:50,274
That's Hendrik.
He's a charmer.

217
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,493
Yeah, I hope
she rots in hell.

218
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:55,997
Hey, Sara was a prisoner,
just like all of us.

219
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,399
Right.

220
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:01,752
Funny, I never
heard her scream.

221
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:05,239
How long have you
been here, Thomas?

222
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,291
A little
over a year.

223
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:08,709
I was working
as a missionary

224
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,312
in Maliku, just off
the coast of India.

225
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:13,414
This ship docked
there for supplies,

226
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,916
Dr. Ivo asked me
to come aboard

227
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:19,420
to administer last rites
for a dying man.

228
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:22,306
My mistake.

229
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:23,441
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,443
Don't be.

231
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:28,646
Can you imagine a better place
for a man in my line of work?

232
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,273
Prochnost.

233
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:47,465
Mr. Queen.

234
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,300
Welcome back.

235
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:51,619
My men are still
searching the beach

236
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:53,254
for your friend
and Sara.

237
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,640
They have
the Mirakuru.

238
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:57,808
So...

239
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,394
Where are they?

240
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:02,480
Go to hell.

241
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:05,733
Maybe you'd like
to rethink that.

242
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,809
Ivo...You torture me
all you want to.

243
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:18,496
I am never going
to tell you where they are.

244
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,148
No. Not willingly.

245
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,504
What is that?

246
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,172
Oh, this?

247
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:30,041
See, this is
sodium pentothal.

248
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:33,010
Its more colloquial,
yet very descriptive name,

249
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,495
is truth serum.

250
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:35,880
No, wait, wait!

251
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:38,916
No, no,
I'll tell you everything!

252
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:42,336
Let's begin.

253
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,058
Are you married,
Mr. Wilson?

254
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,160
Do you have
any children?

255
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:51,345
Sadly neither.

256
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:56,284
Well, there must be
someone special in your life.

257
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:59,070
There was.

258
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:01,906
But she passed away
a few years ago.

259
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,407
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:06,060
My mother and I have had
to deal with a lot of loss,

261
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:08,079
unfortunately.

262
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:11,365
And eventually we learned...

263
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,468
That you just have to move on.

264
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,559
I don't believe that.

265
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,844
You know, I heard
that your family

266
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:26,397
has an affinity
with the fine arts.

267
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,683
Yes, my husband
amassed quite the collection

268
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:31,018
of 19th century
American landscapes.

269
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,721
Hmm. I'd love to see them.

270
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:36,524
Maybe another day.

271
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:40,244
We have some family business
that we need to discuss right now.

272
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,947
I'm sorry. My son
seems to have forgotten

273
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,749
all his manners.

274
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:48,035
Let me just get my staff to open up
the rest of the house.

275
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,754
Thank you.

276
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:57,845
Mom?

277
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,263
Ollie?

278
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:00,848
Not yet, kid.

279
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,584
I'm still going to meet
the rest of your family.

280
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:14,129
Hello?

281
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:19,668
Hey, Ollie, have
you and mom talked,

282
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,286
'cause this whole
not speaking thing...

283
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,470
Thea, now is not
a good time.

284
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:23,889
Who's your friend?

285
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:26,308
Slade Wilson.

286
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,009
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

287
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:30,128
I've heard such wonderful
things from your mother.

288
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,930
About me.

289
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:34,849
Thea, what perfect timing.
This is  Slade Wilson, and I--

290
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:36,885
They've met.

291
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:39,287
...was just about
to show him our collection.

292
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,072
But you're far
better suited. Come.

293
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:43,474
Oh.

294
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,495
Senior year, I was
obsessed with art.

295
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:50,815
My teacher made me
bring my entire art history class

296
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,284
over here
to show our pieces.

297
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:54,753
It was exactly
as mortifying as it sounds.

298
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,487
Oh, I'm sure
it wasn't.

299
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,323
But you're a very lucky girl to have
known such privilege.

300
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:01,760
And I am fortunate
to have your entire family here.

301
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:10,435
Oliver.

302
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:15,774
Oliver, what's
your name?

303
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,677
Oliver Jonas Queen.

304
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:25,450
Oliver, where
were you born?

305
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,703
Starling City.

306
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:32,657
Why did you build
a bonfire on the beach?

307
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:36,211
So you'd see it.

308
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,164
I told you.

309
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,250
Was the bonfire
a trap?

310
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:46,054
Not a trap.
It was a...

311
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:49,474
a distraction.

312
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:54,729
How was the bonfire
a distraction?

313
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:59,384
Where are Sara
and Slade right now?

314
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:01,603
Where are they?!

315
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:06,024
They're on the freighter.

316
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:09,911
Where on
the freighter?

317
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:13,415
They're in the engine room

318
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,917
because we have a raft.

319
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,003
Sound the alarm.
I want every man

320
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:19,454
on this freighter
down in that engine room.

321
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:22,740
Search the entire
floor. Go!

322
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:25,794
Oliver Jonas Queen.

323
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:34,936
It'll taste even worse.

324
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:36,754
But it'll work?

325
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:39,441
I spent a year with Anthony Ivo.
I know how he thinks.

326
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:40,608
It'll work.

327
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,427
What is it,
exactly?

328
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:45,563
Cocculus indicus.
It's a natural source of picrotoxin,

329
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,615
which will counteract
effects of barbiturates--

330
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:49,651
like sodium pentothal.

331
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,270
Ivo's favorite. But you still got to
act stoned to sell it.

332
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,940
Lucky for me. Before all this,
I had a lot of practice.

333
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,134
They're
clearing the decks.

334
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:09,637
The top of the ship's
emptying.

335
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,973
Are you ready?

336
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:14,342
You really don't want
an honest answer to that.

337
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:16,311
But you've done
this before, right?

338
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:20,231
Nobody's
done this before!

339
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:36,114
Here, I think
these belong to you.

340
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:37,832
We're on a clock,

341
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,817
and she needs to
free the prisoners.

342
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:42,670
Ivo sent his men to the engine room
just like we planned.

343
00:22:42,672 --> 00:22:45,540
More convenient for me
to take them out.

344
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:48,042
Go find Ivo.

345
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:52,046
He can't get off this ship.
But don't kill him.

346
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:55,517
Son of a bitch is mine.

347
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:02,974
And here we have
a Curtis Swan from 1882.

348
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:06,010
Fun fact about this one-
he actually painted it with his left hand

349
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:09,347
due to severe arthritis.

350
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:11,983
It's absolutely
exquisite.

351
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:15,353
I know. I can't tell you
how many offers we've had

352
00:23:15,355 --> 00:23:17,372
from private collectors for it.

353
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:20,375
But it was
one of dad's favorites.

354
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:22,360
Wasn't it, Ollie?

355
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:25,213
Yes, it was.

356
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:27,999
He loved that one.

357
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,051
Then you must
never sell it.

358
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:34,055
I believe that when
we lose someone we love,

359
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:37,542
we have the obligation
to honor their memory.

360
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,767
Oof.

361
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,186
I think eventually
I'd hit something.

362
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:50,238
Be patient.
Ollie makes it look easy.

363
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,574
Is anyone going
to get that?

364
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,742
I'll take that
as no. No worries.

365
00:23:54,744 --> 00:23:57,495
No matter where I go,
I'm just answering phones.

366
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,564
Hello?

367
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:02,233
Oliver?

368
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:05,503
Well, I do think
we have been butt dialed.

369
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:08,122
And here
is a Joseph Cooper from 1890.

370
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:10,959
Hey, that's Thea.

371
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:13,428
That's gorgeous.

372
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,079
Wait, hold on.

373
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,931
I know that voice.

374
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:21,686
I actually have a painting from his
first solo exhibition in Boston.

375
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:24,005
Oh, God, no.

376
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:25,356
Who is that?

377
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:27,442
His name is Slade Wilson.

378
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:29,604
And unless we stop him,

379
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:32,299
he's going to kill Oliver
and his entire family.

380
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:40,840
We have to move. Now.

381
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,658
Are you sure it was
Slade Wilson?

382
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,793
I thought he was dead.
I'm sure.

383
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:47,162
That's not a voice
I'd ever forget.

384
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:49,582
What's the biggest gun
you got down here?

385
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,201
That might work.

386
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:54,920
Might?

387
00:24:54,922 --> 00:24:57,539
He has
the Mirakuru in him.

388
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,592
So do I.

389
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:02,645
Can I trust you?

390
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,732
I'll be fine.

391
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:08,984
Slade was a trained killer
even before he was injected.

392
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:11,820
You get the chance,
you get a shot, you put him down.

393
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:14,323
Please save Oliver.

394
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,088
Why are you doing this?

395
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,906
I'm with Oliver now.

396
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:32,091
Why should I believe you?

397
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:34,843
Because you don't
want to die! Go!

398
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:48,090
You helped that maniac
torture us.

399
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:12,998
No!

400
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:25,177
Follow me.

401
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:29,464
Where's Ivo?!

402
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:31,466
He's heading to the bridge!

403
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:05,834
Answer the phone.

404
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:08,303
Hello?

405
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:10,773
Jessica,
it's me.

406
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:12,524
Who?

407
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:14,610
It's Anthony.

408
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,912
Anthony.

409
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:19,381
I was married
to a boy named Anthony.

410
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:20,866
I know,
sweetheart.

411
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:22,284
But he went away.

412
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:24,570
I went to find a cure.

413
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:26,872
And I found one,
sweetheart.

414
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:29,191
I found it, and soon,
we're going to be--

415
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:34,296
He was a doctor,
but he went away.

416
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:51,379
It's harder than
it looks, isn't it?

417
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:54,399
Killing an unarmed man.

418
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:57,786
It seemed pretty easy when
you murdered Shado.

419
00:27:57,788 --> 00:27:59,404
I didn't murder her, Oliver.

420
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:00,939
Ivo, you shot
her in the head!

421
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,941
I gave you a choice!

422
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:06,111
You chose Sara.

423
00:28:06,113 --> 00:28:07,946
You blame me,

424
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:10,616
but that's because
you can't face your own guilt

425
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:14,419
I loaded the bullets, yes,
I pulled the trigger.

426
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:17,940
But you...

427
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:20,125
you aimed the gun.

428
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:24,713
And you hold yourself
responsible.

429
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:26,414
Don't you?

430
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,302
Yes.

431
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:34,923
But that doesn't mean
I won't kill you.

432
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:38,110
The question is...

433
00:28:38,112 --> 00:28:41,313
What will he do?

434
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,876
Is it true?

435
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:09,515
Tell me.

436
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:10,550
Slade, I tried
to tell you...

437
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:12,719
Tell him, Oliver.

438
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:16,139
I was angry,
like you are right now.

439
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:18,591
And I wasn't thinking clearly.

440
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,777
Shut up!

441
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:22,478
I acted rashly;
I told him to choose

442
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,164
between Shado and Sara.

443
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,099
Don't listen to him.

444
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,985
He's a monster,
he will say anything.

445
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:30,603
You know that he will!

446
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,488
Tell him I'm lying, Oliver.

447
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,325
Say it.

448
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:38,161
I can explain...

449
00:29:38,163 --> 00:29:41,164
You've known...

450
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,018
Slade...

451
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,355
Please...Ivo.

452
00:30:05,357 --> 00:30:07,106
He's dead.

453
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:10,109
As dead as you are.

454
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:44,560
Aah!

455
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:58,190
How many?

456
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:05,197
This one time,
you can pray for me.

457
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:23,599
Behind you!

458
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:33,609
Ollie! Are you ok?
Where's Slade?

459
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:35,945
He knows!

460
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:45,004
We've got to get off this ship!
No!

461
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,874
Ollie, it's over!
It's over!

462
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:50,626
We've got to go! We can still swim
back to the island.

463
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:53,796
She's right!
We must hurry!

464
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:17,153
Slade, wait...

465
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:27,246
Stop. Don't move.

466
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:30,583
Get in the cell.

467
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:35,605
I do not take orders
from you.

468
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:38,424
I am this ship's Captain.

469
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:44,847
Not anymore.

470
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:53,356
This is my ship now.

471
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:56,859
Any objections?

472
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:09,171
Slade Wilson
is dangerous.

473
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:11,791
No chances, no mistakes.

474
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,294
I'm in position.

475
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:17,329
When Slade comes out,
I'll have the shot.

476
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:19,498
Felicity?

477
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,835
Thermal imaging's
coming up now.

478
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:26,138
They're in
the northwest hall.

479
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,612
Roy, remember, just get
Thea and Moira away from Slade.

480
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:35,197
Don't start a fight,
you'll lose. Ok?

481
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:37,516
Ok.

482
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,485
Let's go.

483
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:05,053
Thank you again

484
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:08,406
for such a wonderful
and insightful tour.

485
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:11,076
You were a remarkable guide.

486
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:12,761
Did you have
a favorite?

487
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:14,896
I found "The Promise"

488
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:17,565
to be particularly
compelling.

489
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,250
Thea, you home?

490
00:34:19,252 --> 00:34:22,704
Roy! I thought I was
meeting you at Verdant.

491
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:25,239
Oh, yeah.

492
00:34:26,392 --> 00:34:28,093
Uh, this is, uh--

493
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:29,094
I'm Roy Harper.

494
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:32,747
Slade Wilson.

495
00:34:32,749 --> 00:34:35,600
That's a particularly firm
handshake you have there, son.

496
00:34:35,602 --> 00:34:37,552
Yeah, you, too.

497
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,311
Ollie.

498
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:49,263
There you are.

499
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:51,816
Sara, we didn't
hear you come in.

500
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:55,120
I didn't want
to interrupt the tour.

501
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:59,574
Mr. Wilson, this is my son's
friend Sara Lance.

502
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:01,459
Of course.

503
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:05,130
You're the girl who came back
from the dead.

504
00:35:05,132 --> 00:35:08,083
Ah, we're just glad
to have her home.

505
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:10,335
Well, I can see.

506
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:12,138
I mean, it's hard
to find that special someone

507
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:14,956
who means
everything to you.

508
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:17,625
You were very lucky.

509
00:35:22,264 --> 00:35:25,150
So...

510
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:29,604
What would you like to do now?

511
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:32,490
Mr. Wilson.

512
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:47,155
Well, I'd hate
to break up the party...

513
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:49,674
But I think
I should be going.

514
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:55,997
I look forward to seeing more
of you, Moira.

515
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:57,832
Oh.

516
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:02,520
And your
lovely family.

517
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:07,341
Dig's got a shot
lined up outside.

518
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:10,061
Mr. Wilson.

519
00:36:10,063 --> 00:36:13,465
May I walk you to your car?

520
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:31,916
Cyrus gold,

521
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:35,703
the men in the skull mask,
all this was you.

522
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:38,506
They worked for you.

523
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,259
Well, I have my allies,

524
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:44,062
just as you have yours.

525
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:46,431
John Diggle, for example.

526
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:50,902
I suppose you're wondering
why he hasn't taken his head shot.

527
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:54,906
Don't worry.

528
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:58,943
He's still alive--for now.

529
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:02,914
Slade.

530
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:09,537
What
do you want?

531
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:21,966
Five years ago,
I made you a promise.

532
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:24,085
Do you remember?

533
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:29,257
Well, I'm here
to fulfill it.

534
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:32,477
I'll see you
around, kid.

535
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,574
We made it!

536
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:49,828
Where's Oliver?

537
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:05,760
I need you
to see something.

538
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:19,190
Ok. Wait.

539
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:22,160
You need me.

540
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:24,162
Ok, you have
the Mirakuru in you.

541
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:26,865
Not just in me.

542
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:36,257
You burned a box
full of dirt.

543
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:39,627
I can help
you understand how it works.

544
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:41,162
I've spent my entire
life studying it, all right?

545
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:43,932
It was you.

546
00:38:43,934 --> 00:38:45,800
You were the one
who killed Shado.

547
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:48,469
No. No, he chose.

548
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:50,838
It was him.

549
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:58,813
Give him your gun.

550
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:03,517
Take it.

551
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,870
And show me...

552
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:07,855
How you killed Shado.

553
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:10,575
Show me!

554
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:19,500
Slade...

555
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:24,722
This isn't you.

556
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:26,925
It's the Mirakuru.

557
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:28,709
And you're sick!

558
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:30,878
I don't care.

559
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,232
I was trying to protect Sara.

560
00:39:34,234 --> 00:39:36,734
But I didn't want Shado to die.

561
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:40,104
I cared for her, too.
You know that I did!

562
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:42,857
I don't care.

563
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,196
You said we were brothers.

564
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:51,899
You said that.

565
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:54,035
Is that how
you did it?

566
00:39:54,037 --> 00:39:56,921
Is that how you pointed
the gun at her?

567
00:39:56,923 --> 00:39:58,539
Yes.

568
00:40:08,885 --> 00:40:11,135
Get him out of here.

569
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:18,059
Why don't you just kill me?

570
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:20,278
To kill you now...

571
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,097
would be a mercy.

572
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,236
You cannot die

573
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:30,771
until you have
suffered...

574
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:34,942
the same way that
I have suffered.

575
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:38,463
Till you have known

576
00:40:38,465 --> 00:40:40,581
complete despair.

577
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:44,118
And you will.

578
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,588
I promise.

579
00:40:55,147 --> 00:40:57,932
Mr. Wilson leave?

580
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:00,568
Yeah.

581
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,938
It's getting pretty late,
I'm going to go, too.

582
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,607
Hmm. Oliver.

583
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:08,910
I know you and I have
our differences,

584
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:11,863
but they hardly excuse
your behavior tonight.

585
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:18,519
If this is the way you're going to act
around me from now on,

586
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:20,654
then don't come by
the house anymore.
