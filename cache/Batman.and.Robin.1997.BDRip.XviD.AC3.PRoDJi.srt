1
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,760
I want a car.

2
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,600
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,440
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,920
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't wait up, Al.

6
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,960
I'll cancel the pizzas.

7
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,640
<i>Batman,</i>

8
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,960
<i>a new villain has commandeered
the Gotham Museum.</i>

9
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,920
<i>He's frozen
the antiquities wing.</i>

10
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,480
<i>He's turned
the security guards into ice.</i>

11
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
<i>He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze."</i>

12
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,800
Mr. Freeze.

13
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,600
Stop! Drop your weapon...

14
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,040
...or we'll shoot!

15
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
The Iceman Cometh.

16
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,480
Please, show some mercy.

17
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,960
Mercy?!

18
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

19
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
In this universe...

20
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,240
...there's only one absolute.

21
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
Everything...

22
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,120
...freezes.

23
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,560
Hi, Freeze.

24
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
I'm Batman.

25
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
You're not sending me to the cooler.

26
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,520
Nice catch.

27
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,080
You break it, you buy it.

28
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

29
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,120
Kill them! Kill them!

30
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,040
Destroy everything!

31
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,040
It's the hockey team from hell.

32
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Get the ice...

33
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,000
...I'll get the Iceman.

34
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Thanks.

35
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,840
Sweet.

36
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,000
I got mine.

37
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,000
Where's yours?

38
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,200
What killed the dinosaurs?

39
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
The Ice Age!

40
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,840
Hit me, boys.

41
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,400
Thanks for playing.

42
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I was hoping you'd drop in.

43
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,800
Watch the numbers...

44
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,360
...for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

45
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Can you feel it coming?

46
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,480
The icy cold of space.

47
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,640
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...

48
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,960
...and beat no more.

49
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,760
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

50
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,360
Freeze, you're mad.

51
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,200
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

52
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
Freeze well.

53
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,400
- Who invited you?
- I was hanging around.

54
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,280
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

55
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,080
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life."

56
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,520
A Batbomb?

57
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
We must blow this up
before it turns Gotham into a crater.

58
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,600
Now what, call a taxi?!

59
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Watch the first step!

60
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Surf's up!

61
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,680
Gotcha!

62
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
Cowabunga!

63
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,960
He's freezing the furnace!

64
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
I got him.

65
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,840
Stay cool...

66
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,400
...Birdboy.

67
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,360
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

68
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,640
Will you chase the villain...

69
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,720
...or save him?

70
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,160
Emotion makes you weak.

71
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
That's why this day is mine.

72
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll kill you next time!

73
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Did we get him?

74
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Drats!

75
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,360
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again...

76
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,400
...but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

77
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,280
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

78
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,800
...these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

79
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,240
I will have given flora...

80
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,800
...a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

81
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,240
Personal note:

82
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,680
My work would proceed faster...

83
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

84
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,160
...back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

85
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
Why won't he let me in the lab?

86
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,000
What is he doing in there?

87
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,920
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations...

88
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,400
...and...

89
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,520
...our mystery bidder...

90
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,520
...may I present...

91
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
...Antonio Diego...

92
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,240
...serial murderer, serving life...

93
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,320
...in prison...

94
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,400
...and sole surviving...

95
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,120
...volunteer.

96
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,680
And what a charmer he is.

97
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,120
By merely drilling three
concentric holes directly...

98
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,000
...into Antonio's cranial cavity...
I have...

99
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,040
...created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...

100
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,760
...the limbic system.

101
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,960
And now I add...

102
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,040
...my Super-Soldier Serum...

103
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,760
...code-named...

104
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,280
..."Venom"...

105
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,520
...to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids...

106
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
...and toxins.

107
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,520
Plug him in.

108
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,120
Time to scream.

109
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,840
Genius!

110
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,160
Behold...

111
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,920
...the ideal killing machine!

112
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,200
I call this little number...

113
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,760
..."Bane."

114
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Bane of Humanity!

115
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,200
Imagine it.

116
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,480
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

117
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
Bidding begins at a mere...

118
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,520
...10 million!

119
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,640
Turbo!

120
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,800
Show off for Daddy.

121
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,200
Dr. Isley.

122
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,640
Welcome to my parlor.

123
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
What?

124
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,480
You monster!

125
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,200
How could you?!

126
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,600
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

127
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,800
He cut the funding for our work.

128
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,800
Without your research...

129
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,480
...I couldn't have come this far.

130
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,520
Join me.

131
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,840
The two of us,
entwined, side by side.

132
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Join you?

133
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,840
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

134
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,320
...and now you...

135
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
...corrupt my research...

136
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,440
...into some maniacal scheme for
world domination.

137
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,040
When I get through...

138
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,720
...you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

139
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,280
Do you hear me?!

140
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,560
You psycho!

141
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,920
Well...

142
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,000
...I can respect your opinion.

143
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,760
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

144
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,960
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

145
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,320
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

146
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,040
...deep into the earth
you love so much!

147
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,760
Bye-bye, dear!

148
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,600
Fellow maniacs...

149
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,360
...bidding...

150
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,200
...begins!

151
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,280
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago.

152
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,280
Dr. Victor Fries...

153
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,600
...2- time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology.

154
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
After his wife
contracted a rare disease...

155
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,640
...Macgregor's Syndrome...

156
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,880
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

157
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,600
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

158
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,440
That's got to hurt.

159
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,920
That liquid is 50 below.

160
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,080
But, he survived somehow.

161
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,240
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

162
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,280
- What happened to his wife?
- No one knows.

163
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,880
She's presumed dead.

164
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,960
Freeze needs
extreme cold to survive.

165
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,880
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

166
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,080
If it's ice the Iceman wants...

167
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,360
Coming, sir.

168
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,120
Yes, sir?

169
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,000
We need the Wayne diamonds.

170
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,880
We going to trap a snowman?

171
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,520
Yes, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

172
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,960
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

173
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,120
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

174
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

175
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,680
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

176
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,480
How indeed?

177
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,040
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

178
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,440
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

179
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,440
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

180
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,760
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

181
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,680
Despite all your talents...

182
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,920
...you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

183
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,880
Master Dick...

184
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
...follows the same star as you...

185
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,480
...but gets there by his own course.

186
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,640
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

187
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
I trust you, Alfred.

188
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,680
But I shan't be here forever.

189
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,800
Good night, Master Bruce.

190
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,280
Good night, Alfred.

191
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,960
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

192
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,440
Good gracious, what a tumble.

193
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,720
There's a brave boy.

194
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,200
Yes, sir.

195
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,200
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

196
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,440
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now.

197
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,280
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

198
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,280
Dr. Isley?

199
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
Pamela?

200
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,360
You look great.

201
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Especially for a dead woman.

202
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,840
Hello, Jason.

203
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,680
I think I've had a change of heart.

204
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
Or quite...

205
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,560
...literally...

206
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,480
...the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

207
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,200
They replaced my blood with aloe...

208
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,320
...my skin with chlorophyll...

209
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,040
...and filled...

210
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,960
...my lips...

211
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,040
...with venom.

212
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,320
And, Jason, one other thing.

213
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,680
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier...

214
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
...I'm...

215
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,800
...poison.

216
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,960
It's a jungle in here.

217
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
I am Nature's arm...

218
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,440
...her spirit...

219
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,080
...her will!

220
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,640
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

221
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,720
And the time has come...

222
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,720
...for plants to take back...

223
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,600
...the world so rightfully ours...

224
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,240
...because it's not nice...

225
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,000
...to fool with Mother Nature.

226
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,920
"Wayne Enterprises."

227
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,040
Coming, Bane, darling.

228
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,200
We've got a plane to catch.

229
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,920
<i>I'm Mr. Icicle</i>

230
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,960
<i>I'm Mr. Ten Below</i>

231
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,520
Sing! Sing!

232
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,760
Come on, sing!

233
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,240
Louder! Come on!

234
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,240
Sing! Sing! Sing!

235
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,120
<i>He's Mr. White Christmas</i>

236
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,800
Louder!

237
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,000
<i>He's Mr. Icicle</i>

238
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,360
Freezy...

239
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,520
...I'm feeling hot.

240
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,560
I find that unlikely.

241
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,600
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry...

242
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,880
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.

243
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,560
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

244
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,760
Let's heat things up.

245
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

246
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,360
Talk about your cold shoulder.

247
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,600
Frosty!

248
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,960
Yeah, boss?

249
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,240
Energy.

250
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,840
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

251
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
But...

252
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,880
...I was successful nevertheless.

253
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,280
Absolutely, boss.

254
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,960
One more giant diamond of this size...

255
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,000
...and my freezing engine
will be complete.

256
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,440
I will freeze the city.

257
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,600
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

258
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,080
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

259
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,960
...it's winter forever
in Gotham.

260
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,880
The city fathers
will have no choice...

261
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,840
...but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

262
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
...so I can find a cure.

263
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,600
Leave us.

264
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,880
Sure, boss.

265
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,960
We need quality time.

266
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,640
Soon we will be together
once more.

267
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,080
Soon.

268
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,240
I'll get it.

269
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,800
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

270
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,520
No apology necessary.

271
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,400
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.

272
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,520
Please be looking for me.

273
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,560
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

274
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,400
Uncle Alfred!

275
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,920
My dear.

276
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,800
Oh, my dear...

277
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,360
...what a most wonderful surprise.

278
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,400
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

279
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,280
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

280
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,800
Uncle?

281
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,320
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

282
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,120
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.

283
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,560
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

284
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,440
- You have?
- Secrets, Al?

285
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,600
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

286
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,400
Don't you think, sir?

287
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,760
I'm on break from-

288
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,880
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.

289
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,920
The new computer sciences division.

290
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,960
- How'd you know?
- Says so on the patch on your sweater.

291
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,240
- What is it? It's beautiful.
- You can say that again.

292
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,440
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.

293
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,880
I'll show you how to ride it.

294
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,800
You certainly will not!

295
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,480
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

296
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,760
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

297
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,840
Oh, I don't know.

298
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,080
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

299
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,000
...yeah, I'd love to.

300
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,880
Then it's settled.

301
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,440
But, sir, we...

302
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,840
...we do get so busy here.

303
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,080
Don't be silly.

304
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,840
After all, she's family.

305
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,520
Uncle Alfred?

306
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,320
I came to tuck you in.

307
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,720
You came to tuck me in?

308
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
That's quite a switch.

309
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,320
What're you working on?

310
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,880
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

311
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,840
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

312
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,880
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

313
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,800
It travels through India.

314
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
I remember Mom getting postcards.

315
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,960
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

316
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,320
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

317
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,440
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

318
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,120
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

319
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,080
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

320
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,320
Peg?

321
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,040
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

322
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,720
It's good to see you again.

323
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,640
I've missed you.

324
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,520
As I have you.

325
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,240
Sleep well, child.

326
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,960
You sleep.

327
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
Go to bed.

328
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,320
<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

329
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,080
<i>It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory...</i>

330
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,600
<i>... where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises...</i>

331
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,560
<i>... is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.</i>

332
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,080
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

333
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,200
And step on it.

334
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,440
Step.

335
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,360
<i>My father told me, "To succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it. "</i>

336
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,120
<i>So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...</i>

337
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,360
<i>... to Gotham's
Observatory Restoration Project.</i>

338
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,760
<i>With any luck...</i>

339
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,760
...this telescope will give
future generations a chance...

340
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,920
...to follow their own stars.

341
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,160
Brucy...

342
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,200
...is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

343
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,000
Yes. If you'll watch
these monitors right here.

344
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,480
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

345
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,120
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth...

346
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,960
...and through this
intricate network of satellites...

347
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,320
...reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

348
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,760
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

349
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,400
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison...

350
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,080
...have been going out forever.

351
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,400
Are you going to tie the knot?

352
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,360
Marriage?

353
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,440
Marriage?

354
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,800
You want to give me a hand here?

355
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,400
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

356
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,120
And that's most certainly
enough for us... for now.

357
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,360
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

358
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,320
You're a lot of help.

359
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,360
Miss, you need to stop.

360
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,760
Move, fascist bulldog!

361
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,040
- You need an appointment-
- No, I don't!

362
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,040
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

363
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
She has no pass, sir.

364
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,200
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss-?

365
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,960
Dr. Pamela Isley.

366
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,280
Doctor...

367
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,920
...what can I do for you?

368
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,400
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

369
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,160
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America.

370
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,840
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

371
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,560
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

372
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,840
I see you knew him.

373
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,920
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

374
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
I have here a proposal showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

375
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,240
...cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

376
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,640
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth...

377
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
...our mother, our womb.

378
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,480
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

379
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,160
And yet, you spoil her lands...

380
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
...poison her oceans...

381
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
...blacken her skies!

382
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,640
You're killing her!

383
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,080
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat...

384
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,920
...no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.

385
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,720
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

386
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,760
People come first, Dr. Isley.

387
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,880
Mammals!

388
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,600
A day of reckoning is coming.

389
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,840
That's right.

390
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,600
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

391
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,560
...crawl from the primordial soup...

392
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,880
...will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

393
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,840
You must be new in town.

394
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,960
In Gotham City...

395
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,360
...Batman and Robin protect us...

396
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,080
...even from plants and flowers.

397
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

398
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,000
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

399
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,640
...a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

400
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,280
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

401
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,040
Thank you all for coming.

402
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,440
Good day, Doctor.

403
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,560
Batman and Robin...

404
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,360
...militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

405
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,640
...animal protectors of the status quo.

406
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,080
First...

407
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,800
...I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

408
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
And then Gotham...

409
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,560
...will be mine...

410
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,440
...for the greening.

411
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,040
Excuse me, chief.

412
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,800
I got something here
you might want to see.

413
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,040
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

414
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,720
One more diamond, my love.

415
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,320
One more.

416
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,520
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds."

417
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,080
Very nice.

418
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,560
Ladies and gentlemen...

419
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,560
...Gossip Gerty
of "Good Morning Gotham" and I...

420
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,760
...welcome you
to the gem of the evening.

421
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,080
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

422
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,760
...displaying...

423
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,200
...the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan...

424
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,760
...from the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

425
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,480
Think Freeze will take the bait?

426
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,160
He'll be here.

427
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,480
...to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...

428
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,120
...the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

429
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,240
Let's start the bidding!

430
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,160
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

431
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,360
20,000 for the tiger lily!

432
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,440
And I bid...

433
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,240
...30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

434
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,040
Boys, please...

435
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,040
...let's show some gusto!

436
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,200
Hi, there.

437
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,040
And you are?

438
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,040
Poison...

439
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,720
...Poison Ivy.

440
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,480
Why not send junior home early?

441
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,040
I've got some wild oats to sow.

442
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,360
On the other hand...

443
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,320
...youth does have its advantages.

444
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,480
Endurance, stamina.

445
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,360
Forget the geriatric Bat.

446
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,120
Come, join me.

447
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,480
My garden needs tending.

448
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,360
I'll take it from here, pal.

449
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,600
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

450
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,560
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

451
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,680
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

452
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,680
I'll bring everything you see here...

453
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,080
...plus everything you don't.

454
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,600
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

455
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,400
100,000!

456
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,880
And I'll bid...

457
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,160
...500,000 dollars!

458
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,040
One million dollars.

459
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,760
- 2 million.
- You don't have it. 3 million.

460
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

461
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,440
5 million.

462
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,160
That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

463
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,320
6 million.

464
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,360
7 million.

465
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,160
Never leave the cave without it.

466
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,760
You boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?

467
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,120
All right, everyone!
Chill.

468
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,200
Chill.

469
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,040
Get the gun!

470
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,840
Look at you!

471
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,840
Let me guess.

472
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,640
Plant Girl?

473
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,720
Vine Lady?

474
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,600
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...

475
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,520
...or I'll turn you into mulch.

476
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,720
Pheromone dust...

477
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,880
...designed to heat...

478
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,400
...a man's blood.

479
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,160
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

480
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,080
If you insist.

481
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,840
Clever little clover.

482
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,840
That's my exit cue.

483
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,480
Thanks.

484
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,480
Good night.

485
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,120
Cool party!

486
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,560
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

487
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,600
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

488
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,920
That's not a man...

489
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,000
...that is a god.

490
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,720
Enough monkey business.

491
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,680
We've got work to do.

492
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,040
Monkey work.

493
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,040
You can't make the jump.

494
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,320
I can!

495
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,680
Pull back!

496
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,120
I can make it!

497
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,840
Redbird control codes.

498
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,960
Disable engine.

499
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,960
Don't do it to me!

500
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,120
We won't make it!

501
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,280
It's a cold town.

502
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,840
I could've made that jump.

503
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,800
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

504
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,600
The Flying Graysons were a team.

505
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,680
We had to trust each to do his job.

506
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,800
That's what being partners is about.

507
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,320
Counting on someone is the way to win.

508
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,720
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.

509
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,360
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

510
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,240
That's your idea of friendship?

511
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,960
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

512
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,680
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

513
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,920
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

514
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,320
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

515
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,920
This is no partnership.

516
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,600
You're never going to trust me!

517
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,800
Dear brother Wilfred...

518
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,080
...I have tried
every address I know for you.

519
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,640
I'm just praying this reaches you.

520
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,880
We have very little time.

521
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,160
Batman monopolized the evening news.

522
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,840
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

523
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,520
Thanks.
Thank you.

524
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,480
Is there something wrong, sir?

525
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,080
Am I pig-headed?

526
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,120
Is it always...

527
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,200
...my way or the highway?

528
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,240
Why, yes.
Actually.

529
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,960
Death and chance stole your parents...

530
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,160
...but rather than become a victim...

531
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,160
...you have done everything
in your power to control the fates.

532
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,680
For what is Batman...

533
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,400
...if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

534
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,120
An attempt to control...

535
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,920
...death itself?

536
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,440
But I can't, can I?

537
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,760
None of us can.

538
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,920
Sorry. So sorry!

539
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,520
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

540
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,880
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

541
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,520
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

542
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,400
Couldn't resist.

543
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,880
It's just so beautiful.

544
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,520
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.

545
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,800
All right?

546
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,120
Sorry.

547
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,560
Sorry.
Good night.

548
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,200
Drag him into the cold beam.

549
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,840
Welcome home, Frost Face.

550
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,920
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

551
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,600
Allow me to break the ice.

552
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,920
My name is Freeze.

553
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,880
Learn it well...

554
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,840
...for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

555
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,520
All right, Freezie, you can't live
outside the cold zone.

556
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,280
Look at him stew.

557
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,640
Get used to it.

558
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,600
You're going to be here a very long...

559
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,480
...long time.

560
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,320
Sadly...

561
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,800
...you will not live to see it.

562
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,640
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more resistant...

563
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,080
...to my love dust
than expected.

564
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,120
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

565
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,280
They'll literally be dying for me.

566
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,320
"Turkish baths."

567
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,360
This looks promising.

568
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,320
A fixer-upper.

569
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,960
But with a certain homey charm.

570
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,840
A minus!

571
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,800
Current tenants.

572
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,800
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

573
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,680
Hello, yourself.

574
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,800
You look good enough to eat.

575
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,200
That I am.

576
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,440
Come and get me,
if you can.

577
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,720
With pleasure.

578
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,800
Let's redecorate.

579
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,720
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

580
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,760
What is this floor?

581
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,760
It took God seven days...

582
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,000
...to create Paradise.

583
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,080
Let's see if I can do better.

584
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,200
Good babies.

585
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,680
Grow for mommy.

586
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,880
Bane, darling...

587
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,320
...I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

588
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,600
A cool customer, yes.

589
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,480
Icy demeanor...

590
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,480
...no question.

591
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,840
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...

592
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,880
...to my advantage.

593
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,200
Honey, clean up this mess.

594
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,280
We've got company coming.

595
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,000
Honey.

596
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,760
Company.

597
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,920
We've been going out
for over a year now, and...

598
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,440
Okay, here it goes.

599
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,880
I want to spend my life with you.

600
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,680
I'm not the marrying kind.

601
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,640
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

602
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,800
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

603
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,440
You've had your wild nights.

604
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,520
"Wild" doesn't...

605
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,720
...quite cover it.

606
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,640
You'll make someone
a good husband one day...

607
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,320
...but I can't wait forever.

608
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,960
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do...

609
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,080
...you'll just shut down.

610
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,000
I know the way you are.

611
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,240
Think about it.

612
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,560
Just promise me you'll think about it.

613
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,240
Okay?

614
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,400
You don't have to answer now.

615
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,800
Just...

616
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,240
...think it over.

617
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,200
Here's food for thought.

618
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,480
Who's Ivy?

619
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,440
You just called me "Ivy."

620
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,960
Who's Ivy?

621
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,440
I wish I knew.

622
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,840
Enhance detail, 14 to 19.

623
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,480
Who are you?

624
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,000
Gotcha!

625
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,640
Banker, how much coin to play?

626
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,880
21/2.

627
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,840
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run 2 nights ago!

628
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
That'd be me.

629
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,480
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

630
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,480
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

631
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,160
- Want a side bet?
- How much?

632
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,000
- How much you got?
- How much you got?

633
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,280
All right, let's race! Come on!

634
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,080
Just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge.

635
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,480
You got it, Spike!

636
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,800
Out of my way, losers!

637
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,240
Nice try, girlie!

638
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,640
You're next!

639
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,000
Excuse me!

640
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,880
Look out, baby!

641
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,200
Not bad, for a chick!

642
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,120
Now!

643
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,480
End of the line, sweetheart!

644
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,400
So this is where you hang out.

645
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,000
How long you been racing?

646
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,120
Since my parents died.

647
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,120
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

648
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,000
Made the pain go away.

649
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,120
You wouldn't understand.

650
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,720
You'd be surprised.

651
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:36,520
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge so...

652
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,120
...they kicked me out.

653
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,880
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

654
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
Don't say you want to join the circus.

655
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,960
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

656
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,400
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.

657
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,600
What are you talking about?

658
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,440
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing...

659
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,960
...it's really ridiculous.

660
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,320
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...

661
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,880
...and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

662
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,960
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

663
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,120
Paying someone to prepare your meals...

664
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,080
...do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

665
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,640
Alfred's happy.

666
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,240
Happy?

667
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,160
You honestly don't know, do you?

668
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,760
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

669
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,760
Alfred's sick.

670
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,040
Alfred's not sick.

671
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,640
He's dying.

672
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,400
Dying?

673
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,080
Why didn't he tell us?

674
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,200
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

675
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,480
But I can tell.

676
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,000
I can't believe it.

677
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,280
I know.

678
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,680
Icehead, you got a visitor.

679
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,520
Your sister is here to see you.

680
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,880
Sister?

681
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,680
Brother, dear...

682
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,440
...I heard you were blue.

683
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,920
Don't mind us, ma'am.

684
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,000
You can speak freely.

685
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,960
I don't mind you at all.

686
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,960
Men...

687
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,920
...the most absurd of God's creatures.

688
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,400
We give you life...

689
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,320
...and we can take it away
just as easily.

690
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,640
- Right!
- Whatever.

691
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,400
I really am to die for.

692
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,640
Impressive!

693
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,880
Well, I, my most
unabominable snowman...

694
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,720
...have been impressed by you.

695
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,280
In fact...

696
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,800
...I propose a pairing.

697
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,520
I've come to set you free.

698
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,200
An enticing offer...

699
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,800
...but...

700
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,040
...what does the lady want in return?

701
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,000
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

702
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,360
His name is Bane.

703
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,920
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

704
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,480
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

705
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,600
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

706
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,400
I'm running on empty.

707
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,080
I need the diamonds.

708
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,320
I'll help you grab your rocks.

709
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,600
Bane...

710
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,000
...dear...

711
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,720
...an exit, please.

712
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,000
Reinforced steel.

713
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,280
Not good.

714
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,960
Always winterize your pipes.

715
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,240
While I get my diamonds,
you and "meatloaf" retrieve my wife.

716
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,440
You never mentioned a wife!

717
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,560
Come on.

718
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,560
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

719
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,160
Alfred, are you well?

720
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,880
As well as can be expected, sir.

721
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,400
My friend, I know you're sick.

722
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,320
I can get you the best doctors.

723
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,080
I have seen the best doctors.

724
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,000
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized.

725
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:42,480
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce.

726
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,080
Have you ever...

727
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,680
...regretted your life working here?

728
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,840
Looking after heroes?

729
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,280
No, sir.

730
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,160
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

731
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,840
Not all the heroes wear masks.

732
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,080
Freeze has escaped!

733
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,800
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera.

734
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,200
Poison Ivy.

735
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,760
2 nights ago...

736
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,840
...Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America.

737
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,040
They put 10 security guards
in the hospital...

738
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:43,600
...left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

739
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,960
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze.

740
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,480
Excuse me, gentlemen.

741
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,720
Poison Ivy...
why would she help Freeze?

742
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,400
She's definitely evil.

743
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,280
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love-

744
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,560
I know, then the feeling vanished.

745
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,960
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.

746
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,400
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

747
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,280
Well, I'm totally over her.

748
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,120
Me too. Definitely.

749
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,120
- Great stems, though.
- Buds too.

750
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,240
Those are nice.

751
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,480
Here we go.

752
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,520
It's Nora Fries.

753
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,000
She's still alive.

754
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,080
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

755
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,800
He found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

756
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,720
There she is.

757
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,200
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue the bride.

758
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,480
We'll meet back at my place.

759
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,480
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the Bat and Bird.

760
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,080
You leave those boys to me.

761
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,480
Go!

762
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,520
- Can he save her?
- Her case is too advanced.

763
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,040
But maybe someday...

764
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,800
...with more research...

765
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,320
Poison Ivy.

766
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,080
I hate uninvited guests.

767
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,520
My lungs are freezing!

768
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,880
Chilled...

769
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,200
...to perfection.

770
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,080
No beauty.

771
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,400
Just the beast.

772
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,520
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

773
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,560
Give yourself up. If you surrender-

774
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:25,840
To you?

775
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,680
Polly want a kiss?

776
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,720
There's something about
an anatomically correct...

777
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,840
...rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips.

778
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,400
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

779
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,480
Enough...

780
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,200
...sweet talk.

781
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,200
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jail.

782
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,760
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

783
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,160
That's why every Poison Ivy
Action Figure comes with him!

784
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,280
Try not to make a mess when you die.

785
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,120
Hold it right there!

786
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,200
Stop!

787
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,920
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad Bat.

788
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,920
You don't need him.

789
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,720
You're the star.

790
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,640
I can see it now:

791
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,840
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

792
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,560
Let me guide you.

793
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,640
Let me kiss you.

794
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,240
Stop! Don't kiss her.

795
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,600
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

796
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,320
- What are you saying?
- Why does she want to kiss us?

797
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,800
- I bet her lips are poisoned.
- Poisoned kiss?

798
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,320
You have issues with women!

799
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,840
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

800
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,120
Something would be mine, not yours.

801
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,200
Exit, Bane.

802
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,040
Exit!

803
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,040
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

804
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,880
I'm going solo!

805
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,480
What happened?

806
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,280
How'd they get away?

807
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,840
I've never been good with competition.

808
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,800
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

809
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,600
Make yourself right at home.

810
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,080
Where's my wife?

811
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,440
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.

812
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,000
- She's dead.
- You lie!

813
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,320
I'm sorry.

814
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,280
Their bones will turn to ice!

815
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,920
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

816
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,040
Kill them, of course.

817
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,040
But why stop there?

818
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,360
Why should only
Batman and Robin die...

819
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,800
...while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

820
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,640
Yes!

821
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,920
If I must suffer...

822
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,920
...humanity will suffer with me!

823
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:31,800
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

824
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,640
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

825
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,040
First...

826
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,640
...Gotham.

827
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,200
And then...

828
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,720
...the world!

829
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,800
Just what I had in mind.

830
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,080
Everything dead on Earth except us.

831
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,720
A chance for...

832
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,640
...Mother Nature to start again.

833
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:56,840
Behold...

834
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,640
...the dawn of a new age.

835
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,000
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

836
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,000
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

837
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,680
And we shall rule them.

838
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,720
For we will be...

839
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,400
...the only two people
left in the world.

840
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,840
Yes.

841
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,440
Adam...

842
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,120
...and Evil.

843
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,640
You distract the Bat and Bird...

844
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,280
...while I prepare...

845
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,760
...to freeze...

846
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,360
...Gotham!

847
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,240
It's Stage 1 of Macgregor's Syndrome.

848
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,840
I'm sorry.

849
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,640
All we can do is
make him comfortable.

850
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,360
Thank you, Doctor.

851
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,440
Macgregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had.

852
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,480
Alfred's condition is less severe.
Fries' research said...

853
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,040
...he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

854
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,040
No one else is even close.

855
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,720
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone.

856
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,080
- Like hell you do.
- Don't push me right now.

857
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,400
Or what? No one can
capture Ivy but the big, bad Bat?

858
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,320
Right.

859
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,280
You want her for yourself.

860
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,960
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

861
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,000
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

862
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,480
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

863
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,000
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

864
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,760
- You're not thinking straight.
- But I am.

865
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,640
For the first time in a long time.

866
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,240
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

867
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,320
I'm tired of living
in your shadow.

868
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,680
All that ends now.

869
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,280
I'm sorry, Uncle.

870
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,160
I was too late.

871
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,160
You must do something for me.

872
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,080
Find my brother, Wilfred...

873
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,680
...your uncle,
wherever he is, and give him...

874
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,920
...this.

875
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,760
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

876
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,440
Only family can be trusted.

877
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,480
What is it?

878
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,280
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

879
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,440
...whom I have the honor
of calling "son."

880
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,480
Take it to Wilfred...

881
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,200
...and I implore you...

882
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,480
...never open it.

883
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,680
You look so like your mother.

884
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,760
<i>Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.</i>

885
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,800
<i>Everyone who's anyone...</i>

886
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,640
...has flocked to the observatory...

887
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,800
...and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

888
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,760
And here's the man
of the hour himself...

889
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,920
...Bruce Wayne.

890
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,120
Excuse me.

891
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,800
Commissioner.

892
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,400
- How are you?
- Good. You know Julie?

893
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,800
How are you?

894
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,240
Good to see you.

895
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,640
Young man.

896
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,960
Lovely to see you again.

897
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,160
Thank you.

898
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,320
Commissioner Gordon...

899
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,400
...I've always wondered...

900
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,200
...where does that big,
old Batlight come from?

901
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,200
Why...

902
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,160
...it's...

903
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,400
...on top of Police Headquarters.

904
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,440
I'd just...

905
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,200
...love to see it.

906
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,800
But you probably don't have access.

907
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,160
Why, dear lady...

908
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,520
...I am the police commissioner.

909
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,560
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

910
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,200
Would you like to see it?

911
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,880
Who are you, dear lady?

912
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,400
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

913
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,200
No, I'm not.

914
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,720
Please...

915
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,480
...come back.

916
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,880
What are you doing? Come on.

917
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,920
Show me how the satellites work.

918
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:29,840
First...

919
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,040
...I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard...

920
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,040
...then...

921
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,080
...I will pull Batman's heart
from his body...

922
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,840
...and feel it freeze in my hands.

923
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,080
Revenge!

924
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,000
Quickly, Bane.

925
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,360
Quickly now.

926
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,280
Let there be light.

927
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,640
Only family can be trusted?

928
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,560
I'm family.

I spend my entire life
trying to beat back death.

932
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,200
Everything I've done,
everything I'm...

933
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,760
...capable of doing...

934
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,960
But I can't save you.

935
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,960
There's no defeat in death...

936
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,120
...Master Bruce.

937
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,360
Victory comes in defending...

938
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,680
...what we know is right...

939
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,480
...while we still live.

940
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,040
I love you, old man.

941
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,120

<i>Access allowed.</i>

947
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,840
The combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals...

948
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,040
...will complete...

949
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,840
...my freezing engine.

950
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,080
No matter
what they tell you, Mr. Bane...

951
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,840
...it is the size of
your gun that counts.

952
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,160
Where are you going?

953
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,160
It's not a Batlight, it's a Robin signal.
Ivy's calling me.

954
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,480
Her name's Pamela Isley.

955
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:59,360
She must've stolen Gordon's keys
and changed the signal.

956
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,880
She did it for me, for love.

957
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,840
She infected us with pheromones.

958
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,280
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

959
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,600
She wants to kill you.

960
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,360
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

961
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,040
To keep her for yourself.

962
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,080
You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

963
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,600
Sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

964
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,760
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.

965
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,800
So I'm asking you...

966
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,560
...friend, partner...

967
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,760
...brother...

968
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,520
...will you trust me now?

969
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,000
- All the crystals are in place.
- Thank you.

970
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,320
Hi!

971
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,280
I'm sorry about the door.

972
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,360
Is the party over?

973
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,160
Who is this nutball?

974
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,640
If revenge...

975
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,120
...is a dish best served cold...

976
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,000
...then put on your Sunday finest.

977
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,600
It's time...

978
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,520
...to feast!

979
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,680
Tonight...

01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,720

<i>I expected you might find

<i>... and created a virtual simulation.</i>

<i>I anticipated you would...</i>

991
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,160
<i>... and took the liberty
to create something in your size.</i>

992
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,440
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

993
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,240
Hi there.

01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,840
Is your thumb the
only part of you that's green?

995
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,000
You will just have to find out.

996
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,400
I want us to be together, but...

997
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,080
...you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

998
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:53,680
I need a sign...

999
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,680
How about "Slippery when wet."

1000
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,000
...of trust.

1001
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,840
Tell me your plan.

1002
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,480
Kiss me and I'll tell you.

1003
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,240
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

1004
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:10,200
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

1005
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,000
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

1006
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,640
I've got to stop him.

1007
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,920
One kiss...

1008
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,160
...my love.

1009
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,640
For luck.

1010
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,880
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

1011
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,600
Time to die, little Robin.

1012
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,880
I hate to disappoint you, but...

1013
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,360
...rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

1014
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,520
See you!

1015
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,040
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

1016
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,360
Sorry...

1017
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,080
...my vines have a crush on you.

1018
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,800
Got to go.

1019
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,280
So many people to kill,
so little time.

1020
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,000
You're about to become compost.

1021
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,960
Using feminine wiles
to get what you want?

1022
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,120
Trading on your looks?

1023
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,160
Read a book.

1024
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,680
That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

1025
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,840
You give women a bad name.

1026
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:09,000
As I told Lady Fries,
when I pulled her plug...

1027
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,160
...this is a one-woman show.

1028
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,880
I don't think so.

1029
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:34,720
Curses!

1030
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,920
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1031
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,240
I know.

1032
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,360
And you are?

1033
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,600
Batgirl.

1034
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,200
That's not P.C. What about
Batperson or Batwoman?

1035
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,720
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the Batcave.

1036
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,320
We must change the locks.

1037
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,600
- She knows who we are.
- We must kill her.

1038
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,000
Later. We have work to do.

1039
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,320
Let's kick some ice.

1040
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,920
We have 11 minutes
to thaw the city.

1041
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,400
Gotcha!

1042
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,320
Now!

1043
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,840
Shield.

1044
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,120
I'll finish off the city.

1045
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,480
You kill the kids, but...

1046
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,880
...leave me the Bat.

1047
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,520
No sign of the snowman.

1048
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:26,960
Maybe he melted.

1049
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,200
No, he's just hibernating.

1050
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,400
These heaters will thaw them.

1051
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,160
I hope you've got
10 million more of those toys.

1052
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,600
8 minutes
and they're ice cubes forever.

1053
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,360
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.

1054
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,920
Sunrise isn't for 5 hours.

1055
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:03,600
Here.

1056
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,120
It's morning in the Congo.

1057
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:06,320
We'll relay sunlight-

1058
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,680
From below the equator-

1059
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:10,440
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but...

1060
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,560
Damn!

1061
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,240
Damn?
Damn's not good.

1062
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:16,000
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.

1063
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,680
I realign, you thaw the mirrors.

1064
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,240
Tonight's forecast:

1065
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,280
A freeze is coming.

1066
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,440
Bye-bye.

1067
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,080
I got you!

1068
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,280
No.
I got you.

1069
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,480
It's one of those days!

1070
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,960
Dirty fighter!

1071
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:50,640
The tube!

1072
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:05,760
Yay, Batman!

1073
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,280
Hey, Freeze.

1074
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,440
The heat is on.

1075
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,000
You all right down there?

1076
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,480
Here goes.

1077
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,440
Hang on.

1078
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,600
You're doing it!

1079
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:26,480
You've lost, Freeze.

1080
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:27,960
I think not.

1081
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,840
Bombs away, Batman.

1082
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,560
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1083
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,960
What should we do now?

1084
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,000
Pray.

1085
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,040
Hang on!

1086
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,600
Grab on to my belt!

1087
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,080
Thank you, Batman!

1088
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,080
Need a ride?

1089
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,200
- Most of Gotham's still frozen.
- It's midnight.

1090
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:19,040
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

1091
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,120
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

1092
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:23,240
I'm on it.

1093
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,120
No, I'm on it.

1094
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,200
Have to do it upside down.

1095
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,880
Men!
Everything the hard way.

1096
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,280
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

1097
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,240
Watch and learn, little boy.

1098
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:49,360
They say it'll be a beautiful day.

1099
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,240
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum.

1100
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,800
Go on.

1101
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,920
Kill me too.

1102
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:06,680
Just as you killed my wife.

1103
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,440
I didn't kill your wife.

1104
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:17,160
<i>As I told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...</i>

1105
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,720
<i>... this is a one-woman show.</i>

1106
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,640
But she's not dead.

1107
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,640
We found her,
restored her.

1108
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,280
She's still frozen alive...

1109
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,280
...waiting for you to find a cure.

1110
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,120
She lives?

1111
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:42,480
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

1112
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,560
But to give life...

1113
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,760
...that's true power.
A power you once had.

1114
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,680
She's alive.

1115
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,680
So I'm asking you.

1116
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,200
Victor Fries...

1117
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,840
...help me save another life.

1118
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,120
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome Stage 1.

1119
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,240
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

1120
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:13,120
He's still inside you, Victor.

1121
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,120
Buried...

1122
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,400
...deep beneath the snow.

1123
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,520
Will you help me...

1124
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:23,600
...Doctor?

1125
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,680
Take 2 of these...

1126
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,760
...and call me in the morning.

1127
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,440
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham.

1128
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:07,920
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

1129
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,680
All we can do now is wait...

1130
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,240
...and hope.

1131
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,160
He loves me.

1132
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,360
He loves me not.

1133
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,160
He loves me.

1134
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,040
Not!

1135
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,280
Surprise.

1136
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,400
I'm your new cellmate.

1137
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,760
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

1138
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,640
Prepare...

1139
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,600
...for a bitter harvest.

1140
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,280
Winter...

1141
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,520
...has come at last.

1142
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,080
Are you?

1143
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:22,840
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1144
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,040
And quite well, it seems!

1145
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:26,800
Thanks to you, son.

1146
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,120
Thanks to you all.

1147
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:30,840
Well done, Bruce.

1148
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,200
You too.
Well done.

1149
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,960
I got one question.

1150
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:39,840
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1151
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,120
It's the first time I've fallen
and you weren't there.

1152
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:44,000
I figured you could handle it.

1153
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:48,680
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1154
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,240
Excuse me.

1155
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,760
I'm the one who
kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1156
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,000
Yeah, that was me.

1157
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:57,480
I did it all by myself.

1158
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:58,640
