00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:06,392
In the old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,

3
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,861
the Titan would step with fire in his eyes.

4
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,665
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

5
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,134
He's just a statue.

6
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,107
Don't be afraid.

7
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,276
He's announcing our arrival.

8
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,947
I'm not afraid.

9
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:39,348
The House of Black and White.

10
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:42,784
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

11
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,459
Here I leave you.

12
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,768
Thank you for bringing me.

13
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,237
Any man of Braavos
would have done the same.

14
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,507
Valar morghulis.

15
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,743
Valar dohaeris.

16
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:44,844
Hello.

17
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:49,916
Valar morghulis.

18
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,823
Um...

19
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,029
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

20
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,501
No one here by that name.

21
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:10,904
Please.

22
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:14,507
I crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

23
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:16,375
You have everywhere else to go.

24
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:18,377
But wait...

25
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,465
Cersei.

26
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,368
Walder Frey.

27
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,704
The Mountain.

28
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:47,339
Meryn Trant.

29
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,008
Cersei.

30
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:54,912
Walder Frey.

31
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,514
The Mountain.

32
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,851
Meryn Trant.

33
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,820
Cersei. Walder Frey.

34
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,189
The Mountain.

35
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,024
Meryn Trant.

36
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,194
Cersei.

37
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:11,763
Walder Frey.

38
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,297
The Mountain.

39
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,800
Meryn Trant.

40
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,335
Cersei.

41
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,239
Walder Frey.

42
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,073
The Mountain.

43
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,176
Meryn Trant.

44
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,442
Must be good food if it's crowded.

45
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,881
Ale?

46
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:14,924
Ale?

47
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,434
Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven scroll.

48
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,572
You are becoming an observant young lady.

49
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,442
My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

50
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:37,178
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

51
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,048
Excuse me.

52
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:41,817
So it was good news?

53
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,118
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

54
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,959
I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

55
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,589
Ale?

56
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:50,658
I'll have some.

57
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,263
My lady.

58
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:57,631
What is it?

59
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,633
Sansa Stark. Don't look.

60
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,269
You sure?

61
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:03,925
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

62
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:05,318
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

63
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,407
Littlefinger?

64
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:08,075
A bunch of knights with him.

65
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:10,143
A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick? Six? 20?

66
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,312
10, I think. Too many.

67
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,287
My lady, I don't think this is the right...

68
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:16,617
- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

69
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,551
Find more.

70
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:26,026
Do you like the taste?

71
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:28,262
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

72
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,598
Why do men love it so much?

73
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,633
It gives some men courage.

74
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:35,869
Does it give you courage?

75
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,140
That's far enough.

76
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,477
Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.

77
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,613
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

78
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:49,081
We've met with Renly Baratheon.

79
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,285
What did he say about you?

80
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:57,323
He said, "Your loyalty
came free of charge."

81
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,579
Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.

82
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,609
Lady Sansa,

83
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:19,578
before your mother's death,

84
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,880
I was her sworn sword.

85
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:25,016
I gave my word I would
find you and protect you.

86
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:28,386
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

87
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,122
and give my life for yours if need be.

88
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:34,426
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

89
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:37,662
Please, Lady Brienne,

90
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,497
no need for such formality.

91
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:41,933
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?

92
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,134
- I was.
- Strange.

93
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,603
I knew Cat from the time we were children.

94
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:47,505
She never mentioned you.

95
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:49,474
It was after Renly's murder.

96
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:50,775
Ah, yes.

97
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:52,577
You were accused of killing him.

98
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:55,312
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

99
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,381
By men who didn't see what happened.

100
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:59,083
And what did happen?

101
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,689
He was murdered by a shadow.

102
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:08,392
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

103
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:11,661
A shadow?

104
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:15,264
With the face...

105
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,635
This woman swore to protect Renly.

106
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,003
She failed.

107
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:23,439
She swore to protect
your mother. She failed.

108
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:27,677
Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

109
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:29,845
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

110
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:31,414
Because I am her uncle.

111
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,750
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

112
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:37,653
We're family now and you are an outsider.

113
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:41,524
Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but
experience has made me wary of outsiders.

114
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,660
Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone...

115
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:46,128
No.

116
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:47,902
Please, my lady. If I could explain...

117
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,432
I saw you at Joffrey's
wedding bowing to the king.

118
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:54,003
Neither of us wanted to be there.

119
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,738
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

120
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:58,040
And sometimes we do.

121
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,277
You should leave.

122
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:05,078
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

123
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:06,915
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

124
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,183
Why don't you stay?

125
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,694
The man asked you to stay...

126
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,966
Hyah! Hyah!

127
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:33,808
Hyah! Hyah!

128
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,843
After her!

129
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,224
- Yah! Hah!
- Oh!

130
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:09,609
- Stop! Stop!
- I'll take him!

131
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:12,945
Podrick!

132
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:15,248
Hold on to her!

133
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:19,719
Take her!

134
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,003
Keep moving!

135
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,216
Stop! Stop! Stop!

136
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,285
Stop! Stop!

137
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:58,757
That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.

138
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,461
No, no, no, stop!

139
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:25,883
I guess that means you're unarmed.

140
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,951
Down, Podrick! Down!

141
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:50,607
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lady?

142
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:52,809
You can stand now.

143
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,611
Yes, my lady.

144
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,317
Sansa Stark?

145
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:02,885
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

146
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:05,287
I saw her riding on the
East Road with Littlefinger.

147
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,522
We'll follow them.

148
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,993
My lady, if both Stark
girls refused your service,

149
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:12,695
maybe you're released from your vow.

150
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,131
I swore to their mother I
would protect those girls.

151
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:16,365
But if they don't want your protection...

152
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,400
Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?

153
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,571
No, my lady.

154
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,473
Get your horse.

155
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,884
A summons from the queen.

156
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,004
There are only two like it in the world.

157
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,474
The one I'm wearing, the
one I gave to Myrcella.

158
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:02,343
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

159
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,045
Our daughter's alone in Dorne

160
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:08,616
surrounded by people who hate our family.

161
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,417
"It's a threat."

162
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,453
No note?

163
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:16,723
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

164
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,894
and every other tragedy that's
befallen their cursed country.

165
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,536
I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.

166
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:23,898
- Softer.
- What?

167
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,766
Not so loud.

168
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,234
Our daughter's in danger and you're
worried I'm speaking too loudly?

169
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:30,637
The world can't know she's our daughter.

170
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,107
Then don't call her your daughter.

171
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,009
You've never been a father to her.

172
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,345
If I was a father to any of my
children, they'd be stoned in the street.

173
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,647
And what has your caution brought?

174
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:45,118
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

175
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,653
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

176
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:50,256
Our baby boy set to marry

177
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,059
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

178
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:03,402
I'm going to make things better.

179
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,058
You've never made anything better.

180
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:06,305
I'm going to Dorne

181
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:08,541
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

182
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,210
You can't just ask Prince Doran

183
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:13,346
to give her back.

184
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:14,814
She's promised to his son.

185
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,582
I'm not going to ask him anything.

186
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:19,951
You go down there with an
army, it's an act of war.

187
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:21,453
No army.

188
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:23,588
Do you know where they're keeping her?

189
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,927
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

190
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,863
I'll find her.

191
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,600
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

192
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,338
You're going to Dorne?

193
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:44,709
A one-handed man alone?

194
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:47,812
I never said I was going alone.

195
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,522
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

196
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:01,092
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

197
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,760
And music. I adore music.

198
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,862
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

199
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,031
We can have a harp if
you like, but no flutes.

200
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,566
Then there's the food. Food
is the most important thing.

201
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,835
Don't you agree? We're
going to need pigeon pies.

202
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:15,105
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

203
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:16,807
Don't they?

204
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:19,676
Don't who?

205
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:22,712
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

206
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,581
They certainly do, my dear.

207
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:28,051
They certainly do.

208
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,320
It's a fine place, isn't it?

209
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,122
A fine place.

210
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,157
I never thought I'd end up

211
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:37,093
settling down in a place like this.

212
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:40,463
- You won't.
- Pardon?

213
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,364
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

214
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,353
When Mother dies, my sister gets
the castle because she's older.

215
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:47,336
- Oh.
- She hates me.

216
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:49,772
She calls me mean names
and sometimes even still

217
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:52,742
she pulls my hair when
Mother's not looking.

218
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,078
You know what I think?

219
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,314
I think you're a good person.

220
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,582
And your sister is a mean person.

221
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,184
She is.

222
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,921
I've been all over the world,

223
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:08,023
and if there's one thing I've learned,

224
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,060
it's that meanness comes around.

225
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:12,894
People like your sister,

226
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:16,364
they always get what's
coming to them eventually.

227
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,567
One way or another.

228
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,805
Who's that?

229
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:28,076
Jaime fucking Lannister.

230
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:32,813
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

231
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,684
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

232
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:38,319
Thank you.

233
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:41,289
This is my betrothed Lollys.

234
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,825
A pleasure.

235
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,662
Run along, love.

236
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:57,237
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

237
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:59,406
When were you planning on getting married?

238
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,641
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

239
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,543
What you're here for.

240
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,179
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

241
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,681
It's very good for you.

242
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:23,129
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.

243
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,430
Mmm.

244
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,299
We made a deal, your sister and I.

245
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:30,269
- I would have advised against that.
- How is this good for me?

246
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:33,105
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

247
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,642
And when we return, I'm going
to give you a much better girl

248
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,644
and a much better castle.

249
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,615
Return from where?

250
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,052
As far south as south goes.

251
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,068
My future queen.

252
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,221
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

253
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,122
Remove yourself from my path

254
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,291
or I'll take that longaxe
and I'll shove it...

255
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:28,726
Captain.

256
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:31,862
Let her pass.

257
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,102
Your brother was murdered

258
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,304
and you sit here in the Water Gardens

259
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,739
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

260
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,542
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.

261
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,010
By law, that is not murder.

262
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,580
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

263
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,382
He was my brother long
before he was anything to you.

264
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,518
What will you do about his death?

265
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,886
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

266
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:59,756
- And then?
- You would have me go to war?

267
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,257
The whole country would have you go to war.

268
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,193
Then we are lucky the whole
country does not decide.

269
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,297
The Sand Snakes are with me.

270
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,960
They have the love of their people.

271
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:12,535
They will avenge their
father while you sit here

272
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:15,471
in your chair doing nothing.

273
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,010
Oberyn is dead

274
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:24,880
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens

275
00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:28,984
eating our food, breathing our air.

276
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:31,987
How many of your brothers and
sisters do they have to kill?

277
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:35,257
Let me have her.

278
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:40,829
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

279
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:44,466
I loved my brother.

280
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,768
And you made him very happy.

281
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,837
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

282
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:55,177
But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.

283
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,844
Not here.

284
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,780
Not while I rule.

285
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,116
And how long will that be?

286
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,334
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

287
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:23,304
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

288
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,632
Of course you haven't
found any Sons of the Harpy.

289
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:27,741
You haven't, have you?

290
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:32,580
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

291
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:35,649
they drink, they whore,

292
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:37,450
fight in the streets,

293
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:38,985
they blend in.

294
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:41,287
They overhear things in taverns,

295
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:44,925
follow people from the
taverns to nice, quiet alleys,

296
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:47,227
break a few fingers,

297
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,229
overhear a few more things.

298
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:52,165
Before you know it...

299
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:14,186
No one here.

300
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:15,587
We go.

301
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,390
In a hurry? You're afraid?

302
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:20,525
Unsullied fear nothing.

303
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:22,461
Right.

304
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,429
That's your problem.

305
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,765
You understood fear once long ago,

306
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,634
but you've forgotten what it means.

307
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:32,371
Someone who's forgotten fear

308
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:33,938
has forgotten how to hide.

309
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,949
Fear is useful that way.

310
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:13,143
Sons of the Harpy, they want
to put a collar back on my neck.

311
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:14,512
On all of our necks.

312
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:16,379
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

313
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:17,815
It would send a message.

314
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,583
I think you should exercise
restraint, Your Grace.

315
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:23,453
- Why?
- For one thing, he may have valuable information.

316
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:26,556
The Son of the Harpy has no
more valuable information.

317
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,657
How do you know that?

318
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,960
Because I questioned him.

319
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:31,896
And the information you did get,

320
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,802
- he is young and poor.
- He is born free.

321
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,932
Why should he want to bring back
slavery? What did it do for him?

322
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,467
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

323
00:24:37,835 --> 00:24:39,402
was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.

324
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,837
They pay him.

325
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:42,538
Great families afraid to do a thing.

326
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,407
They pay poor man to do it for them.

327
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:46,209
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

328
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,610
I don't know it and I'm
the head of a great family.

329
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:50,919
We do not know what this
man did or didn't do.

330
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:54,650
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

331
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,785
Show all the citizens of Meereen

332
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:58,821
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

333
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:00,723
Teach them a better way.

334
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,044
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

335
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:06,261
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

336
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:08,497
But here in Meereen,

337
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,333
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

338
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,535
So we learn much about them

339
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,771
or we do not live long.

340
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:18,139
They teach me what they are.

341
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:22,577
Mercy, fair trial...
these mean nothing to them.

342
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:25,046
All they understand is blood.

343
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,187
Thank you all for your counsel.

344
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,930
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

345
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:45,700
- About what?
- About your father.

346
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:48,035
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

347
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,504
You're here to remind
me of my enemies' lies?

348
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:51,038
Consider me reminded.

349
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:54,775
Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard.

350
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:56,877
I was at his side from the first.

351
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,513
Your enemies did not lie.

352
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:02,716
Go on.

353
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:07,121
When the people rose in revolt against him,

354
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,624
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

355
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:13,993
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

356
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:16,362
He burned men alive with wildfire

357
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:19,499
and laughed as they screamed.

358
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:23,069
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

359
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:27,540
led to rebellion that killed
every Targaryen except two.

360
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,943
I'm not my father.

361
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:33,546
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

362
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:37,951
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

363
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:41,854
And each time, it made him
feel powerful and right.

364
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,356
Until the very end.

365
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:51,564
I will not have the Son
of the Harpy executed

366
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:53,265
without a fair trial.

367
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:58,871
Your Grace.

368
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:09,714
There's a bug.

369
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:11,216
Yes, best be careful.

370
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,785
You might accidently
consume some solid food.

371
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:15,920
When I agreed to come with you,

372
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:18,590
did I misrepresent my intentions?

373
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,964
Besides, what else is there for me to do

374
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:27,999
inside this fucking box?

375
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,093
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

376
00:27:30,135 --> 00:27:31,035
You can't.

377
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:32,737
Cersei has offered a lordship

378
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,905
to the man who brings her your head.

379
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:36,773
She ought to offer her cunt.

380
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:39,510
Best part of her for the best part of me.

381
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:43,481
Well, I suppose a box is as
good a place for me as anywhere.

382
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:46,717
Are we really going to spend
the entire road to Volantis

383
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:48,752
talking about the futility of everything?

384
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,654
You're right. No point.

385
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:52,889
The road to Volantis?

386
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,791
You said we were going to
Meereen. What's in Volantis?

387
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,427
The road to Meereen.

388
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:00,863
And what do you hope to find at
the end of the road to Meereen?

389
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:03,199
I told you. A ruler.

390
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,268
We've already got a ruler.

391
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,038
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

392
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:10,973
Every pile of shit on
the side of every road

393
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:12,975
has someone's banner hanging from it.

394
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,013
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

395
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:19,582
During your brief tenure as Hand.

396
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,584
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

397
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:23,819
Still, a man of talent.

398
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,400
Managed to kill a lot of people.

399
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,624
Yes, but you showed great
promise in other areas as well.

400
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:35,630
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

401
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:37,732
She begged me.

402
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,435
I wouldn't go.

403
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:40,769
Why?

404
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:43,038
'Cause I liked it.

405
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,808
Power. Even as a servant.

406
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:50,045
People follow leaders.

407
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:51,913
And they will never follow us.

408
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:53,815
They find us repulsive.

409
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,349
I find us repulsive.

410
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:57,385
And we find them repulsive,

411
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,754
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

412
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,557
to keep them away.

413
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,858
And yet,

414
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:07,195
no matter what we do,

415
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,532
people like you and me are never
really satisfied inside the box.

416
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,867
Not for long.

417
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,970
You're right.

418
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,505
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

419
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,609
How many dwarves are there in the world?

420
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,944
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

421
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,150
Not him.

422
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,085
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

423
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,787
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

424
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:36,623
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

425
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:39,192
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

426
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:41,161
Mistakes will be made.

427
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,029
- Thank you, Your Grace, thank you.
- Your Grace, thank you.

428
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,965
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

429
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,799
I would take it if you don't mind.

430
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:49,636
It could prove useful for my work.

431
00:29:49,803 --> 00:29:51,270
Very good.

432
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,408
Over there will be fine.

433
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,912
You heard the man. Over there.

434
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:29,074
You're the Hand of the King?

435
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,742
No, Uncle.

436
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:32,010
Clearly it would not be appropriate

437
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:34,479
for a woman to assume that role.

438
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:36,727
I'm merely advising my
son until he comes of age

439
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,316
and chooses a Hand for himself.

440
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,752
Your Grace, I would be
willing to serve provisionally

441
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,000
as the King's Hand until
he becomes old enough...

442
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,530
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

443
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:47,692
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

444
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,860
In addition to being Master of Ships,

445
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,763
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

446
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,099
Oh, Your Grace.

447
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,001
He called your experience and wisdom

448
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:59,269
in financial matters unparalleled.

449
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:01,672
He said he would be honored to have you

450
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:03,727
represent the crown's
interests in the same.

451
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,576
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

452
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,713
Your Grace, in the past
on several occasions,

453
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:11,481
a Grand Maester has
served as the King's Hand.

454
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:16,152
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

455
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:20,624
Your Grace, him? This... this man?

456
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,228
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

457
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:27,463
Your Grace, what qualifications

458
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:29,398
can he possibly have for this post?

459
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,335
The qualification of
loyalty, Grand Maester.

460
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:34,270
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

461
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:36,940
Far more than many ever have.

462
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,776
I must say, I cannot see...

463
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:42,178
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position

464
00:31:42,512 --> 00:31:44,012
as commander of the Lannister armies,

465
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:47,550
it would please the king if you
would serve as his Master of War.

466
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:50,753
No man living better deserves the title.

467
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,021
That is kind of you to say.

468
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:55,158
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

469
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:56,932
The king is very busy at this moment.

470
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:59,428
He should be here learning
what it means to rule.

471
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:00,996
He is learning.

472
00:32:01,364 --> 00:32:03,265
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,

473
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:05,768
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

474
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:09,104
I returned to the capital to
pay my respects to my brother.

475
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:12,574
And to you. And to serve the king.

476
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:14,609
I did not return to the capital

477
00:32:14,878 --> 00:32:16,278
to serve as your puppet.

478
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,047
To watch you stack the small
council with sycophants.

479
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,617
Sending your own brother
away so he wouldn't be...

480
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:24,471
My brother has left the capital to lead

481
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,187
a sensitive diplomatic mission.

482
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:27,221
What mission?

483
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,392
That is not your concern as Master of War.

484
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:33,694
I do not recognize your authority

485
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:36,931
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

486
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:40,467
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

487
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,941
You would abandon your
king in his time of need?

488
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,277
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

489
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:52,579
At Casterly Rock.

490
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:02,255
Come on, you know this one.

491
00:33:04,158 --> 00:33:05,659
It looks like an animal.

492
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:09,896
Snake.

493
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:12,532
Sssnake. S.

494
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:15,068
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

495
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,204
Huh!

496
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,805
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history

497
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:22,108
Osric Stark was elected at the age of 10?

498
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:25,978
I know S.

499
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:27,714
You'll learn, I promise.

500
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:31,048
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

501
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:34,019
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

502
00:33:34,254 --> 00:33:35,655
Very patient.

503
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:38,591
I only said that the more
time that you spend practicing,

504
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:40,246
the faster you'll be able to read.

505
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:42,728
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

506
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,197
I'm sure you and "Ostrich" Stark

507
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:47,867
have a lot to talk about.

508
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:52,537
How old were you when
you learned how to read?

509
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:54,240
- Three.
- Three?

510
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:55,628
Who taught you, your mother?

511
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:59,277
No, old Maester Cressen did.

512
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,012
I had a lot of time to practice.

513
00:34:01,313 --> 00:34:03,281
My mother kept me inside because...

514
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:07,486
What do you call it in the south,

515
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:09,488
what happened to your face?

516
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,256
Greyscale.

517
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:14,125
What do you call it north of the Wall?

518
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:16,427
I don't know.

519
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:18,029
But two of my sisters had it.

520
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,864
They both died.

521
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:21,266
How did they cure you?

522
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,067
I don't remember.

523
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:24,568
I was a baby.

524
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:26,504
Lots of people came and tried, I think.

525
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:28,906
Whatever they did, it went away.

526
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:32,510
What happened to your sisters?

527
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:39,383
My father made them move out of
the keep into the huts outside.

528
00:34:39,718 --> 00:34:41,552
None of us were allowed to go near them.

529
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:45,956
But we heard them, especially at night.

530
00:34:46,324 --> 00:34:50,227
They started to sound not like themselves.

531
00:34:50,494 --> 00:34:52,562
Did you ever see them?

532
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,832
Only once at the end.

533
00:34:57,668 --> 00:34:59,602
They were covered with it.

534
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,705
Their faces, their arms.

535
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,241
They acted like animals.

536
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:10,012
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

537
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,549
What did he do with them in the woods?

538
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:19,555
Mother.

539
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:21,223
Leave us.

540
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:25,194
Your Grace.

541
00:35:27,197 --> 00:35:28,637
You need to stay away from that girl.

542
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:30,032
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

543
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,268
Her name is Gilly. She's nice.

544
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:33,535
I'm teaching her to read.

545
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:34,870
She's a wildling.

546
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:36,572
Your father defeated her people.

547
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:39,541
He executed their king for treason.

548
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:42,277
They could strike at
him by striking at you.

549
00:35:42,545 --> 00:35:44,613
Gilly wouldn't do that.

550
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:48,750
You have no idea what people will do.

551
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:51,152
All your books and you still don't know.

552
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:59,633
I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.

553
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,297
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

554
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:04,866
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

555
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:07,369
A king's word is law.

556
00:36:07,736 --> 00:36:09,577
Perhaps you should ask
Ser Davos how much mercy

557
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,739
I show to lawbreakers.

558
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:17,312
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

559
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,447
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

560
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,215
With respect, Your Grace,

561
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,751
the free folk will never follow
you no matter what you do.

562
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,766
You're the man who burned their king alive.

563
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,855
Who, then?

564
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:31,658
You?

565
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,627
No.

566
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,762
Only one of their own.

567
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:40,100
Do you know this wretched girl,

568
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:41,668
Lyanna Mormont?

569
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:43,670
The Lord Commander's niece.

570
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:47,040
Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10.

571
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:51,836
I asked her to commit her house
to my cause. That's her response.

572
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,814
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

573
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:57,083
whose name is Stark."

574
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:59,118
That amuses you?

575
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:03,589
I apologize, Your Grace.

576
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:07,860
Northerners can be a
bit like the free folk.

577
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:11,164
- Loyal to their own.
- I know.

578
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,433
My brother Robert went on often and loudly

579
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,734
about how difficult it was to control them.

580
00:37:18,004 --> 00:37:19,738
Even with your father's help.

581
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:26,478
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

582
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,413
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

583
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,949
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

584
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:33,518
He thinks you're a traitor.

585
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,455
What's your life going to be like here
at the Wall with Thorne in command?

586
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,256
Unpleasant, I expect.

587
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:41,226
Your bravery made him look weak.

588
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,328
He'll punish you for it.

589
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,029
I don't punish men for bravery.

590
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:46,998
I reward them.

591
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,767
I don't doubt it, Your Grace.

592
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,836
But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

593
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:54,304
I pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

594
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,940
I don't know what I have left to give you.

595
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,009
You can give me the North.

596
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,177
I can't.

597
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,181
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard,

598
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:06,349
a Snow.

599
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,552
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

600
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,822
Pledge me your service and
you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

601
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:14,857
Lord of Winterfell.

602
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,465
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

603
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:26,102
It's the first thing I
ever remember wanting.

604
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:29,271
I'd daydream that my
father would ask the king

605
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,421
and just like that, I would never
be the bastard of Winterfell again.

606
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:34,576
You deserve this. You do.

607
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:37,279
I couldn't be happier for you.

608
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:39,782
I'm going to refuse him.

609
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:45,154
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

610
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:47,589
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

611
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:49,403
If I don't take my own word seriously,

612
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,993
what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?

613
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,901
Crowded. You'd think we
were serving venison stew.

614
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:11,512
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates

615
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:14,515
before we cast our tokens

616
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:18,886
for the 998th Lord Commander

617
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,588
of the Night's Watch?

618
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:24,958
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,

619
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,661
he's a man of true nobility.

620
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,697
He was acting commander when
the Wall came under attack

621
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:32,691
- and led us to victory against the wildlings.
- Hear, hear.

622
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,201
He's a veteran of 100 battles

623
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:37,270
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

624
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:38,839
Aye.

625
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:40,607
He's the only true choice.

626
00:39:45,646 --> 00:39:48,082
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

627
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:50,983
and has served loyally
longer than any other ranger.

628
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:53,753
Through 10 winters he served.

629
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:55,589
As commander of the Shadow Tower,

630
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,390
he kept the wildlings away.

631
00:39:57,658 --> 00:39:59,025
We could do no better.

632
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:05,464
If there is no one else,

633
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,166
we will begin the voting.

634
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:10,069
The triangular tokens count

635
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:12,739
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

636
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:16,709
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

637
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:19,846
- Each brother will...
- Maester Aemon.

638
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:23,982
Samwell Tarly. Go on.

639
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:27,853
Sam the Slayer.

640
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:30,689
Another wildling lover just
like his friend Jon Snow.

641
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,824
How's your lady love, Slayer?

642
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,561
Her name is Gilly.

643
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:37,463
Brother Slynt knows her quite well.

644
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:40,698
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

645
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,533
Lies!

646
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:45,436
A wildling girl, a baby,

647
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,139
and Lord Janos.

648
00:40:47,506 --> 00:40:49,908
I found him there after the battle was over

649
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:51,409
in a puddle of his own making.

650
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:58,349
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding

651
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:00,818
with the women and children,

652
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:03,187
Jon Snow was leading.

653
00:41:03,522 --> 00:41:05,757
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true.

654
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:08,526
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

655
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,628
He took charge of the Wall's defense.

656
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:12,763
He killed the Magnar of the Thenns.

657
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,399
He went north to deal with Mance Rayder

658
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,435
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

659
00:41:21,907 --> 00:41:24,508
Before that,

660
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:27,711
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

661
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,115
Mormont himself chose
Jon to be his steward.

662
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,985
He saw something in Jon and
now we've all seen it, too.

663
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,855
He may be young,

664
00:41:39,156 --> 00:41:41,090
but he's the commander we turned to

665
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:42,659
when the night was darkest.

666
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:54,003
I can't argue with any of that.

667
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,440
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

668
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:00,876
Night's Watch

669
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,678
or the wildlings?

670
00:42:03,012 --> 00:42:06,515
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl

671
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,517
and spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

672
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:12,287
What would have happened in that
tent between those two old friends

673
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:14,623
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

674
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:19,328
We all saw him put the
King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery.

675
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,298
Do you want to choose a man who has
fought the wildlings all his life

676
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,700
or a man who makes love to them?

677
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,009
It is time.

678
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:24,024
It appears to be a tie, Maester.

679
00:43:44,711 --> 00:43:47,847
Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

680
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:22,146
You. You.

681
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,019
What have you got there?

682
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:32,390
- I said...
- Turn around and go.

683
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:37,395
Turn around and go.

684
00:44:37,662 --> 00:44:39,163
That's a nice little sword.

685
00:44:39,465 --> 00:44:41,799
Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that.

686
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:46,169
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

687
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,173
Come on.

688
00:44:50,408 --> 00:44:52,109
Quickly, go! Go!

689
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:06,823
Who are you?

690
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,525
Why were they scared of you?

691
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:10,927
You lost this.

692
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:24,073
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

693
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:25,775
There isn't.

694
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:28,144
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

695
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,949
Well, who are you, then?

696
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,918
No one.

697
00:45:35,218 --> 00:45:37,219
And that is who a girl must become.

698
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,435
_

699
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:31,868
_

700
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:34,635
_

701
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,024
Why?

702
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:53,927
_

703
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,095
_

704
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:01,783

705
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:04,917

706
00:47:05,037 --> 00:47:08,422

707
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:09,842

708
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:14,227

710
00:47:16,976 --> 00:47:19,383

711
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,601

712
00:47:23,446 --> 00:47:26,951

713
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:32,354

714

715
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:39,721
_

716
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:44,454
_

717
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:50,525
_

718
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:55,583
_

719
00:47:58,093 --> 00:47:59,804
_

720
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:07,342
_

721
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:11,418
_

722
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:12,914
_

723
00:48:13,034 --> 00:48:14,783
_

724
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:20,953
_

725
00:48:31,154 --> 00:48:33,456
Mhysa! Mhysa!

726
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:35,325
Mhysa! Mhysa!

727
00:48:55,078 --> 00:48:57,512
Mhysa! Mhysa!

728
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,215
Mhysa!

729
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,190
She should have cut off the traitor's head

730
00:49:02,352 --> 00:49:04,032
in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.

731
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:06,355
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

732
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:11,760
Mhysa! Mhysa!

733
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:15,897
_

734
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,504

735
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:27,837

736
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,413
_

737
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,776
_

738
00:49:54,896 --> 00:49:57,343
_

739
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:05,443

740
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:08,067

741
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:11,147

742
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:15,064
_

743
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:32,305
Mhysa.

744
00:51:07,206 --> 00:51:09,374
Mhysa!

745
00:52:13,503 --> 00:52:15,664
I'll stand guard outside
your door tonight, Your Grace.

746
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,573
We all guard tonight.

747
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:20,208
Leave me.

748
00:53:12,995 --> 00:53:14,828
Drogon.

749
