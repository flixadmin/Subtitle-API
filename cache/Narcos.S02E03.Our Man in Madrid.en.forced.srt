1
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,820
WE LOVE YOU!

2
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,760
Present arms!

3
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,150
I am responsible
for the death of those men, Eduardo.

4
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,280
And if Escobar is using their deaths
to send me a message, then I will respond.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,030
I agree completely.

6
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,490
We have to go in full force.

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,370
Keep in mind... bringing him back
won't be a popular decision.

8
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,340
But since when do we care
about being popular?

9
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Colonel Carrillo.

10
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,990
Yes, Mr. President.

11
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,980
Boss, they're all saying
they don't know anything.

12
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,980
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

13
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,570
You gentlemen are under the impression
that you work for the Moncadas.

14
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,320
Allow me to clarify.
You have never worked for the Moncadas.

15
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,580
You work for me,
and you have always worked for me.

16
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,830
- Blackie.
- Yes, boss.

17
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,170
Who gave Judy Moncada
the cash to buy this house?

18
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,250
You, Don Pablo.

19
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,500
- Jairo.
- Yes, Don Pablo.

20
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,840
The money that puts food on the table
for these men, where does it come from?

21
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,720
- From your pocket.
- Everything you see here is mine.

22
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,720
Everything you have
is because I allow you to have it.

23
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,110
Everything you think you are protecting,
you are protecting for me.

24
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,610
Are we clear on this?

25
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,120
You're going to tell me the location
of every safe house, every lab,

26
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,700
every office,
every account of the Moncadas.

27
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,040
And look...

28
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,920
that doesn't make you gentlemen traitors.

29
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,250
Certainly not.

30
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,220
You simply didn't know
who you were really working for.

31
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,430
So let's begin...

32
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,310
with what's most important.

33
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,650
You're... going to tell me right now...

34
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:50,320
where that bitch Judy Moncada is hiding.

35
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,800
- Ms. Judy, welcome.
- Thank you.

36
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,680
Pardon me.

37
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,100
- Hey!
- Navegante!

38
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,520
- Watch yourself.
- Mrs. Moncada is our guest.

39
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,820
We treat our guests with respect.

40
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,360
Even the ones who invite themselves.

41
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,950
Listen, Pacho,
are you sure you have enough men?

42
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,660
One might get the impression
you're scared of someone.

43
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,130
Perhaps if you took security
more seriously...

44
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,800
just maybe your husband
would still be alive...

45
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,390
and you wouldn't be coming to us for help.

46
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,310
Listen to this guy.
Who told you I was coming here for help?

47
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,230
Where's your boss?

48
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,320
You mean my partner.

49
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,570
- Handling the business.
- Is that right?

50
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,410
So he's still trying to pretend
he isn't a drug trafficker?

51
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,660
Mrs. Moncada...
why don't you go look around?

52
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,670
I don't know, pet the horses.

53
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,880
Or rehearse whatever it is
you came to say.

54
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,920
Gilberto will be here shortly.

55
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,510
Thank you, Pacho.

56
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,560
Ma'am? Here's what you asked for.

57
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Who's that?

58
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
He's one of the new guys.

59
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
Excuse me.

60
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,210
POLICE STATION ATTACKED IN MEDELLÍN

61
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,640
What a hideous painting.

62
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,090
What a lovely surprise.

63
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,460
- To what do we owe the pleasure?
- Business.

64
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,520
"And one by one, the nights
between our separated cities,

65
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
they are added to the night
that unites us."

66
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,610
It's the middle of the fucking day,
Gilberto.

67
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,110
Not a fan of Neruda?

68
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,860
The only thing that unites us in this life
is a desire to see Pablo dead.

69
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,130
Gentlemen.

70
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,840
So tell me, Mrs. Moncada,
why did you come all this way?

71
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,270
To help you kill the man
who murdered my husband and brother

72
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,940
by offering very important information
that only I possess.

73
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,270
- And what is this information?
- Targets.

74
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,610
The location of every one of his labs.

75
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:03,780
Going after Pablo's infrastructure
will cripple him, force him to surface.

76
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,790
When he does, we put a bullet in his head
and we take turns shitting on him.

77
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,620
What's valuable isn't knowing
what Pablo has,

78
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,790
but what he wants to acquire.

79
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,960
Because that's where he'll be next.

80
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,550
Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

81
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,800
Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

82
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,680
You want me to tell you where my labs are?

83
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,900
Well... let's say...

84
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,230
that I share that information.

85
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,070
What happens to my labs?

86
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,490
Oh, Judy.

87
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,320
Your sense of vengeance is heartwarming.

88
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,370
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

89
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,750
You're right.

90
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,750
He would be very proud of me.

91
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,840
I built the business by his side, Pacho.

92
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm from the Medellín cartel.
I know what I am.

93
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,350
I don't need bullshit art
hanging on my wall to prove any different.

94
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,390
Wait.

95
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,060
Hold on.

96
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,690
Confronting Pablo directly
won't help us maintain a low profile.

97
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,690
But...

98
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,120
what if the Search Bloc were to learn
the location of your labs?

99
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,120
What good is it if he's arrested?

100
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,630
He's already shown
he can fuck us from prison.

101
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,090
This won't end with Pablo in a cell.

102
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,590
You think the police will kill him?

103
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,220
There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

104
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,300
And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

105
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,850
Assemble the Search Bloc outside.
I want 100 men and six trucks.

106
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,770
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?
- On it, Colonel.

107
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
- What's up?
- They just left. Four motorcycles,

108
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,390
five pickups, and a truck.
It's a large convoy.

109
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,570
They're heading to Barrio Escobar.

110
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,990
It's going to get crowded.

111
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,420
The convoy has arrived.

112
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,850
We're in position.

113
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,360
A MAN, A NEIGHBORHOOD, A COUNTRY!

114
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,630
Look. Look up there.

115
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,460
There's something weird happening.
What do you see?

116
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,800
- They're clouds.
- No, not clouds.

117
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,640
Because clouds form shapes.

118
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,140
- What I see is a turtle.
- Boss!

119
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,730
- Excuse me. I need to talk to you.
- Keep looking.

120
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,820
Keep looking at the clouds.

121
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,490
Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important.

122
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,910
- What's going on?
- Carrillo is back.

123
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,660
And he's here in Medellín.

124
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,920
What else?

125
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,140
That son of a bitch filled
Barrio Escobar with police and...

126
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,140
he pissed on your mural, sir.

127
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,720
Those fucking cops
are going up 26th Street.

128
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,050
Copy that, brother. All good.

129
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,740
Trujillo, load up six unmarked cars,
four men per car.

130
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,410
Instruct them to leave in 20-minute
intervals to avoid attention. Clear?

131
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,740
- Yes, Colonel.
- Okay.

132
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,600
Freeze! Don't move!

133
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,360
Relax. Everything's good.

134
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,940
What is this?

135
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,610
Piraña down.

136
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,540
Son of a bitch.

137
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,210
Where are you going?

138
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,880
Get him!

139
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,260
Don't move!

140
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,930
Don't move!

141
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,140
- Good evening.
- Yes?

142
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,720
Would you allow me to search your house?
We're looking for--

143
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,390
Stop! Stop, boy!

144
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,600
Stop!

145
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,440
Get on the floor!

146
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,620
Show me your hands.

147
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,080
You think you're slick?
Why were you running?

148
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,000
No! What did I do wrong?

149
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,670
You tell me what you did.

150
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,700
Do you know who I am?

151
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,280
My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.

152
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,790
Last week...
30 police officers were murdered.

153
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,210
Those pigs probably deserved it.

154
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,220
Many of them were my friends.

155
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,810
A person perched on rooftops,
guiding murderers with radios...

156
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,640
are assassins themselves.

157
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,150
I hope after this encounter,
you'll reconsider

158
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,570
working with someone
who thinks he's above the law.

159
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,990
What? Am I supposed to
shit in my pants in fear?

160
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,040
No.

161
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,840
Do I make myself clear?

162
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,590
I want you to tell your friends,

163
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,090
that this is what happens
when you work for Pablo Escobar!

164
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,240
Take it.

165
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,700
Take it.

166
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,210
Tell them this is for Pablo.

167
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,140
Remember what you saw.

168
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,560
And know what will happen to you
if I see you on a rooftop.

169
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,390
You can leave.

170
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,310
Leave!

171
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,170
So, what book shall we read
before bed tonight?

172
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,840
The Witch.

173
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,670
No, my love. No scary stories.

174
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,340
The Witch? What's that? I don't know it.

175
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,010
Dad reads it to us. Right, Dad?

176
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,350
- The bad witch and the good witch, right?
- Yes.

177
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,350
Not The Witch, Pablo.

178
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,360
I don't want any more scary stories
in this house.

179
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,450
Love, take your sister
and brush your teeth.

180
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,280
And go straight to bed.

181
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,120
Listen, where's my kiss?

182
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,290
Good night.

183
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,380
- Good night, my love.
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.

184
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,190
I heard a scary story, Pablo.

185
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,570
The man who killed Gustavo
is back in Medellín.

186
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,150
Is that story true?

187
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,490
Yes.

188
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,000
Does that sound like the government
is trying to negotiate?

189
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,540
Good night.

190
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,600
Someone has to tell you
how things are, Pablo.

191
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,860
That man is here to kill you.

192
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,390
I'm scared, Pablo.

193
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,770
I promise you one thing:

194
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,610
if things get out of hand
and I can't control it...

195
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,240
we'll leave the country.

196
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,120
Okay?

197
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,850
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

198
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,230
She works at the market.

199
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,190
Sweetheart?

200
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,900
- Are you sure?
- No.

201
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Nobody's seen the bitch.

202
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,840
I'm pissed off, brother.

203
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,850
Let's go for some ice cream.

204
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,180
Something cold.

205
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,830
You were different this time, Javi.

206
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,340
I always know when my clients
are trying to forget something.

207
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,350
You know what I do to relax?

208
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,020
- I write.
- You write?

209
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,690
- What do you write?
- Letters.

210
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,860
For my family, but I never send them.

211
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,950
It's good to forget.

212
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,880
What do you want to forget?

213
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,850
Why don't you stop?

214
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,140
Why don't you?

215
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,920
Welcome, brother.

216
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,760
This way.

217
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
- What is your name?
- David.

218
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,190
- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you, too.

219
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,530
Follow me.

220
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,030
They told me you like soccer.

221
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,370
- I play defense.
- Of course.

222
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,290
Those are the real men.

223
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,130
You're very brave, David.

224
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,130
I'm sorry for what you witnessed.

225
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,050
The people we're fighting
are very bad people.

226
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,810
Tell me about the man who did that.

227
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,560
He said this bullet is for you.

228
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,660
I need you to do one last favor for me.

229
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,660
It's very important.

230
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,290
You think you can do it?

231
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,510
Thank you, David.

232
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,850
Agent Peña. This is Don Berna.

233
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,020
I have a proposition
you might be interested in.

234
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,690
What a surprise.

235
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,120
What's up, Peña?
Are you expecting anyone else?

236
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,870
No. Are you?

237
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,370
No, it's not necessary.

238
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,630
Everywhere I go in this town,
I'm surrounded by friends.

239
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,710
Sit down. Sit so you can taste
the best coffee in Medellín.

240
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,470
Doña Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.

241
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,010
You have something
other than coffee for me?

242
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,890
Look, Agent... I'm not one of those
street-corner informants

243
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,060
that you slip a few gringo dollars
for a tip. No, sir.

244
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,560
Then why are we here?

245
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,740
Agent, you and I
are like the snake and the cat.

246
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,000
If the snake has the chance,
it will kill the cat.

247
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,330
And if the cat has the chance,
it will kill the snake.

248
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,420
But there are times
when they see a big rat,

249
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,880
and they both want to eat it.

250
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,330
Gato!

251
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:31,210
No! Calm down.
Okay, relax. Don't kill me--

252
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,670
Relax!

253
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,800
Detaining the prisoners.

254
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,980
We captured about 45 of them.

255
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,120
Approaching.

256
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,210
We're locking you up.

257
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,460
Move it!

258
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,600
Hello, Valeria.

259
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,440
- I didn't realize you'd be here.
- I wanted to be sure it went well.

260
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,320
- People need to hear the truth, right?
- Yes, it's important.

261
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,780
They forced this boy
to watch his friend get shot.

262
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,620
When the country hears this story,
they'll turn on that son of a bitch

263
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,200
who's murdering children
for the Americans.

264
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,460
Well... that's what I hope.

265
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,880
I'm glad you came.

266
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,720
It's good to see you again.

267
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,520
Are all eyes still on you?

268
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,570
Except yours.

269
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,750
Let's begin.

270
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,170
Yes.

271
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,090
- How old are you?
- Ten.

272
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,420
I understand you're quite a soccer player.

273
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,390
Thank you for being brave enough
to tell us your story, David.

274
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,020
Tell me, who were the men
who brought you to the building that day?

275
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,020
They were Search Bloc policemen.

276
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,690
Do you know why they brought you there?

277
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,690
He said they were going
to send a message to other kids.

278
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,280
Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?

279
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,280
Colonel Carrillo.

280
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,280
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

281
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,780
- Where are you taking us?
- Bogotá.

282
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,460
You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

283
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,920
But look...
if you help me, I can help you.

284
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,630
Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else,
then I'll help you.

285
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,380
I don't know where they are.
I don't know them.

286
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,390
- So you don't know anything?
- No, sir.

287
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,770
What about you, Gato?

288
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,310
All right.

289
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,780
If it's going to be like this...

290
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,490
Who else was there
besides Colonel Carrillo?

291
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,750
A bunch of men.

292
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:21,830
Some I heard speaking English.
Americans. Like in the movies.

293
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,960
Are you sure they were police?

294
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,670
Yes.

295
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,170
What now?

296
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,010
You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

297
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,520
Asshole, he doesn't even know you exist.
Do you know that?

298
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,680
It's your last chance, Gato.

299
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,350
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

300
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,170
- Hello.
- Everything is good.

301
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,340
- It worked.
- Very well.

302
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,880
It worked.

303
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,430
- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

304
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,440
It's for a noble cause, Mrs. Moncada.

305
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,530
Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.

306
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,360
Search Bloc took down the Moncadas'
biggest lab before we could take it apart.

307
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,950
Carrillo got Gato. We don't know where
they are or what they're doing to him.
