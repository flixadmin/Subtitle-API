1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:06,965
Hey, you hungry?

2
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,802
I was thinking blueberry pancakes
for breakfast this morning.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,061
Or I could get us something fun
from that Brooklyn's Best Bagels place.

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,767
They just opened
a new location downtown.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
Iris?

6
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,442
Iris.

7
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,834
Thanks for the company, Cecile.

8
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,460
Anytime.

9
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:27,005
You know, I figured you'd be
working this time of day.

10
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,131
Oh, I was.

11
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,093
Yeah, I'm actually avoiding
a new meta client,

12
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,362
so I figured I'd get out of the office,

13
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,096
come over,
see what Team Flash was up to.

14
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:40,852
Well, we're all good here. Yeah,
the town is quiet. No alerts, no crisis.

15
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,397
Just sweet, sweet, silence...

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Okay.

17
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,109
Barry, what's wrong?

18
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,049
Yeah, should we be worried?

19
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,363
It's Iris.

20
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:56,283
She's missing.

21
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,472
Satellites aren't picking Iris up
anywhere in the city.

22
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,776
I'm gonna expand the physical
search radius.

23
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,893
Cecile, anything?

24
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Nothing.

25
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:30,443
I can't sense her either and I've
reached out across a five-state radius.

26
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,862
It's like Iris' mind has just vanished.

27
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,281
Same here, only worse.

28
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:39,619
Barry, Iris isn't registering
anywhere on the planet.

29
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,120
How is that even possible?

30
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,162
It's just like last time.

31
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,291
She's not here anymore,
at least not in this plane of existence.

32
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,669
She must've had another attack.

33
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,380
Now she's lost in time.

34
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:53,508
Okay, well, then we need Deon
to find her.

35
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,233
No one's seen
Deon since he disappeared,

36
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,553
and I can't access
the Still Force without him.

37
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,262
Okay, so...

38
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,307
So what do we do?

39
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:07,605
Okay, okay, it's a long shot, but,
look, when Iris was in Coast City,

40
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,109
it wasn't just her time sickness
that caused her to vanish.

41
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,529
Tinya Wazzo's powers did, too.

42
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,235
I can't believe you're serious.

43
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,767
You really want to try
and bring Frost back?

44
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,749
And I already have a plan.

45
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,646
I'm going to repurpose Eva McCulloch's
R-CEM chip

46
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,798
to replicate Frost's cryo genes
so I can create a new body for her.

47
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,843
Caitlin, I know you're hurting,
so am I, but listen to yourself.

48
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,303
It worked before, it will work again.

49
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:43,182
And what about the thing
that makes Frost... Frost?

50
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,061
I have already identified her latent
empathic genes on my DNA.

51
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,081
I'm talking about a soul
and you give me brain waves?

52
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:54,068
I'm also going to extract
her active imprints from her own DNA.

53
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,713
Look, I've already got the sample.

54
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:59,532
Unfortunately, the keratin in the cells
is decaying a little too quickly, so...

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,202
I'm going to need a better sample.

56
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,204
Are you talking about grave-robbing?

57
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:08,666
It's called an exhumation and I am
a doctor as well as the next of kin.

58
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,712
So getting approval won't be a problem.
We just, we need to do it quickly.

59
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,384
I know how this sounds.

60
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:21,179
Oh, like that old horror movie
<i>Frankenstein Created Woman?</i>

61
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,196
Does Team Flash know
what you're planning?

62
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,435
Didn't think so.

63
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,562
They wouldn't understand.

64
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,772
Neither do I!

65
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,902
Caitlin, have you forgotten that
you literally just tried to resurrect

66
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:36,985
your dead husband?

67
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,614
And it was a complete disaster?

68
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:43,201
No, I haven't, but that thing
was never Ronnie, okay?

69
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:46,496
Deathstorm used a physical form
that I love to try and trick us.

70
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,456
Look, this is different.

71
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,666
The science is solid. Trust me.

72
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,878
Yeah, mad science.

73
00:04:55,296 --> 00:05:01,677
Mark. Mark, Frost was supposed to live
a full and complete life.

74
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,641
You both were, together,
and now that's been taken from you.

75
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,435
Don't you want that back?

76
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,270
What do you think?

77
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,279
You can process losing Frost
in whatever way you need to,

78
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,963
but as far as
all of this is concerned...

79
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,244
count me out.

80
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,903
Tinya, uh, can we talk?

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,196
Why? I don't know you.

82
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:06,826
I'm Barry Allen.
You know my wife, Iris West-Allen.

83
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,704
I'm really sorry,
but she's missing again

84
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:10,947
- and I don't know...
- Again?

85
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,540
Whatever. I don't care.

86
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,709
Your other half ruined my life.

87
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,087
You have every right to be angry.

88
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,005
I need your help.

89
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,216
The first time Iris disappeared,
she was with you.

90
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,178
You mean when I wiped her
out of existence like she did to my mom?

91
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,306
Are you okay?

92
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,145
What the hell?

93
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,315
Mom?

94
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,861
What did you do to my mom?

95
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,906
Tinya, she never meant to hurt anyone.

96
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,240
Well, I did.

97
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,561
Which is why you should back off.

98
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,622
Do you even understand
how your powers work?

99
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,544
Examining how they work could help us
answer what's really happening to Iris.

100
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,964
I don't care about Iris.
God, what is wrong with you?

101
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:07,011
You know, I was fine until Iris found me
and started spewing all that crap

102
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,555
about family and having faith in people.

103
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,268
She made me believe that I could have
the life that I always wanted.

104
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,481
And now that's gone
and it's never coming back.

105
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,067
So welcome to the club.

106
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,557
Deon, thank God.

107
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,227
- Iris is missing.
- Yeah, I know.

108
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:59,855
Yeah, she's in the Still Force. I've
been trying to track her down, but...

109
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:00,897
Hey.

110
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,898
No, don't, don't.

111
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,832
I've been infected
by Iris' time sickness, too.

112
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,825
I need you to find the Isotopic Sensor.

113
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,870
It's the only way we can track down
that particle that I placed inside Iris.

114
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,413
"We"?

115
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,625
Barry, I can't find her alone.

116
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,961
I'm gonna need your help.

117
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:27,967
Okay, but the sensor's damaged.
We're going to need to repair it first.

118
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,467
Okay.

119
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,095
Okay, do it fast.

120
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,014
I'll come back for you after.

121
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,012
This is how we get Iris back.

122
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,305
So you're saying that Deon
wants to do that by bringing you

123
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,329
into the Still Force?

143
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:000
Well, both of us, together.

124
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,336
I thought he said it was too dangerous
for anyone to go in there who wasn't,

125
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,378
you know, a god.

126
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,215
It's risky, but I trust Deon.

127
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,499
And he wouldn't suggest this
if there was any other way.

128
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,219
Well, Deon's right about one thing.

129
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,555
Our satellites can't trace
isotopic particles

130
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,016
across other planes of existence.

131
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,351
That's why we need you
to repair the sensor.

132
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,787
It's the only thing that can locate

133
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,022
Iris' temporal particle
inside the Still Force,

134
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,483
but once we find her, we bring her home.

135
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:27,484
Amen to that.

136
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,780
Not to question a god,
but why would Deon need help

137
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,657
tracking a particle
that he created himself?

138
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:38,621
Deon's not at full strength.

139
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,706
Iris' time sickness
has affected him, too.

140
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,755
Chester, how long will it take
to get the sensor running?

141
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,591
An hour, maybe less,

142
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,301
but Barr, how are you going to

143
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
get inside the Still Force
in the first place?

144
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,239
Deon's going to come back for me
as soon as he can

145
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,743
and we need to be ready when he does.

146
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,976
And you ran this plan past
the other Forces?

147
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:05,022
Nora, Bashir, Alexa,
they're all on board, too?

148
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,527
Uh, no, I haven't been
able to contact them.

149
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,029
Any of them.

150
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,365
And Iris' sickness,

151
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,138
it could have spread to them already.

152
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,703
Which would explain why
they've been radio silent.

153
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:24,083
If that is the case,
then maybe we should all slow down

154
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,752
and figure it out before we launch you

155
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,713
into a place where
we know nothing about, Barry.

156
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:30,797
There's no time.

157
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,886
Look, Joe, Deon is our only chance
at finding Iris.

158
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,640
If he says going into the Still Force
is the answer, then I believe him.

159
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,980
I'm going to get the sensor
from the Starchives.

160
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,186
Meet you in your workshop.

161
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,771
I should get back to CCC.

162
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,773
Got to keep the lights on
until Iris is safe.

163
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,617
- Barr, hold up.
- What?

164
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,412
Look, I am willing to do
whatever it takes to bring Iris home,

165
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,848
but something don't feel right
about this.

166
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,683
It's dangerous,
but we've taken greater risks before.

167
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,501
Yes, we have,
but are you sure about the facts?

168
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,225
Because you seem to be putting
a whole lot of faith in Deon's plan.

169
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,422
Because I know it'll work.

170
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,884
That's what Deon thinks you should do.
What do you think you should do?

171
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,111
That's just it, I don't know.

172
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,135
And Deon does?

173
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:20,306
Look, Joe, I owe Deon this.

174
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,641
As soon as I learned
about Iris' time sickness,

175
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,162
I should have spent every waking moment
trying to find a cure.

176
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,771
Even when she told me to stop pushing,
but I didn't.

177
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,899
Now it's worse,
plus Deon's affected, too.

178
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,861
If there's a chance I can find Iris and
make up for all this, I have to take it.

179
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,255
- Parliament-Runkadelic.
<i>- It's Captain Kramer.</i>

180
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,882
Yes. Yes, ma'am. How can I help?

181
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,801
Chester, I need a full analysis
on an unknown device

182
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,011
we found at a crime scene.

183
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,473
You're not busy saving the world,
are you?

184
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,726
No, no, Captain, your timing is perfect.

185
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,978
Barry's gone to where no man's
been before,

186
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,022
so I'm free to fly solo.

187
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,191
Great. Thanks. I'll see you soon.

188
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,401
Oh, you heard her, Chester P.,

189
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,738
the crime-fighting world
needs your mojo!

190
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,072
Mojo...

191
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,073
Mojo.

192
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,701
Seven out of ten.

193
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:39,134
Oh, damn, moving through dimensions
is getting harder. Is that it?

194
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,553
Yeah, are you sure we can find her?

195
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,891
There's just one thing. Where we're
going, there's only one way in and out,

196
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,726
and it's a bumpy ride.

197
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:52,564
So hang on, because things
are about to get real weird.

198
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,116
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

199
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,535
I've been here before.

200
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,706
- When Iris...
- First got sick, yeah.

201
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,793
Place is like a doorway.

202
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,754
I call it my front porch.

203
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,467
I can see everything from here.

204
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,383
This place is different than before.

205
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,989
Yeah, that's because it's
more dangerous now.

206
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,243
Welcome to the Still Force.

207
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
What's left of it.

208
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,053
Sorry about the mess.

209
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,346
How bad is it?

210
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,683
Ever since Iris got lost here,
things have been mad disorganized.

211
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,227
I mean, night becomes day
in the blink of an eye

212
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,813
and just as fast, it's night again.

213
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,151
And now it's getting worse.

214
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,289
You see, past, present and future
all exist here simultaneously,

215
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:34,375
but now the balance is all out of whack.

216
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:39,921
See what I mean?

217
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,344
All right, now, stay close to me
because if we get separated...

218
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,427
I could get lost, too.

219
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,470
Or worse,

220
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,491
You could get trapped in a dead zone

221
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,517
where time just repeats itself
indefinitely.

222
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
If that happens,

223
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,522
I'd never get you out.

224
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,652
Sensor's picking up Iris' signature.

225
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,248
All right.
Let's ease on down the road, man.

226
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,118
- We're getting close.
- Yeah.

227
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,669
...my decision is not...

228
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:22,673
Oh, one thing, once we find Iris,
let me try and stabilize her first

229
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,836
before we do anything else.

230
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,402
They need to know
what you've been hiding.

231
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,052
- All right.
- Taylor, don't.

232
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,888
This is my life, my decision.

233
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,849
It's not what you think.

234
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,016
I know those voices.

235
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,412
They need to know... They need
to know what you've been hiding.

236
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,979
Taylor, don't... Don't.

237
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,398
This is my life, my decision.

238
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,841
It's not what you think.

239
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,110
They need to know what...
You've been hiding.

240
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,154
Taylor, don't. Taylor, don't.

241
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,448
- This is my life, my decision.
- What is this?

242
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,925
They need to know...
Been hiding.

243
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,993
It's a future moment
that's stuck on repeat.

244
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,745
They need to know what you've
been hiding. They need to know...

245
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,039
They can't move onward and become
part of the past.

246
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,123
My decision.

247
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,291
It's not what you think.

248
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,686
They need to know
what you've been hiding.

249
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,710
Taylor, don't.

250
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,423
My life... My life, my decision.
Taylor, don't.

251
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,715
This is... This is my life.

252
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:05,923
How do we stop it?

253
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,678
We can't, not till we find Iris
and fix this whole place.

254
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,766
Help me.
Someone, please help me.

255
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,647
Help me.

256
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,043
Please, I don't know
what's happening to me

257
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,694
and I have to get back to my daughter.

258
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,153
Renee.

259
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,742
Renee Wazzo, you're Tinya's mom.

260
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,078
Yes, do you know where she is?
I have to find her before...

261
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,458
She's trapped in here, too,
just like Iris.

262
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,333
We have to find her again.

263
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,271
Tinya thought she'd lost her,
but if her mom's alive...

264
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,756
Uh-uh. She's fractured,
just like me and Iris, all right?

265
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,341
We need to stick to why we're here.

266
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,344
Deon, we have to help her. Renee
has been lost in all this for weeks.

267
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,348
Hey! What we need to do is keep moving
or else Iris is history.

268
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,477
She's the key to everything, man.

269
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,273
Iris is close.

270
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:06,984
I can feel it.

271
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,950
Hi, thanks for coming in.

272
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,578
Oh, always happy to tech consult
for Central City's finest.

273
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,333
Also, I am in love with the artwork
in here. Is it, uh...

274
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,168
Indigenous, yes.

275
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,170
It reminds me of home.

276
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:30,967
Nice.

277
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,972
So I'm guessing this is
our mystery machine.

278
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,642
There was an explosion at
a halfway house downtown this morning.

279
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,620
The fire department
secured this from the rubble.

280
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,484
Apparently it was attached
to the water heater.

281
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,604
Was anyone hurt?

282
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,148
Well, that's the strange part.

283
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,278
C.C.F.D. got a call about
an imminent explosion

284
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,823
and by the time they arrived on scene,
everyone had already been evacuated.

285
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,035
Then this released an energy wave
that took out the entire building.

286
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,498
Damn. Folks could have died.
How many people were living there?

287
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,875
Thirty-seven at the time. We got lucky.

288
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,338
Halfway house staff have no idea
who led the evacuation,

289
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,048
so this device is our only lead.

290
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,011
I need to know what it is,
what it does and who built it.

291
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,888
Well, I'm picking up traces
of radioactive particles.

292
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:20,350
This thing was packing serious
kinetic energy before it went kaboom.

293
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,520
Maybe it's some kind of...

294
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,649
Some kind of, like, EMP.

295
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,778
Whoa.

296
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,197
That's quantum coiling.

297
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,868
Captain, whoever built this
got mad skills.

298
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,346
Everything all right, Chester?

299
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,722
Huh?

300
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,268
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,230
I'm as good as a hydrogen-phat sunrise
over Jupiter.

302
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,691
Yeah, I'm...

303
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,238
I'm just, I'm going to take this back to
my workshop and do a full diagnostic,

304
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,717
you know, just to make sure
that everything's totally cool.

305
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,867
If that's fine.

306
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,203
Of course, I'll authorize it.

307
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,496
Okay.

308
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,625
Runk, are you okay?

309
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,461
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

310
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,546
I'm five by five by the wayside.

311
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,590
Just gonna pack up my things.

312
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,211
Vanya's the Editor-in-Chief?

313
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,344
This can't be right. Where is she?

314
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:24,724
What?

315
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,871
Tracing that particle should have
led us right to her.

316
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,605
Yeah, I know, I know, just hold on.

317
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:36,861
Wait.

318
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,238
What are you doing?

319
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,079
What are you doing?

320
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,206
Deon?

321
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,502
We needed that to find Iris.

322
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,380
Sorry, Barr.

323
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:57,882
Gotta bounce.

324
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,023
What the hell?

325
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:29,997
I'm back home again.

326
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,001
With no way out.

327
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:46,431
Shark Stadium erupted in cheers
after XS' heroic save,

328
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,019
even without Impulse,
her partner in crime-fighting,

329
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:54,981
who was too busy partying
to answer his alerts...

330
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,862
Ugh! You are so disgusting!

331
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:08,286
It is clear that XS is the most
daring speedster to appear in years.

332
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,499
Good afternoon, Nora West-Allen.
How can I assist you?

333
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:18,088
Gideon, I need another word
for "daring" that isn't too flowery.

334
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,507
Of course, I have found 27... 27...

335
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,049
Gideon?

336
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,093
Gideon?

337
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,011
Where'd you go?

338
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,098
Nora.

339
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Nor.

340
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,143
Nora.

341
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:44,655
Nora.

342
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,533
Deon?

343
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,910
Is that you?

344
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:54,709
Barry's trapped.
I can't help him, but you can.

345
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,086
Well... Where?
How am I...

346
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,506
Uh...

347
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,303
Oh, schrap.

348
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:23,111
<i>Iris, come on!</i>

349
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,488
<i>This brunch reservation
ain't gonna get any later.</i>

350
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,732
<i>Joe, don't worry,
I'll make sure we're on time.</i>

351
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,493
<i>You guys got
any resolutions for 2022?</i>

352
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,078
I know mine.

353
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,289
More family time.

354
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,133
<i>Holy schrap! Thank goodness
I found you, Dad!</i>

355
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,182
Nora?

356
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,688
This place is messing with me.

357
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,692
Dad!

358
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,365
- Nora?
- Hi.

359
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:11,617
You're really here.

360
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,251
Oh, my God,
I'm a supervillain.

361
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,671
Seriously, that's what
you're worried about?

362
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,300
Okay, then where's your meta-hunting
dagger or your purple head fan?

363
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,177
No, I'm serious, okay?

364
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,887
I'm the bad guy in all of this.

365
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,930
No, you're not.

366
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:37,477
Oh, yeah, Allegra, the microchip that
I found inside that thing was hard-wired

367
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,606
with a one-of-a-kind energy converter
that I created.

368
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,626
But you didn't build this one.

369
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,985
So, so what?

370
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,571
I still went live with the designs
on my blog last month.

371
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,323
What is this, anyway?

372
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,325
It's a quantum coil transformer,

373
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,494
which means it's extremely powerful
and dangerous

374
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,996
if used for the wrong application.

375
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:58,872
You know what?

376
00:24:58,873 --> 00:24:59,959
You were right.

377
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,045
You're right. I should have never
put my designs online.

378
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:08,967
And never will again.

379
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,723
Chuck, you're overreacting.

380
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,516
Should have vetted my online posse.

381
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:21,896
Your posse could be anyone,
but, Chuck, you inspire people.

382
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,315
You don't send them to the dark side.

383
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:25,941
Think about it.

384
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,587
You said there were no casualties
because the person that built this

385
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,613
evacuated the place before it detonated.

386
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,243
Does that sound like a supervillain
or his accomplice?

387
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,079
No, Allegra, but I...

388
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:43,209
Then, believe me when I tell you
we're missing the real story.

389
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,337
And you're one of the good ones.

390
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:51,384
So... have a little faith in yourself.

391
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,019
Dad, how are we supposed
to get out of here?

392
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,644
I don't know.

393
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,150
You shouldn't have followed me here.
You were safer in 2049.

394
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,569
But Deon told me you needed my help.

395
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:10,986
Deon?

396
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,949
Deon's the reason I'm stuck here.

397
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,899
I never should have trusted him.

398
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,749
I mean, you and Mom created Deon,

399
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,712
- of course you're going to trust him.
- I know.

400
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:32,342
Joe tried telling me something was off
and I didn't listen.

401
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:37,722
I was so focused on trying to find
your mom,

402
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,350
I ignored the signs.

403
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:47,232
She's counting on me and I,
I keep letting her down.

404
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,106
I want to tell you something.

405
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:59,369
I mean, you're going to find out
in a few decades anyways,

406
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:04,582
but you know how
the other Nora was a CSI

407
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,417
and was following in your footsteps?

408
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,004
Well, I kind of did the opposite.

409
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,258
I'm a reporter.

410
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,137
And even though I love it, I...

411
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,305
I'm just starting out.

412
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,184
And sometimes I'm, like,
"How does Mom even do this?"

413
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,686
I'm proud of you.

414
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,774
So you're not mad I didn't join C.C.P.D.
like you and Grandpa Joe?

415
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:30,858
Of course not.

416
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,484
I'm just...

417
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,238
I'm glad you found a path
that's right for you.

418
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:45,123
So, the thing is, is that I'm having
a really hard time

419
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,208
finding my voice as a reporter.

420
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:52,046
But Mom is teaching me
to have faith in myself,

421
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,757
and listen to my instincts.

422
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:59,053
And if she were here right now,
she'd tell you to do the same.

423
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,853
And that everyone loses faith
in themselves sometimes.

424
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:07,936
Even heroes.

425
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,399
But learning how to keep
believing in yourself,

426
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,944
when the whole world
is telling you the opposite,

427
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,405
that's what makes a hero.

428
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,535
You really are your mom's daughter.

429
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,078
Well, I'm yours, too.

430
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,416
Maybe it's our belief in each other

431
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,169
that keeps us connected
just as much as the other stuff.

432
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,174
You're right.

433
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,425
We are connected.

434
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:41,930
Not just to our family...

435
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,642
Me and Iris, to the Still Force.

436
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,519
It's like you said, we created it.

437
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,443
Nora, I heard your voice
before you got here.

438
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,406
I think somehow, just for a moment,

439
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:04,911
I connected to the future
before it became a part of the present.

440
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,247
Or the past.

441
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,708
You must already have a piece
of the Still Force inside you.

442
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,752
If I can figure out
how to connect to it again,

443
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,921
and control it this time,

444
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,632
I can get us out of here.

445
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,900
Okay, I'm ready.

446
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,612
Okay. Remember, whatever remnant
of stillness that's inside me

447
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,697
won't be there for long.

448
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:51,124
You look like Uncle Wally when he taught
Bart how to create lightning constructs.

449
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,461
This is also how Wally taught me how to
make contact with the other Forces.

450
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,176
Nothing's happening.

451
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,986
Focus on Mom's brush.

452
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,030
She still has it in the future.

453
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,282
You can use it as an anchor.

454
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,360
What in the world?

455
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,487
In the world...
In the world...

456
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:09,285
Barry, Nora, what are you two doing
in my living room?

457
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,414
Grandpa Joe, you can see us?

458
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,624
Plain as day.

459
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:19,087
Only you're glowing
with some kind of green light.

460
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:25,426
Barry, I thought you were
in the Still Force with Deon.

461
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,805
Dad, whatever you're doing,
it must be working

462
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:32,225
because if Grandpa Joe can see us, too,
the present must be stabilizing.

463
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,770
Barry, can you hear me?

464
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,439
Barry!

465
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:42,692
Barry!

466
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,678
Grandpa Joe's gone.

467
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,139
And so's the brush.

468
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,267
Dad, are you okay?

469
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,443
Nora, the temporal stream.

470
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,741
I can feel pure Still Force energy
moving through me.

471
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,288
I can see the past,

472
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,291
present and future all at once.

473
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,670
I can see Jesse and Harry.

474
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:46,674
Cisco and Frost, too.

475
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,219
I can see Bart's children.

476
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,388
Your wife.

477
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,601
Nora, you're all so happy.

478
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
I see...

479
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:02,731
Max?

480
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,611
I'm getting married?

481
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,030
Who's the lucky lady?

482
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,448
Actually, don't tell me.

483
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,950
I can already feel the spark
inside me fading.

484
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:14,618
Take my hand.

485
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,538
This feels seriously weird.

486
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,697
Let's get the hell out of here.

487
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,214
Where's the exit in this place?

488
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,717
Memorial Park. It's the only way
in and out of the Still Force.

489
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,796
Schrap! What the hell happened?

490
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,130
It's a temporal barrier.

491
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,068
We have to hit it with everything we got
while trying to phase through it.

492
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,089
We're caught in a temporal loop.

493
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,483
Dad, we're never gonna get out of here.

494
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:57,221
You see, the past, present and future
all exist here simultaneously.

495
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,763
Yes, we are.

496
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:01,726
This isn't a time loop.

497
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,354
It's the Still Force pulling us
back into the past

498
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,897
every time we're about to escape.

499
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,274
Well, why would it do that?

500
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:11,652
Deon said the past, present
and future all coexist here,

501
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:15,031
so if we've already escaped,
the only way to stop us...

502
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,408
Is to keep us stuck in the past.

503
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,788
Nora, use the spark I gave you
to focus on the moment

504
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,792
that's already on the other side
of that barrier.

505
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,399
The moment you and I get back home.

506
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,937
<i>Focus on the moment
you and I get back home.</i>

507
00:35:58,866 --> 00:35:59,866
<i>We get back home.</i>

508
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,370
<i>We get back home. Home.</i>

509
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,162
<i>Home.</i>

510
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:37,613
Wait, so you're telling me that you were
able to get out of there

511
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,740
because you already knew you had?

512
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,118
I know, it's totally surreal, right?

513
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:47,331
Barry, is there still a spark of
the Still Force inside of you?

514
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:51,127
Because if that's the case, then maybe
we can use that to help find Iris.

515
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,714
Not anymore. I tried to tap
into it again as soon as we got back

516
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,258
and I must have used every bit I had
to get us out of there.

517
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:01,178
- We'll have to find Iris another way.
- And we will.

518
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:05,891
You know, guys, there's one thing
that I still don't quite get.

519
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,438
Barry, why would Deon
want to trap you in the past?

520
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,523
Yeah, I don't know.

521
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,151
I'm really worried about him.

522
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:19,739
I better get back to 2049.

523
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,116
Make sure Mom's still there
and that she's okay.

524
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,827
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

525
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,954
- We're going to miss you, too.
- Sweet one.

526
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,757
But you're right, we need you there
to keep our family's future safe.

527
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:33,877
Bye.

528
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,925
I miss her and Bart
more and more every day.

529
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,384
Yeah.

530
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,137
And my baby girl.

531
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:48,893
Joe, about earlier,
I should have listened to you.

532
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,228
You know, you were right
about everything.

533
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:55,441
It's okay. We all stumble.
I'm just glad you picked yourself up.

534
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,736
Look, there's something else.

535
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:03,240
When I was in the Still Force
and I tapped into a tiny bit of it,

536
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,579
I could feel Iris, almost see her.

537
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,330
It was like a...

538
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:15,336
A spark of stillness was
inside her, too, that I could sense.

539
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,087
What do you think it means?

540
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:23,260
I'm not sure, but somehow I know,
wherever she is right now,

541
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,261
she's okay.

542
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:51,914
"No problem. Just remember, you can
message me anytime you need help...

543
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,502
...with a project, day or night."

544
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,575
You're feeling better.

545
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,674
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, you were right.

546
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:04,009
Yeah, there was more to the story.

547
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:08,264
And once I started digging, I remembered
where I'd seen this circuitry before.

548
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:13,519
WookieLover77 posted this in
the comments of one of my live streams.

549
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,981
He was asking the Chester Posse
for tips on renewable energy.

550
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,900
- It was all an accident, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

551
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,820
WookieLover77 volunteers
at that halfway house.

552
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,381
He was just trying to provide
the residents

553
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:27,700
with unlimited hot water
from a clean source.

554
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,494
Someone's a believer again.

555
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:32,871
Thanks to you.

556
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,539
You're welcome.

557
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:40,713
So I was thinking, you know,
Marco's birthday drinks are in ten.

558
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,592
How about I buy you a root beer?

559
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,886
You know, to say thanks.

560
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,221
And I could use one myself, actually.

561
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,849
- I would love that.
- Yeah?

562
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,098
It's me. Open up.

563
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:36,310
Go away.

564
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,487
Sorry about that.

565
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,736
I think you're gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

566
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,826
What is wrong with you?

567
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,038
First you blow me off and now you
break into my home.

568
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,429
What? I should...
I should call the Flash?

569
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,709
Well, that's your choice.
Just like this one's mine.

570
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:02,961
I'm going to help you.

571
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,548
And don't worry,
I'll pay for a new lock.

572
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,761
Now, you want to know why
I changed my mind?

573
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,097
Because you were right.

574
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,131
Frost and I were just starting
to build a life together.

575
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,496
And thanks to her, I was finally
becoming the man that I didn't even know

576
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,521
I'd always wanted to be.

577
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,733
Losing her broke me,
but losing her twice...

578
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,194
that'd kill me.

579
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,445
That's...

580
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,507
that's why I was so afraid to help you.

581
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:33,908
So...

582
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,162
If we do this,

583
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:40,124
I need you to promise me one thing.

584
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:44,919
We won't fail.

585
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:49,716
We won't.

586
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,592
I promise.

587
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,639
Let's get to work.
