1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,969
Tohru: Unh! Oh!

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,839
Jade: That's it, big guy.
Only 2 more miles.

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,408
Tohru: Oh, I can't--
I can't make it.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,410
Jade: Can't isn't in our
vocabulary.

5
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,012
Feel the burn!

6
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,680
(Tohru groans)

7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,453
Uncle: Aiiyaa!

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,855
Jackie!

9
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,957
Jade: What is it, uncle?

10
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,127
Uncle: A drum!

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,929
The immortal relic
used to defeat po Kong,

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,598
the mountain demon.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,401
Demon chi has been
activated!

14
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,403
Jackie: Canada.

15
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,872
Stone walls.
Must be Quebec.

16
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,140
It's a walled city.

17
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,474
We'd better move quickly.

18
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,476
After losing
the thunder demon chi,

19
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,912
drago will be
more determined than ever.

20
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,984
(Tohru breathing heavily)

21
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,519
Jade: Going somewhere?

22
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:57,189
Jackie: Canada.
The mountain demon chi
is in Quebec.

23
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,025
Jade: Cool!
I can practice my French.

24
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,128
Croissant, crepe,
creme brulee, baguette.

25
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,297
Tohru: Mmm!
Baguette.

26
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,899
Jade: No baguette, tohru!

27
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,434
Think lean and mean
protein.

28
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:11,670
No bread, no pasta, no rice,
no cookies, no cake.

29
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:12,838
Jackie: No Quebec.

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,440
And no argument.

31
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,909
You have a big math test
tomorrow. Remember?

32
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,710
You stay here with tohru.

33
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,013
Jade: Aww.
Tohru: Ugh!

34
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,455
(Chi-o-matic sputtering)

35
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,356
Jackie: Is it broken?

36
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,393
Uncle: Not anymore.

37
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,100
Jackie: "Ancient rice
and artifacts collection?"

38
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:44,570
Rice?
I thought we were
searching for a drum.

39
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,305
Maybe that thing <i> is</i> broken.

40
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,707
Maybe it's that new
containment jar.

41
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,643
Uncle: Since when are you
the big-time expert?

42
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,780
New containment jar
not a problem.

43
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,748
Uncle made so
device can hold

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,884
more than one
demon chi at once.

45
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:02,888
Does not affect
the way detector works.

46
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,356
Now knock.

47
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,428
French woman: <i> Bonjour.</i>

48
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,363
<i>Comment allez-vous</i>
à <i> aujourd'hui?</i>

49
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,966
Jackie: Maybe we
should have brought Jade.

50
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,935
Jackie: Uh... <i> Bonjour.</i>

51
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,904
My name is Jackie chan,

52
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,273
and this is my uncle.

53
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,276
We are from America,

54
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,980
and we are looking
for an ancient drum.

55
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,781
Do you have one?

56
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,518
French woman:
<i>Bienvenue.</i>

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,986
<i>Entree, entree.</i>

58
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,093
<i>Merci de venir.</i>

59
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,794
<i>Amusez-vous.</i>

60
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,034
Uncle: Uncle knows that people
collect many things...

61
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,903
But rice?

62
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,546
Chopsticks?

63
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,714
Jackie: Wooden chopsticks.

64
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:07,019
Uncle: Carved from ancient
drumsticks, used to play

65
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,454
immortal drum.

66
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,790
Jackie: But which ones?

67
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,832
Drago: Chan fried rice,
anyone?

68
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,436
Uncle: Aiiyaa!

69
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,637
Jackie: Drago!

70
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,006
Drago: I'd say it was
good to see you, chan,

71
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,776
but why start the day
with a big, fat lie?

72
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,517
Jackie: Uncle!

73
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,920
The chopsticks!

74
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,456
We will have to
take them all!

75
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,729
French woman: <i> Qu'est-ce</i>
à <i> que c'est?</i>

76
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,202
Jackie: Watch out!

77
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,007
Uh, you know, I never did
get your name.

78
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,568
Uncle: Aiiyaaa!

79
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,571
Drago: So how would you like
your uncle to be cooked?

80
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,441
Rare, medium
or well-done!

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,747
Jackie: Strike.

82
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,129
Uncle: Maybe uncle
should retire?

83
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,099
Drago: Dead end, old man,

84
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,535
in more ways than one.

85
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,215
(Tohru grunting)

86
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,416
Jade: Come on, tohru.

87
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,584
You need to get
in shape.

88
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,519
No pain, no gain.

89
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,121
Almost there.

90
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,889
(Tohru grunts)

91
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,760
Jade: Perfect! That was one.

92
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,296
Way to push yourself, dude.

93
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,766
Eating right is cool,
you dig?

94
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,035
If you don't,
your butt's too big.

95
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,245
Sorry, pal.

96
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,181
Think lean. But cheer up!

97
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,818
There's a tasty
tofu Patty back home
with your name on it.

98
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,986
(Tohru groans)

99
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,394
Jackie: I don't think
I've ever been so tired.

100
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,195
(Yawns)

101
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,463
Uncle: No yawning!

102
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,664
We have work to do!

103
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,832
(Yawns)

104
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,667
Jackie: I know, I know.

105
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,069
We must find
which chopsticks

106
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,239
contain
the mountain demon chi.

107
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,080
(Uncle yawns)

108
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,882
(Grunts)

109
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,283
Jackie: You falling asleep!

110
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,851
Uncle: Stop pointing finger!

111
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,686
You are the one
falling asleep!

112
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,888
Jackie: No, I am wide awake!

113
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,424
But you, you are doing this!

114
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,092
(Imitates yawn)

115
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,393
Uncle: Not sleeping.

116
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,795
Resting eyes.

117
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:13,732
But maybe tea will help you
keep yours open.

118
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,635
Uncle will put kettle on...

119
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,703
In just a minute.

120
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,372
(Both snoring)

121
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,142
(Stomach growls)

122
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,813
(Stomach growls)

123
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,215
Tohru: I heard you
the first time.

124
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,083
(Both snoring)

125
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,691
Tohru: Ohh, I hate fish...

126
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,092
And tofu Patty.

127
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,464
Mmm. Yummy
pork fried rice.

128
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,766
No. Jade said I
should not have rice.

129
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:51,002
One bite couldn't hurt.

130
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,940
Jade.

131
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,478
Hmm.

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,879
Pretty.

133
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,357
(Drago growls)

134
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:17,429
Drago: I can't believe we're
back in this lame junkyard!

135
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,565
The space needle lair,
gone!

136
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,168
The thunder demon chi,
gone!

137
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,171
And any faith I ever had
that you 3 were

138
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,108
strong enough to beat
Jackie chan, gone!

139
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,376
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, dude,

140
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,978
step off the blame game.

141
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,212
It wasn't our fault.

142
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,248
Drago: Then whose fault
was it?!

143
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,116
Mc cobra: Yours?

144
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,890
Drago: You wanna
guess again?

145
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,691
Mc cobra: Nah. I'm cool.

146
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,663
Drago: I'm through losing
everything to Jackie chan.

147
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,431
I want that
mountain demon chi.

148
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,934
And then it's
payback time.

149
00:08:55,936 --> 00:09:00,338
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be
something chan's never
gonna forget.

150
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,140
Hear what I'm sayin'?!

151
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,544
But first thing's first.

152
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,612
Strikemaster ice:
Uh, are we supposed
to follow him or what?

153
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,813
Both: Huh?

154
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,283
Jade: 5 pounds?!

155
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,417
Uncle: Aiiyaa!

156
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,585
Jackie: Mommy!

157
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,887
Jade: How did you gain
5 pounds in 2 days?

158
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,959
You've been cheating
on your diet, haven't you?

159
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,427
Haven't you?!

160
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,029
You know what that means.

161
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:27,332
Tohru: No! No, please.
Not push-ups.

162
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,633
Jade: Drop and give me 20!

163
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,502
Tohru: That scale's
an antique.

164
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,970
Perhaps it is defective.

165
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,905
Uncle: Nothing in
uncle's shop is defective!

166
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,507
(Chi-o-matic sputters)

167
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,309
Jackie: Make that
<i>almost</i> nothing.

168
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,777
Uncle: Detector
not defective,

169
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,313
just temperamental.

170
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,648
Now hurry and dig
through the chopsticks.

171
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,985
We are behind schedule
because you fell asleep.

172
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,320
Jackie: So did you.

173
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,856
Uncle: Uncle merely
resting brain.

174
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,529
Jackie: How is it possible?

175
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:00,398
None of these chopsticks
contain the demon chi?

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,601
Uncle: Maybe you
dropped pair?

177
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,469
Jackie: I did not drop
anything.

178
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,072
Besides you were the one
holding the bag.

179
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,341
Just admit it.
I'm right.

180
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,377
That machine of yours
has gone haywire.

181
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,114
Uncle: Uncle not saying yes.
Uncle not saying no.

182
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,617
Uncle not saying haywire.

183
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,986
Uncle will run test.

184
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,487
Happy?

185
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,712
Jade: You've got to be
kidding me!

186
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,782
7 more pounds
in one day?

187
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,851
don't even try to tell me
you're not cheating,

188
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,052
'cause I know you are!

189
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,254
Tohru: I may have been...
Snacking.

190
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,522
Jade: On what, concrete?

191
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,925
Uncle: Aiiyaa!

192
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:04,262
Uncle's been robbed!

193
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,832
Jackie: What did they take?
Ancient carvings,
rare paintings?

194
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,569
Uncle: Bagels!

195
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,238
Jackie: Bagels?
Jade: Bagels.

196
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,109
Uncle: Doughnuts, soup,
hummus, everything's gone!

197
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,478
Jackie: What kind of thief
steals only food?

198
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,280
Uncle: Hungry thief.

199
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,581
Calling police.

200
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,851
Put out apb for uncle's
cream cheese.

201
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,320
Jackie: Uncle, the police
don't have time

202
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,655
to track down your--

203
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,590
Jade: Besides there
<i>is</i> no thief.

204
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,159
It was just tohru...

205
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,061
Cheating on his diet.

206
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,129
He's gained 7 pounds
since yesterday!

207
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,131
Tohru: Maybe I'm retaining
a little water.

208
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,668
Jade: Yeah, maybe you're
retaining the pacific ocean.

209
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,772
Drago: <i> This</i> is more like it!

210
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:51,342
The right crib
- makes all the difference.

211
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,311
Strikemaster ice:
Place rocks, d-man!

212
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,580
Mc cobra: Yeah, and these
night vision things

213
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,715
are off the hook!

214
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,216
Drago: If you think
this is sweet,

215
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,985
just wait'll we bring it
to the chans!

216
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,220
Strikemaster ice:
Bring on the hurt...

217
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,555
Mc cobra: Bring on the pain!

218
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,591
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
so what's the plan, d-dude?

219
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,160
Drago: Surprise attack
on the antique shop

220
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,462
owned by chan's uncle.

221
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,964
Strikemaster ice: Cool.
Hit 'em on their own turf.

222
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,933
Drago: We're gonna take down
the chans,

223
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,002
take down section 13,

224
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,005
and then all the demon chi
will finally be mine!

225
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,143
It's gonna be my turn
to call the shots!

226
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,244
Strikemaster ice:
For reals, homes.

227
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,012
Security guard:
Hey, who's in there?

228
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,453
Drago: We don't need any
unnecessary heat right now.

229
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,654
Meeting adjourned.

230
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,857
don't forget the swag.

231
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,562
Jackie: Uncle,
it's very late.

232
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,964
Are you all right?

233
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,198
Uncle: Uncle is fine.

234
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,801
And so is chi detector.

235
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,338
Chopsticks do not have
mountain demon chi.

236
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,206
Jackie: Then
where did it go?

237
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,149
Jade: I knew it.

238
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,450
He is so weak.

239
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,064
Whoa! So not nutritious.

240
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,000
Tohru: Food!

241
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,569
Jade: Aah! Aah! Jackie!
Uncle!

242
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,739
Uncle: Why can't niece
use indoor voice?

243
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,682
Jade: Told ya. It's like he's
a giant trash compactor.

244
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,883
(Jackie gasps)

245
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,921
Uncle: Not trash!
Priceless antiques!

246
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,959
Drago: Approaching
target of opportunity.

247
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,861
200 yards and closing.

248
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,563
Continue stealth mode.

249
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,099
Mc cobra: Why is he talkin'
into the headset?

250
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,267
Yo, we're right here.

251
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,802
Strikemaster ice:
Dude's into protocol.

252
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,271
Drago: The chans will
never see this coming.

253
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,106
Or anything else
ever again.

254
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,942
Take no prisoners.

255
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,020
Jackie: I don't know
how it happened,

256
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,057
but tohru must have absorbed
the mountain demon chi.

257
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,258
Jade: Ya think?

258
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,793
Uncle: Aiiyaa!

259
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,795
Han dynasty noodle cabinet!

260
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:28,199
Tohru, uncle's shop is not
an all you can eat buffet!

261
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,269
No! Stop!
- Not Tibetan prayer table!

262
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,805
Cost uncle small fortune!

263
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,307
Jackie: Uncle!
Forget about the table!

264
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,277
We need to remove
- the demon chi from tohru.

265
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,246
Uncle: How about plastic
mahjong set?

266
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,948
Much better for digestion!

267
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,763
Jade: Whoa. Looks like tohru's
done with the appetizers.

268
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,832
Jackie: And moving on
to the main course.

269
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:05,036
Uncle: Uncle's afraid
today's special is
San Francisco!

270
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,613
Jade: Hurry! We must remove
the mountain demon chi
from tohru

271
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:19,217
before he turns
the entire city
into breakfast!

272
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,088
All: Whaa! Hyah!

273
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,791
Drago: Game over, chan!

274
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:32,697
Strikemaster ice: Whoa!
Looks like somebody already
crizzashed this partay!

275
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,765
Mc cobra: Drag.

276
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,434
Drago: Grrr!

277
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,838
I smell demon chi.

278
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,288
Jackie: Tohru, stop!

279
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,491
Jade: Whoa! He is so
gonna have heartburn.

280
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:04,429
Uncle: Too far away.
Must get closer!

281
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,365
Jackie: Aah!

282
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,233
Oh, no! Not now!

283
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,170
Ow!

284
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,539
Bad day, bad day.

285
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,452
Jade!

286
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,965
Uncle: Aiiyaa!

287
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,571
Jade: Aah! Aah!

288
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,573
Tohru: Jade.

289
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,577
Jade: Aah!

290
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,787
Drago: It's over, chan!

291
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,657
Your family tree is
about to be chopped down!

292
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,861
Strikemaster ice: Whoa!
Earthquake?

293
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,397
Jade: Tohru quake!

294
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,532
(Tohru grunting)

295
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,801
Tohru: Arrgh!
(Snorts)

296
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,669
All: Aah!

297
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,641
Drago: Yo, jolly green
freak show!

298
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,777
You've got something
that belongs to me,

299
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,079
and I want it back!

300
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,716
(All grunting)

301
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,832
Uncle: Jackie!
The blowfish!

302
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,736
Jackie: Whoa!

303
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,276
Jade, stay here.

304
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,011
Jade: This time,
I think I will.

305
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:07,185
(Uncle chanting
in Chinese)

306
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,386
Jackie: Uncle!

307
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,654
Wait!

308
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,789
If you remove the mountain
demon chi from tohru,

309
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,257
he will be crushed!

310
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,676
Jackie: No! Tohru!

311
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,180
Tohru: Ugh!

312
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,017
Drago: Ha ha ha ha ha!

313
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,819
Ha ha ha ha!

314
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:48,126
(Uncle chanting in Chinese)

315
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,894
Drago: No!

316
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,632
Drago: You're
gonna pay for that!

317
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,134
Uncle: Uncle doesn't
have cash.

318
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,635
How about I.O.U.?

319
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,803
(Chanting in Chinese)

320
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,005
Drago: Aah!

321
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,107
(Uncle chanting)

322
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,610
Tohru: Ugh!
What's happening?

323
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,312
Jackie: Uncle is trying to
remove drago's fire power.

324
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,714
Jade: Yes!

325
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,217
(Uncle chanting)

326
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,723
Drago: Aghh!

327
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,957
Ugh!

328
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,026
My fire power!

329
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,929
This isn't over!

330
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,098
Jackie: Actually...
I think it is.

331
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,768
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
don't sweat it, d-man.

332
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,737
We got your back!

333
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,081
Jade: Ooh!
Uncle really put drago's
fire breath on ice!

334
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,584
Jackie: And now
- section 13 will finally have

335
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,388
all the demon chi powers
under control.

336
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,790
(Tohru burping)

337
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,292
Tohru: Ooh, sorry.

338
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,927
Must've been
something I ate.

339
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,596
Jade: Yeah, well, I hope you
enjoyed your little binge,

340
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,766
'cause from here on out,
I have 2 words for you.

341
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,801
Celery sticks.

342
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,003
And don't think that
just because you
saved us and everything

343
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,307
you get to skip your
workout tomorrow, 'cause
that's not gonna happen.

344
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,142
Tohru: Unhh!

345
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,317
Jade: Hey, Jackie, have you
ever flown a plane?

346
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,018
Jackie: Actually, I did.

347
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,555
Not the commercial one,
of course, the private jet,

348
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,125
with the pilot
and the copilot
let me to drive.

349
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,262
But I'd really like to learn
helicopter.
