1
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:50,030
Good morning, Presage employees.

2
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,371
We hope you're all ready for our exciting
team-building retreat.

3
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,750
Please enjoy your breakfast...

4
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,379
...and then make your way to the bus,
which will leave shortly.

5
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,711
Hey, Sam, when I said, would you put
breakfast together for the retreat?

6
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:03,923
...I meant, like, some stale doughnuts,
some coffee.

7
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:05,428
But this is amazing.

8
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:09,262
Thanks, man. Just remember that when you
see my sales report for last month.

9
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,846
Oh, I saw it last night.

10
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,053
Shit. Has Dennis seen it?

11
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,472
Not yet.

12
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:16,936
Look, you just need to make a decision,
you know?

13
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:20,352
Are you going to be "chef" or are you
going to be "sales guy"?

14
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,690
I am saying that as your friend because,
as your boss, I am ready to fire your ass.

15
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,735
As your friend, I appreciate that advice.
Good.

16
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,573
Inside my baby's room

17
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,457
Hold on, man, I will be right back.

18
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,377
Yeah, I guess I am doing okay

19
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,583
I moved in with....

20
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,717
Molly. Your ticket's canceled.

21
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:46,382
Tell me that's a mistake.

22
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,179
I was going to tell you after this weekend.

23
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:49,969
Uh, tell me what?

24
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:53,305
That I don't think it's such a good idea.

25
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:57,473
What, the trip? It's my brother's wedding.

26
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,316
What's going on here?

27
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,318
We should talk about this later.
Let's just....

28
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:06,323
What, pretend like I didn't see this for the
next two days? No, let's talk about this.

29
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:08,324
It's not working out, Sam.

30
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,370
We're not working out.

31
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:17,534
Hey.

32
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,420
Hey. Oh, it's, uh, Candice, right?

33
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,793
Not funny. Oh.....

34
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:27,177
Okay, sorry, this is not a vacation.
Okay, this is a business retreat.

35
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,963
So we're going to be all business
for the next two days.

36
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,302
Sorry.

37
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:34,308
I love you, but doesn't change the fact
that you're still an intern.

38
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:41,858
Oh, um, but that 12:30 curfew tonight?
You should plan on breaking that.

39
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,064
Why?

40
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:46,321
For the naked team-building.

41
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,672
Hey, Olivia.

42
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:06,128
Don't forget these.

43
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:09,636
Oh, yeah. I keep trying to.

44
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,593
- Hmm.
- I like it. It's very Lisa Loeb.

45
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:14,099
Oh, well, you know...

46
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:18,433
...I'd rather be very Olivia.

47
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,188
We got a gig on Sunday.

48
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,690
Yeah, I will be there.

49
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,559
Morning, Peter.

50
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,233
- Looking good.
- Uh, hi.

51
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:30,569
Olivia. Have you slept
with every hipster in town yet?

52
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,451
Candice. Do you actually get paid
for this internship...

53
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,863
...or does Daddy
just increase your allowance?

54
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,954
You know, if you want to get rid of that
baby fat, you should try the gym.

55
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:42,665
They have these workout machines
that you use on your back.

56
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:43,919
You're good at that.

57
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,002
Sweetie, it's not fat.

58
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,218
They're called tits.

59
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,549
You're not looking so hot there,
Moll-face.

60
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,967
Gee, thanks.

61
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,019
Did you try the little jam-bread whatever
your boyfriend made?

62
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,648
I got to tell you, he's a pre.... Uh-oh,
that's what it is, is it? Did I touch a nerve?

63
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:06,560
- Just leave me alone, Isaac.
- Hey, Moll? Moll? Look at me.

64
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,429
If you ever need anyone to talk to...

65
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,403
...I have been told I am a good listener
by a lot of ladies. Shh, wait.

66
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:15,569
Tell me this is Kimber from last Tuesday.
Wait, I am sorry, which Kimber is....?

67
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,487
Hey, let's sit next to each other
on the bus.

68
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,533
No, no, I remember you.
You were, like, a bigger gal, right?

69
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,118
You know what you should do?
You should apologize.

70
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:25,082
- Why?
- Doesn't matter.

71
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:28,231
Never matters.
I am sorry, because I....

72
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:29,423
Oh, shit.

73
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,263
Hey, Stan, how's it going?

74
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,474
Uh, it's Sam, sir.

75
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,930
Did you just correct me?

76
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,680
No.........

77
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:47,934
Look at me.

78
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,398
- What's my name?
- Dennis.

79
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:50,938
Look away.

80
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,321
All set, Pete?

81
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,983
Yes, sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.

82
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,824
What's the one thing
we can't recycle, Pete?

83
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,078
Wasted time, sir.

84
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,453
Exactly. I want to be on the road
in 90 seconds.

85
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:05,243
Uh, well, I just saw his car,
so I will go track him down.

86
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,663
Way to show some initiative, Stan.

87
00:08:07,663 --> 00:08:09,581
It's going to be a good day.

88
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,089
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.

89
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,466
What's up, bud?

90
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,305
Why you riding Nate so hard, man?

91
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,816
You know,
I am just trying to make sense of it here.

92
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:30,523
Three weeks ago they brought you in
as assistant plant manager...

93
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:35,236
...and now you got a day off?
It's not a day off. It's a re... re...

94
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,991
Re... re... what? Retarded?

95
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,119
It's a retreat.

96
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,448
I don't want to go. 
I am just following orders.

97
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:45,618
- So if you don't like it, then you can....
- I can what? What? I can what?

98
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,169
Nathan, hey. Come on, man,
we're all waiting for you.

99
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,964
- Yeah, okay.
- Now, hold on. What you going to say?

100
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,716
What you going to say?

101
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:58,255
I got 15 years on you here. You got, what,
four years in some classroom upstate?

102
00:08:58,255 --> 00:09:00,094
Listen, if you think
I am going to sit here....

103
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:03,100
Not a good idea, Roy.
Not a good idea, man.

104
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,431
We're fine for the day.

105
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,642
Why do you let him get away with that?

106
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,356
No choice. He's the union rep.

107
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:15,614
I fire him and suddenly
I have got a factory full of Roys.

108
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,025
But I will win him over, 
even if it kills me.

109
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,072
What about you?

110
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,863
When are they going to offer you
that permanent gig at the restaurant?

111
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,248
- They already did.
- Dude, that's great.

112
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,498
I don't know, man.

113
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:30,379
I mean, they want to send me
to the flagship restaurant in Paris...

114
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,086
...for who knows how long?
Could be six months, could be a year.

115
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,501
I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.

116
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,594
Although now I am not so sure.

117
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:45,226
Well, look, if you do go to Paris,
do me a favor.

118
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:47,808
- What's that?
- Take Roy with you.

119
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:49,063
Aw, hell, no.

120
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,613
Hey, Sam.

121
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,115
You coming?

122
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:04,870
Yeah.

123
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:13,460
Get ready for a new
adventure at 180 Corporate Consulting.

124
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,926
For the next two days, you will be tested,
both physically and mentally...

125
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,428
...to help you reach your true potential...

126
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:23,090
...through working as part
of your corporate team.

127
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,727
This weekend, a professional will guide you
to achieving better results...

128
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,770
What are those for?

129
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,435
Oh, it's, um, just something I do
to relax me. And for luck.

130
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:39,861
Gymnasts are worse than baseball players
at this kind of thing.

131
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:41,149
She's superstitious.

132
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,036
Hey, Katrina, how you doing?

133
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:49,457
Nah, just this stupid retreat thing
with the idiots from the office.

134
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,869
No, no, no, not you, sir. Them.

135
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,085
Hold on a sec, let me go someplace
a little more private.

136
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:59,126
Bald's the new black, sir.
Bald's the new black.

137
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:03,263
Yeah, no, hang on a sec, babe. Just
going to head on back to my private office.

138
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,092
The right-hand side.

139
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,074
Whew.

140
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,392
Ow. Damn it.

141
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,100
For management,
the valuable skills necessary...

142
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,611
...for being a good leader will be
cultivated through a variety....

143
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,773
Dust in the wind

144
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:47,233
All we are....

145
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,998
We will tie it off from the far side.

146
00:12:57,998 --> 00:12:59,253
Oh, whoa.

147
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:01,373
Whoa, what the hell?

148
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:07,462
- Peter, did you feel that?
- What?

149
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,431
Something's wrong.

150
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:28,782
Look out.

151
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,071
- Molly, come on.
- Candice.

152
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,699
- Go.
- Go, go.

153
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,411
Candice. Candice.

154
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:40,669
Peter.

155
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:43,623
Peter. Peter.

156
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,301
No, Candice. Aah.

157
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:53,512
No.

158
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,263
Peter. Come on, Peter, let's go.

159
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,477
Molly, come on.

160
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,147
What the fuck?

161
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,778
Oh, no. No. No.

162
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:12,615
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

163
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:31,466
Oh, shit.

164
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:40,020
Over here. See the railing?

165
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:52,909
You can do this. Let's go.

166
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:55,865
Let's go. Do it.

167
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:57,701
You can do it. Don't look down.

168
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,786
Good. Good.

169
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:14,754
Run.

170
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,051
Help me.

171
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,719
- Sam.
- Olivia.

172
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,349
Olivia.

173
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:23,560
- Sam.
- I am right here. I am right here. Okay.

174
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,770
It's coming loose.

175
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:29,570
- Do you feel it? All right.
- Olivia, come on.

176
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,233
It's okay, it's safe. Now you have just
got to follow this to Molly's voice, all right?

177
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,902
Come towards me.
Come on, you're almost there. Come on.

178
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,290
Come on.

179
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,789
- Come on. Come on.
- Molly.

180
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,009
No. No.

181
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,605
- Aah.
- Olivia.

182
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,114
Sam. Wait for us.

183
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:15,950
Oh, my God.

184
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,109
Sam.

185
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:21,072
Aah. Sam, be careful.

186
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,479
Sam.

187
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:48,809
Peter. Hurry.

188
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,818
Sam. Sam.

189
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:58,784
Sam.

190
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:17,716
Hold on.

191
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,428
Come on, come on.

192
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:33,482
Sam, hold on.

193
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:43,613
No. Peter.

194
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,557
Ow. Damn it.

195
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:10,439
...as well as define controls and procedures.

196
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,270
We will help you build a culture
of corporate ethics by defining...

197
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,566
Dust in the wind

198
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,277
....risk management process.

199
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,031
We all got to get off.

200
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,912
What are you talking about?

201
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:31,624
- The bridge is going to collapse.
- What?

202
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,788
- We're all going to die.
- What the hell is going on?

203
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,423
We're all going to die
if we don't get off this bridge now.

204
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,928
Stan, relax, it's just some construction.

205
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,974
Molly, please. Please, God, follow me.

206
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:46,975
Open the door.

207
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,892
This is a major liability issue. If something
happens to them, it's on us, you get that?

208
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:55,901
- Yeah.
- Then go get that.

209
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,696
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, all right.

210
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,819
Hey, Sam? Molly?

211
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,949
- Peter, please, just follow.
- Come on.

212
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:05,157
Okay, everybody just calm down.

213
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:07,447
- I am going to go help.
- Please don't.

214
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,160
Hey, guys, come on.

215
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:10,620
Let's go.

216
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,627
Sam, just get back on the bus.
We can talk about it.

217
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,788
Molly, Sam, come on, guys.

218
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:22,295
Did he seem weird to you
when he got on the bus?

219
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,179
No, he was fine. It's like he just snapped.

220
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,012
- What's going on?
- What the hell is going on out here?

221
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,268
We should, uh...

222
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:38,652
Holy shit.

223
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:40,279
Get off the bus.

224
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,374
Come on.

225
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,272
How did you know?

226
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,825
That's the big question here.

227
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,289
How did you know?

228
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,209
It says right here in your statement:

229
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:38,917
I saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen.

230
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,672
That sounds premeditated to me.

231
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,708
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

232
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:47,383
I had a vision.

233
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:50,346
Okay. A vision.

234
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:53,557
Psychic phenomena, ghosts, Bigfoot.

235
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:55,687
You actually believe in that stuff?

236
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,893
I don't know.

237
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:01,356
I will tell you what I believe:

238
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:03,396
There's an answer for everything.

239
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,065
There's an answer for why
you knew to warn everyone...

240
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:09,702
...the bridge was going to collapse,
and minutes later, it did.

241
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:14,161
I told you, I saw it coming.
I don't know how.

242
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:15,620
I just did.

243
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,419
And no one else did?

244
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,208
Like I said, it just came out of nowhere.

245
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,967
Did Sam have issues with authority?

246
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:28,880
Did he ever demonstrate
any sort of extremist behavior?

247
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,630
No.

248
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:34,468
Wait. Extremist behavior?

249
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,725
You mean like a terrorist?

250
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:40,437
You see him talk to anyone that morning?
On a cell phone, pay phone?

251
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:41,942
Just his girlfriend.

252
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:45,571
His ex-girlfriend, I mean. Molly.

253
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,573
- But that was in person.
- Molly.

254
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,822
Ex.

255
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,578
Tell me about the breakup.

256
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:56,786
Was he upset? Scale of 1 to 10.

257
00:21:57,491 --> 00:21:58,913
It's personal.

258
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,790
You must have been pissed, right?
Getting dumped like that.

259
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,958
What does that have to do
with anything?

260
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,011
I am just trying to get all the pieces
of the puzzle together...

261
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,343
...before I start moving them around,
making them fit.

262
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,929
Look, I just had a hunch that something
bad was going to happen. That's it.

263
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:21,982
Excuse me.

264
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,146
Forensics came back with the analysis.

265
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:30,032
- And?
- They're chalking it up to high winds...

266
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,158
...and structural damage
from the construction.

267
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:33,661
High winds?

268
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:35,787
Yeah. Send everyone home.

269
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,490
You're free to go.

270
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,339
I have a feeling
we will be seeing each other again.

271
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,843
Call it a hunch.

272
00:22:57,301 --> 00:23:00,396
Authorities are calling
the North Bay Bridge collapse...

273
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:02,352
...a freak act of nature...

274
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:07,190
...citing a highway improvement project
that may have weakened the superstructure.

275
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,324
Among the survivors were eight employees
of Presage Paper...

276
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,530
...on their way to a business retreat.

277
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,037
The other 17 employees
were killed in the collapse.

278
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,040
And although they have been branded
the lucky eight.....

279
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,329
...the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future.

280
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:45,398
Hey, guys.

281
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:46,683
Hey.

282
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:47,897
Hey.

283
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,740
Anybody know
when this thing's supposed to start?

284
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,243
When Dennis gets here, I guess.

285
00:23:58,028 --> 00:23:59,701
That agent still hounding you?

286
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:04,369
No. You heard the news,
it was natural causes.

287
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,704
Yeah, more like supernatural.

288
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,966
How you holding up? I tried calling.

289
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:14,470
No, yeah, I saw. I was just tired....

290
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,757
So?

291
00:24:19,383 --> 00:24:21,101
How did you explain it?

292
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,272
I didn't.

293
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:27,479
I couldn't.

294
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,439
Sam, there had to be a reason.

295
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,979
Heh. That is exactly
what the agent kept saying.

296
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:39,612
Whatever answer you're looking for,
I don't have it.

297
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,122
Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.

298
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:45,660
We should all just put it behind us
and be grateful we're still alive.

299
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:50,957
Definitely beats the alternative, right?

300
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:53,008
I look out at the faces today...

301
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:56,797
...and I see family members, friends.

302
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:02,180
But the people that left us on the bridge
that day, they were more than that.

303
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,849
People like Jennifer Alcott...

304
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,478
...Chris Boylan...

305
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,310
...David Buckler.

306
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:14,605
Maybe you worked next to them.

307
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,490
Maybe you worked for them.

308
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,448
But we all worked with them, huh?

309
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,701
Who can forget Trevor Wino's smile?

310
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,872
Or Isaac Palmer.

311
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:30,079
Did he just say my name?

312
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,673
- That's not funny.
- I know, I am sorry.

313
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:36,756
I just get weird with tragedies. 
I am sorry.

314
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,013
I see dead people.

315
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:43,012
Guys.

316
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,690
Death...

317
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:57,698
...doesn't like to be cheated.

318
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,609
Excuse me?

319
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,201
What's that supposed to mean?

320
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,038
You all just be careful now.

321
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:11,374
Okay. Thanks for the advice.

322
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:13,538
Creepy guy.

323
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,524
How's that foie gras, Sam? 
Waiting on you.

324
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:53,913
Wasted like a drunk
She drank, drunk, drunk

325
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,797
Stop it

326
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:57,424
It's not forgotten

327
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,297
Thanks.

328
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:00,676
Got my dessert?

329
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,099
What's the matter with it?

330
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,481
Said it was flat. No flavor.

331
00:27:13,724 --> 00:27:15,647
- Do they want something else?
- Yeah.

332
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:16,981
The check.

333
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:21,865
Let me taste it.

334
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,749
The customer is an asshole.
The bourguignon is good.

335
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:44,630
Hold on.

336
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:58,860
You mind if I come in?

337
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,942
Yeah. Sure.

338
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:12,161
Thanks.

339
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:14,122
I thought you'd be working tonight.

340
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:17,504
Yeah. You know,
I worked the first shift, but...

341
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:20,795
...there was something else I needed to do.

342
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,132
- Can I...?
- Oh.

343
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:30,926
Yeah. Sure, go ahead.

344
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,856
Thank you.

345
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:28,613
Listen...

346
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,822
When everything started going down
on that bridge...

347
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,748
...the only thing I thought about
was you.

348
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:41,921
Getting you to safety.

349
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,089
You are the only thing
I care about, Molly.

350
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,469
Whatever's wrong, I can fix it.

351
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:54,054
You haven't done anything wrong.

352
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:57,103
Then, what? What is it?

353
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,644
Paris.

354
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,433
We talked about that.

355
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:06,447
I am not going to uproot my life,
leave you, for that job.

356
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:09,108
But it's the only thing
you have ever dreamed of.

357
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:13,825
Life is too short, Sam.

358
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,581
You have to go after what you love.

359
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:18,791
I am.

360
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:25,290
You should take the job.

361
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,503
Go to Paris.

362
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,524
- Hey.
- Hey.

363
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:49,109
What's the matter?

364
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,822
I don't know. I am not ready.
I don't feel ready.

365
00:30:52,822 --> 00:30:56,454
It's been really hard to concentrate
after everything.

366
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,786
Yeah? Are you sure?

367
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,788
Yeah.

368
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:03,830
Because this is the last practice
before the championship.

369
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,502
And it's your last practice
of your college career.

370
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,417
I know, but...

371
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,254
I think you got this.

372
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:15,299
- Really?
- Yeah.

373
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,268
I mean, you love it out there.

374
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,347
Okay. You're right.

375
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,732
And besides, coach would kill me. Heh.

376
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:25,483
Yeah.

377
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,734
Here.

378
00:31:28,812 --> 00:31:30,359
Thanks.

379
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,694
Come here.

380
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:35,451
Bye.

381
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,993
You got this.

382
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:52,986
You have to get a little more speed.
You got to hit that follow-up.

383
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:59,309
- I am sore from the back extensions.
- Really?

384
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:06,729
Okay, seriously, this is stupid.

385
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:09,395
They have got to make it cooler
or we're going to pass out.

386
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,108
They're working on it.

387
00:32:11,108 --> 00:32:13,365
Well, they should have it fixed by now.

388
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:39,383
Come on, Candice. You're up.

389
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,065
Come on, Candice. You got this.

390
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:20,383
Candice, now.

391
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:29,937
Really strong value on this.

392
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:43,117
Hey, coach. How was that?

393
00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:05,886
I want to see you guys
run the routine all the way through once.

394
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:25,284
- That's good.
- Whew.

395
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:27,495
All right, Janine next. Let's go.

396
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:29,955
Let's go, ladies, and drink water.

397
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:35,920
That's it.

398
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,376
Every time, Candice.

399
00:34:42,823 --> 00:34:45,175
- There you go.
- Thanks.

400
00:34:45,175 --> 00:34:47,265
Nicely done, Candice.

401
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:53,645
Okay, go to bars.

402
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:55,936
Come on. Hit the floor. You can do it.

403
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:00,361
Go hard this time, Candice.

404
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,742
Let's be aggressive.

405
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:07,580
Here we go, Candice. Stay loose.

406
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,208
Okay, Porter, it's your turn.

407
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,078
Stay focused.

408
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:15,351
Good.

409
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:23,593
Looking good, Candice.

410
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,466
Candice? Candice?

411
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,930
- Oh, what happened?
- Don't touch her.

412
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,811
Someone call 911.

413
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:12,971
Candice?

414
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:36,161
Peter.

415
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,268
I came as soon as I heard.

416
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,557
She was doing great.

417
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:03,610
She was almost finished with her routine
and then...

418
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:12,614
Why did it happen?

419
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,835
This doesn't make any sense.

420
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,712
I don't know, man.

421
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:25,502
I am sorry. I am so sorry, Peter.

422
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:41,066
Let's just go, Sam.

423
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:56,833
Hey.

424
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:59,081
How's it going?

425
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,955
It's weird.

426
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,586
Being here, I mean.

427
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,549
It's just so quiet.

428
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,891
Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls
rerouted to corporate.

429
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,929
Yeah, well, it's depressing.

430
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,401
Holy crap. Did you guys
get your bereavement pay yet?

431
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,190
Hey, what's he doing here?

432
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:32,447
I think he just needed the distraction.

433
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:34,078
Yeah.

434
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:36,952
Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.

435
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,205
Guess we all should have seen
that coming.

436
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:43,876
What?

437
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:47,918
You see the crazy shit those gymnasts do.
I am surprised it doesn't happen more often.

438
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,592
Once you have handled the e-mail

439
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:54,633
you will need to deactivate all the 
key cards of the deceased employees.

440
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,301
Instructions are in your binder.

441
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:59,767
Well, shouldn't that be the job
of the facility manager?

442
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,565
The facility manager's dead.

443
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,477
Dennis, you want me to fly someone
up there?

444
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:07,983
No, no, I got it.

445
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:16,821
Aw, Debbie.

446
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:24,958
You were so naughty.

447
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,140
Fuck it.

448
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,233
Robert, my man.

449
00:39:58,655 --> 00:39:59,952
Ow.

450
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,876
Shit.

451
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,760
You shouldn't have, buddy.

452
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:25,640
Hey, man, what are you doing up here?

453
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,402
Had to get off the factory floor, man.
Roy's driving me crazy.

454
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,738
So, uh, who wants one?

455
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:34,023
Where'd you get these?

456
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:38,320
I stole it out of Roy's truck.
Ha, ha. It's good, right? Ha, ha.

457
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,988
I got something better.

458
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:42,035
Ooh, nice one.

459
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:43,745
Yeah, count me in.

460
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,078
Are you sure you want to share that?

461
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:51,299
If I don't, I will end up drinking it alone,
which is just sad.

462
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,044
Well, this day just got way more fun.

463
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,517
No, I did call you.

464
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:13,321
Of course. I just called you
right now, didn't I?

465
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,278
Because I really do
want to take you out again.

466
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:19,445
Yeah, yeah, we will do, like, a nice
romantic dinner.

467
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,113
You know,
somewhere maybe outside the city.

468
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,532
Hold up.

469
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:29,079
You know what? I got to go.

470
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,418
No, no, no. I am not blowing you off.

471
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:35,256
Hey, listen. Hey, who's my girl, Kimber?

472
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,170
Amber, yes, that's what I said.

473
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,383
Excuse me.

474
00:41:44,343 --> 00:41:49,474
Amber? Amber, I am sorry, wait a second.
Is that weird sound on your end or my....?

475
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:54,316
Sorry about that. My, uh, sister
tends to get a little chatty sometimes.

476
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:56,322
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

477
00:41:56,322 --> 00:42:00,486
So tell me about stress relief.

478
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:04,281
And what does this really get me?

479
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:07,166
This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.

480
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,623
Like massage therapy?

481
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:12,706
Erotic massage?

482
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,795
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional.

483
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:21,931
Hey, that's great. I prefer a professional.
In fact, you know what? I kind of demand it.

484
00:42:21,931 --> 00:42:27,813
I am just trying to clarify, though, that 
this professional experience ends, uh...

485
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:30,848
...happy.

486
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:35,937
I know exactly what you need.

487
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:38,152
Oh, I am sure you do.

488
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:40,487
- Follow me, please.
- I'd love to.

489
00:42:40,487 --> 00:42:42,027
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

490
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,786
Slow down there a little bit.

491
00:42:43,786 --> 00:42:46,824
Yeah. Yeah, you have
a lovely little Canter.

492
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:53,000
Yum yum, dim sum.

493
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,539
Hold up there a second.

494
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,174
All right, these are solid.
Just making sure.

495
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,506
Tend to be a bit noisy,
if you know what I mean.

496
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,806
Ha, ha. Yo, Buddha.
Slow down on the rice cakes.

497
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:14,021
- Just close your eyes.
- Mm-hm.

498
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:15,435
- Relax.
- Ooh.

499
00:43:15,435 --> 00:43:20,277
And someone will be in
to service you soon.

500
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:22,362
Oh, yeah.

501
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:36,706
Oh, yeah.

502
00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:38,216
Feels dynamite.

503
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:42,299
No, no. You're going the wrong way there,
little lady.

504
00:43:45,173 --> 00:43:46,516
Oh.

505
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,678
Wait a second, what happened
to the younger version of you?

506
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:56,233
Okay, I am sorry.
Do you come with subtitles?

507
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,445
Maybe I should go.

508
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:02,527
Don't know what that means. 
No idea. Yep.

509
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:03,277
Ow.

510
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:05,364
Fuck.

511
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,160
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay, I am all right.

512
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,195
Holy shit, you're strong.

513
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,783
What are you doing? Ow.

514
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:14,293
What are you doing? Ow.

515
00:44:14,293 --> 00:44:15,874
You're a little aggressive.

516
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,457
What's "capay"?
I don't know what that means.

517
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:22,214
I don't want a "foo-hay." 
No "foo-hay." Aah.

518
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,513
Cheers.

519
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:31,978
Mm.

520
00:44:38,017 --> 00:44:39,189
Shit, that's my ride.

521
00:44:39,189 --> 00:44:40,945
Shit. I got to go.

522
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:42,856
Leaving more for us.

523
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,283
All right, well, more for me.

524
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:54,575
All right, bye.

525
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,084
- See you later.
- Okay.

526
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:57,291
Later.

527
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,923
This is the end,
so, what are we toasting to?

528
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:02,880
To, uh, finding new jobs.

529
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,420
Because it's only a matter of time
before they shut us down.

530
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,260
- Hear, hear.
- Oh. To starting over.

531
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,061
Peter?

532
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:19,601
It just doesn't make sense.

533
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:22,611
She dies doing something
that she's done...

534
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:25,694
...almost every day
for the last 15 years of her life.

535
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,364
She said she didn't want to do it.

536
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:31,780
She said she wasn't ready.

537
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,368
And I should have stopped her.

538
00:45:37,243 --> 00:45:38,995
I should have done something.
I should have....

539
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:41,505
Peter, there wasn't anything
you could have done.

540
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,672
How do you know?

541
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,804
I am sorry. I am sorry.

542
00:46:02,143 --> 00:46:05,989
Hello, Agent Block? This is Dennis.

543
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:09,993
Yeah, Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know what.

544
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:11,653
Does that mean anything?

545
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:14,242
You told me to call if I saw anything odd.

546
00:46:14,242 --> 00:46:19,912
I don't know yet, but thank you, Dennis,
and call me if you see anything strange.

547
00:46:19,912 --> 00:46:21,499
Stranger.

548
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:25,963
Should we maybe have code names
for one another, do you think?

549
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,587
Over and out.

550
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:33,758
All right, ahem,
show me how this happened.

551
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,135
I don't think I can.

552
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:37,895
What do you mean?

553
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:43,652
I mean, I could try it a hundred times and
never re-create exactly what happened here.

554
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:46,608
This is some freaky shit.

555
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:58,620
God.

556
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,252
Oh, that actually felt great.

557
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,632
Oh, yeah. Awesome.

558
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:13,590
Oh...

559
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:17,677
Wait. Are those things even sterilized?

560
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:21,143
No, no. I am not catching any diseases
unless I have earned them.

561
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:31,608
Wait a second. You understood that.

562
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:34,743
You speak English.

563
00:47:37,738 --> 00:47:39,035
Oh.

564
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:47,089
All right, you know what?

565
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:50,127
Let's do this.
Two billion people can't be Wong.

566
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,129
I said Wong. You follow me?

567
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:54,638
You get it, you're Chinese.

568
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:02,429
Ow, ow. Okay, it's in. It's definitely in.
Ow, okay, yes, it is in.

569
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,853
How many of these are you going to
put in me?

570
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:21,957
Oh, uh, hey,
can you grab that for me? Thanks.

571
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:24,956
Hey.

572
00:48:27,496 --> 00:48:29,373
That's not very nice, you know.

573
00:48:42,103 --> 00:48:44,680
Okay, your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes.

574
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,520
I am not going to lie, 
it's a little annoying.

575
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:50,478
Once again, Chinese lady,
I don't have a clue what you're saying.

576
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,615
Thirty minutes. You sleep.

577
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:07,336
Sleep.

578
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,447
Oh.

579
00:49:36,315 --> 00:49:39,489
Hey. Fire.

580
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:40,209
Hello?

581
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:42,742
Hey.

582
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,620
Hey. Hey.

583
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,161
Hey, there's a fire in here.

584
00:49:48,744 --> 00:49:50,246
Hey, there's a fire.

585
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,332
Get in here.

586
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,687
Oh, shit.

587
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,009
You should come with me.

588
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:20,670
To Paris? Yeah, you know,

589
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:24,466
you said it yourself.
Like, you're going to have to start over.

590
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,347
Start over with me.

591
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:31,605
How many drinks have you had?

592
00:51:31,605 --> 00:51:34,734
Enough. Molly, I am serious.

593
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:39,068
Look, you were right.
If I don't take the job, I will regret it.

594
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,282
But I am not willing to lose you.

595
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:44,990
Why does it have to be
one or the other?

596
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,363
I am better when you're with me.

597
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,209
Uh, guys, you're not going to believe this.

598
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:07,266
They're saying it was a freak accident.

599
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:09,518
Yeah, raise your hand
if you believe that.

600
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:12,851
Who dies during a massage? Seriously.

601
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,145
First Candice, now Isaac.

602
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:17,150
It can't be a coincidence.

603
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:19,069
It's not.

604
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:20,983
Where are you going?

605
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:23,816
It's that creepy dude.

606
00:52:23,816 --> 00:52:26,781
Why are you following us?

607
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:29,113
Who are you?

608
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,960
You were at the cemetery,
then the gym, now here.

609
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:36,374
What are you doing?

610
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:38,289
My job.

611
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:49,383
What's happening to us?

612
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:55,560
What makes you think I know anything?

613
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,895
You warned us.

614
00:52:57,516 --> 00:53:00,440
At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.

615
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,651
It's just that I have seen this before.

616
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,611
You have seen what?

617
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:08,152
A lucky few survive a disaster.

618
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:13,370
And then one by one,
Death comes for them all.

619
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,336
You changed things on that bridge.

620
00:53:17,336 --> 00:53:22,591
There's a wrinkle in reality.
And that wrinkle is you.

621
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:25,173
So, what, we're doomed to die?

622
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,171
I mean, is that it?

623
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,929
We just got our lives back,
so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?

624
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:32,809
Are you saying that we can't stop this?

625
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,721
You were supposed to die on that bridge.

626
00:53:36,263 --> 00:53:38,311
You're not supposed to be here.

627
00:53:39,141 --> 00:53:40,859
You shorted Death.

628
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:43,817
So you let Death
have somebody else in your place...

629
00:53:43,817 --> 00:53:46,983
...and then you take their spot
in the realm of the living.

630
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:50,995
All the days and years
that they have yet to live.

631
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,748
And they take your place in death.

632
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,500
Then the books are balanced.

633
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,630
Wait a minute. We kill someone, we get
their life? Is that what you're telling me?

634
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:04,087
I don't make the rules.

635
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:10,302
I just clean up after the game is over.

636
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:25,191
Maybe that's why
Candice and Isaac are dead.

637
00:54:25,604 --> 00:54:28,858
They weren't supposed to survive,
and now it's coming after the rest of us.

638
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:30,066
No.

639
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:33,111
No, not all of us.

640
00:54:33,779 --> 00:54:35,622
Molly made it, she didn't die.

641
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:37,124
What?

642
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:42,668
Well, when I had that vision,
or premonition, or whatever it was...

643
00:54:43,872 --> 00:54:47,046
...I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.

644
00:54:47,046 --> 00:54:48,335
You survived.

645
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,720
You saved her?

646
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,554
Why, because you decided that she
deserved to live more than the rest of us?

647
00:54:54,554 --> 00:54:57,515
That's not what he's saying. I don't
deserve to live more than anyone.

648
00:54:57,515 --> 00:54:59,351
You deserve to live
more than Candice.

649
00:54:59,351 --> 00:55:00,685
Whoa, Peter, hang on.

650
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:03,226
No, look, guys, come on.

651
00:55:03,226 --> 00:55:05,360
You're not drinking the Kool-Aid,
are you?

652
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,773
Killing people
to survive Death's list. Really?

653
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:13,619
I may not know what's going on,
but it's not what that guy's selling.

654
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:16,826
Yeah? What else is it, then?

655
00:55:21,076 --> 00:55:22,874
Shit.

656
00:55:22,874 --> 00:55:24,413
We need to tell Olivia.

657
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,377
Come on.

658
00:55:30,419 --> 00:55:31,966
My forms are all signed.

659
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:35,429
I see that it's been quite a while
since your first consultation.

660
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:37,935
What made you decide
to take the leap today?

661
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:42,356
Uh, well, a lot is going on in my life and

662
00:55:42,356 --> 00:55:45,734
I just don't want to miss anything...

663
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:47,190
...you know, important.

664
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,025
Same reason I had it done myself.

665
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:53,317
- Come on in back. Let's get you started.
- Okay.

666
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:55,410
Oh.

667
00:55:59,907 --> 00:56:02,877
Yep, that's the first step.
You will never need those again.

668
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,674
Here we are. Come on in.

669
00:56:20,218 --> 00:56:21,265
What's with these?

670
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:25,065
Oh, just for some of
our younger patients.

671
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,229
And, um, sometimes our older ones too.
Come on.

672
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,453
What was that?

673
00:56:42,453 --> 00:56:44,209
Relax.

674
00:56:44,209 --> 00:56:47,212
You know, it looks a lot worse
than it really is.

675
00:56:47,212 --> 00:56:51,717
Okay, I am gently going to
position your head...

676
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:54,924
...and I want you to tell me...

677
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,923
...when this feels snug.

678
00:56:57,923 --> 00:56:59,512
I can't move my head.

679
00:56:59,512 --> 00:57:02,519
Perfect. Just what we want.

680
00:57:04,513 --> 00:57:06,436
There we go.

681
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:10,228
Okay, now comes the fun part.
Here comes a drop.

682
00:57:10,978 --> 00:57:14,824
And you will feel a little numbness
in your eye...

683
00:57:14,824 --> 00:57:16,450
...which is a good thing.

684
00:57:32,499 --> 00:57:33,796
Deep breath.

685
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:39,844
Relax.

686
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:47,688
Very good.

687
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:55,564
Thattagirl.

688
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,291
There.

689
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:09,169
That's not so bad, is it?

690
00:58:21,256 --> 00:58:22,758
Looks good.

691
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,235
- What was that?
- Just relax, Olivia.

692
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:35,862
I am just going to enter some data into...

693
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,367
Dottie.

694
00:58:42,736 --> 00:58:44,113
Dot.....

695
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:46,953
Do you know what?
My assistant's given me an incomplete file.

696
00:58:46,953 --> 00:58:48,867
I will be right back.

697
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:52,997
Hold on, you're leaving?

698
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:26,322
Is that supposed to be happening?

699
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,867
Help me.

700
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,506
Olivia Castle. Where is she?

701
01:00:21,506 --> 01:00:22,794
She might be in danger.

702
01:00:22,794 --> 01:00:25,339
She's fine.
We do this kind of procedure all the time.

703
01:00:33,388 --> 01:00:35,561
Help me.

704
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,859
Help me.

705
01:00:56,328 --> 01:00:58,171
This has never happened before.

706
01:01:02,918 --> 01:01:04,545
Sam.

707
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:07,927
Stay with me tonight, please.

708
01:01:09,049 --> 01:01:10,892
Of course.

709
01:01:15,764 --> 01:01:17,812
Five different systems had to go wrong...

710
01:01:17,812 --> 01:01:21,854
...for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly. Five.

711
01:01:21,854 --> 01:01:23,772
What do you want from us?

712
01:01:23,772 --> 01:01:26,237
I want you to tell me
what you think is going on.

713
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:29,118
Two deaths? Okay, all right.
That's a coincidence.

714
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,156
Three? That's a pattern.

715
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,670
Now...

716
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:49,677
...I know you two didn't do this.

717
01:01:50,882 --> 01:01:52,179
All right?

718
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:55,929
But I think you know something.

719
01:01:58,598 --> 01:01:59,770
What is it?

720
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,320
We don't know anything.

721
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:07,191
Take a guess.

722
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,533
We think we weren't supposed to survive
on that bridge.

723
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:18,914
What?

724
01:02:19,577 --> 01:02:23,878
And now something
is trying to set it right.

725
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,127
"Something"?

726
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,513
That's all you got?

727
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:31,931
Right now, yeah.

728
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:37,558
But if you come up with any 
other explanations, let us know.

729
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,351
Thank you.

730
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:50,363
"Something."

731
01:02:59,284 --> 01:03:00,456
Hey.

732
01:03:02,454 --> 01:03:03,876
Been up long?

733
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:10,675
Uh, I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
I just kept thinking about the bridge.

734
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:17,345
Sam, you can't do this to yourself.

735
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:21,481
No. No, no, no. I was thinking about,
in the premonition...

736
01:03:22,307 --> 01:03:26,403
...we all got off the bus,
but the ground gave way and Candice fell.

737
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:29,523
Then the bus tipped over.

738
01:03:30,648 --> 01:03:33,697
And Isaac, he never got off the bus.
He went with it.

739
01:03:33,697 --> 01:03:35,237
What are you getting at?

740
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:38,532
I know that there was just
so much going on...

741
01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:42,411
Look, I know that I helped you across.

742
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,796
Then I reached back for Olivia.

743
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:48,717
But she didn't make it. She fell.

744
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:53,964
So first was Candice.

745
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,847
Then Isaac.

746
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:00,311
Then Olivia.

747
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:03,557
They're dying in order.

748
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,560
Who dies after Olivia?

749
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,639
Roy, would you come
to the control room, please?

750
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:47,525
Uh-oh, Roy, that's the boss.
You in trouble, Roy.

751
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:06,328
Okay, schoolboy,
what do you want to talk to me about?

752
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:09,293
- What is with your timecard?
- Let's talk about my timecard.

753
01:05:09,293 --> 01:05:11,925
You cut my hours,
which means you cut my pay.

754
01:05:11,925 --> 01:05:13,255
I cut everyone's hours, okay?

755
01:05:13,255 --> 01:05:16,547
Corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over.

756
01:05:16,547 --> 01:05:18,715
My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.

757
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,385
- My dumb kid ain't operating at 50 percent.
- Roy.

758
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:24,646
My ex-wife, she's taking 50 percent,
so I will tell you what I am going to do.

759
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:25,930
No, we got to move, man.

760
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:29,442
- Hey, I am not going anywhere. Hey.
- Look, we got to move. Got to move.

761
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:30,898
We got to move now.

762
01:05:40,987 --> 01:05:43,240
Roy. You okay down there?

763
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:49,454
- Hey, Dennis?
- Hey.

764
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:53,591
They're closing us down.

765
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:55,047
They're shutting down the plant?

766
01:05:55,047 --> 01:05:59,511
Not the plant, just us.
Just sales and administration.

767
01:05:59,511 --> 01:06:01,345
Can you believe it? Us?

768
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:03,681
It's the factory guys
that usually get laid off.

769
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:05,390
Not us, we're supposed to be safe.

770
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:07,931
Yeah, Dennis, we got bigger problems.

771
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,517
Olivia and Isaac are dead.

772
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:12,610
Who's Isaac?

773
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,864
Isaac Palmer, tech support.

774
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,192
Wasn't he dead already?

775
01:06:18,192 --> 01:06:19,735
No, Dennis.

776
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:25,245
Listen, it's going to happen to us too
if we don't do something about it.

777
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:29,210
Yeah, I understand.
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.

778
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:33,465
No. No, guilt doesn't kill you.

779
01:06:33,465 --> 01:06:35,591
Obviously, you have never met my in-laws.

780
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,548
I am not fucking around here, Dennis.

781
01:06:38,002 --> 01:06:39,595
Anyone could be next.

782
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,382
It could be you. Understand?

783
01:06:42,382 --> 01:06:44,017
Nobody's safe.

784
01:06:44,017 --> 01:06:45,722
What are you talking about?

785
01:06:48,012 --> 01:06:50,731
We weren't supposed to survive
that bridge collapse.

786
01:06:50,731 --> 01:06:53,769
And so now it's kill or be killed.

787
01:06:54,352 --> 01:06:56,525
You get that, Dennis?

788
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:58,694
Whatever.

789
01:06:58,694 --> 01:07:01,700
I warned you.
Do whatever you want to do.

790
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,248
I will.

791
01:07:12,036 --> 01:07:14,334
Hey, Agent Block, it's Dennis. Um....

792
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:18,422
Listen, Pete just came in here
and he's just completely lost it.

793
01:07:18,422 --> 01:07:21,464
He's yelling about "kill or be killed."

794
01:07:21,464 --> 01:07:24,553
Oh, yeah,
it definitely sounded like a threat.

795
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:42,616
What happened?

796
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:45,699
I don't know. I don't know.
It just happened so fast.

797
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:48,581
- Nathan. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

798
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:52,415
- We heard, and we thought....
- No. No, uh, I am good.

799
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:54,788
Did you kill him?

800
01:07:55,163 --> 01:07:56,289
What?

801
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:59,050
No. No, I just....

802
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,087
It was just timing, you know?
He got in the way and....

803
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:03,550
No, you did, didn't you?

804
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,092
You saw it coming, and then you took
his life. You put him in the way.

805
01:08:07,092 --> 01:08:08,885
No, I didn't really do anything.

806
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:11,896
Tell us the truth: Did you or didn't you?
Hey, Peter, calm down.

807
01:08:11,896 --> 01:08:13,432
Did you or didn't you?

808
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:18,315
Did you or didn't you?

809
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:22,152
Yes. I think I did.

810
01:08:22,982 --> 01:08:24,234
I killed him.

811
01:08:25,151 --> 01:08:28,325
So if the theory works,
then you traded spots.

812
01:08:28,325 --> 01:08:32,163
He should have your death,
and you should have his years.

813
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,206
How do we know for sure?

814
01:08:34,206 --> 01:08:36,246
I think there's an order to these deaths.

815
01:08:37,664 --> 01:08:40,634
They mirror the order everyone died in
on the bridge.

816
01:08:40,634 --> 01:08:42,590
Then who would be next?

817
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,673
Who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened?

818
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:48,178
Who is it, Sam?

819
01:08:48,178 --> 01:08:49,388
Who's what?

820
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:57,184
Dennis. It was Dennis.

821
01:08:57,642 --> 01:08:59,610
No shit.

822
01:09:00,645 --> 01:09:02,397
Jesus.

823
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,493
Why are you fighting me on this?

824
01:09:07,493 --> 01:09:10,030
You're not seriously going to work,
are you?

825
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:14,497
Molly, Isaac died on a massage table.

826
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:17,333
If Death is going to come for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.

827
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:19,247
You have to do something.

828
01:09:19,247 --> 01:09:22,133
- What, kill someone so I can live?
- No, of course not.

829
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:25,045
We will just have to
figure something else out.

830
01:09:25,045 --> 01:09:27,305
I have figured it out.

831
01:09:27,755 --> 01:09:30,725
Something saved me on that bridge.

832
01:09:30,725 --> 01:09:32,726
Maybe it doesn't want me to die.

833
01:09:35,054 --> 01:09:36,522
Maybe.

834
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:39,560
We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.

835
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:46,237
So if it happens tomorrow,
or 50 years from now, whatever.

836
01:09:46,237 --> 01:09:48,618
As long as we're together...

837
01:09:49,861 --> 01:09:51,078
...I will be okay.

838
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:56,625
Right? Why don't you come by
after my shift...

839
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,878
...and I will make you
a nice late dinner, okay?

840
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,013
All right, give me this.

841
01:10:17,972 --> 01:10:20,225
Excuse me.
We don't have to wait for them, do we?

842
01:10:20,225 --> 01:10:22,689
- I will let you know.
- Okay, thank you.

843
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,865
To the girl on the run

844
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:39,877
Veal's ready, take it out.

845
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:42,130
Samuel. Get to work on the bourguignon.

846
01:10:50,463 --> 01:10:51,680
Whoa.

847
01:10:52,089 --> 01:10:53,136
Pan coming through.

848
01:10:54,759 --> 01:10:56,432
Whoa, watch yourself.

849
01:11:07,188 --> 01:11:09,532
- Okay. Meat's in. Pick it up, eh?
- Yes, sir.

850
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,082
Whoa.

851
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:24,088
That could have been ugly, huh? Ha, ha.

852
01:11:24,088 --> 01:11:26,921
Yeah. Could have been.

853
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,298
Vincent, speed it up, okay?

854
01:11:40,638 --> 01:11:41,935
Whoa, hey.

855
01:12:05,496 --> 01:12:07,498
Hey, clean that grate.

856
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:18,969
- Just met your girlfriend.
- Oh.

857
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:22,059
Are you sure it's okay
if I make her a little something?

858
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,728
Make sure to clean up afterward.

859
01:12:24,728 --> 01:12:27,644
I will, of course. Thank you.

860
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:30,313
And, chef...

861
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:33,775
The apprenticeship.

862
01:12:33,775 --> 01:12:36,444
If the offer still stands...

863
01:12:36,444 --> 01:12:37,954
...I'd like to take it.

864
01:12:39,614 --> 01:12:41,116
It's yours.

865
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,306
Okay, no more suspense.

866
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:01,139
What you have been waiting for.

867
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:05,356
Wow. You're going to help me
with this, right?

868
01:13:05,356 --> 01:13:06,982
Yeah, sure, if you want me to....

869
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,643
No? You don't want me to...?

870
01:13:09,435 --> 01:13:10,607
So how's your French?

871
01:13:11,103 --> 01:13:13,356
Heh. Terrible.

872
01:13:13,356 --> 01:13:17,197
Oh, good. Well, then,
we can be terrible together.

873
01:13:17,197 --> 01:13:20,534
- Why?
- I took the internship.

874
01:13:20,534 --> 01:13:24,621
What? Sam, that's amazing.

875
01:13:27,995 --> 01:13:29,793
I am so proud of you.

876
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:49,726
- Peter.
- Hey.

877
01:13:51,519 --> 01:13:54,568
You okay, man?
You look a little, uh, upset.

878
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:58,655
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a rough couple days.

879
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,034
Yeah. Yeah, for everyone.

880
01:14:02,989 --> 01:14:04,866
For some more than others.

881
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:07,080
Do you mind if I come in?

882
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,587
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, come in.

883
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,753
Here, have a seat.

884
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,179
Thanks.

885
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:24,594
Hey, Peter.

886
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,559
Hi, Molly.

887
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:46,161
Peter, can I get you anything to eat?
I can make you up some pasta.

888
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:50,286
Uh, no. No, no, no. I am good.
Uh, thank you.

889
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,630
Uh, I am sorry. I just thought....

890
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:56,383
It's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.

891
01:14:57,001 --> 01:14:59,470
Yeah, you know,
I am surprised I am here at all.

892
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,302
Uh...

893
01:15:02,302 --> 01:15:04,308
Still alive, I mean.

894
01:15:04,308 --> 01:15:05,810
I am next to go, right?

895
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:08,809
It's me and then you, isn't it?

896
01:15:11,599 --> 01:15:16,446
Anyways, uh, I was up all last night,
you know...

897
01:15:16,446 --> 01:15:19,778
...thinking about if I could really do it.

898
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:24,199
- Do what?
- Take someone else's life.

899
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:29,618
If I could actually kill some stranger,
replace their life with my own.

900
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:32,499
And I thought about it and....

901
01:15:33,287 --> 01:15:35,289
....I convinced myself that...

902
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,167
...yeah, I could.

903
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,259
So I went on a walk.

904
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:46,175
You know, nowhere in particular but

905
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:49,221
every couple of minutes,
an opportunity would just present itself

906
01:15:49,221 --> 01:15:52,185
Heh. Like clockwork.

907
01:15:52,598 --> 01:15:55,693
I could just grab somebody
and pull them into an alley.

908
01:15:56,268 --> 01:15:59,863
Or just shove somebody off a curb
into traffic.

909
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:02,028
You know?

910
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:04,155
It'd be real easy.

911
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:09,449
Peter, what did you do?

912
01:16:17,164 --> 01:16:19,587
- Did you...?
- No, I didn't.

913
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:24,551
I couldn't.

914
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:26,556
I realized that...

915
01:16:26,556 --> 01:16:29,639
...I couldn't kill somebody
that didn't deserve to die.

916
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,441
And I thought about Candice,
and I thought, wait a minute.

917
01:16:36,475 --> 01:16:39,399
Candice didn't deserve to die.

918
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:44,116
Olivia didn't. Dennis didn't.

919
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,493
I don't.

920
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:49,701
Do I?

921
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:52,078
No, of course you don't.

922
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:56,457
Well...

923
01:16:57,621 --> 01:17:03,754
...none of us deserve to die,
then why is it...

924
01:17:05,045 --> 01:17:08,015
...that you deserve to live, Molly?

925
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,222
You said it yourself...

926
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:13,600
...you don't.

927
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:20,018
Go.

928
01:17:21,437 --> 01:17:25,988
Repeat, shots fired.
Requesting backup. 1026 Washington.

929
01:17:26,734 --> 01:17:30,113
Hide and I will distract him.
When you can, go.

930
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,707
Not done yet, Sam.

931
01:17:36,368 --> 01:17:37,665
Where is she?

932
01:17:39,705 --> 01:17:43,460
Where is she?
I am not going to let you hurt her, Peter.

933
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,465
You're going to have to kill me first.

934
01:17:45,465 --> 01:17:47,842
Well, that doesn't do me any good.
Heh, heh.

935
01:17:47,842 --> 01:17:49,257
Death's after you too.

936
01:17:49,257 --> 01:17:51,801
This is crazy, Peter. Don't do this.

937
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:56,563
Just think for a minute, all right?

938
01:17:56,563 --> 01:17:58,315
You are not a killer.

939
01:17:59,683 --> 01:18:01,310
I don't want to kill anybody, Sam.

940
01:18:04,688 --> 01:18:05,905
I don't want to die yet either.

941
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,124
Heh. It's not your time yet.

942
01:18:24,124 --> 01:18:26,297
Don't worry, Molly...

943
01:18:28,462 --> 01:18:30,009
...I didn't kill him.

944
01:18:32,466 --> 01:18:36,487
But I didn't need to, Molly because...

945
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,359
...because Death
is going to do that for me.

946
01:18:41,809 --> 01:18:44,187
Doesn't mean I can't help it.

947
01:18:46,146 --> 01:18:47,864
That's it.

948
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:33,485
- Are you okay? What's going on?
- It's Peter. He has a gun.

949
01:19:38,032 --> 01:19:39,705
Oh, my God.

950
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,796
You killed him.

951
01:19:52,171 --> 01:19:53,673
It's Sam's turn.

952
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,231
Peter, just go.

953
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:05,818
You have Block's life, you're safe now.

954
01:20:06,685 --> 01:20:08,153
Please.

955
01:20:08,395 --> 01:20:10,272
I am sorry, Molly.

956
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:15,194
But you just witnessed the murder
of a federal agent.

957
01:20:17,863 --> 01:20:22,369
And I am not going to spend
the life I just earned in prison.

958
01:20:33,837 --> 01:20:36,465
Molly, go. Go get help.

959
01:21:04,243 --> 01:21:06,621
You son of a bitch.

960
01:21:44,658 --> 01:21:47,878
Tell Candice I love her.

961
01:21:48,245 --> 01:21:49,292
Peter.

962
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,404
It's gone. You killed him.

963
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:21,032
So does that mean I get Block's life?

964
01:22:26,033 --> 01:22:27,535
Yeah.

965
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,120
I guess I do.

966
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,596
Do you mind if I take the window seat?

967
01:22:48,013 --> 01:22:51,062
You're going to make me sit in the middle?
Uh-huh.

968
01:22:51,062 --> 01:22:53,398
- I am like twice your size.
- Not really.

969
01:22:53,398 --> 01:22:55,562
- All right.
- Sit down.

970
01:22:55,562 --> 01:22:58,073
- I will remove him.
- Fuck you. I will remove myself.

971
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,449
Get off him.

972
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:00,860
Settle down.

973
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,905
- Come on, Browning. Come on, you punk.
- Get off the plane.

974
01:23:03,905 --> 01:23:06,540
Get off the plane. You don't understand.

975
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:09,499
Everybody just stay where you are.

976
01:23:10,702 --> 01:23:14,332
- What's all that about?
- I have no idea.

977
01:23:14,332 --> 01:23:18,227
Ladies and gentlemen, we will be pulling
away from the gate as soon....

978
01:23:23,715 --> 01:23:24,807
Here we go.

979
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:27,557
The cabin lights
have been dimmed for takeoff

980
01:23:52,744 --> 01:23:55,338
With curiosity

981
01:23:56,748 --> 01:24:00,218
Dust in the wind

982
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:13,683
Sorry about that.

983
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:18,271
Oh, excuse me.

984
01:24:18,271 --> 01:24:23,113
Those passengers who got off the plane
earlier, what was that all about?

985
01:24:23,113 --> 01:24:25,949
A kid had
a panic attack and wanted off the plane.

986
01:24:26,278 --> 01:24:28,201
Said he had some kind of vision.

987
01:24:29,072 --> 01:24:30,415
No.

988
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:33,626
Oh, my God.

989
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,587
Sam.

990
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,362
I got you.

991
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:14,497
- Sam.
- Molly, hold on.

992
01:25:16,078 --> 01:25:17,125
No.

993
01:25:19,164 --> 01:25:19,914
No.

994
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:46,737
Nice of you to come, Nathan.

995
01:25:46,737 --> 01:25:50,237
I know Roy wasn't the easiest 
guy to work with. Yeah.

996
01:25:50,237 --> 01:25:51,614
You know.

997
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:53,908
I still can't believe he's gone, though.

998
01:25:53,908 --> 01:25:56,543
Yeah. Yeah, no kidding.

999
01:25:56,543 --> 01:25:58,554
I guess it was for the best.

1000
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:00,455
What do you mean?

1001
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:03,796
Company did an autopsy
for insurance purposes.

1002
01:26:03,796 --> 01:26:07,054
Turns out Roy had an enlarged
blood vessel in his brain so big...

1003
01:26:07,054 --> 01:26:10,466
...it was about to burst.
They said he'd be dead any day now.

1004
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:12,976
Nothing lasts forever but the...

1005
01:26:12,976 --> 01:26:14,762
Any day?

1006
01:26:15,721 --> 01:26:16,768
Life's a bitch.

1007
01:26:16,768 --> 01:26:18,728
Dust in the wind

1008
01:27:59,157 --> 01:28:02,411
You all just be careful now.
