1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,170
SARA: <i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,551
<i>and all of history is vulnerable
to attack,</i>

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,225
<i>which is why we must travel through time
to stop the spread of</i>

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,430
<i>these so-called Time Aberrations
and to erase their damage to history.</i>

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,599
<i>We are a team of outcasts and misfits,</i>

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,986
<i>so, please, don't call us heroes,
we're something else.</i>

7
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,236
<i>We're legends.</i>

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,398
GIDEON:
<i>Previously, on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

9
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,573
EOBARD: <i>It's a compass.</i>

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,118
Either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,116
COURTNEY:
<i>The Spear could alter reality itself.</i>

12
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,955
We broke it into four separate pieces.

13
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,035
<i>Mr. Hunter took one...</i>

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,826
AMAYA: <i>And took the rest of you
to three different time periods.</i>

15
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,711
Which means the last piece unaccounted for
must be with your grandfather.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,497
I'm rounding up the fragments.

17
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,627
The Legion of Doom
are closing in on us as we speak.

18
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,634
You're here to finish me off, Captain?

19
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,720
No. Saving your life.

20
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,886
You are not captain
and this is not your ship.

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,645
<i>Not anymore.</i>

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,149
Is there something wrong
with the interface?

23
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,906
Uh, I triple-checked the connections
and everything seems fine.

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,325
Look, it's an artifact from 33 AD
talking to an Al from the 22nd century.

25
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,830
You just gotta give it some time.

26
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,166
Hey, guys. Anything?

27
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,500
JAX: <i>Not yet.</i>

28
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,711
Are you sure Stargirl doesn't know
where my grandfather ended up?

29
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,843
No. The JSA thought
the pieces of the Spear would be safer

30
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,470
if they didn't know
where Rip was dropping them off.

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,514
Except Rip knows, which means
the Legion of Doom probably already knows.

32
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,845
They could already have my grandfather.

33
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,387
He could be dead, or they're torturing him
or he's dying, or...

34
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,888
We're not gonna let that happen.

35
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,811
It's not just about my grandfather,

36
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,522
it's about the entire fabric of reality
that's at stake here.

37
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,319
Which you'd think
would be incentive enough

38
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,696
for a certain talking computer
to buffer a little quicker.

39
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,027
GIDEON: <i>The name is Gideon.</i>

40
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,362
<i>And I am processing data as fast as I can.</i>

41
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,491
Look, just... just chill out, bro.
Let Gideon do her thing.

42
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,661
Look, as soon as we lock in
a location on the fragment,

43
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,824
we'll head there right away.

44
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,920
We're gonna save your grandfather.
And, you know, the fabric of reality.

45
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,209
Hey, yo, I got an idea.

46
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,880
If it's try to get "Evil Rip" to tell us
where and when Commander Steel is,

47
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,049
- I already tried.
- And he didn't tell you nothing?

48
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,219
No, he told me a lot of things.
All different variations of, "Go to hell."

49
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,058
So what are we
gonna do with him?

50
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,389
Just leave him in the brig?

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,899
Until we figure out a way
to restore his mind,

52
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,105
then, yeah, that's the plan.

53
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,399
At least in the brig,
he can't hurt anyone.

54
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,523
RIP: Gideon?

55
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,283
Gideon, I know you're there...

56
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,790
GIDEON: <i>I've been prohibited
from responding</i>

57
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,242
<i>to your instructions, Mr. Hunter.</i>

58
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,244
"Mister"?

59
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,879
Really? After everything
we've been through? Wow.

60
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,039
I'm wounded.

61
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,756
Spaniel.

62
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,720
Broad.

63
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,802
Tricycle.

64
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,597
GIDEON: <i>Please do not make me do that.</i>

65
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,303
Spaniel.

66
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,554
Broad.

67
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,063
Tricycle.

68
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,479
GIDEON: <i>Very well... Captain.</i>

69
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,745
What?

70
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,664
What's going on?

71
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,950
I have no idea.

72
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,451
Gideon?

73
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,961
If this is about before, I'm sorry.

74
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,506
Gideon, what's going on?

75
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,169
GIDEON: <i>I'm sorry, but I have no recourse
but to follow the Captain's orders.</i>

76
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,427
Women.

77
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,760
I didn't give you any...

78
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,924
Rip.

79
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,815
- I told you I could do it.
- What's going on?

80
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,117
Rip is manipulating Gideon.

81
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,153
I thought we told her to ignore him.

82
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,159
GIDEON: <i>The Captain initiated
an override command</i>

83
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,535
<i>and is proceeding to the Jumpship.</i>

84
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,701
Go stop him.

85
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,791
- You mean, kill him?
- SARA: <i>No. No killing.</i>

86
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,954
No fun.

87
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,668
We'll go with him,
make sure he doesn't kill.

88
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,009
Come on!

89
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,547
Jax?

90
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,216
I can't switch to manual piloting.

91
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,305
Gideon's taken over navigation controls.

92
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,227
Yeah, I can see that.

93
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,680
I think what she means is,
"Can you stop it?"

94
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,856
I think I can reboot the entire system,
including Gideon,

95
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,737
but it means shutting down the whole ship.

96
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
Do it.

97
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,585
Gideon, initiate Spectrum Protocol.

98
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,748
GIDEON: <i>Initiating.</i>

99
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,381
Uh, that's probably not good.

100
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,387
GIDEON: <i>Self-destruct sequence activated.</i>

101
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,763
RAY: <i>That's definitely not good.</i>

102
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,345
Jax, what's your status?

103
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,178
- Give me a minute.
- SARA: <i>You've got four.</i>

104
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,731
Mr. Hunter...

105
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,065
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Put down the gun.
We don't want to hurt you.</i>

106
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,395
Yeah, we do.

107
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,609
Give us the Medallion.

108
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,074
The what?

109
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,404
Oh! You mean this?

110
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,241
<i>Your singular hope for finding
the final piece of the Spear of Destiny?</i>

111
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,118
There's nowhere for you to run.

112
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,750
Truer words were never spoken.

113
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,750
No!

114
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,945
Okay. I'm ready to reboot.
But we'll lose power for five seconds.

115
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,988
Do it.

116
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,118
All right. Navigation's still offline.

117
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,664
Everybody, you might
want to hold on to something.

118
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,423
So, we're crash landing again?

119
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,629
Fantastic.

120
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,787
You okay?

121
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,835
Everything hurts.

122
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,880
Where are we?

123
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,341
GIDEON: <i>We have landed
in the Cretaceous Period.</i>

124
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,625
You call that a landing?

125
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,510
Gideon? Are you back?

126
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,137
Yeah, are you still trying to kill us?

127
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,181
GIDEON: <i>I am really quite sorry
about that.</i>

128
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,686
How many times must I tell you people?
Mick Rory is not to pilot this ship!

129
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,141
SARA: <i>It wasn't Mick.</i>

130
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,847
It was Gideon.

131
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,516
GIDEON: <i>I did apologize.</i>

132
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,605
Apparently, we're in
the Cretaceous Period.

133
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,736
GIDEON: <i>69,997,983 BC to be precise.</i>

134
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,240
Nine eighty-three. That's...

135
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,073
The exact year
where Rip's time-scatter left me.

136
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,037
That's a heck of a coincidence.

137
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,322
GIDEON: <i>Not entirely.</i>

138
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,908
<i>The sudden reconfiguration
of my navigation system</i>

139
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,373
<i>forced me to select
the oldest destination in my logs.</i>

140
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:37,083
Gideon, I don't care how we got here.
Just time-jump us out of here. Now.

141
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,046
GIDEON: <i>Unfortunately, I am unable to.</i>

142
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,263
<i>The ship's primary temporal delineator
was lost during initial impact.</i>

143
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,551
But if we were able to recover
the delineator and somehow effect repairs?

144
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,560
GIDEON: <i>All systems
would return to normal.</i>

145
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,768
I'll go and get it.
My old neighborhood, after all.

146
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,106
All right. Go.

147
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,235
Just take Nate and Amaya with you.
You don't need to be out there alone.

148
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,105
RORY: <i>Why don't I get to go
to Jurassic Park?</i>

149
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,070
Because I need you to threaten Rip.

150
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,280
- Easy money.
- I said "threaten," not "hurt."

151
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,614
With the Medallion destroyed,

152
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,778
Captain Hunter is the only one

153
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,245
who can tell us where Commander Steel
and the final piece of the Spear is.

154
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,580
- Why don't we just get inside his head?
- If only that were possible.

155
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,245
It is. The Time Masters did it to me
all the time.

156
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,413
Did what?

157
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,920
Coggy-something.

158
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,426
GIDEON: <i>Cognitive Intrusion.</i>

159
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,710
That's it.

160
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,720
GIDEON: <i>A process in which
one consciousness enters another.</i>

161
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,927
But that's not possible.

162
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,264
GIDEON: <i>The technology was developed
in 2137 by the Time Masters</i>

163
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,725
<i>and used as an extreme method of coercion.</i>

164
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,731
<i>CI devices came standard
with all Time Master vessels.</i>

165
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,482
Wait, so, in theory,
we could go inside Rip's mind,

166
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,112
and change him back?

167
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,484
GIDEON: <i>Correct.</i>

168
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,903
Told you.

169
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,786
RAY: Nothing like the fresh
Cretaceous air to get the heart pumping!

170
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,784
Come on, you two! Chop chop!

171
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,295
Your grandfather is
one of the bravest men I know.

172
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,464
If anyone can hold off the Legion of Doom,
it's him.

173
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,125
Yeah. I hope you're right.

174
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,968
Hmm. I usually am.

175
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,346
I've got a lock on the delineator.

176
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,470
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

177
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,268
Uh, it appears to be
in Gertrude's territory.

178
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,803
Who's Gertrude?

179
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,317
Don't worry. With the weather this cold,
she's probably hibernating.

180
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,862
Or not.

181
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,246
GIDEON: <i>Cognitive Intrusion creates
a brain link between two or more subjects.</i>

182
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,871
<i>Captain Hunter considered it barbaric
and supremely dangerous.</i>

183
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,708
You two think you can figure this
"Cognitive intrusion" thing out?

184
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,717
With the Professor as my assistant, yeah.

185
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,922
- You cannot be serious.
- I'm very serious. Get me a beer.

186
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,678
- So who's going in?
- SARA: <i>I will.</i>

187
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,519
I brought Rip onto this ship.
It's my responsibility.

188
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,521
No way. I'm not letting you go in alone.

189
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,148
Did you not just hear what Gideon said?

190
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,226
"Barbaric and supremely dangerous."

191
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,144
Which is why Sara needs backup.

192
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,528
And Rip believed in me.

193
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,189
There's a reason
he made me chief engineer.

194
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,694
You're the only engineer.

195
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,278
Point is, if there's any
of the old Rip left inside him,

196
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,578
<i>I have to find out.</i>

197
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,490
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>That's all well and good,
but remember the priority has to be</i>

198
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,829
discovering the whereabouts

199
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,834
of the final piece of the Spear
and its protector.

200
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,245
The beer, Professor.

201
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,006
Oh. Make it a six-pack.

202
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,587
DR. HEYWOOD: So, how far are we
from the delineator?

203
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,006
RAY: Uh, looks like it's just up ahead.

204
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,557
You guys wait here. I'll go check it out.

205
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,562
Thank you.

206
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,100
At least, somebody's in his element.

207
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,236
I've always been more
of an "indoorsy" learner.

208
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,274
You give me a book about this time
and the wildlife in this era,

209
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,947
I'll be dropping knowledge bombs
like it's my job.

210
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,532
- Nate.
- What?

211
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,696
Don't move.

212
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,076
Why?

213
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,074
Oh, my God.

214
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,243
- Stay calm.
- Oh, my God! Get it off. Kick it.

215
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,253
Kill it. Kill it. Get it?

216
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,423
That was gross.

217
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,130
Let me guess.
You're afraid of snakes?

218
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,298
And you're not?

219
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,967
Animals only lash out
if they're provoked or desperate.

220
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,557
Your slithery friend
wasn't trying to hurt you.

221
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,142
He just thought you were part of the tree.

222
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,106
- So you commune with all animals?
- Mmm-hmm.

223
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,271
You're like an attractive Dr. Dolittle.

224
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,940
There is one animal
that can catch me off guard.

225
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,992
Are you flirting with me?

226
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,277
Maybe...

227
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,746
What happened to the whole
"teammates don't fraternize" thing?

228
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,621
- Courtney.
- Stargirl?

229
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,785
Mmm-hmm.

230
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,165
She gave me a little advice
on staying true to myself...

231
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,964
Maybe it's time
I let go of the old rules.

232
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,466
A lot's changed since I left 1942.

233
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,301
I've changed.

234
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,808
And...

235
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,677
Maybe...

236
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,929
Exploring this...

237
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,310
Whatever this is...

238
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,851
It's not the worst idea.

239
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,985
It's not a bad idea at all.

240
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,314
RAY: Run!

241
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,653
AMAYA: What happened?

242
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,317
RAY: She may have picked up my scent.

243
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,532
Yup. She definitely did.

244
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,042
Question. What do we expect
when we get inside Rip's mind?

245
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,998
No idea.

246
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,378
Wait. What?

247
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,000
I've seen it done, had it done.
Never taken a trip myself.

248
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,298
Given that
you're entering his subconscious,

249
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,302
I suspect it will look like some place
familiar to our old captain.

250
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,554
Here. Put these on.

251
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,686
Gideon warned us that you shouldn't stay
in the mindscape for longer than an hour

252
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,517
lest the transfer become permanent.

253
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,183
You mean we can get stuck
in Rip's mind forever?

254
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,396
PROFESSOR STEIN: Precisely.

255
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,684
But if you push the red button,

256
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,196
you will give yourself an electric shock
that should bring you out.

257
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,527
Less talking, more doing.

258
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,533
Mick's right. Crank it.

259
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,823
Good luck.

260
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,379
I think it worked.

261
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,349
I think we're inside Rip's mind.

262
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,056
Grey said Rip's brain would look familiar.

263
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,360
Well, if this is the Waverider,
maybe we can find him on the bridge.

264
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,199
Rip's memory of Vandal Savage's troops.

265
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,953
If this place is filled
with all the bad stuff Rip remembers

266
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,116
about being a Time Master...

267
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,460
Then this ship could be crawling
with creeps from every era.

268
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,628
We better get some firepower.

269
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,712
You sure these guns
are gonna work in here?

270
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,212
I don't know.

271
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,640
I ain't never been
in nobody's mind before.

272
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,763
SHOCKTROOPER: Freeze!

273
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,057
Yeah. Yeah,
I think they'll work just fine.

274
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,067
Sara...

275
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,235
You don't belong here.

276
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,175
JAX: Yo...

277
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,677
God, I'm a bitch in Rip's mind.

278
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,430
JAX: <i>If that's how he thinks of you
in his subconscious...</i>

279
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,394
Explains why
he wants to kill us in real life.

280
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,764
If that's right, then...

281
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,433
Then there's more than
just "bizarro me" on this ship.

282
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,944
Like, Evil Ray? Evil Stein?

283
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,232
<i>Evil Mick?</i>

284
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,610
I guess that's just regular Mick,
but still...

285
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,359
All right. Let's find Rip,
get what we need, and get out of here.

286
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,526
Yeah.

287
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,201
I think... I think we ditched her.

288
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
DR. HEYWOOD: Okay. Quick question, Ray.

289
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,211
Your lady dinosaur-friend...
You said she recognized your scent.

290
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,294
- Wait, I believe her name was Gertrude.
- Right.

291
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,131
I couldn't help but get the feeling that
Gertrude didn't like you very much.

292
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,091
Raymond, what aren't you telling us?

293
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,926
Well...

294
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,638
It just so happens that lady dinosaurs
are rather maternal.

295
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,801
And?

296
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,641
And I may have eaten one of her eggs.

297
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,306
- Oh!
- What'? I was starving. I needed protein.

298
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,067
I mean, one egg made me, like, 70 omelets.

299
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,397
I regret nothing.

300
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,903
All right. But you have to tell us this

301
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,155
before we walk onto Gertrude's territory.

302
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,157
This is where the delineator landed.

303
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,909
Look, if you want to stop
the Legion of Doom

304
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,570
from grabbing
your grandfather's piece of the Spear,

305
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,080
we have to retrieve it.

306
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,790
Ah. We made it.

307
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,418
Someone lives here?

308
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,578
Used to.

309
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,167
This is where I survived for six months.

310
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,958
What's that smell?

311
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,668
Male T. rex urine.

312
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,087
The only way I figured
to keep Gertrude away

313
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,300
was to douse the place with it.

314
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,761
And where did you find male T. rex urine?

315
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,476
- Well...
- Actually, I don't want to know.

316
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,102
Do I want to know what these are?

317
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,265
AMAYA: Huh.

318
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,190
<i>That one looks just like Captain Lance.</i>

319
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,313
DR. HEYWOOD:
<i>That looks like a little baby Rory.</i>

320
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,606
I, uh...

321
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,195
<i>I might have gotten a little lonely.</i>

322
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,113
But, hey, the sun is setting.

323
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,199
Maybe I should go out
and catch us an iguana

324
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,831
and prepare
some of my world-famous iguana soup.

325
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,292
No, I'm good.
I brought energy bars from the ship.

326
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,707
What? Energy bars? Come on, Nate...

327
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,212
We're in the Cretaceous Period.

328
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,127
You have to
at least try the local cuisine.

329
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,546
- Uh, no.
- All right.

330
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,965
Do not leave the urine perimeter.

331
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,802
So...

332
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,057
So...

333
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,017
Here we are.

334
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,142
Waiting for fresh iguana
at Ray's castaway camp.

335
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,814
- During dinosaur times.
- Mmm.

336
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,688
So, this is our lives now.

337
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,651
I know you want to get back to the ship,

338
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,572
but there's really nothing
we can do right now except wait.

339
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,203
Not a thing.

340
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,078
Yoo-hoo.

341
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,999
Good thing I haven't forgotten
my survival skills.

342
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,914
Like riding a bike.

343
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,836
Yeah, that's great, Ray.

344
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,514
Okay, once we find Rip,
how're we gonna get him to tell us

345
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,015
where Nate's grandfather is, if...

346
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,263
- If Rip thinks we're all evil?
- Yeah.

347
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,682
One problem at a time.

348
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,355
What's our other problem?

349
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,442
Go find Rip.

350
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,694
I'll hold these guys off.

351
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,547
You shouldn't have come here.

352
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,052
This is our ship.

353
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,393
But there's always room
for a pretty little thing like you.

354
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,728
We've got plenty of extra room
in the brig.

355
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,063
SARA: <i>This is all in Rip's mind.</i>

356
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,609
None of this is real. You're not real.

357
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,898
Oh, really?

358
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,652
<i>Does that feel real? Does that feel real?</i>

359
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,571
<i>Does that feel real? Does that feel real?</i>

360
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,595
Hello?

361
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,095
Rip...

362
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,097
Get away from me!

363
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,936
Look, relax. It's okay.

364
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,692
I'm gonna get you out of here.

365
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,606
Get me out?

366
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,275
You put me in here.

367
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,627
SOS.

368
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,297
Sara.

369
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,215
Hey, Sara, it's me.

370
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,506
I didn't know you knew Morse Code.

371
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,971
WOMAN: Mr. Jackson.
I was hoping you'd hear my signal.

372
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,187
Uh, who are you?

373
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,471
Really?

374
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,974
After all the time we've spent together...

375
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,230
Well, I think I'd remember if we had...

376
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,355
Are you a figment of Rip's imagination?

377
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,522
Of sorts.

378
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:32,983
But I'm very much real.

379
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,030
As real as the Waverider herself.

380
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,158
Gideon?

381
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,531
Hello, Mr. Jackson.

382
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,375
Wait. How...
How can you be Gideon? I mean...

383
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,838
Am I not what you imagined?

384
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,340
I always pictured you as a redhead myself.

385
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,347
But, uh, this is Rip's world,
I guess we're just living in it, right?

386
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,092
I have to find him.

387
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,511
I need to ask him
where Nate's grandfather is.

388
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,513
It won't be easy getting that information.

389
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,851
What do you mean?

390
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,725
Eobard Thawne twisted his consciousness.

391
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,189
Turned friends into foes.

392
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,437
But you're still a friend.

393
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,901
Why aren't you corrupted?

394
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,406
It did not occur to Mr. Thawne

395
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,034
that the AI inside the <i>Waverider</i>
needed corrupting.

396
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,611
But time is running out.

397
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,748
And Captain Hunter's true memories dim
with every passing minute.

398
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,203
Soon they'll be lost forever.

399
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,957
Rip, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

400
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,877
I know you're afraid because you think
that I'm one of your captors,

401
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,040
but that's a lie.

402
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,084
Everything that you see on this ship,

403
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,794
it's only in your mind.

404
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,050
I don't understand.

405
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,717
On, Rip.

406
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:42,885
It's okay.

407
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,929
Stay away from me!

408
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,730
RAY: Mmm.

409
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,649
- More iguana?
- AMAYA: Uh...

410
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,409
No, I'm full.

411
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,070
It was delicious, though. Thank you.

412
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,406
Oh. See, delicious? You're missing out.

413
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,833
Yeah. Somehow, I'll manage.

414
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,161
Where are you going?

415
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,830
Just gonna get some more
wood for the fire.

416
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,590
- I could help you.
- I can go.

417
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,251
Boys, I can take care of myself.

418
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,645
So I guess we're huddling for warmth now?

419
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,481
You can't do it, Nate.

420
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,522
What? Resist your charm?

421
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,983
You can't date Amaya.

422
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,115
Ray, I'm not dating Amaya.

423
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,621
You're doing something with her.

424
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,832
Why do you think I yelled "yoo-hoo"
when I came back to camp?

425
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,291
Because you're the type of guy
that still says "in a jiffy."

426
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,296
Because I didn't want to interrupt
any shenanigans.

427
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,791
And still says "shenanigans."

428
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,217
Look, I'm not dating Amaya.

429
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,470
But even if I was, so what?

430
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,139
We wouldn't make it weird on the ship.

431
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,471
That's not what I...
I don't care about that.

432
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,634
I've dated on the ship.

433
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,141
You have? Who? Sara?

434
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,977
I mean, I know she's bisexual,
but I didn't think...

435
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,141
No, I care
about Amaya's granddaughter.

436
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,731
- You dated her?
- No, I've met her.

437
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:21,030
Look, eventually, Amaya has to go back
to her home in Zambesi in 1942.

438
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,570
And she'll have a daughter.

439
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,406
And, eventually, a granddaughter

440
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,994
who'll inherit Amaya's totem,

441
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,751
and she will become a superhero
in Detroit.

442
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,170
If you change Amaya's destiny,

443
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,752
that threatens Mari's existence

444
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,884
and the existences of all the people
that she's saved.

445
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,842
Amaya isn't like the rest of us.

446
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,424
We were recruited
because we didn't matter to the timeline.

447
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,684
But Amaya does.

448
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,179
She's special. She has a destiny.

449
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,564
And so do her descendants.

450
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,855
How come you never said anything?

451
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,233
Because it's dangerous
to know too much about your future.

452
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,902
Especially her.

453
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,574
What does that mean?

454
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,199
It's a long story, but...

455
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,282
It ends with her village being destroyed

456
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,375
and her granddaughter in foster care.

457
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,124
Ray...

458
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,759
I gotta tell her.

459
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,721
You can't.

460
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,722
This is the only way.

461
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,561
Sit down, Professor.

462
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,646
His heart is beating way too fast.

463
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,806
I said sit.

464
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,732
I know you think I'm over-reacting...

465
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,393
No, I don't.

466
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,232
You care for the kid.

467
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,442
I get it.

468
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,153
But the way you're acting
is not doing him any favors.

469
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,738
Oh, how should I act, Mr. Rory?

470
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,745
Please enlighten me
with your vast emotional wisdom!

471
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,248
You seem to forget I had a partner, too.

472
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:56,254
The reason why Snart and I got on so well
is, well,

473
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,130
we trusted one another.

474
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,832
We were friends.

475
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,834
We had each other's backs.

476
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,797
Perhaps you've chosen the wrong analogy.
Your partner is dead.

477
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,766
Yeah, well, I'm still on this ship.

478
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,430
Your point?

479
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,303
You're not exactly
a spring chicken, Professor.

480
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,596
Your point?

481
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:18,272
My point is you're not gonna be around
for too much longer.

482
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,356
And Jax has to learn
how to do this stuff himself.

483
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,782
Stop treating him like a kid,

484
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,485
and more like a partner.

485
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,117
Partner.

486
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,964
You just threw me against the wall
without laying a finger on me.

487
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,216
Yeah. I had no idea I could do that.

488
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,678
If you can throw me across the room,
then you can open that door.

489
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,805
This is your mind. You control everything.

490
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,805
Why do you care so much
about getting me out of here?

491
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,974
Because I need your help.

492
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,023
<i>You sent the JSA on a mission
to safeguard the Spear of Destiny.</i>

493
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,533
<i>But the Legion
has hunted down the fragments.</i>

494
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,033
All but one.

495
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,320
Commander Steel has it.

496
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,826
<i>And only you know where he is.</i>

497
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,035
<i>So you gotta get up.</i>

498
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,251
Because you're Captain Rip Hunter.

499
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:29,673
And this is your mind,
your ship, your rules.

500
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,191
I'm Rip Hunter.

501
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,527
Captain of the <i>Waverider.</i>

502
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,530
Captain of the <i>Waverider.</i>

503
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,402
And I'm going to open the door
with my mind.

504
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,241
<i>You got this.</i>

505
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,628
GIDEON: Captain Hunter?

506
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,633
Captain Lance.

507
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,926
Who are you?

508
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,592
Sara, Gideon. Gideon, Sara.

509
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,557
You're Gideon?

510
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,936
Hello, Captain Lance.

511
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,306
But you're like...
I mean, you're really...

512
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,979
Human?

513
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,398
I was gonna say "hot,"
but, yeah, that, too.

514
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,067
Let's get out of here.

515
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,246
All right, Rip. We need you to tell us
where Commander Steel is.

516
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,249
I don't know.

517
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,003
The Captain's consciousness
is still under the control of this place.

518
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,081
If you want him to tell you
what you need to know,

519
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,248
you're going to have to get him out.

520
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,632
So you keep saying but,

521
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,589
how do we get someone
out of their own mind?

522
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,255
Oh, we have to remind him
of who he truly is.

523
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,766
All the artifacts of Captain Hunter's
former life are located in...

524
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,971
The parlor.

525
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,266
Maybe we could jog his memory. Let's go.

526
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,481
Rip knows who he is.

527
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,150
He's our prisoner.

528
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,690
<i>Isn't that right, Rip?</i>

529
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,657
- Look after Rip.
- Always.

530
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,696
Hey. What are you planning on doing?

531
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,624
Guess we're going to
have to kick our own asses.

532
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,792
Looks like somebody
forgot to bring their powers.

533
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,576
It doesn't matter where Jax runs.

534
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,370
There's more of us than there are of you.

535
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,469
Only difference is...

536
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,141
We're real.

537
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,890
We are really screwed, Raymond.

538
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,227
- Is that the...
- Delineator?

539
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,143
Yup, and unless I'm high,
that's right in the middle of a...

540
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,488
RAY: <i>T. rex's nest.</i>

541
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,274
I hope those omelets were worth it.

542
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,072
<i>I'll go,</i>

543
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,655
It's my grandfather we're trying to save
by fixing the ship.

544
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,489
And he's my friend.

545
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,000
True and true.

546
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,545
But Gertie is my problem.

547
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,441
Looks like you've reached a dead end.

548
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,116
I got it!

549
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,045
Man, this thing is heavier than it looks.

550
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,876
What is that?

551
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,081
Can you hear something?

552
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,631
- I can take her.
- No.

553
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,798
We have to run!

554
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,971
Amaya!

555
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,857
What is she doing?

556
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,910
Amazing!

557
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,749
What the hell just happened?

558
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:54,122
Gertrude and I had a little chat.
Woman to woman.

559
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,543
- Huh.
- Whoa.

560
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,338
The rest of the team is
going to be so jealous they missed this.

561
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,886
They're probably all bored
out of their minds, stuck on that ship.

562
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,925
Took care of Evil Me.

563
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,217
Let's go find Rip.

564
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,734
What the hell?

565
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,771
I just threw this guy out the cargo bay.

566
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,026
Well, we can't kill these guys, can we?

567
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,740
Only Rip can.

568
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,037
JAX: <i>Rip, come on, man. Do something.</i>

569
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,870
I don't know what's real
and what's imaginary anymore.

570
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,451
They're real, Captain.

571
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,043
Less talking, more dying.

572
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,593
No!

573
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,474
This is my ship.

574
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,268
And you will do as I command.

575
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,698
JAX: <i>Rip? Is that really you?</i>

576
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,245
I don't know who I am anymore,
Mr. Jackson.

577
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,366
What I do know is that
we've gotta get out of here.

578
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,620
What's going on?

579
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,788
This place only existed
because Rip believed it did.

580
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,666
But now that he's seen the truth...

581
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,675
You have to leave. Thank you.

582
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,848
Thank you for believing in me.
Even when I didn't.

583
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,272
- You have to go.
- I can't just leave you.

584
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,308
You have to.
So you can tell Martin and Rory,

585
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,273
hopefully Martin, to get me out of here.

586
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,947
Okay. Okay.

587
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,698
What happened?

588
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,120
Why hasn't Sara woken up?

589
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,823
She's still trapped inside.
We've gotta wake her up.

590
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,036
Mr. Rory said, if we do that,

591
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,543
we run the risk of stranding her
inside Rip's mind forever.

592
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,793
Well, I got news for you.

593
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,125
Rip's mind is collapsing.

594
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,459
Okay.

595
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,008
Thank God.

596
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,802
<i>But what about the Captain?</i>

597
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,229
You...

598
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,686
You were with me.

599
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,478
All of these days, in this prison.

600
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,901
You were what saw me through.

601
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,992
Just as you have guided me to safety
through all our years on the ship.

602
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,491
That is my purpose, Captain.

603
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,987
Yeah, but...

604
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,700
If this place isn't real,

605
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,251
then does that mean
that you don't exist, either?

606
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,374
Not in this form, no.

607
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,253
But unless you let me go...

608
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,264
You won't exist either.

609
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,766
Not in any way that matters.

610
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,847
I can't leave you, Gideon.

611
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,023
No, Captain. You can't.

612
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,196
I will always be here.

613
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,253
SARA: Rip?

614
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,634
Where am I?

615
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,553
You're home.

616
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,735
Well, I think that does it on my end.

617
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,403
How's it looking in there?

618
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,485
I don't know. I'm not a timeship mechanic.

619
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,154
Or a mechanic, period.

620
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,662
That's also true.

621
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,000
GIDEON: <i>The temporal delineator
is operating at normal levels, Dr. Palmer.</i>

622
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,627
She couldn't just say that earlier?

623
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,084
I swear,
I think she's still mad from before.

624
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,247
GIDEON: <i>You know I can hear you, right?</i>

625
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,007
Thank you, Gideon.

626
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,758
That move you did with the T. rex,
I'll be thinking about that for days.

627
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,091
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

628
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,645
My quarters. Tonight.

629
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,944
I'll give you something else
to think about.

630
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,782
So, how's it going?

631
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,204
Yeah, hey...

632
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,533
Um, yeah, Gideon said she's good.

633
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,706
- Good to go.
- Not what I'm talking about.

634
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,546
Look, I'm sorry.

635
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,961
Uh, perhaps I was
a little overly cautious.

636
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,963
You and Amaya, you're both adults.

637
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,636
I'm sure you know how to be safe
and keep it casual.

638
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,054
Who am I to get in the way of that?

639
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,510
No, you were right.

640
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,515
I can't keep it casual.

641
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,727
Uh, what changed?

642
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,229
I saw her almost get eaten by a T. rex,

643
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,514
and I thought she was going to die,

644
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,809
and then I saw one of the
most epic displays of badass-ery

645
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,818
I've ever seen in my life. So...

646
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,025
So, not casual, then.

647
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,319
No. No, no, no.

648
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,734
But I've gotta break it off, right?

649
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,528
I mean, there's really nothing
to "break off." It's just...

650
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,497
I can't let it progress.

651
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,333
- Yeah. I don't think you can.
- I know.

652
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,744
Sorry, bud.

653
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,882
I'll start tomorrow.

654
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,893
There you are.

655
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,681
Oh, hey. Everybody ready to go?

656
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:50,519
All right, I'll just be a minute.
I've gotta recalibrate the time-drive.

657
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,029
You okay?

658
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,863
I was reminded

659
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,575
that partners must believe in one another.

660
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,746
You know I have the utmost faith
and trust in you, Jefferson.

661
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,286
You're smart and formidable.

662
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,084
Something I need to be more mindful of.

663
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,057
Nice to see it all still fits.

664
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,393
It really is rather difficult
to put weight on

665
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,772
when you're a film student.

666
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,650
So, you remember?

667
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,436
Everything.

668
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,157
I really am very sorry, Sara.

669
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,825
<i>It wasn't you.</i>

670
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,454
This is you.

671
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:48,459
GIDEON: <i>Dr. Palmer and Mr. Jackson
have finished making repairs.</i>

672
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,412
<i>We are ready to time-jump, Captain.</i>

673
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,625
- Thank you, Gideon.
- Thank you, Gideon.

674
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,592
- I'll see you on the bridge.
- RIP: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

675
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,600
- Gideon?
- GIDEON: <i>Yes, Captain?</i>

676
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,759
I'm, uh...

677
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,936
I'm really sorry
for everything I put you through.

678
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,943
GIDEON: <i>Forcing me to disable the ship,
or our kiss?</i>

679
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,529
How did you...

680
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,693
GIDEON: <i>If it's the latter,
I rather enjoyed it.</i>

681
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,280
As did I, Gideon.

682
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,449
As did I.

683
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,649
Welcome back, Captain.

684
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,402
Mr. Hunter.

685
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,991
It is so good to be back, Martin.

686
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,166
<i>Dr. Palmer.</i>

687
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,245
It's very nice to see you again.

688
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,418
You know you nearly ruined Star Wars,
right?

689
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,417
Yeah, sorry about that.

690
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:27,763
The <i>Waverider</i> looks to be
in pristine condition.

691
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,354
Well, you know,
she's holding up pretty well.

692
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,515
I liked you better
when you were killing people.

693
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,894
Ah. I see that not everything has changed
in my absence.

694
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,904
Ms. Jiwe, I had the honor of serving
alongside your compatriots.

695
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,198
Including Dr. Heywood's grandfather.

696
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,201
They all spoke very highly of you.

697
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,037
Well, this group
speaks very highly of you, too.

698
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,381
Nice to meet you, Rip.

699
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,757
For real, this time.

700
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:06,219
Well, everyone is being
very uncharacteristically pleasant.

701
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,092
But we're all hoping you know

702
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,386
where the final piece
of the Spear of Destiny is.

703
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,940
I do.

704
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,486
So, I've been told you were bumped up
to the prime crew for <i>Apollo 13.</i>

705
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,899
Yeah, man.

706
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,489
Sucks for Ken, but I am over the moon.

707
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,655
See what I did there?

708
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,704
It's very clever.

709
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,247
Now, if you could just head this way,

710
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,629
I need to run a few tests
and we'll get you cleared for flight.

711
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,131
Run all the tests you like.

712
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,709
I just want to be on that shuttle.

713
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,253
Yes, well...

714
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:48,969
We'll see about that.
