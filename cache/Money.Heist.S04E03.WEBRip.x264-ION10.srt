1
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,878
We think love is declared
with flowers and chocolates,

2
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,246
but you can also declare your love
with a hammer.

3
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,583
Or with an angle grinder.

4
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,246
Kidnapping a police officer
can be a declaration of love.

5
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,211
Saving him from the bottom of his pool

6
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,495
is another.

7
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,166
What's going on down there?

8
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,785
What are you doing?

9
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,288
- Pretend we're drunk.
- No, I won't pretend.

10
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,625
Play drunk or I'll snap your neck.

11
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,956
- Have you no shame?
- I'm calling the police!

12
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,133
I am the police, ma'am.

13
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:35,208
- That's Benito!
- Do you want to call them? Ring, ring.

14
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,831
What are you doing?

15
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,166
Pretend, come on.

16
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,325
The house is full of them.

17
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,455
And so is your car.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,420
And your wife's car.

19
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,170
It looks like C-4, but it's only plastic.

20
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:04,286
That's your alibi.
You wouldn't be a criminal, you'd be...

21
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,035
a scared father, and they'll understand.

22
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:11,498
Once I get out, I'll report you
and come back with 3,000 officers.

23
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,333
We can also use real C-4.

24
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,955
Anywhere you can imagine.

25
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,788
Don't get the wrong idea.

26
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,535
We don't want you
to do this for money, but...

27
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,165
we understand the inconvenience
this could cause.

28
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,420
One million euros.

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,330
With this money and the alibi,
you're free to choose

30
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,916
who you want to be with.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,500
With a woman
who illegally arrests people,

32
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,038
tortures them,

33
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,041
and abuses the power given to her
by the Constitution.

34
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,251
Or with us.

35
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,205
- Now you'll answer some questions.
- I'll decide that.

36
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,878
Is Inspector Murillo alive?

37
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,206
She might be.

38
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,421
Is she in the tent?

39
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,713
She might be.

40
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:20,041
I just need you to let her know
that the Professor knows she's alive.

41
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,535
She won't believe me.

42
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,285
If I'd been with you,
why wouldn't I have arrested you?

43
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,668
If she sees you wearing this watch,
she'll believe you.

44
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,788
Because when love is concerned,
there's always a ticking clock.

45
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,958
There's always a countdown.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,710
Loving someone is not enough,

47
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,793
you have to make it in time.

48
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,376
What's that?

49
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:15,668
- For when she wakes up.
- That's a beautiful gift and gesture.

50
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,083
She said she wouldn't touch me
with a ten-foot pole.

51
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,415
Let me give you a piece of advice.

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,830
Don't fall in love during a heist. 

53
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,458
It's bad luck.

54
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,038
Paulita!

55
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,630
Miss Mariví!

56
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,995
MINDANAO
DAY 1 OF THE HEIST

57
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,253
The phone!

58
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,791
SOUTHERN SPAIN
DAY 1 OF THE HEIST

59
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,705
Mom?

60
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,041
Paula, honey.

61
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,415
How are you? What did you do today?

62
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,253
The same as yesterday, Mom.

63
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,883
I'm sure you did something great today.

64
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,828
- Tell me something.
- I can't think of anything.

65
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,501
Do you miss me?

66
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,495
Yes.

67
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,291
What's wrong?
You're watching TV, aren't you?

68
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,455
No, I was playing with Grandma.

69
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,075
Put her on, please.

70
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,038
OK. Grandma!

71
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Darling?

72
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,293
Is Paula all right? She sounds odd.

73
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,495
I don't know.

74
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,753
She seems fine.

75
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,330
But you can talk to her
when you come for dinner.

76
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,381
- Sure, Mom.
- And don't forget to buy some bread.

77
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,665
It's six in the morning.

78
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:37,328
The ambulance is in the crime lab.
In about an hour, Alberto will be there.

79
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,666
Like a bloodhound.

80
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,253
Sniffing out the trail of his new prey,
your daughter.

81
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,543
Do you think I leave her address
stuck on the fridge with a magnet?

82
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,915
I think you feel guilty
for being a bad mother.

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,580
You don't simply go off...

84
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,750
away on a heist for weeks and not call.

85
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,038
Am I wrong?
What about your bad-daughter complex?

86
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,415
Because your mom...

87
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,708
You can't even leave her
to eat a yogurt on her own.

88
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:09,208
How did you do it?
How did you call from the motor home?

89
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,331
This may surprise you,
but we thought this through.

90
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,825
Alberto can go in
like a pig in search of truffles.

91
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,416
He won't find a thing.

92
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:40,293
- What happened to your head?
- I'm obsessed with the heist, Colonel.

93
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,956
I wake up very early.
I'm not sleeping.

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,710
I was tying my shoelaces
and thinking about the heist,

95
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,921
and as I stood up, I banged my head
on the window so hard I nearly broke it.

96
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,330
You're like me, Antoñanzas.

97
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,958
Even with the truce, I couldn't sleep.

98
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,961
I was wide awake at 3:00 a.m.,

99
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,921
wondering how the Professor
would ruin our day.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,420
I'm going in to see if Sierra needs...

101
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,630
Murillo is in total isolation.

102
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:14,251
I'm only going to go in
to give the inspector her coffee.

103
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,133
Murillo can only have contact with Sierra.

104
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,628
She didn't let her sleep all night.
She's wearing her down.

105
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,128
Let's go for a coffee.

106
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,251
A crime's worst enemy isn't the police.

107
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,376
It's rushing.

108
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,290
The motor home was clean as a whistle.

109
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,710
You left it...

110
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,503
like new.

111
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,668
But the ambulance...

112
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,205
You hauled ass out of there.

113
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:51,171
There's always something left. Always.
A hair on the pillow...

114
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,670
A sock...

115
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,828
And then forensics arrives
with UV light and luminol, and bang!

116
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,165
Gotcha.

117
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,830
I repeat my offer.

118
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,960
I'll go there now and remove that hair
that'll lead us to your family.

119
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,083
Or we wait for your ex...

120
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:11,996
to fuck you over.

121
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,250
You've got nothing.

122
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,706
You're threatening me with
maybe we'll find something.

123
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:33,003
You know what? Your pregnancy
has made you so high on estrogen

124
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,333
that you feel like
the most optimistic woman in Spain.

125
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,041
But that isn't meant for work.
It's for the delivery,

126
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,575
which is fucking hard.

127
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,075
What will you do when it's born?

128
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,748
Is it a boy or a girl?

129
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,381
You don't know?

130
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Poor thing.

131
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,211
What the fuck happened?

132
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,541
They were barefoot, man.

133
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,165
Barefoot? Who?

134
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,540
Rio and Stockholm.

135
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,040
- So?
- What do you mean, so?

136
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,538
Who goes barefoot during a heist?

137
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,251
Taking your shoes off on a couch
in the middle of a heist is weird.

138
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,463
Are you stupid?

139
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,826
If they were thinking of fucking,
they'd fuck... not take their shoes off.

140
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,245
Well...

141
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,826
What were you doing in here last night?

142
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,631
Well, this.

143
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,541
- This is what you were doing?
- Yes.

144
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:10,503
You beat a guy up,
completely change how she sees you,

145
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,746
and you think giving her
a heart is going to fix it?

146
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,455
What can I do then?

147
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,746
Change.

148
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,125
In her eyes...
you're a bad guy now.

149
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,963
A violent guy.
What made her fall in love with you?

150
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,828
I shot her.

151
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,166
I mean, I shot her in the leg
to save her life.

152
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,826
To save her life.

153
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,251
I don't know.

154
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,418
I did a cool dance for her.

155
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,576
- You did a dance for her?
- Yes. I danced for her.

156
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:55,001
I told her stories.
We laughed a lot together.

157
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:02,331
And...
how long is it since you told her stories?

158
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,626
Since you made her laugh?

159
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,626
How long since you danced for her?

160
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,995
Hey, Rio, can you get me a black coffee?

161
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,706
I came up with this plan.
You're safe thanks to me.

162
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,291
How about some gratitude?

163
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,288
You're tied up. Why don't you rest?

164
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,035
Can I at least have some water, please?

165
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,671
Just a bit of water.

166
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,036
I'm sorry, but...

167
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:52,923
Thanks.

168
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,711
You look awful.

169
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,043
Can't you sleep?

170
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,753
How many times do you wake up at night?
Three, four, more?

171
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,418
Hey, Rio...

172
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,671
if you need anything...

173
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,250
to talk or whatever, I'm here.

174
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,325
Thank you.

175
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,246
He's the weakest link.

176
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:36,206
Palpitations,
excessive sweating, insomnia.

177
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,248
Break free during his watch.

178
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,883
He won't be capable
of pulling the trigger.

179
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,076
What makes you think I won't kill you
as soon as I'm free?

180
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,126
Well...

181
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,291
I smashed your head in.

182
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,253
You fucked my eyes up.

183
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,670
That's a tie.
A gentlemen's agreement.

184
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,630
Are you asking me to trust you?

185
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,375
What I'm saying is,
a truce has been declared out there.

186
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,791
No armored vans are coming.

187
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,125
It's a fucking cold war.

188
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,498
- And we are captives.
- So?

189
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:15,171
You should become
the agent of chaos we need.

190
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,166
Like the creature in Alien.

191
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,496
Like John McClane in Die Hard.

192
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,711
STORM RESERVOIR
KEEP OUT

193
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,825
Let's go.

194
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,883
When he got to the storm reservoir,
the Professor was thinking of Raquel,

195
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,670
just like Alberto
as he stepped into the ambulance.

196
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,381
It's strange how you can
think about one person,

197
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,535
at the same time, in such different ways.

198
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:57,333
They say love makes the world go round.
But hatred certainly isn't far behind.

199
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,673
You were right.

200
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,293
Lisbon is alive.

201
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:07,955
Where is she?

202
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,961
In the tent.
I imagine she's being interrogated.

203
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,631
- How long can they keep her?
- I don't know.

204
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,748
I don't think they'll stick
to the usual 72 hours.

205
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,668
They'll transfer her at some point.

206
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,038
- Can you rescue her?
- Not during a transfer.

207
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,075
It'd be stupid. We did it with you.
They'll expect it. It'd be suicide.

208
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,666
What are you going to do?

209
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,496
They have Lisbon there
with the whole plan in her head.

210
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,583
Including the place
you're calling me from.

211
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Professor?

212
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,831
I don't know.

213
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,206
I'm so tired, Tokyo. I can't think.

214
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,581
But I'll find a solution. Don't worry.

215
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,213
I'm making ravioli. You need energy.

216
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,711
- Is Palermo still tied up?
- Yes.

217
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,075
I want you to go and tell him this...

218
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,576
No, I'm not telling him anything.
He'd bite me like an animal.

219
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,581
Well, you'll have to.
Tell him exactly this...

220
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:25,285
You have a message from the Professor.
Lisbon is alive.

221
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,245
She's being held in the tent.

222
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,003
I need you to think of a way
to save her.

223
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,576
- He won't do it.
- Listen to me.

224
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:38,076
All I'm trying to do is to get Palermo
to fall back in love with the plan.

225
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
I need him back on our side.

226
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:45,208
Go tell him.
I'll think of something. Understood?

227
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,375
Understood.

228
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,003
I'm going to the bathroom.
Want to come with me, Sergio?

229
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:22,328
Have you ever had the privilege
of an experienced man giving you fellatio?

230
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,041
He's absolutely unpredictable.

231
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,626
He simply offered you fellatio, gallantly.

232
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,578
- He...
- You know what I mean.

233
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,036
He's uncontrollable.
He's sick with egomania.

234
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,455
He'll respect the hierarchy.

235
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,711
He would in a heist
lasting two or three hours, or a night.

236
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,001
We're talking about several days.

237
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,753
Under infinitely higher pressure.

238
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,125
- I can control Martín...
- You can't!

239
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,330
- I've been doing it for years.
- You can't. He's an egomaniac.

240
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,330
He's obsessed with power.

241
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,875
That only means one thing.

242
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,503
If he's not in charge,
he'll do anything to change that.

243
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,753
And he won't hesitate to execute,
betray, or create chaos.

244
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:17,753
He's an obsessive egomaniac,
he believes in himself, and he's a genius.

245
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,745
Like you.

246
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,633
If you prefer, use second-raters.
They'll follow you like sheep.

247
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,708
You don't get it.
The fact he's a genius complicates things.

248
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,961
He's dangerous
because we won't see him coming.

249
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,495
You're my brother.

250
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,173
I would put you in charge
of any heist in a heartbeat.

251
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,171
But him...

252
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,326
You're wrong to trust me and not him.
I'm less trustworthy.

253
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,415
Two beers.

254
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,826
Don't get more peanuts.

255
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,881
You're already
as overweight as an orangutan.

256
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,328
If you laugh at my bow tie,
you're laughing at me.

257
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,786
If you laugh at me,

258
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,285
you'll remember this March 17th
for the rest of your life,

259
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,705
but we don't quite know why yet.

260
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,326
Don't you find it thrilling?

261
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,168
Is something wrong?

262
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,958
Not at all.

263
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,416
There are prints on most of the surfaces.

264
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,790
The walls are covered
with plans, maps, diagrams...

265
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,633
I see an oven.

266
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,165
They probably used it
to get rid of evidence.

267
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,753
I'm going to examine it.

268
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:05,791
There are some plastic fragments,
perhaps from an electronic device.

269
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,171
I'm separating the burnt pieces.

270
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,500
I think I have something.

271
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,498
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

272
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,040
So I'm a Maserati, am I?

273
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,455
For fuck's sake,
did he put it in the papers too?

274
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,671
It's OK.

275
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,251
- If you want, I'll give you a ride.
- What the hell?

276
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,166
It's just a ride.

277
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,080
Just a ride?

278
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,786
Then we push a button, erase the tape,

279
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:49,955
destroy the black box,
and it's like nothing happened.

280
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,286
Mónica dumped me.

281
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,075
I'm a free man.

282
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,165
I don't need to erase any black box.

283
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,630
I'll take the Maserati,
put the pedal to the metal,

284
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,288
and start doing donuts
until I burn rubber.

285
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,211
Cool as a cucumber.

286
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,375
- You're so macho, aren't you?
- Very macho, so watch out.

287
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,878
In case you have to go to the garage
to change the suspension.

288
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,576
Wait until you see
the state of the chassis.

289
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,541
Scary.

290
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,458
This bastard even leaves misleading clues
in the bidet.

291
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm sure they planted it there.

292
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,250
It was at the bottom of the oven, melted.
It's impossible it was planted.

293
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,253
So?

294
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,713
A SIM card is engraved
with a number of up to 19 digits,

295
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,131
unique to each card.

296
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,500
This one disappeared when it was burnt,
but, during the process,

297
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,423
it bent over the metallic chip,

298
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,580
branding seven numbers on it.

299
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,036
We cross-checked it
with data from carriers,

300
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:17,665
and we came up with 354 cards
matching those end numbers.

301
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,581
One of them was bought three months ago
and has only made one call.

302
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,463
During the heist.

303
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,421
Bingo!

304
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,920
Where did they call?

305
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,080
Wait! A little suspense, no?

306
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,745
Mindanao, the Philippines.

307
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,083
Holy shit, I knew it!

308
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,293
We'll talk to Interpol.

309
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,666
- Hello?
- Mindanao, the Philippines. They know.

310
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,876
- How?
- A half-burnt SIM card. In the ambulance.

311
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,501
Nothing changes for you.

312
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,963
You've got to go into the office now,
show her the watch...

313
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:22,538
- And tell her, I'm with you.
- That I am? Should I say it like that?

314
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:23,828
Excuse me?

315
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,916
I'm with you could be confusing.

316
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,460
She might just think I'm weird.
A communist cop.

317
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,961
If I say the Professor's with you,
it's clearer.

318
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,671
Just show her the watch. That's all.

319
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,670
Understood.

320
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,711
Get the hostages out.

321
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:49,168
- Get up and go to the stairs.
- How's the pressure of being in charge?

322
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,830
Fantastic.

323
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,833
I'm all ears. I'm listening.

324
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:00,376
You have a message from the Professor,
Lisbon is alive.

325
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,538
She's in the tent.
Think of a way to save her.

326
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,076
It's an order.

327
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,788
First you stage a coup,
now you give me an order.

328
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,535
That's odd. I'd say it's...

329
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,581
a dangerous thing to do,
but it's also...

330
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,706
understandable, of course.

331
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,541
There they are, the empowered women.

332
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,166
This is all bullshit.

333
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,575
- And it's about to end.
- Are you done?

334
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,503
What's wrong with you?

335
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:33,043
- With me?
- Are you angry at your mom?

336
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:36,376
Didn't she breastfeed you long enough?

337
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:41,825
Is that why you keep on looking
for something to complain about?

338
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:52,883
The order comes from the Professor.
He's got a dick, just like you.

339
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,375
They are in Mindanao.

340
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,751
In 24 hours, we'll have found them.

341
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,423
You know the protocol.

342
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,750
Paula arrives here,

343
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,003
you're declared guilty of child abduction,

344
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,423
you lose custody,

345
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,958
and she goes to live with her dad.

346
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,960
Have you come to tell me I'm screwed?
I already know that.

347
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,326
It depends.

348
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,415
I'll let you call them. Here and now.

349
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,630
And you save them.

350
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,708
When we get to the house in Mindanao,
they won't be there.

351
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,081
We screwed up.

352
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:55,378
I'm not thrilled at the idea
of Paula going to Alberto either.

353
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,631
I wonder what she's doing now.

354
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,376
Close your eyes. Picture her.

355
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:10,583
Tucked in bed.

356
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:14,076
Her hair spread across the blanket.
You can almost smell her.

357
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,210
Close your eyes. Picture her.

358
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,420
Close them.

359
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,496
What are you doing?

360
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:29,631
It's only a five-year wait.
Then you'll see each other again.

361
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,831
She comes running. Mommy!

362
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,498
She hugs you like this, wraps you up.

363
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,253
She clings to you like a little monkey.

364
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,376
And you press her against you...

365
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,576
and hold her face.

366
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,626
To look at her.

367
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,880
But she won't let go.

368
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,875
She repeats endlessly,

369
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,130
like a mantra to save her
from the bad things.

370
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:59,958
Mommy, don't leave me.

371
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,918
Mommy, don't leave me.

372
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Mommy, don't leave me.

373
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,830
Raquel,

374
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,536
I know you love him. And he loves you.

375
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:13,291
For that exact reason...
what do you think he'd tell you to do?

376
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,833
I offered you...

377
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:24,078
five years in prison.
I'll change it to five minutes.

378
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,213
I'm offering you freedom.

379
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,286
Sergio goes to jail. You go free.

380
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:40,793
Your arrest was never official.
Call them, bring them to safety.

381
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,331
You'll be with them in 24 hours.

382
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:48,331
We'll never come after you.
Everything will be over, honey.

383
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:39,921
Better?

384
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,003
Well?

385
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,331
Did you get any rest?

386
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,211
I've tried to, but I can't sleep.

387
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,916
Do you have nightmares?

388
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:06,376
Every time I close my eyes,
I relive it.

389
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:25,423
Hey, what happened to the alpha male?
I thought you were a free man.

390
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,671
What are they talking about?

391
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,750
Hello, cutie.

392
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,583
Come to my island, if you like.

393
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,330
Provided you don't party much.
I'm not really into that noisy music.

394
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,958
If you invite me over,
I'll show you my best bikini.

395
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,325
Why didn't you tell us?

396
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,670
I couldn't.

397
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,166
You need to talk about it, Rio.

398
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,003
They took me out of my cell one night,

399
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,881
forced me to dig my own grave
in the desert.

400
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,168
I'm such a sweet girl.

401
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,995
That's why I'm smiling all damn day.

402
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:21,286
Then they made me
place a coffin in the hole.

403
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,790
And they made me get inside.

404
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,538
Then they threw sand on top.

405
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,423
Until I was buried.

406
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,078
And they left me there.

407
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,040
In the darkness.

408
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,456
In silence and barely able to breathe.

409
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,540
Easy.

410
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:55,828
Easy.

411
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,790
I'm here with you.

412
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,128
Do you know the only thing on my mind?

413
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,246
What?

414
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:11,915
It should have been the Professor
being buried alive, not me.

415
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,540
I'm sorry.

416
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,035
Look.

417
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,745
Come on, let's go.

418
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,168
Excuse me a second.
I'm going to the bathroom.

419
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,753
You don't trust me.

420
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,326
I'm an egomaniac.

421
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,131
I'll only be willing to follow my plan.

422
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,666
I'm obsessed with being the boss.

423
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,290
So much so that if things don't go
how I planned...

424
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,205
I might become a risk, right?

425
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,673
Yes.

426
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,001
That's what I think.

427
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,963
You figured me out.

428
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,540
But there's something
you haven't considered.

429
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:50,126
It's that not only do I love your brother,
but I also love the plan...

430
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,875
to the same extent.

431
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,790
I would sell you out, no problem.

432
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,040
And the rest of the gang too.

433
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,166
But I'd never betray the plan.

434
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,291
That's where my loyalty lies.

435
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,461
This is more than a heist,
and you know it.

436
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,250
The plan isn't perfect yet.
I accept that.

437
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,963
It's an unfinished poem.

438
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,003
We need you, brother.

439
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,458
Please.

440
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,750
You seemed very brave out there.

441
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,248
Which is admirable.

442
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,210
Commendable.

443
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,750
Come on, let me past.

444
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,753
You seemed very brave earlier,
but now you have to prove it.

445
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,036
Let's see those balls.

446
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,251
Hold on.

447
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,746
Hold on. Tell me what you prefer?

448
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,131
Death?

449
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:47,325
Look at me. Or impotence?
Sometimes you have to make hard choices.

450
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:50,826
For me, what do I do
with this jerk laughing at my bow tie?

451
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:54,376
For you, is it worth living
without a penis?

452
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,285
He's taking a long time.

453
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,205
He's beating up the fat guy
in the bathroom.

454
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,078
We would've heard something.

455
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,075
Real chaos, dear Sergio...

456
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,793
makes no noise.

457
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,668
Palermo was loyal to the heist.

458
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,540
But in his head,
that only meant one thing.

459
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:28,825
For the heist to continue,
he had to be back in charge.

460
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,040
It was his silent way of ensuring
we didn't see the chaos coming.

461
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,213
You know what you have to do.
Don't be a coward.

462
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,326
You have to dislocate the joint

463
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,960
between the first metacarpal
and the trapezium.

464
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,041
Firmly, without hesitation.

465
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:50,213
You twist it around like that.
There's no shackle it won't work on.

466
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,043
Don't make me have to separate you.

467
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:04,706
It'll hurt. But freedom will be worth it,
don't you think?

468
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,286
Come on.

469
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,380
Don't move!

470
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,130
- Don't move.
- Easy, kid.

471
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,998
I'm just a fucking security guard.

472
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:55,918
On the ground.

473
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,916
- No way.
- I said, on the ground now.

474
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:03,131
What are you going to do?
Shoot me, unarmed?

475
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:07,288
I swear if I have to, I will shoot you.

476
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:11,583
You'll shoot an unarmed father
who is only trying to escape?

477
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,325
Go ahead.

478
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,503
Here I am.

479
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:25,001
Don't move!

480
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,498
Get on the fucking ground, Gandía!

481
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,921
You won't shoot.

482
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,460
On the ground!

483
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,375
Don't move, for fuck's sake!

484
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,251
I said, don't move!

485
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,208
See you soon.
