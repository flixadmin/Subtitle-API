00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,135
Why, is yours a frigid narcissist, too?

314
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,303
Cold as ice.

315
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,557
Yeah, Mom was like that
ever since Charlie died.

316
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
Who's Charlie?

317
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
My brother.

318
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,229
I never had a brother.

319
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,566
No? Then why was Mom such a bitch
on your Earth?

320
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,319
Honestly, I couldn't say.

321
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:58,077
So, how is this
going to get me out of here?

322
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,581
The electrical current in the cable
should heat up the carbyne,

323
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,292
which, in turn,
should speed up the electrons.

324
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,835
And the faster they go...

325
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,338
The weaker
its molecular structure becomes.

326
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,964
Exactly.

327
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,466
Hmm.

328
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,760
I studied every once in a while.

329
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,096
Well, when it gets hot enough,

330
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,765
it should make the carbyne
as fragile as glass.

331
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,602
And then we can both get out of here.

Wha... It's just one time,
that's all I'm asking.

341
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,801
It's impossible.

342
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,971
He saved my life, Joe.
I owe him a thank you.

343
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,352

I did everything at full speed
without a care in the world.

347
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,951
But it wasn't until Zoom took me,

348
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,788
that I really thought I was gonna die.

349
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,544
And I was going to die
if The Flash didn't do what he did.

350
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:37,176
He gave up his powers to save me,
a guy he didn't even know.

351
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,680
No one's ever done anything like that
for me before.

352
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,435
I need to tell him
how much that means to me.

353
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,275
Well, all right.

354

Yeah, he's suffering from

00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,117
Relax, he'll be here.

632
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,455
What should I say?
I mean, I don't even know where to start.

633
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,458
Just be honest. Speak from your heart.

634
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,042
Okay.

635
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,919
THE FLASH: <i>Wally West.</i>

636
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,714
I'll see you at home.

637
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,884
You wanted to see me.

638
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,429
Uh, yes. I did. I mean, I do.

639

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

640
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,182
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

641
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,060
I just wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

642
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,024
And I know that
that came at a huge price for you.

643
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,486
<i>And I don't know how I'll ever repay that.</i>

644
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,074
I guess what I wanted to say was that

645
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,787
I'm not gonna waste this chance
that you've given me.

646
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,915
Thank you.

647
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,210
You're welcome, Wally.

JAY: <i>You okay?</i>

650
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,818
Stay away from me.

651
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,738
Killer Frost tried to kill you, Caitlin.

652
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,950
I saved your life.

653
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,994
You should thank me.

654
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,621
I just wanna go home.

655
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,583
No. Stay.

656
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,629
I want to leave!

JAMES: (ECHOING) Stay, boy!

ASHLEY: (ECHOING) <i>No!</i>

659
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,306
Please, take me back to my Earth.

660
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:33,311
You know,

661
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,148
I've always measured my success by
counting the number of victims I've had.

662
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,487
But now I think I'm gonna widen my scope

663
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,450
and start counting the number of Earths
I conquer instead.

664
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:50,370
You wanna go home?

665
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,415
Let's go. After all,

666
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,126
this Earth has already been
brought to its knees.

667
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,857
Well, you're here early.

668
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,402
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

669
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,861
Me, neither.

670
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,990
I know that we just took down Gray
without my powers, but...

671
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,537
I have no idea
how to get Caitlin back without them.

672
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,580
We can't, Allen.

673
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,207
Then what are we gonna do?

674
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,046
Gray...

675
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,966
Gray kidnapped me

676
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:51,346
because he thought I was Harrison Wells
from this Earth.

677
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,559
I know he was talking about another guy,
but I just...

678
00:39:56,226 --> 00:40:01,106
I can't help but think.
I still haven't paid for what I've done.

679
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,484
What does that mean?

(SIGHS)

681
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:13,661
I thought, you know, when you...
When we closed the breaches,

682
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,498
I could just forget
about everything I've done, but I can't.

683
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,753
I realize what I can do.

684
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,927
You are gonna get your speed back, Allen.
And I'm gonna help you do that.

685
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:33,180
How?
