1
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,458
DEDICATED TO MY DEAR FATHER
MR. LILARAM RAI SINGHANI

2
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,083
Rishu.

3
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,375
Rishu.

4
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,625
Rishu!

5
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,458
Rishu!

6
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,625
Rishu!

7
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,750
RANI

8
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,458
Name, Rishabh Saxena.

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,125
Age, 32 years.

10
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,875
Time of blast was between 4:00 and 4:30.

11
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,125
Everything is burnt.

12
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,625
He was hit on the head with
a heavy object, probably before the blast.

13
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,875
I see. Find out when it happened.

14
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,500
Sir, we've got fingerprints of one hand.

15
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,333
The rest of the body is completely burnt.

16
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,708
-There is a deep wound on the head.
-Yes, sir.

17
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,291
The body is completely burnt.
Only this hand remains.

18
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,083
There is a deep wound on the head.

19
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,708
Seems like he died before the blast.

20
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,000
There's "Rani" tattooed on the wrist…

21
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,083
Rani is his wife, she's sitting there.

22
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,708
This is not an accident, sir.

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,666
Once we get the murder weapon,
everything will be clear.

24
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,875
Stop sulking.

25
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,791
We're going to see
a girl for you to marry!

26
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,625
We'd done this two years ago as well.

27
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,583
Remember?

28
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,833
Exactly.

29
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,458
It's been two years!

30
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,875
You met Meera for all of two minutes,
but you're still not over her.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,791
Tell me, what else do you like?

32
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,083
Mahesh.

33
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,750
I really like Mahesh.

34
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,583
We studied together in college.

35
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,416
I've not been able
to tell Daddy about him.

36
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,916
Who falls in love
with the first girl he meets?

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,625
You've been moping around since.

38
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,166
And here we have got such a nice proposal.
Your horoscopes have also matched.

39
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,541
Her name is lovely too.

40
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,916
Rani Kashyap.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,041
Rishu-Rani, the names sound good together.

42
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,708
The girl is pretty, well-mannered…

43
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,041
she's a vegetarian and fair-skinned too!

44
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,375
She has completed her Masters
in Hindi Literature.

45
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,291
Stop it now, Mommy.
I'm meeting her now anyway.

46
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,958
And please, don't use the "going to the
washroom" excuse to survey the house.

47
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,166
Let's go.

48
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,833
Please, have some more food.
Rani has cooked all the food.

49
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,958
-All of these?
-Yes.

50
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,416
-And this kachori as well?
-Of course.

51
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,666
She has also embroidered
these covers on the sofa.

52
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,541
Do you like him?

53
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,625
He's an engineer
at the Jwalapur Electricity Board.

54
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,125
Don't know.

55
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,750
I don't want to live in Jwalapur.

56
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,541
Don't think of it like that.

57
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,750
Remember your boyfriend of five years,
what's his name…

58
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,583
Neeraj Khaitan.
That gasbag vamoosed off to America.

59
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,541
And the other guy you dated for two years…

60
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,333
Aunty, I know… He was my boyfriend.
I remember very well.

61
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,583
Stop dreaming of
these romantic novel heroes

62
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,750
and grab a simple guy like him.

63
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,291
Plus, you're not getting any younger.

64
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,125
Also, it's very difficult
to find a match for your horoscope.

65
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,958
Your father has found only
two matches in the last two years.

66
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,958
Look at your other option.

67
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,875
This man from Mumbai.

68
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,750
Your horoscope has matched with his.

69
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,333
And this… Jwalapur.

70
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,541
Jwalapur?

71
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,166
So what?

72
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,791
Your husband seems like a quiet man,
just like mine.

73
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,625
Rani would like to talk to Rishu,
in the kitchen.

74
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,750
Please come.

75
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,916
Just don't ask her what else she likes.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,958
Please come.

77
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

78
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,416
Okay, let me start with some
bullet points about myself.

79
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,833
I have studied literature.

80
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,791
I work as a beauty salon manager,
as a hobby.

81
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,000
And I hate doing household chores.

82
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:19,958
Apart from this,
I'm a well-mannered and homely girl.

83
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:27,333
You're getting a great combo here,
a beauty with brains and a hot bod.

84
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:35,958
All we want is a simple and homely girl.

85
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,750
In that case, it's a perfect match.

86
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,250
Have you read books
written by Dinesh Pandit?

87
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,541
He's the best crime novelist!

88
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,250
His forte is writing about
spine-chilling murders in small towns,

89
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,333
which nobody can solve.

90
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,708
Have you heard of him?

91
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,750
No. I just heard of him now, from you.

92
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,583
Do you have anything else
you'd like to ask me now?

93
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,291
Or do you plan to come back to Delhi,
to continue this conversation?

94
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,708
Er, no…

95
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,208
Never mind, tell me about your hobbies.

96
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,333
-My hobbies…
-Yes, what are your hobbies?

97
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,833
I'm telling you.

98
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,750
Well…

99
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:21,416
My neighbors call me over on weekends
to fix their electronic appliances.

100
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,416
I like fixing gadgets.
I'm an engineer. They must have told you.

101
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,541
That's great. It's perfect timing!

102
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,958
-Thank you.
-Let me test you on this.

103
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,708
This fan has conked off.

104
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,000
Fix it.

105
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,916
Now?

106
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,708
Do you need anything from here?

107
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,125
Beena, where's the toilet?

108
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,125
This way.

109
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,583
Go straight and take a left.

110
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,541
It's…

111
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,291
I was looking for the toilet.

112
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,041
Let us discuss this with our
guruji and we'll let you know.

113
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:04,958
Okay?

114
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,458
Listen!

115
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:14,958
If you insist on marrying this girl,
I'll drink this poison.

116
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,083
Mommy, I really like Rani Kashyap.

117
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:39,250
In that case, I'll hang myself and die.

118
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,208
You can marry her after I'm dead.

119
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,958
Fine, I'll jump to my death.

120
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,125
What?

121
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,708
Won't you stop me?

122
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,291
I'm confused as to what to stop you from.

123
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,875
Poisoning, hanging,
or jumping to your death?

124
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,750
Decide and let me know.

125
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,833
Mark my words,
both of you won't get along.

126
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,166
You won't be able to handle her.

127
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,250
I'm an engineer, Mommy.

128
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,500
I handle livewires every day.

129
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,916
Of course, I can handle her.

130
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,041
You know what, Uncle?

131
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
-All she needs is to be trained.
-Really?

132
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,750
You can easily train her
in the first ten days.

133
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,041
Besides she seems very bubbly.

134
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,666
They all seem very
bubbly in the beginning.

135
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
So did she, when I married her.

136
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,375
You looked like a bubble too, at first,
and then my bubble burst.

137
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,833
Everyone looks at me in wonder

138
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,333
As I call out your name, day and night

139
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,375
My happiness knows no bounds

140
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,333
Sparks of desire fly everywhere

141
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,875
Fly everywhere

142
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,083
As our eyes meet

143
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,041
A fire comes alight

144
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,916
And in its flames

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,291
My poor heart melts

146
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,250
As our eyes meet

147
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,291
A fire comes alight

148
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,875
And in its flames

149
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,375
My poor heart melts

150
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,458
That loser has struck gold!

151
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,875
The poor guy doesn't know
what's about to hit him!

152
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,041
DINESH PANDIT
WRATH OF KASAULI

153
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,041
Confusion.

154
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,541
He is naughty yet a bit naive

155
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,916
The guy is so very naive

156
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,958
I too feel some sparks within me

157
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,958
Sparks light up within

158
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,375
My heart flutters when I see him

159
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,041
But I'm confused if he's hot or not

160
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,458
Hot or not

161
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,875
My heart leads me
Here and there

162
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,625
It knows not what it wants

163
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,041
Everything gleams and shines

164
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,083
The girl is nice

165
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,916
The guy is crooked

166
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,541
A bunch of lies

167
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,416
Oh, ho, ho

168
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,541
The guy is naive

169
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,250
The girl is sly

170
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,958
And therefore it's a

171
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,541
No, no, no

172
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,583
As our eyes meet
A fire comes alight

173
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,208
And in its flames

174
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,666
My poor heart melts

175
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,208
My poor heart melts

176
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,125
Who switched off the lights?

177
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,458
Ms. Rani.

178
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,916
Sir will be here in five minutes.

179
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,916
Your tiffin box fell, sir.

180
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,333
This is my favorite case.

181
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,916
But why, Rastogi?

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,708
Finally, after all
the riot and burglary cases,

183
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,375
I can relax, have my tea and snacks
as we discuss this case.

184
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:18,250
Rastogi, this case
is a breath of fresh air.

185
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,625
It's like poetry, with love and conflict

186
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,083
This case has riled Kishore Sir,
hence his personal interest…

187
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,500
He thought it was an open and shut case.

188
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,291
This woman looks like a murderer.

189
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,250
Case file solved. Medal received.

190
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,375
But madam has got…

191
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,291
-…his knickers in a twist!
-…his knickers in a twist !

192
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,125
Oh!

193
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,833
Any news of that boy?

194
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,125
It's a dead-end, sir.

195
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,583
The team returned today.

196
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,875
Sir?

197
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,333
Madam has been waiting
for the last two hours.

198
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,916
Good.

199
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,458
Let her get used to being in prison.

200
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,791
Rishabh Saxena.

201
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,458
Madam, we've been going over
the same story for two months now.

202
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,125
Why don't you tell me the truth, for once?

203
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,875
So madam, why did you kill your husband?

204
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,916
Only a vile woman
can kill such a loving husband.

205
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,291
He had even tattooed
your name on his wrist.

206
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,500
"Rani."

207
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,833
And you blew him to pieces?

208
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,916
All that remained of him
was his hand… bearing witness.

209
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,875
Rani Kashyap, you may have fooled
Rishu and everyone else,

210
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,416
but I'm certain
that you are the one who killed Rishu.

211
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,333
Should I tattoo your name
on my wrist as well?

212
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,333
"Killer Rani Kashyap!"

213
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,666
Huh?

214
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,125
Go ahead, sir.

215
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,666
But that won't change the truth.
That I am innocent.

216
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,916
Really?

217
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,625
Let's start from the beginning.

218
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,041
What was your relationship like,
with your husband?

219
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,000
Like any other
husband-and-wife relationship…

220
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,916
Sometimes good…

221
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,875
sometimes not so good.

222
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,083
Take this, Rani.

223
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,208
-It's been an hour. Still no sign of him.
-He's still not here.

224
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,250
-Did you speak to him?
-Did you tell him what time…

225
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,541
-There he is.
-Afzar has come!

226
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,166
Bro, there's a lot of traffic
at the junction.

227
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,833
Why don't you take Rani in the car?

228
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,416
I'll get the luggage in that one.

229
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,750
-Okay.
-Hello, Rani.

230
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,416
Please go ahead. I got the car cleaned.

231
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,208
A new city.

232
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,375
New people.

233
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,333
A new husband.

234
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,916
Dinesh Pandit would have liked Jwalapur…

235
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,875
but I didn't care much for it.

236
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:24,166
Our first meeting, the skies wept
and the city drowned…

237
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,041
Seems like Jwalapur didn't care
much for me either.

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,083
Hello! Fetch me too. Already forgotten me?

239
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,041
Don't you… have any friends?

240
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,000
There was no one to receive us.

241
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,333
But Afzar was there.

242
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,625
There wasn't any musical band
to welcome us either.

243
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,583
It was getting very late.

244
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,125
I thought we'd celebrate tomorrow.

245
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,916
Also, it's raining so heavily.

246
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,958
In Delhi, we don't let
such small things ruin our plans.

247
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,458
Er, sorry. A lot of rainwater came inside.

248
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,291
Give me two minutes, I'll clean this mess.

249
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,708
Misers!

250
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,916
Hello, Uncle.

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,041
Hello, Aunty.

252
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,583
Hi.

253
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,041
Hi.

254
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,583
Oh, there's tea!

255
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,500
It's empty.

256
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,166
I'll get some more.

257
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,500
Thanks.

258
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:13,416
Rani, our neighbors
will come to meet you today.

259
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Why don't you make
some delicious onion and potato fritters?

260
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,375
Sorry, Aunty,
I don't know how to make fritters.

261
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,708
You know what,
I can't even make a decent cup of tea.

262
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,125
No problem, I am good at it.
I'll get a cup for you.

263
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,500
-Great.
-Hold on.

264
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,875
Wait a minute.

265
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:39,083
Your mother said that you
had cooked all the food

266
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,083
that we ate at your house.

267
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,916
And I'd told Rishu…

268
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,916
hadn't I?

269
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,416
The kachoris were very crispy.

270
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,791
-Yes, you did.
-Aunty…

271
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,083
don't believe everything my mother says.

272
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,416
She will even claim
that my father can build airplanes.

273
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,916
Don't take her seriously.
She has a bad habit of exaggerating.

274
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,833
Because of this bad habit of hers,
now we're saddled with you.

275
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:03,333
She had guaranteed
that you are docile and talented.

276
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,500
Show us how docile you are!

277
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,666
I am very docile, Aunty.

278
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,375
I religiously fast on Mondays.
I am a vegetarian.

279
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,458
It's just that I don't know
how to make fritters, that's all.

280
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,916
I can do everything else.

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Threading, waxing,
bikini wax, cleanup, manicure-pedicure.

282
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,125
I can even get rid of your blackheads.

283
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,458
We've landed up with a beauty parlor
instead of a daughter-in-law.

284
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,375
Your biodata said
that you are a homely girl.

285
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,791
Let's not talk about biodatas, Aunty.

286
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,208
Your son's biodata said that he's 5'10".

287
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,083
There's no way he's more than 5'8"!

288
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,208
I'll… I'll get the tea and fritters.

289
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,916
Problem solved.

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,166
Please carry on.

291
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,500
I'll… I'll be back.

292
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,875
Did you study homeopathy?

293
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,458
Not really. It's my hobby.

294
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,708
Okay, let me test your knowledge.

295
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,041
What if I'm losing hair?

296
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,250
Are you?

297
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,875
It's just a test.

298
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,166
Oh, okay.

299
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,458
For hair loss, Thallium Metallicum.

300
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,958
Naturum Muriaticum for alopecia ariata.

301
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:49,208
For mild alopecia,
Ferrum Phosporicum should work.

302
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,166
Hmm.

303
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,625
What if it hurts here?

304
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:07,625
If your heart, er…
chest hurts, then Kalium Carbonicum.

305
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,875
But if it's severe…

306
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,666
What if my body itches, all over?

307
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,250
A new bar of soap, maybe?

308
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,500
Mother was asking me
about our honeymoon plans.

309
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,375
I've made a booking in Goa, for next week.

310
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,958
Did your parents try to set you up
with anyone else, before we got married?

311
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,500
Marriage?

312
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,541
Er…

313
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:41,916
You must have met other girls,
even if you didn't like them much.

314
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,500
Yes…

315
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I had met a girl, Meera.

316
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:55,958
She was really pretty.

317
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,791
Do you know, she pursued Masters as well?

318
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,916
No, I didn't.

319
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,750
What did she study?

320
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,125
Home Science.

321
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,375
Didn't you think of studying homeopat…

322
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:15,625
She'd said that she could
even cook Italian food, lasagne.

323
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:21,166
I love eating good food
and watching TV with my family.

324
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,208
-Yeah, I saw. I saw that.
-I love it.

325
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,458
Why didn't you marry her?

326
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,666
Things didn't work out.

327
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,875
So? Am I a consolation prize?

328
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,833
What?

329
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,583
What do you mean?

330
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,666
It means… I'm modern and outgoing,
but still, I am a homely girl.

331
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,083
Yes.

332
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,875
But you wanted the girl
who cooks Italian food, Ms. Lasagne!

333
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,791
-No.
-No?

334
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,958
When your mother lectured me
about fritters this morning,

335
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,750
you didn't speak up for me.

336
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,958
Er, I did.

337
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,291
This is the problem.

338
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,958
Without any effort,
without dating, without any hard work,

339
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,458
you've landed yourself
a beautiful and hot wife.

340
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,208
-So you take her for granted.
-No, no.

341
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,000
This is the problem
with arranged marriages.

342
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,791
Love marriages need a lot of work.

343
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,625
While in arranged marriages,
you're handed a wife on a platter.

344
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,375
And she's expected
to fry fritters for you.

345
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,250
Don't frit…
You don't have to fry fritters.

346
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,208
Go fry them yourself!

347
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,125
Tell your mother to fry them!

348
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:20,000
You should've mentioned
that you wanted to marry a cook.

349
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,291
You asked for a docile and pretty girl,
and you got one.

350
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,333
What's her name again?

351
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,541
Ms. Lasag-Ne!

352
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,375
-M… Meera.
-Yes.

353
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,583
Why didn't you marry her?

354
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,083
Didn't she know how to fry fritters?

355
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,458
Everybody wants docile cows
in arranged marriages!

356
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:11,791
You sauntered off to the market,
saddling me with this beauty parlor.

357
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,125
Now she's pandering to
your father's midlife crisis!

358
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,708
And look. Look at your new father.

359
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:25,625
He'll get you a new mother,
to live with your wife.

360
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:28,958
Er, I'd asked Aunty
if she wanted to color her hair too.

361
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,500
I was bored, so I thought…

362
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:36,166
So you'll make us show-monkeys,
to keep yourself entertained?

363
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,458
Here I am, chopping vegetables all day…

364
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,125
And Her Highness hasn't even
stepped inside the kitchen.

365
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,000
-Let me chop the vegetables.
-Why don't you just chop off my head?

366
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,125
Eyebrows!

367
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,125
She didn't even spare his eyebrows!

368
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,333
Looking good, aren't I?

369
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,291
You've let your wife
run wild in the house.

370
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,500
And she has turned him wild as well.

371
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,125
I've been telling you, start her training!

372
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,416
You mean physical training?

373
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,250
Not PT, TT.

374
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,333
A time table.

375
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,708
Tea at 7:00 a.m. Breakfast at 9:00 a.m.

376
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,041
Ironing your clothes at 10:00 a.m.
Et cetera, et cetera at 11:00 and 12:00.

377
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,791
Keep her busy with domestic chores.

378
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,458
This is how an arranged marriage works.
Right, Uncle?

379
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,083
You've been through this.

380
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,791
You're right, son.

381
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,333
Give me a pen and paper.

382
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:28,000
Which idiot walks around
with paper and a pen in his pocket?

383
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,125
I do.

384
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,458
Learn from him.

385
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,541
Here.

386
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,541
Demand tea at 7:00 a.m., without sugar.

387
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,541
Once served,
tell her you'd asked for sugar.

388
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,291
Okay? Show some attitude!

389
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,750
This will fan her desires
and make her pamper you.

390
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,958
You should try and control your anger.

391
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,791
Try to seduce him.

392
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,000
For now, calm down.

393
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,750
You can unleash all your anger
on him after a month.

394
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,458
Then, give him a tight slap
when he's sleeping.

395
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:55,625
But I've already screamed at him.

396
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,541
Be an angel in the first month.

397
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,541
Dripping sweetness.

398
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:04,166
Once he salivates like a dog,
for you, you can control him.

399
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,000
Work your magic on him.

400
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,416
In the next couple of days, seduce Rishu
by flaunting your cleavage.

401
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
"Oh no, oops!"

402
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,000
Make sure you wear tight blouses.

403
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,000
Turn him on and then get busy
doing something else.

404
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,375
Rani, it's seven, where's my tea?

405
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,083
7 A.M.
TEA

406
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,875
Rani, it's 7… Er…. Um…

407
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,500
8 a.m. No, not 8, 9! 9 a.m.!

408
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,125
Rani, I want breakfast at eight.

409
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,083
Rani, eight o'clock… Shit, she's here.

410
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,500
Rani?

411
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,208
Rani?

412
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,541
Rani!

413
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,625
Serve my breakfast at… at nine.

414
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,083
Vegetables are so expensive.

415
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,083
What do you two do all night…

416
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,041
that you have to flaunt your cleavage
during the day?

417
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,250
What's wrong?

418
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,083
Nothing. Continue watching your shows.

419
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,625
You've gone through enough.

420
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,375
Now that you've made a time table,
step two for the training is…

421
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,625
What?

422
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:26,291
Winning her over in the bedroom.

423
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,916
Be a lion.

424
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,875
Be a macho guy. Then you'll win her over.

425
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,708
Which is the most important part
of the body?

426
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,791
The head.

427
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,958
Understand?

428
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,875
Becoming a lion won't help, Afzar.

429
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,833
Selenium Metallicum,
Phosphoricum Acidum, Yohimbinum…

430
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,291
These medicines will help.

431
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:46,791
I hope all these x-cum, y-cum medicines
help you come at the right time!

432
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:49,125
What was that medicine you mentioned,
Urinum-cum-cum?

433
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,083
Please act your age, Daddy.

434
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,458
And stop dyeing your hair black.

435
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:57,875
You look like a scarecrow.

436
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,416
Mommy might use you to
scare away the devil himself.

437
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,375
Right.

438
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,333
Weren't we discussing something important?

439
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,083
-I only wanted to clarify…
-Can't you see we're talking here?

440
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,833
You don't need to know
that medicine, Daddy.

441
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,416
Rishu?

442
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,458
Rishu?

443
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,166
-Are you sleeping?
-Hmm?

444
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,166
Can you…

445
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,916
open this hook?

446
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,625
This… this hook?

447
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,666
Yes.

448
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,625
One…

449
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:14,958
Two…

450
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,833
It's done.

451
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,083
Ouch.

452
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,958
-Is it bleeding?
-No, no, it's not bleeding.

453
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,833
-Is there a cut?
-No.

454
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:32,000
Want me to give you two drops of Arnica?

455
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,666
Your pain will vanish in two seconds.

456
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,666
Should I?

457
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,125
You just… switch off the light.

458
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,000
Sorry, I'll come over to this side.
Should I come to this side?

459
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,583
Yes. Sorry, sorry.

460
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,541
One minute. My leg…

461
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:54,041
Get up.

462
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,125
-Okay.
-Er… I…

463
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,541
Okay.

464
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,500
Here.

465
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:12,750
Slowly, Rishu.

466
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,000
Rishu?

467
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,166
Rishu?

468
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,458
So how was last night?

469
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,000
What last night?

470
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,458
I told you I wanted a love marriage.

471
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,666
Husbands make no effort
in arranged marriages.

472
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,500
It's wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am
and the show's over.

473
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,458
The wife is left high and dry.

474
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,833
Didn't he come onto you?

475
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,875
He came. Too soon!

476
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:31,833
He's like a firefly.

477
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,875
Do you get it? A firefly!

478
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,250
Their light flashes for one second
and then it's game over!

479
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,833
Try and make him feel manly.

480
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,375
Be "homely," make him feel "manly…"

481
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,583
How many feelings do I need to give him
for such a simple thing?

482
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,083
I'm stuck in this back of beyond Jwalapur.

483
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,083
There'll be no fireworks between us.

484
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,958
Rishabh Saxena turned out
to be a damp squib!

485
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,666
Mother was right, I can't handle her.

486
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,541
She shares all our private details
with her family members.

487
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,833
She must have been joking with them.

488
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,125
You better stop drinking
those concoctions,

489
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,291
and don't take things personally.

490
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,458
And stop sulking.

491
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,125
UGVN LIMITED
ELECTRICITY DEPARTMENT -CHILA

492
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,916
Get it done, it's been pending…

493
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,208
Rishu, what are you doing here?

494
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,583
Aren't you on leave?

495
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:55,208
You know how it is.
Sir calls me on a whim.

496
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,458
-Rishu?
-Sir.

497
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:57,916
What are you doing here?

498
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,375
You should be on your honeymoon.

499
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,333
Focus on your performance there
and not here.

500
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:04,166
I think he wants to spend
his honeymoon with you, sir.

501
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,291
Remember, it's a Sunday tomorrow.

502
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,375
Don't turn up at the office.

503
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,666
Keep that in mind.

504
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,708
Get it?

505
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,583
-Should I serve you dinner?
-No, I have eaten already.

506
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,166
Rishu?

507
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,291
Should I serve you food?

508
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,625
I don't want to eat.

509
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,208
Lights are off, she must've gone to sleep.

510
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,875
Can I leave now?

511
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,541
You are bored with me, right?

512
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,125
No, nothing like that.

513
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,583
Lies.

514
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,208
Let's play a game of Truth or Dare.

515
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,500
If you choose truth, you'll tell me
why you're running away from me.

516
00:36:55,916 --> 00:37:00,666
If you choose dare, I'll take off
my blouse, and you, your pants!

517
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,041
I heard you speak to your mother and aunt.

518
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,083
What kind of a man
were you looking for, Rani?

519
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Someone…

520
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,833
with a sense of humor,

521
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:30,416
who's dashing, naughty,

522
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,500
and madly in love.

523
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,416
Sometimes wild,

524
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,416
sometimes passionate,

525
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,708
and a little crazy.

526
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,750
You'll need five to six different people.

527
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,291
You won't find all this in one guy.

528
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,250
But can't that guy have
at least one of these qualities?

529
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,000
Or is that too much to ask?

530
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,125
The office will start
MBA classes tomorrow.

531
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,250
I will attend the classes after work.

532
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,166
Also…

533
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,583
you didn't get the six-in-one man
you were looking for,

534
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,208
instead you got me…

535
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,625
I'm sorry for that.

536
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,666
That was when
Rishu and I started drifting apart.

537
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:47,458
All I got from Rishu was his anger.

538
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,833
Even though we are together

539
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,625
You feel so distant

540
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:04,000
As we can't express our feelings

541
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,625
We remain silent

542
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:11,333
Or bicker all the time

543
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:16,041
Words of love remain unspoken

544
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:20,291
Do I convince her

545
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,958
Or convince myself

546
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:27,958
How do I change our fate?

547
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:32,041
Now I leave
Everything to fate

548
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,958
Everything to fate

549
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:39,750
Everything, I leave
To destiny

550
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,458
I tried to get close to him many times.

551
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:46,958
But it seemed he didn't love me anymore.

552
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,416
DINESH PANDIT
WRATH OF KASAULI

553
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,166
Oh

554
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,833
Days go by

555
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,291
And night begins

556
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:04,333
All night
I pace around my home

557
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,708
Since you're washing clothes,

558
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,916
wash Rishu's as well.

559
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,125
Oh

560
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,041
I close my eyes

561
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,791
And hide my tears

562
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:21,791
How do I change our fate?

563
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:26,125
Now I leave
Everything to fate

564
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:29,250
Everything to fate

565
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:32,791
Everything, I leave
To destiny

566
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:33,916
And abandon us

567
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,166
Now I leave
Everything to fate

568
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,041
Everything to fate

569
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:45,000
Everything, I leave
To destiny

570
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:50,041
Now I leave
Everything to fate

571
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:53,083
Everything to fate

572
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,041
Everything, I leave
To destiny

573
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,333
Sure, I can drop you.

574
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,666
Rani?

575
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,083
Studying hard, aren't you?

576
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,416
Just giving her some directions…

577
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,375
Directions?

578
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:11,791
He's forgotten his way back home.

579
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,375
But he'll give you good directions.

580
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,833
This is your MBA?

581
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,333
It's only been a month since our wedding.

582
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,458
He tried just once, and failed.

583
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:26,291
Just thought you should know.

584
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:28,875
Getting an MBA, huh?

585
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:35,333
Now I leave
Everything to fate

586
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:39,083
Everything to fate

587
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:43,875
Everything, I leave
To destiny

588
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,875
Can I come home for a few days?

589
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:50,250
No, it won't look good
if you come home so soon.

590
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,666
I'll only stay for a few days.

591
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,000
I know, but I'm going
to my brother's house tomorrow…

592
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:58,833
for a week.

593
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,458
And you'll be going
for your honeymoon soon.

594
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,791
Things like these happen.

595
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,375
Everything will be fine.

596
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,500
I'll call you later.

597
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,708
Should I start packing, for Goa?

598
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,333
There will be no honeymoon.

599
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:01,000
Will these dogs keep barking every night?

600
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:05,583
I can't stop these dogs from barking
for you to sleep peacefully.

601
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,833
I knew it!

602
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:09,333
I knew you would say something like this.

603
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:12,291
You shouldn't have married me, then.
You should've refused.

604
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,625
I was a fool.

605
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:16,916
This was my destiny.

606
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,958
These dogs were also in your destiny.

607
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,125
Try and befriend them.

608
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,583
So your house is opposite Rishu's?

609
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,750
-Yes.
-You must have seen what happened.

610
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:39,541
The thing is, a husband-wife relationship
is like a delicate thread.

611
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,166
You have to handle it with utmost care.

612
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,208
If you don't, it will break.

613
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,791
What's with all this poetry?

614
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,583
Explain it to me clearly.

615
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:53,166
Officer, try and understand
a woman's heart.

616
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:56,875
Neel is Lata's nephew.

617
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,916
He'd come to stay with them.

618
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,041
Why didn't you come for the wedding?

619
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:20,291
I did go to Delhi.

620
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,208
Why didn't I see you, then?

621
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,666
Because the wedding procession
had left by then.

622
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,000
-And the wedding was over.
-Crazy boy!

623
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,625
Where did you disappear last month?

624
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:32,416
Aunty… You know, I'm a free bird,
flitting around here and there.

625
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,750
Your mother was so worried.

626
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,583
You were asking about Rishu's wife.

627
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:39,125
Here she is.

628
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,833
This is Neel.

629
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,833
My nephew.

630
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,625
He'll stay with us for a few days.

631
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:51,750
During tourist season,
he takes tourists around on his row boat.

632
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:52,958
Aunty…

633
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,541
What she means is rafting.

634
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:56,958
River rafting?

635
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:00,916
Exactly. On a row boat!

636
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,541
Did Rani just wake up?

637
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,333
The sun is blazing already.

638
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,458
My sun isn't blazing yet, Neel.

639
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:18,166
Aunty…

640
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:21,958
why don't you ask Rani
to cook something special for me?

641
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,916
Don't talk about cooking.

642
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,583
She's no good at that.

643
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:31,000
The only thing she's good at
is using her scissors.

644
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,958
And stay away from her scissors.

645
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:36,750
Or you'll end up looking like
your uncle, Mr. Rambo.

646
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,458
Want a taste of my scissors?

647
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,125
No.

648
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,500
You're back.

649
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,958
Freshen up, I'll serve your dinner.

650
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,083
Rishu, my favorite cousin!

651
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,666
Neel? When did you arrive?

652
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,666
-Today, morning.
-This morning?

653
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,125
Nobody told me about this.

654
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:03,458
Please switch off the light, Rishu.

655
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:08,375
Seeing your father in his
glamour-boy haircut is hurting my eyes.

656
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:09,708
Just look at him.

657
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,666
And get your wife to stop her snipping.

658
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,125
She's quickly snipping away
our reputation.

659
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,916
You better control your wife.

660
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:43,791
The mother committed the murder
and implicated the wife.

661
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,291
DINESH PANDIT
HORROR OF LUST

662
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,625
So you've read Dinesh Pandit's novels?

663
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:55,916
Sorry, do you mind?

664
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,458
It's only a matter of a month.

665
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,916
Jwalapur will kill you if smoking doesn't.

666
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,708
You look fine to me.

667
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:11,666
Yeah, I look fine.

668
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:33,875
Is it a good pic?

669
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:42,666
She has stolen my heart

670
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,041
From afar

671
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,000
Yes, yes.

672
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,916
I've been feeling this love

673
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,958
Have you got everything?

674
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:53,458
For some time now

675
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:57,083
To her I bestow

676
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,875
Every moment of my life

677
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,625
She's the reason for my being

678
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,291
She is my world

679
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:07,791
She is magical

680
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,666
My heart says to me

681
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,125
Slip away

682
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:18,875
My heart says to me

683
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,875
Slip away

684
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:26,208
My mind says to me

685
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:29,208
Drift away

686
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,833
My heart says to me

687
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:33,458
Can I get a cup of tea?

688
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:36,125
Slip away

689
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,750
Do you want a cup of tea?

690
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:52,625
Are you going to make it?

691
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,625
Yes.

692
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,208
Sure.

693
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,333
Tea leaves?

694
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,833
Next to the sugar.

695
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:41,291
Another two spoonfuls.

696
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:49,791
And sugar?

697
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:50,875
Three spoonfuls.

698
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:33,666
You'll need a sieve.

699
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,291
It's good.

700
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:13,333
Oh, I don't know what is right

701
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,833
Or wrong

702
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:18,875
This fever of love

703
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,791
Surges within me

704
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,041
You make tea so well…

705
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:26,250
I'll happily die for food cooked by you.

706
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,375
Oh, I don't know who is friend

707
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:33,166
Or foe

708
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,625
This wave of joy

709
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:37,000
These mobile videos don't give
the correct instructions.

710
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,791
Has saved me

711
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:43,541
As I dive

712
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,291
Into the depths

713
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,208
The flame is too high.

714
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:50,916
She comes closer

715
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,125
Closer to me

716
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,958
Longing to touch her

717
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:01,500
Waiting for that moment

718
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,333
She is my reason

719
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:05,250
She is my refuge

720
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:08,958
She is everywhere

721
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,166
My heart says to me

722
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,375
Slip away

723
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:19,583
My mind says to me

724
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:20,916
Slip away

725
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,541
Are you okay, Rishu?

726
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,125
Rani.

727
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:35,416
Rani!

728
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,000
Rani!

729
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,083
Rani!

730
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:10,625
My heart says to me

731
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,875
Slip away

732
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:20,666
My mind says to me

733
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:24,166
Drift away

734
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,291
Who's she?

735
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:36,125
Slip away

736
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,791
Don't you dare touch me again!

737
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,833
Rani!

738
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:31,916
Rani! Rani!

739
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,583
Where are you?

740
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:49,875
This needs a little more salt.

741
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,708
I think she is a gifted cook.

742
00:55:56,916 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm craving some mutton curry.

743
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,541
You can't cook mutton in my kitchen.

744
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,625
Madam, over here.

745
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,541
Madam, big pieces or small?

746
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,958
-Meat?
-Hmm.

747
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,083
You said you're vegetarian.

748
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:36,791
Where did you get this meat from?

749
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,041
-I…
-What's wrong, Mommy?

750
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:40,166
Rishu, she wants to cook meat
in my kitchen.

751
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,416
-It's alright.
-Return it.

752
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,583
Don't worry, it won't go to your kitchen.

753
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:43,958
Come with me.

754
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,458
…she killed her husband so brutally.

755
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:37,583
Disposed of the murder weapon
and helped her lover escape…

756
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,333
these two are fucking with us now.

757
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:46,291
Women like her are very cunning.

758
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:52,791
Once I get a lead, she'll rot in jail!

759
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,458
He was my only friend, sir.

760
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:03,958
He was crazy about his wife.

761
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,458
Sir, this witch…

762
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:13,958
and her lover killed my friend.

763
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,416
They burnt him alive.

764
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,291
Wasn't his love enough for you?

765
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,125
She burnt him alive, sir!

766
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,458
He loved you so much.
She'll go to hell for this!

767
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,541
Arrest this woman, sir.

768
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,791
This witch has killed him.

769
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:41,041
How would you describe your relationship
with Neel Tripathi?

770
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,041
Sometimes good…

771
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:48,916
sometimes not so good.

772
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:51,041
Did you have a physical relationship?

773
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,083
Officer…

774
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,625
Dinesh Pandit writes,

775
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,250
that a relationship is a meeting of minds.

776
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,958
If it's only physical, it's lust!

777
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:19,750
Didn't you plan this with your lover?

778
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,083
Where's the lighter?

779
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:41,958
Thank you.

780
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:46,291
I'm cooking mutton, Afzar-style.

781
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,166
I got the recipe from Fatima.

782
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:51,875
Come here.

783
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,875
How many photos will you take?

784
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,458
I'm leaving next week.

785
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,333
Fine, I'll leave for Delhi as well,
next week.

786
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,208
Then I'll come to you.

787
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,291
Tell me…

788
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,666
Sure you can cook mutton?

789
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,541
It takes a lot of sweat and blood.

790
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:25,583
Once you taste my dish,
you can guess my blood group.

791
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,166
I'll put my heart
and soul into cooking it.

792
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,500
And what about Rishu?

793
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,583
I'll tell him everything.

794
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:40,333
The truth.

795
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:46,791
Stop!

796
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:48,166
Don't bring the mutton over here.

797
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,833
Rishu will return late.

798
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,833
You can give it to him when he's back.
Don't keep it here.

799
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:53,791
What about Neel? He'll eat it.

800
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,208
He left. Neel has left.

801
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:58,083
He quickly packed his stuff
and drove off suddenly.

802
01:00:58,166 --> 01:00:59,416
Without saying bye?

803
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,625
Yes. He left without saying bye.

804
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,458
I wonder what the hurry was!

805
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,625
-Have some more.
-Weird fellow…

806
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,250
left without saying goodbye.

807
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,666
He didn't just leave.

808
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:15,333
He ran away.

809
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:21,166
He ran away.

810
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:23,833
What are you waiting for?

811
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:25,250
Go and keep it inside.

812
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:20,416
Rani.

813
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,375
Serve Rishu his dinner.

814
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,416
She's always lost in her thoughts.

815
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,458
Wow!

816
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:02,458
I can see that you're making an effort.

817
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:10,333
Actually, you're so beautiful
that I get nervous in front of you.

818
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,666
I am sorry for all that has happened.

819
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:25,416
Can we start afresh?

820
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:39,291
Nice.

821
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:41,875
I had cooked the mutton for Neel.

822
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,666
I had fallen in love with him.

823
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:54,041
I wanted to be with him

824
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,166
but he ditched me and ran away,

825
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:04,791
and I got left behind… with you.

826
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,416
The mutton is delicious.

827
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:52,750
And he didn't say anything after that.

828
01:04:56,416 --> 01:05:00,541
I kept looking at him
and he continued eating.

829
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:06,583
It's a good story.

830
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:12,541
But I suspect you and your lover
killed Rishu.

831
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:17,041
There is a wound on his head
after being hit with something heavy.

832
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:20,208
I like your story as well, sir.

833
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,916
You'll like the ending as well,

834
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:34,416
when I find the murder weapon
and your lover.

835
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,791
OFFICE OF JWALAPUR INSPECTOR GENERAL

836
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,166
So you don't regret it?

837
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,541
Having an extramarital affair?

838
01:05:58,833 --> 01:05:59,916
No.

839
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,750
If I hadn't met Neel…

840
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:05,875
I wouldn't have met the real Rishu.

841
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,041
JWALAPUR TO DELHI

842
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:50,541
Rishu.

843
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:51,958
-Neel, how dare you!
-Are you mad?

844
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:01,708
Rishu…

845
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,625
Crazy man…

846
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:26,833
Let's go.

847
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,708
Sorry, sorry… It's nothing…

848
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:49,958
I admit, it was a mistake.

849
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,041
I was attracted to her.

850
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,916
And I fucked up.

851
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,208
If you'd satisfied her,
she wouldn't be so lonely.

852
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:01,833
I wouldn't have come between you two.

853
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,125
But Rishu…

854
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,625
why did you not consummate
your relationship with her?

855
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:12,208
Because I'm a fucking idiot!

856
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,208
I wanted to win her heart first.

857
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,583
And you thought…

858
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:33,333
"Rishu is a simpleton, screw him!

859
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,375
Let me screw his wife as well.

860
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,708
He won't protest."

861
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Why didn't you get her with you?

862
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:48,291
At least the two of you
would have been happy.

863
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,125
Where were you?

864
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:19,666
I tried calling you, Rishu.

865
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:27,666
Won't you talk to me?

866
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,375
Let's play Truth or Dare now.

867
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:40,375
Where did you go?

868
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:42,916
To get beaten up by Neel.

869
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:47,208
Why?

870
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:49,375
Because he left you.

871
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,125
You loved him so much,
but he didn't love you back.

872
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,000
Why?

873
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:28,250
-I am sorry.
-Stay… stay away from me.

874
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,250
What do I do, Rishu?

875
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,291
I made a mistake.

876
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,375
Should I leave?

877
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:46,916
Yes, please leave.

878
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:48,583
Really. Leave.

879
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:51,958
This is for the best.

880
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,583
I loved you so much, Rani!

881
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:04,916
So much that I couldn't live without you.

882
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,458
But now I can't live with you either.

883
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,208
You really should leave.

884
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,791
Because I feel like strangling you.

885
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,708
Leave, Rani, or else I'll kill you.

886
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,916
Just go.

887
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:48,375
Rishu?

888
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:50,583
Oh, no! What happened to you now?

889
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,333
You keep falling and getting hurt.
Can't you be careful?

890
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:57,333
We're going to Uncle's place,
we'll be back in the evening.

891
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,625
What's wrong?

892
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,791
Can you drop me off at the station?

893
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:54,750
Go by yourself.

894
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:17,958
Stop, stop.

895
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:19,666
What's wrong?

896
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,375
Hello, Rani.

897
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,291
Are you leaving?

898
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,750
Neel has also left.

899
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,750
I'll drop you. Get off.

900
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,083
Please come. Hop on, Rani.

901
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:34,833
Can't three of us ride together?

902
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:36,875
You won't get a rickshaw at this hour.

903
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,791
It won't take long, I can drop you.

904
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,458
We're just like Neel, Rani.
We'll keep you happy.

905
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,666
Ride with us, Rani. It will be fun.

906
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,875
We'll take good care of you.

907
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:47,291
It's our duty after all.

908
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:51,791
-Go inside. I'll deal with it.
-Oh, Rishu is here.

909
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,708
Rishu, are you taking Rani somewhere?

910
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,958
You've come out and she's going in…

911
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,541
We'll miss her so much, Rishu.

912
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,583
Rickshaw!

913
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:03,333
You know, Neel had called me.

914
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:06,833
He told me to look after both of them.

915
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:10,666
Let's all go… row, row, row your boat…

916
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,125
Don't worry, Neel is my bro.

917
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,458
Rickshaw!

918
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,208
You can't even stop a rickshaw…

919
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:19,791
Guess we'll have to do that for him too!

920
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:25,208
Rishu, can I send her a friend request?

921
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:26,708
Will she accept it?

922
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:27,916
Of course,

923
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:30,500
I'm sure she will.

924
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,833
We should get her handle for live stories.

925
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,166
#hotbhabhi.

926
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:41,833
You didn't even invite us
to the wedding, Rishu.

927
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:44,125
Give us a chance, let's have fun together.

928
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:52,958
There it is.

929
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,500
Come on, let me help you…

930
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,750
My mistake…
and Rishu was bearing the brunt of it.

931
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:04,500
There's Neel… who had run away.

932
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:06,041
And Rishu…

933
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,125
who was fighting my battles.

934
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:25,625
Please take my suitcase out.
I am not leaving.

935
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:34,833
You can punish me as you like,
but I'm staying with you.

936
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:36,166
I am not leaving.

937
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:42,666
That day I decided, no matter what,

938
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,458
I wouldn't ever leave Rishu.

939
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,250
Don't know if it was my stubbornness,

940
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:55,666
love…

941
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,125
or my guilt.

942
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,166
Can I have your wallet?

943
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,708
I have to pay for the laundry.

944
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,250
It's inside.

945
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:50,416
In front of me was a man
with murder in his eyes.

946
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,666
And I almost died… several times.

947
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:01,916
But as they say, love and hate are
two sides of the same coin.

948
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,041
Wallet.

949
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:13,541
When I met Rishu for the first time…

950
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,041
I had met an engineer.

951
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:20,583
The next time we met, he was my husband.

952
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:25,000
The third time around,
I met the lover in him.

953
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:29,291
A lover with whom
I was falling madly in love.

954
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:35,166
So deep was my love,
that I was willing to lose my mind…

955
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:38,166
and risk my life for him.

956
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,333
Dinesh Pandit writes,

957
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:44,750
"So what if he can't
stand the sight of me now?

958
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,666
His heart will beat for me someday."

959
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:30,500
So you knew
that your husband wanted to kill you.

960
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,750
And you didn't report it to the police?

961
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,750
You didn't even tell your family members?

962
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,541
You stayed on,
so that he could kill you, is it?

963
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:39,875
I didn't tell anyone, sir.

964
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,041
I stayed.

965
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,833
I'd made a mistake

966
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:46,916
and I'd have to pay the price for it.

967
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:53,333
Madam, are you mad,
or are you trying to drive us mad?

968
01:21:54,375 --> 01:22:00,000
Sir, true love often drives us
to the brink of madness.

969
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,625
Dinesh Pandit writes,

970
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:21,458
"Eternal love will always be
stained with a few drops of blood…

971
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:24,166
to protect it from evil!"

972
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,708
Well said.

973
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,583
Indeed.

974
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:31,375
Someone find this fucking Dinesh Pandit
and bring him here!

975
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:32,416
Yes, sir.

976
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:36,416
Let's get to the point.

977
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:40,416
So your official statement is that your
deceased husband wanted to kill you?

978
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:43,083
Yes.

979
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,250
And then, what did you do?

980
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:50,625
I waited.

981
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:52,125
For what?

982
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,791
For the right moment to kill him?

983
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:57,166
For his forgiveness.

984
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:02,416
Rani is here.

985
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:06,416
How are you, Rani?

986
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,625
Dinner is ready. Should I serve your food?

987
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,250
Sure.

988
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,916
Mix it with poison, while you're at it.

989
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,833
Let me tell you
an interesting story, Afzar.

990
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,708
Everyone in the neighborhood
already knows.

991
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:36,416
Why should you be left out?
You're my friend after all.

992
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,666
Listen to this.

993
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,916
Rishu.

994
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,833
Have you heard the story
of the emperor who goes to the market?

995
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,083
Rishu, please.

996
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:45,750
Which emperor?

997
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:50,083
In the story, the mighty emperor

998
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:54,416
proudly walks around the market,

999
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,166
wrapped in a silk shawl.

1000
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,666
When suddenly a little boy shouts out,

1001
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,666
"The emperor is naked."

1002
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:13,500
Then the emperor realizes,
he has been butt-naked all this time,

1003
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:16,458
and he didn't even know it.

1004
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,916
He smiled and walked around,

1005
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,166
while everyone else laughed at him.

1006
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,458
I don't get it.

1007
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:26,625
You will.

1008
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:34,416
My situation is similar to the emperor's.

1009
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:40,375
I am butt-naked!

1010
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:48,458
Everyone here knows that my wife
had an affair with my cousin.

1011
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:49,958
Rishu…

1012
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:54,125
A real steamy affair!

1013
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:56,416
What nonsense!

1014
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,750
It's not nonsense. It's the truth.

1015
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:00,916
-Enough!
-Here I was, being the good guy…

1016
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,291
And someone came and stole my love,
right in front of my eyes.

1017
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:09,166
You've had too much to drink.
Eat and go to bed.

1018
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:11,208
-I'll eat dinner.
-Where are you off to?

1019
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:12,750
See you tomorrow morning.

1020
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:13,958
Sit for a while.

1021
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:18,458
Hey, Afzar, I've just started.

1022
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,458
What!

1023
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:24,000
No one wants to talk to me.

1024
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,041
You can talk to me.

1025
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,375
You're punishing me anyway.

1026
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:34,250
Go ahead and vent your anger.

1027
01:25:34,333 --> 01:25:35,666
But why?

1028
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,583
Will you go on, like this?

1029
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:43,208
What else can I do, Rani?

1030
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:00,750
This is your chance.

1031
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:01,708
Push me.

1032
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:45,791
I had told you,
if you leave, I won't stop you.

1033
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:46,958
I'll kill you now!

1034
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:50,125
Rishu, if you had to kill me,
you would've done it already!

1035
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,125
Want to kill me, right?
Push me off the ledge.

1036
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,708
Push me… now!

1037
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:56,708
Or get a knife and stab me.

1038
01:26:58,458 --> 01:26:59,875
If you can't do this…

1039
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:02,833
then please forgive me.

1040
01:27:03,458 --> 01:27:05,958
Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

1041
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:09,250
I made a mistake. I'm really sorry.
I made a mistake.

1042
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:12,208
I am sorry.

1043
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:15,750
You're a good man.

1044
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:21,291
You're a very good man.

1045
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:28,041
If you love me even a little bit,
that will do.

1046
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,250
That is enough for me.

1047
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:32,583
You don't deserve my love.

1048
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:35,166
No, I don't, right?

1049
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,416
But you still loved me… a lot.

1050
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:47,125
You loved me so much
that I hate myself for betraying you.

1051
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,875
I am sorry. It was my fault.
I am really sorry.

1052
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:51,875
I said… sorry.

1053
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:54,166
I am so sorry.

1054
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:00,541
Ordinary people like me…

1055
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:04,333
go unnoticed.

1056
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:09,750
Everyone thinks of us
only when they want something fixed.

1057
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,500
-We are no heroes.
-No.

1058
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:14,875
I don't want a hero.

1059
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:16,833
I want Rishu.

1060
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,791
I want you.

1061
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:22,125
Can't we start over again?

1062
01:28:23,166 --> 01:28:24,583
Just once, please.

1063
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:26,958
Please.

1064
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,791
I'm sorry… sorry.

1065
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:39,166
Sorry.

1066
01:29:18,041 --> 01:29:20,833
All that happened, is in the past

1067
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:23,458
These new moments

1068
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:27,250
Let us cherish them

1069
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,291
Slowly

1070
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:32,958
With you

1071
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:37,500
My days are happy again

1072
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:41,333
These precious dreams of mine

1073
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:43,791
I give to you

1074
01:29:43,875 --> 01:29:48,166
Come and see them

1075
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,875
Our lives

1076
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:53,750
Have come together

1077
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:58,458
And everything is bright again

1078
01:29:58,541 --> 01:30:00,875
You've come to me

1079
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:03,375
Like we've never been apart

1080
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:06,500
You've come to me

1081
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:11,250
Love has blossomed

1082
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:13,833
Like things were never amiss

1083
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:17,208
Love has blossomed

1084
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:19,458
You are mine

1085
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:20,625
Was he killed?

1086
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,791
The neighbor rang the bell and saw…

1087
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:29,125
What are we having for lunch?

1088
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:30,458
-Lust.
-Lust?

1089
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,708
Lust for peas.

1090
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:33,750
-"Lust for peas"?
-Er, just carrots and peas.

1091
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:44,291
May the fragrance of your love

1092
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:46,958
Now be mine

1093
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:52,125
Your eyes speak a thousand words

1094
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:55,375
Your heart beats

1095
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,083
Together with mine

1096
01:30:57,166 --> 01:31:00,958
I feel alive

1097
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:05,500
My destiny

1098
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:07,958
Lies in your hands

1099
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:12,333
We will never be apart

1100
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:15,291
Let me give you

1101
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:18,333
Many new reasons

1102
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:22,458
To smile

1103
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:25,333
You've come to me

1104
01:31:25,416 --> 01:31:27,833
Like we've never been apart

1105
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:32,166
You've come to me

1106
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:35,500
Love has blossomed

1107
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:38,041
Like things were never amiss

1108
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:42,000
Love has blossomed

1109
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:48,333
You are mine

1110
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,250
Rishu?

1111
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:06,541
Sorry.

1112
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,500
Rani?

1113
01:32:14,666 --> 01:32:17,500
What's she doing? Is she crazy?

1114
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:37,125
Rishu, I've dropped that girl off.

1115
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:40,333
Ask her if she wants to ride with me.

1116
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,500
-I will…
-Rishu.

1117
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:08,083
Please let him go, Rishu.

1118
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:09,958
I won't leave him.

1119
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:57,583
-What happened?
-The tires are stuck.

1120
01:34:10,166 --> 01:34:12,500
The timing belt is broken.
It will take time.

1121
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,166
I want to wash my hands.
Where's the washbasin?

1122
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,875
On the right.

1123
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,333
Okay, hurry up.

1124
01:34:33,291 --> 01:34:34,291
Does it hurt?

1125
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:36,708
Just a little.

1126
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:40,416
When I got burnt at the gas stove,

1127
01:34:41,125 --> 01:34:42,708
that hurt a lot more.

1128
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:46,916
I was angry.

1129
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:50,750
Sorry.

1130
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:55,125
I haven't come across a criminal like you,
not even in Dinesh Pandit's books.

1131
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:57,875
Thank goodness,

1132
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,416
I'm better than him
at something, at least.

1133
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,166
"You don't listen to your mind

1134
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,958
and I don't listen to my heart.

1135
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:14,041
"No one listens to each other
in this city."

1136
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:17,458
-Wrath of Kasauli.
-Wrath of Kasauli.

1137
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:23,375
When did you start reading
Dinesh Pandit's books?

1138
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:26,833
After I fell in love.

1139
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,291
-Ouch.
-Sorry. Are you hurt?

1140
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:33,916
And then,
it seemed like everything would be okay.

1141
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:19,208
According to the neighbor,
on the day of the explosion,

1142
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,916
Neel arrived at the house at 2:30 p.m.

1143
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:28,625
15 minutes later, Rishu went in.

1144
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:33,291
And a little later, she left the house.

1145
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:35,250
Sir.

1146
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:38,583
If Rishu was dead before
she left the house…

1147
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:41,625
She left the house
and sent the little girl

1148
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:44,666
to tell Rishu to lock the door.

1149
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:47,250
Munni, tell Rishu to lock the door.

1150
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:48,666
-Rishu!
-But, sir,

1151
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,458
Munni has testified

1152
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:52,375
that Neel closed the door.

1153
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:56,125
Call the rickshaw driver.

1154
01:37:56,208 --> 01:37:58,208
Hey, you, come here. Quick!

1155
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,916
-Tell him everything.
-Tell him.

1156
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,958
Sir, madam was with me
from 3:15 p.m. to 4:15 p.m.

1157
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:08,166
Where to?

1158
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,333
The market.

1159
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,791
She went to the market in my rickshaw.

1160
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,750
I took her there.

1161
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:17,041
I saw her walking around the market.

1162
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:20,541
I waited.

1163
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:25,250
And then I drove her back.

1164
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:29,333
I saw her feed mutton to the dogs.

1165
01:38:29,416 --> 01:38:31,541
Suddenly… there was a loud explosion.

1166
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:34,833
Madam was outside the house.

1167
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:36,166
How could she murder…

1168
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:37,958
She couldn't, right?

1169
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:40,125
You scoundrel!
Looks to me like you're the murderer!

1170
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:42,333
Mess with me and I'll break your legs.

1171
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,000
You'll be riding a rickshaw with one leg.

1172
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:47,083
-Get lost.
-Buzz off.

1173
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:49,125
Everyone has a different
version of the story.

1174
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,416
What beats me is, when there
was so much drama going on here,

1175
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,875
why would she leave
the husband and lover alone at home

1176
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:58,416
and go to the market?

1177
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:01,750
Perhaps to hide the murder weapon, sir?

1178
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:02,875
Where is it?

1179
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:06,291
When did she hide it and where?

1180
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:11,500
I am convinced
that this woman is behind it all.

1181
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:14,291
She's just leading us
on a wild goose chase.

1182
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:19,583
Hello?

1183
01:39:20,666 --> 01:39:22,041
What?

1184
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:29,750
Hello, sir.

1185
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:33,291
What did you find, Mr. Singh?

1186
01:39:35,833 --> 01:39:37,041
See this, sir.

1187
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:39,125
The blast took place
during the Clean India campaign.

1188
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:40,583
We were recording that.

1189
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:42,000
And here is Neel.

1190
01:39:48,166 --> 01:39:49,041
Oh.

1191
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,666
So here he is.

1192
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:52,833
See the replay, sir.

1193
01:39:53,916 --> 01:39:56,291
We've been searching
for the lover all this while…

1194
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:58,791
And here he is, swimming away!

1195
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:02,583
When you guys were busy recording videos,

1196
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:04,541
madam's lover made the great escape.

1197
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:07,875
Instead of investigating, policemen are
now key witnesses in this case.

1198
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:11,083
Tell me, what have you
discovered from this video?

1199
01:40:11,166 --> 01:40:12,791
-That…
-What's going on?

1200
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:14,875
What's going on in here?

1201
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:17,291
I see all the policemen here,
solving Rani Madam's case.

1202
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:20,625
We have a good lead, sir.
He won't be able to escape now.

1203
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:22,916
You wasted two months
running after that Neel.

1204
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,916
-Sir, to solve the case…
-Did you solve it?

1205
01:40:25,791 --> 01:40:28,541
-Sir, actually…
-There is an honor killing case.

1206
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:30,750
It is getting a lot of media attention.

1207
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:32,750
Forget madam's case. Focus on this.

1208
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:34,875
Sir, please give me two days.

1209
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:36,416
We already have a court order.

1210
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:39,416
We'll do a lie detector test
and everything will be clear.

1211
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:44,041
If you don't solve this madam's case
in two days, find another job.

1212
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:46,708
Idiot.

1213
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:49,750
Where's Madam? Rani…

1214
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:52,958
Go, call that woman.

1215
01:40:53,041 --> 01:40:54,416
Take a look at this.

1216
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:55,583
It's Neel.

1217
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:01,750
He entered the lane at 2:30 p.m.

1218
01:41:01,833 --> 01:41:03,041
Then Rishu went into the house.

1219
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:04,625
After that, you came out.

1220
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:06,083
And then there was an explosion.

1221
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:09,250
And here we see Neel escaping,
right after the explosion.

1222
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:13,125
Where's Neel, madam?

1223
01:41:15,583 --> 01:41:16,416
I don't know, sir.

1224
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,208
You bloody whore.

1225
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:22,416
We're sick of your stories.

1226
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:25,833
You better tell us where you've hidden
the murder weapon,

1227
01:41:25,916 --> 01:41:27,500
-or I'll beat you to a pulp.
-Bindiya.

1228
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:29,583
She won't talk here.

1229
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:31,916
Take her inside and get her to talk.

1230
01:41:32,416 --> 01:41:35,000
What were you saying, huh?

1231
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:36,833
Madness in love…

1232
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:39,166
Go in, let me show you. Give me that.

1233
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:41,625
Madness, huh?

1234
01:41:45,208 --> 01:41:46,791
What else does Dinesh Pandit write, huh?

1235
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:48,041
Tell me!

1236
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:49,708
What else does he say?

1237
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:57,916
Sir. She's an adamant one.

1238
01:41:58,541 --> 01:42:01,916
Even though I thrashed her,
she hasn't spilled anything.

1239
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:07,125
Ask the technician if he can do
the lie detector test tomorrow.

1240
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:09,000
-Okay, sir.
-Listen.

1241
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:11,083
Yes?

1242
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:13,041
Let her go.

1243
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:15,500
Okay.

1244
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:22,750
Hey! Rani, get up.

1245
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:53,958
Madam?

1246
01:43:03,916 --> 01:43:05,625
Why is it taking so long?

1247
01:43:13,958 --> 01:43:16,708
Why don't I take you
to the doctor tomorrow?

1248
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,541
I need to go back
to the police station tomorrow.

1249
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:35,916
Is everything ready, Mishra?

1250
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,708
The recordings are precise.

1251
01:43:37,791 --> 01:43:39,500
There's no chance of a mistake.

1252
01:43:40,666 --> 01:43:41,791
Please come in.

1253
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:44,291
This machine detects every minute detail,

1254
01:43:45,166 --> 01:43:48,583
perspiration, trembling of lips,
eye movement.

1255
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:49,500
All these get noted.

1256
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,916
Your heartbeat is being monitored, anyway.

1257
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:55,791
-Should we start, Mishra?
-Sure.

1258
01:43:57,416 --> 01:43:59,083
Sir, may I go to the bathroom?

1259
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:09,208
Hurry up.

1260
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:11,708
How long will you take?

1261
01:44:11,791 --> 01:44:13,041
Come on out!

1262
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:14,708
Rani!

1263
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:16,916
What the hell are you doing?

1264
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,583
Hurry up!

1265
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:20,333
Are you dead?

1266
01:44:20,416 --> 01:44:22,041
Don't be too smart…

1267
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:24,958
I'll break the door and come in!

1268
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:26,750
Is your name Rani Kashyap?

1269
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:29,500
Rani! Come out, quickly!

1270
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:31,208
Yes, my name is Rani Kashyap

1271
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:33,958
Is your name Rani Kashyap?

1272
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:36,041
Yes, my name is Rani Kashyap.

1273
01:44:36,125 --> 01:44:37,541
Are you 28 years old?

1274
01:44:38,666 --> 01:44:39,958
Yes.

1275
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,958
Are you nervous, madam?

1276
01:44:49,291 --> 01:44:51,583
You heart is already beating very fast.

1277
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:54,166
Yes, I am nervous.

1278
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:56,375
Take a few deep breaths, madam.

1279
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:03,208
What happened on the 30th of November?

1280
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:11,875
Sir, on that day, Rishu's parents
left for Bareilly, to attend a wedding.

1281
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:17,083
Remember to turn off the gas valve,
or you'll end up blowing up the house.

1282
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:18,375
-Bye.
-Take care.

1283
01:45:18,458 --> 01:45:19,416
Bye. You also take care.

1284
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,833
We had invited Rishu's friends
over that day.

1285
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,791
Aren't your friends coming over today?

1286
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:29,541
I had asked Rishu to get a few things,
on his way back from work.

1287
01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:31,916
I've already bought mutton.
Don't forget the spices.

1288
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,833
Send me a list of what you need.

1289
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:40,125
-But Rishu returned early.
-I've got everything.

1290
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:43,791
And he saw me talking to Neel.

1291
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:46,250
Rishu, he…

1292
01:45:47,666 --> 01:45:49,666
Welcome home, Rishu.

1293
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:53,083
Why haven't you told him
that you're leaving with me?

1294
01:45:53,166 --> 01:45:54,041
Stop lying.

1295
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:55,791
He's here to talk about something, Rishu.

1296
01:45:55,875 --> 01:45:57,583
Rani, go outside and let us sort this out.

1297
01:45:57,666 --> 01:46:01,041
I tried to explain everything to Rishu.

1298
01:46:01,125 --> 01:46:02,750
Go, Rani.
We are just talking, don't worry.

1299
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:04,541
But he wouldn't listen.

1300
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:06,541
He insisted.

1301
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,666
And I left to go to the market.

1302
01:46:15,916 --> 01:46:17,041
Rickshaw!

1303
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:19,875
As I left the house,
the door was left open…

1304
01:46:19,958 --> 01:46:21,958
Tell Rishu to lock the door.

1305
01:46:22,041 --> 01:46:23,708
Rishu! Lock the door.

1306
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:24,875
I saw Ruhina.

1307
01:46:24,958 --> 01:46:26,708
I am making kheer today.
I'll send some over.

1308
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:30,666
-That's great.
-And I got into the rickshaw.

1309
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:34,500
I had a tiff with the butcher.

1310
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:35,625
Your knife looks rusted.

1311
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:37,958
There's no way our knives are rusted.

1312
01:46:38,041 --> 01:46:40,125
Give it to me,
I'll get it cut from somewhere else.

1313
01:46:41,041 --> 01:46:43,375
So I went to another butcher,

1314
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:47,208
got him to cut the mutton,
and was on my way back home.

1315
01:46:47,791 --> 01:46:50,166
I gave a few pieces of mutton
to the stray dogs.

1316
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:05,583
Rishu!

1317
01:47:06,416 --> 01:47:07,333
Rishu!

1318
01:47:09,625 --> 01:47:10,458
Rishu!

1319
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:24,333
Her heartbeat is fast even
when answering general questions.

1320
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:26,000
Which is normal.

1321
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:28,708
But there's no change
when I ask the other questions.

1322
01:47:29,291 --> 01:47:31,083
It's difficult to come to a conclusion.

1323
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:33,541
Now what?

1324
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,333
We can do one thing.

1325
01:47:37,166 --> 01:47:40,666
I'll ask her questions
she can reply, with a yes or a no.

1326
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:42,375
Okay.

1327
01:47:53,541 --> 01:47:56,583
Does she always wear these shoes?

1328
01:47:58,416 --> 01:47:59,250
Why?

1329
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:01,208
Got it. Let's go.

1330
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:03,916
Remove your shoes, madam.

1331
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:14,958
Look at this, sir.

1332
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:16,833
She has put a nail inside the shoe.

1333
01:48:17,916 --> 01:48:19,583
This would have caused her pain.

1334
01:48:20,166 --> 01:48:22,458
And pain quickens the heartbeat.

1335
01:48:23,416 --> 01:48:27,041
Now she'll claim
that she was unaware of this.

1336
01:48:27,875 --> 01:48:31,000
Get her to talk, Mishra.

1337
01:48:34,583 --> 01:48:36,416
Is your name Rani Kashyap?

1338
01:48:39,416 --> 01:48:40,250
Yes.

1339
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:41,958
Are you 28 years old?

1340
01:48:42,458 --> 01:48:43,625
Yes.

1341
01:48:43,708 --> 01:48:45,750
Did you kill your husband?

1342
01:48:50,416 --> 01:48:51,625
No.

1343
01:48:57,916 --> 01:49:00,750
Were you having an affair
with Neel Tripathi?

1344
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:02,666
Yes.

1345
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:05,125
Did your lover kill your husband?

1346
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:08,666
I don't know.

1347
01:49:12,916 --> 01:49:15,583
Did you murder your husband?

1348
01:49:17,125 --> 01:49:18,458
No, I didn't.

1349
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:32,458
Sir, I am convinced
that she has committed the murder.

1350
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:34,625
She knows where her lover is.
The machine hasn't…

1351
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:35,875
Enough of this nonsense.

1352
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:40,083
Close Rani's case and start investigating
the honor killing case.

1353
01:51:02,458 --> 01:51:05,916
Madam left and the case file was closed.

1354
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:09,875
But this case will always
remain open for me.

1355
01:51:10,625 --> 01:51:14,583
Everyone said that I'd taken
this case very personally…

1356
01:51:15,583 --> 01:51:19,333
Five years went by and I got transferred.

1357
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,666
-Have you taken everything?
-Yes, I have.

1358
01:51:26,583 --> 01:51:28,250
I've kept your luggage inside, sir.

1359
01:51:28,833 --> 01:51:30,750
Best wishes for your new posting.

1360
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:32,166
We'll miss you, sir.

1361
01:51:33,083 --> 01:51:34,625
-Good to know!
-Thank you, sir.

1362
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:36,666
-How much is it?
-Won't you share some?

1363
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,041
Give some to Uncle.

1364
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:39,666
It's okay…

1365
01:51:40,375 --> 01:51:41,583
What about me?

1366
01:51:41,666 --> 01:51:44,708
Sir, have you read Dinesh Pandit's novels?

1367
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:47,958
DINESH PANDIT
WRATH OF KASAULI

1368
01:51:48,541 --> 01:51:50,333
Dinesh Pandit writes,

1369
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:55,833
"Eternal love will always be
stained with a few drops of blood!"

1370
01:51:58,333 --> 01:52:01,541
Savitri had won over
Bhairav's heart once again.

1371
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:05,958
But Bhairav didn't know
that he had one last hurdle to cross,

1372
01:52:06,541 --> 01:52:08,916
before he could get her.

1373
01:52:12,625 --> 01:52:18,666
Cardamom, cloves, raisins,
almonds, and… Rishu.

1374
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:22,708
From a different perspective,
Rani can be an endless debate.

1375
01:52:23,416 --> 01:52:26,583
One with accusations and insults for me…

1376
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:29,833
But I want to have this debate…
all my life.

1377
01:52:30,875 --> 01:52:35,333
Truth be told, I want to have
all my arguments only with her.

1378
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:36,416
Move aside, Munni.

1379
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:40,791
I had wronged her greatly,
but she stayed with me despite that.

1380
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:42,375
And today…

1381
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:43,708
I've got everything.

1382
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,375
…today I can do anything for Rani!

1383
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:49,250
Welcome home, Rishu.

1384
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:52,250
We were talking about you.
Did you get the cashews and raisins?

1385
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:53,416
Please leave, Neel.

1386
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,583
Tell him.

1387
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:58,083
Tell him that you're leaving with me.
Go on.

1388
01:52:58,166 --> 01:52:59,375
You're lying.

1389
01:52:59,458 --> 01:53:00,708
I'm lying?

1390
01:53:00,791 --> 01:53:04,083
Rishu, he's here to bother us,
nothing else.

1391
01:53:04,166 --> 01:53:06,000
I'm here to bother you?

1392
01:53:06,083 --> 01:53:08,958
He's the one who's been bothering me.

1393
01:53:09,041 --> 01:53:11,750
Why don't you tell her
what you've been up to, Rishu?

1394
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:14,541
He'd come to Delhi,
to attack me with a screwdriver.

1395
01:53:15,125 --> 01:53:17,625
Now he's told my neighbors
that I'm a sex offender.

1396
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:19,125
Me, a sex offender?!

1397
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:23,958
Why did you guys get married,
if you can't satisfy your wife?

1398
01:53:24,625 --> 01:53:27,375
Then people like me get stuck
being called sex offenders.

1399
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:29,375
Listen, I came here to clarify.

1400
01:53:29,916 --> 01:53:31,541
Neither of us is an offender.

1401
01:53:31,625 --> 01:53:33,958
What happened between us was consensual.
I didn't force her.

1402
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:35,541
She's right here. Ask her.

1403
01:53:38,416 --> 01:53:39,750
And it was good.

1404
01:53:39,833 --> 01:53:41,041
I bet she thinks about it too.

1405
01:53:41,125 --> 01:53:44,250
Yes, I think about the
huge mistake that I made…

1406
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,541
this is how I think of it.

1407
01:53:46,833 --> 01:53:47,791
A mistake?

1408
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,583
Why did you come to me, then?

1409
01:53:51,416 --> 01:53:54,958
Because one has to kiss many frogs
before one can find true love.

1410
01:53:55,041 --> 01:53:56,958
And you belong to that category.

1411
01:54:06,708 --> 01:54:07,791
A frog, huh?

1412
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:11,666
This frog is a big fan of yours, Rani.

1413
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:13,625
Let me increase your fan base.

1414
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:18,041
I'd taken a few videos
of us together, remember?

1415
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:21,125
Let me share these
in a few WhatsApp groups.

1416
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:22,500
And your fan base will increase.

1417
01:54:22,583 --> 01:54:26,000
Rishu, you better get
some more screwdrivers,

1418
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:29,916
because you'll have to run after quite
a few boys, who'll watch these videos.

1419
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,291
See this. Don't you look nice?

1420
01:54:33,333 --> 01:54:35,500
Remember? You were having a good time too?

1421
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,333
-Rishu!
-Get off!

1422
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:54,500
You're completely mad, you know?

1423
01:55:05,333 --> 01:55:06,791
Have you lost your mind?

1424
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:23,958
Rishu…

1425
01:55:24,708 --> 01:55:25,583
Get up.

1426
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:34,125
There's blood.

1427
01:55:39,791 --> 01:55:40,791
Neel?

1428
01:55:46,916 --> 01:55:48,375
Neel?

1429
01:55:50,375 --> 01:55:51,375
Neel!

1430
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:53,750
Neel!

1431
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:23,458
Let me call the police.

1432
01:56:24,083 --> 01:56:26,166
-I'll call the police.
-What?

1433
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:27,333
He is dead.

1434
01:56:28,541 --> 01:56:31,500
-He is dead.
-No… don't call the police.

1435
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:33,500
-I killed him.
-You didn't kill him, Rani.

1436
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:36,000
I killed him, Rishu.

1437
01:56:36,083 --> 01:56:37,708
It was an accident.
He died in an accident.

1438
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:39,291
We didn't kill him on purpose.

1439
01:56:39,791 --> 01:56:43,208
I won't let you go to jail for this.

1440
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:48,750
You won't go to jail for this.
Listen carefully.

1441
01:56:48,833 --> 01:56:52,000
Finally, things have improved between us

1442
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:55,000
and I want to be with you.

1443
01:57:06,041 --> 01:57:07,000
Now…

1444
01:57:09,416 --> 01:57:10,916
what next?

1445
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:11,958
What do we do?

1446
01:57:15,791 --> 01:57:18,583
In every unplanned crime,
you get one chance to hide it.

1447
01:57:21,791 --> 01:57:24,000
I've read only one of
Dinesh Pandit's novels,

1448
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:25,083
Wrath of Kasauli.

1449
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:29,583
-Rishu. No.
-We have no other option.

1450
01:57:29,666 --> 01:57:31,541
No Rishu, this is madness.

1451
01:57:31,625 --> 01:57:32,958
-We don't have a choice, Rani.
-I'll go to jail…

1452
01:57:33,041 --> 01:57:34,791
Nothing will happen.
No one will get caught.

1453
01:57:34,875 --> 01:57:35,750
Listen to me, please.

1454
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:37,416
Everything will be fine!

1455
01:57:38,166 --> 01:57:39,541
No, I refuse to be parted from you.

1456
01:57:40,166 --> 01:57:41,500
Just do as I say, okay?

1457
01:57:42,791 --> 01:57:43,875
Please.

1458
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:46,916
We will get caught.

1459
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:08,125
Ice, ice!

1460
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:10,875
Ice!

1461
01:58:11,458 --> 01:58:13,041
Go and get some ice!

1462
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,125
Ice… Where's the ice?

1463
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:23,958
Rani!

1464
01:58:25,416 --> 01:58:26,250
Rani!

1465
01:58:30,166 --> 01:58:32,000
Get some kerosene. Go.

1466
01:58:37,916 --> 01:58:39,458
Get some newspapers.

1467
01:58:41,625 --> 01:58:42,583
Give them to me.

1468
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,875
No, I can't. No.

1469
01:59:39,083 --> 01:59:40,500
Hold this, Rani.

1470
01:59:42,166 --> 01:59:44,083
What's wrong with you, Rani?

1471
01:59:44,166 --> 01:59:45,750
-Please.
-I can't.

1472
01:59:47,416 --> 01:59:49,458
Want to be away from me? No, right?

1473
01:59:51,291 --> 01:59:53,458
Then you have to do this. Do this for us.

1474
01:59:53,958 --> 01:59:55,125
Please, Rani. Okay?

1475
01:59:55,208 --> 01:59:56,375
Come.

1476
01:59:58,125 --> 01:59:59,125
Hold this!

1477
01:59:59,958 --> 02:00:01,500
Rani! Just do it!

1478
02:00:17,875 --> 02:00:20,208
Rishu! Rishu!

1479
02:00:20,833 --> 02:00:23,625
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

1480
02:00:24,166 --> 02:00:26,000
Open your eyes, Rishu.

1481
02:00:30,625 --> 02:00:31,666
Rishu.

1482
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:54,208
Your tears are the reason for my sorrows

1483
02:00:54,291 --> 02:00:59,750
Your happiness, I owe to you

1484
02:01:00,375 --> 02:01:06,250
Every inch of my being

1485
02:01:06,333 --> 02:01:11,000
Says that

1486
02:01:12,833 --> 02:01:15,958
We write our own story

1487
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:19,000
We are our destiny

1488
02:01:19,083 --> 02:01:24,125
We only have each other

1489
02:01:24,208 --> 02:01:27,458
Sorrows are gone

1490
02:01:27,541 --> 02:01:30,583
Happiness is ours

1491
02:01:31,166 --> 02:01:36,208
We've made it together at last

1492
02:01:36,291 --> 02:01:39,333
You've come to me

1493
02:01:39,416 --> 02:01:42,333
Like we've never been apart

1494
02:01:42,416 --> 02:01:46,083
You've come to me

1495
02:01:48,333 --> 02:01:51,250
Love has blossomed

1496
02:01:51,333 --> 02:01:54,125
Like things were never amiss

1497
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:58,541
Love has blossomed

1498
02:01:59,333 --> 02:02:03,791
You are mine

1499
02:02:16,083 --> 02:02:18,291
Rickshaw!

1500
02:02:25,208 --> 02:02:27,833
Munni, tell Rishu to lock the door.

1501
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,625
Rishu! Rishu! Lock the door!

1502
02:02:33,125 --> 02:02:33,958
Rishu…

1503
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:39,125
I am making kheer today.
I'll send some over.

1504
02:02:45,208 --> 02:02:46,625
Don't play over here.

1505
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:49,875
Go somewhere else.

1506
02:03:15,083 --> 02:03:16,416
Wait a minute.

1507
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:18,958
Give it to me,
I'll get it cut from somewhere else.

1508
02:03:26,041 --> 02:03:27,000
There's one more.

1509
02:03:27,541 --> 02:03:29,125
Can you cut this as well, please?

1510

1512
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:50,958
Rishu.

1513
02:05:36,708 --> 02:05:40,000
RANI

1514
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:02,333
And Bhairav's story of love and sacrifice…

1515
02:06:04,291 --> 02:06:06,500
drowned in the river with him.

1516
02:06:17,583 --> 02:06:19,416
What happened? Why are you laughing?

1517
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,625
He switched the lover's body
with his own and turned the case around.

1518
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,166
The lover will remain missing.

1519
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:28,416
His body will never be found.

1520
02:06:29,208 --> 02:06:32,458
The husband cut off his hand
and kept it with the dead body,

1521
02:06:33,375 --> 02:06:34,958
to save his wife.

1522
02:06:35,041 --> 02:06:38,250
In this day and age,
who goes to such lengths for love?

1523
02:06:38,333 --> 02:06:41,000
I'm sure, you wouldn't even sacrifice
a fingernail for me!

brink of insanity, it's not true love…

Only the meek seek refuge
in passionless relationships."
