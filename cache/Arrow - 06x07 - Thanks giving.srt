Previously on "Arrow"...

00:00:01,215 --> 00:00:03,448
Last night, a group
of vigilantes saved

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,249
hundreds of lives.

00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,051
So if we are going to decide

5
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:08,806
on diverting
police resources

6
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:10,874
towards stopping them,
we are not going to do that

7
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:13,510
until the people
of Star City have spoken.

8
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,745
How the public will decide
on the issue of vigilantism

9
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,814
is anyone's guess.

10
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:19,649
Mayor Queen didn't mention he was
under investigation?

11
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,784
Of course he did.

12
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,352
Which makes us
overdue for a chat.

13
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:23,787
I'm not the man
you think I am.

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,722
No, Mr. Queen.
I think you are.

15
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:29,326
Cayden: I was able to upload
a critical piece of code

16
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,094
to Arclight.

17
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:32,095
What happens now?

18
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,663

very much, guys.

William: Thank you.

Oh, that's very

Thank you, buddy.

- Thank you. All right!
- Here you go.

Oh, cranberry sauce.
Awesome.

Ok, happy Thanksgiving,
guys. Thank you very much.

Happy Thanksgiving.

It's a nice turnout.
You having fun?

00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,918
Yeah! I'm really glad
we're doing this.

Uh, you should go

that he's

00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:14,905
If I was dating
the Green Arrow,

41
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,273
I think I would know.

42
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,208
Besides, the Flash is much
more my type.

43

Sam, she's a civilian.

44

Just give her a little
space, ok?

45
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,582
How is it that you

46

don't put an arrow into
one of those people?

Um, Rene--he is a complete
pain in the ass,

53
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,795
but he's a very good
advanceman.

54
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:40,463
Good. Detective,
what's the tally?

55
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,132
Um, I got it
all here.

Thank you so much for
being here today, guys.

63
00:01:57,115 --> 00:02:02,452
It means a ton to Felicity,
to William, to myself

64
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:05,755
that we can all gather
together as a city

65
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:09,159
and help our neediest
neighbors on Thanksgiving.

66
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,227
Across these various
food drives with your help,

67
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:14,531
the SCPD has collected
enough food

68
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,233
to feed over 1,200 families.

69
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,636
And it is why
I am incredibly proud

70
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:21,605
to be here today
at the unveiling

71
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,139
of our new precinct.

72

It's a top-of-the-line
facility

73
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,811
for a top-of-the-line
police force...

74
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,983

actually make

Murder, assault,
burglary, and kidnapping

82
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:51,968
all stemming from your
activity as the Green Arrow.

It's--it's gonna be
fine, buddy. I promise.

Watson: You have the right
to remain silent.

be used against you in a court of law...

to come in, press in tow.

You'll give
the formal salute,

I want this man
processed,

room.

00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,794
I'm a federal agent
with a valid arrest warrant.

96
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,629
I want this man
bound over until arraignment.

97
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,164
Quentin: Yes, but
you're federal. This is--

lieutenant to sign off.

I'm the ranking lieutenant.

for him?

as it will stop this.

that it will.

00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,088
and can extrapolate
to predict

480
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,256
population movements.

481
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,891
I mean, maybe if
I can re-create it.

482
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,860
I'm here. Uh, what
can I do to help?

483
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,495
You can start by telling
me what prototype you used

484
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:58,129
to treat John's condition.

485
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,631
Our prototype,
the one

486
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,032
we've been
developing

487
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,300
to cure paralysis.

488
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,802
You injected our friend

489
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,470
with our company's
proprietary technology,

490
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,972
and you didn't think to--
I don't know--

491
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,573
involve me in that at all?

492
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,941
I thought Lone Ranger
was just the way we

493
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,643
did things here at
Helix Dynamics.

494
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,278
You know, the name of
the company you picked

495
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,813
without consulting me.

496
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,718
I'm gonna work on
an algorithm over there

497
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,287
when I figure out
what an algorithm is.

498
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,725
I can't believe you just
equated a company name

499
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,494
to exposing a friend of ours
to an untested procedure,

500
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,396
one you still haven't
told me about.

501
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,064
It's the prototype of
your spinal implant--

502
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,634
well, mine, seeing as
how I'm the one who invented it,

503
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,302
which is why I probably
don't understand

504
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,170
how you get to be
so offended here.

505
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,340
We don't have time
for this right now.

506
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:45,977
You should
cross-reference

507
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,312
the crowd's patterns

508
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,813
with the bomb's
path of destruction.

509
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:52,284
I'll work on
a particle cloud SIM.

510
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,520
You could've
just told me you

511
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:56,755
didn't like the name.

512
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,790
It's more than just
the name.

513
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,692
Felicity, you picked
the product we're making.

514
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,427
We're working out
of your loft.

515
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,929
That's called being decisive,
taking initiative.

516
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,130
I didn't do anything
in secret.

517
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,698
Can we maybe fight
about this

518
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,466
when we don't have
a thermobaric bomb to stop?

519
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,535
You don't have to ask me
to do anything

520
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,572
because that's how you
and I work together.

521
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,174
It's done.

522
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,976
Let's hope it works.

523
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,547
[John exhales sharply]

524
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,655
I told Felicity not
to bother you with this.

525
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,658
Which part?

526
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,694
You being in
the hospital?

527
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:40,398
The experimental
steroid? Or...

528
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,134
The nerve damage...

529
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,103
that has affected
you for months?

530
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,440
Are you gonna be
all right?

531
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,175
I'll be fine.

532
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:51,743
I didn't want you
to worry, Oliver,

533
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,278
which is why I didn't
tell you.

534
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,579
No, no, John.

535
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,181
You didn't tell me
because you knew

536
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,183
I'd never let you
go out there compromised

537
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,218
and that I'd
certainly

538
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,120
never let you
compromise the team.

539
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,423
I've been mad at
you before, John,

540
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,791
but this--

541
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,164
is the first time
I've ever been disappointed.

542
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,167
Oliver, you gave up the right to judge me
when you gave up that hood.

543
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,936
You don't get to claim
the moral high ground here, my friend.

544
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:19,404
Oh, I'm not, Oliver,

545
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:24,209
but I apologized to the
people who I endangered--

546
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:27,312
the team,
Oliver.

547
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,614
The team.

548
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,850
My obligation begins
and ends with them.

549
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,418
I don't owe you
a damn thing.

550
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,953
For the sake of
our friendship,

551
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:37,222
I hope that's
withdrawal talking.

552
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,331
I put on this hood
because you asked me to.

553
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,899
Don't blame me for this.

554
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:51,069
I'm not blaming you, Oliver.
I blame myself...

555
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,240
For putting your needs,
your goals,

556
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:57,542
even your family,
above my own.

557
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,811
I've done that from
the very beginning.

558
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,646
That was my biggest
mistake.

559
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,748
That was your
biggest mistake?

560
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,819
Mine was trusting you
to be the Green Arrow.

561
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:26,004
Hey, Speedy...

562
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,474
I miss you.

563
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,875
[Chuckles softly]

564
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,679
I miss chatting.

565
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:41,486
They say that, um...

566
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,489
People in comas
can hear

567
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,825
other people
talking to them.

568
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:49,294
If you can hear me,

569
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:51,963
just wake up,
all right?

570
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,132
Please.

571
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:57,902
'Cause I need you now.

572
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,981
Should we order
our traditional Thanksgiving meal?

573
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:10,976
I can call Big Belly Burger.

574
00:24:10,977 --> 00:24:13,657
I'm gonna crush my French fries
and pretend they're mashed potatoes.

575
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:17,083
Got it.

576
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,718
Maximum damage for
a thermobaric bomb

577
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
is Starling Stadium.

578
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:21,688
Today's Thanksgiving.

579
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,289
Yeah, we just covered that
when we talked about

580
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,824
ordering Turkey burgers.

581
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,426
Wow.

582
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:27,727
I'm saying, Billy Joel's
playing there tonight.

583
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:29,696
Sold-out crowd.

584
00:24:29,698 --> 00:24:31,331
I happen to like
a wide variety of music,

585
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,499
and "The Stranger"
is a treasured piece

586
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,435
of rock and roll history.
Yeah.

587
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:37,570
Starling Stadium
seats 35,000 people.

588
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:40,306
Guess that sold-out crowd's
gonna get pressure-cooked to death.

589
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:42,008
So how do we go in
without Diggle?

590
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,143
We got to step it up,
fight without him.

591
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:45,979
Yeah, 'cause that went
really well at Amertek.

592
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,180
We have 4 hours
until showtime.

593
00:24:47,182 --> 00:24:48,848
That's definitely
the place

594
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,783
because Cayden
already has control over the system.

595
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:52,018
What can we do about
shutting it down

596
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,186
or cutting the power
or something?

597
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,887
Tried that. Didn't work.

598
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:56,923
That's how I know Cayden has
me locked out of the grid.

599
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:58,558
Ok, I know the saying goes,
"the show must go on," but this can't.

600
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,327
I might be able
to help with that.

601
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:02,962
I'll declare
a state of emergency

602
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:04,330
and make them cancel
the concert.

603
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:06,833
- Did you talk to John?
- John and I spoke.

604
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:08,968
I'd like to apologize
to everyone.

605
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,372
I didn't know about
John's injury,

606
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:15,575
and I should have.

607
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:17,810
I will have them
shut down the concert.

608
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:20,146
I wanted to see
Billy Joel.

609
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:23,883
Like I said on the
phone, Mr. Mayor,

610
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,985
I'm not canceling.

611
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,721
The cost will
be catastrophic.

612
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:30,990
Well, so would
a terrorist attack.

613
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:32,191
You have no actionable
intelligence

614
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:34,761
or confirmation
from law enforcement.

615
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:36,429
You're asking me
to set a match

616
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:38,031
to millions of dollars
on a hunch?

617
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:41,034
Have you even brought
this to Mr. Joel?

618
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:42,568
Brought what?

619
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,570
You haven't given me
anything substantive.

620
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,439
I'm trying to save lives.

621
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:48,441
You're trying
to save your ass.

622
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:49,776
You give me some
proof--

623
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:51,411
something more than
your gut to go on--

624
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:52,812
then I'll cancel.

625
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:54,414
But without it,

626
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,249
we open the gates
at 7 pm.

627
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,586
Oh, come on.

628
00:26:00,588 --> 00:26:04,023
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Why you asking?

629
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:06,259
- Because you don't look it.
- Whoa!

630
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:07,860
Well, I get it.

631
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:09,195
No one wants to believe
someone that they care about

632
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:10,463
is capable of
unspeakable things.

633
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:11,697
I've been there.

[Scoffs]
Oh, yeah?

otherworldly doppelganger

636
00:26:16,738 --> 00:26:18,638
been on a murder spree
lately, Dinah?

a professional manner.

a safer and better place.

891
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:33,523
I also recognize, as mayor,
that it is my duty to honor

892
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:36,225
the will of the people.

possible penalties

in acts of vigilantism.

Some people still believe
that includes me.

897
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:50,540
Uh, but I remain confident
that my innocence

898
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:51,874
will be proven

899
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,343

at my trial.

had to lie to your son.

I don't want to lie to him,

937
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:36,006
but I can do it if it's
temporary,

938
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:42,145
if I'm just, uh, subbing in
for the real Green Arrow.

What do you mean?

940

I mean as soon as you're
healed up,

that hood back on.

that sounds.

Well, that stuffing
smells

As in our Raisa, yeah.

956
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,202
But, uh, I have a--I have a
lot to catch you up on, so...

957
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,837
Yeah.

958
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,372
William: Uh, I'll save you
some stuffing for later

959
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:44,374
if you want, auntie Thea.

960
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:47,043
I would love that.

961
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,079
How did you make such
a miraculous recovery?

962
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,481
- Lazarus pit water.
- She's kidding.

963
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,817
For blast victims like Thea
in a minimally conscious state,

964
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,853
the trick is just to find the right drug
to literally wake her brain up.

965
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,455
In this case, a new form
of Zolpidem.

966
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,423
It's not even
on the market yet.

967
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,393
So more like cutting-edge
neuroscience

968
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:06,029
than--I don't know--
a miracle.

969
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,998
Well, it seems pretty
miraculous to me.

970
00:41:09,268 --> 00:41:11,701
I missed you very much.

971
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:15,238
Felicity:
Hell of a Thanksgiving.

972
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,407
I've never had more
to be thankful for.

973
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:22,178
Come here. You, too.

974
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:29,102
