1
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,357
PUSSY

2
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,745
Leave it there.

3
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,792
Enjoy your meal.

4
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,941
<i>Hi, brother, it's me.
How are you doing?</i>

5
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,403
Better if I knew how this happened.

6
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,530
<i>Gilberto, someone betrayed us.</i>

7
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:43,200
<i>Where the fuck were those pigs we pay?</i>

8
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,078
It was an American operation.
It was the DEA.

9
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,623
Our friends knew nothing about it.

10
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:54,003
Unless our friends have
been lying to us all along.

11
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:58,507
Maybe they need a reminder
what all that money was for.

12
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,469
Relax, Miguel.
My situation will be rectified soon.

13
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,764
<i>The truth is that things
are getting more complicated.</i>

14
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,476
And our friends in the North Valley
need reassurance.

15
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,396
You need to set a meeting with Henao.

16
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,024
<i>Compliment him.</i>

17
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,610
- On what?
- Doesn't matter. Offer him something.

18
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,406
<i>He likes tequila. Have a bottle ready.</i>

19
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:27,995
Tell him... this is just a small setback.

20
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,915
<i>In the meantime,
business goes on as usual.</i>

21
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,793
Increase your personal security.

22
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,921
<i>The Americans will come after you next.</i>

23
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,133
<i>Your freedom is our best leverage,
brother.</i>

24
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,927
Gilberto, this is getting dangerous.

25
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,849
What if there's a leak?

26
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,812
There may be.

27
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,439
Find out.

28
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,025
<i>I need to go, brother. I love you.</i>

29
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,235
I love you too, brother.

30
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,452
Justice can be hard to find.

31
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,747
And a man as powerful
as Gilberto Rodríguez

32
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,333
won't stay in custody for long.

33
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,964
If you want to keep him behind bars,
you need someone to testify.

34
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,091
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

35
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,887
I'm working on a high-level target.

36
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,684
I suggest you work fast,
because without it,

37
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,769
nothing else will matter.

38
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,694
We went through the machine, sir.
We've got nothing.

39
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,865
So what am I supposed to do with that?
What does this mean?

40
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:40,747
If somebody sold us out,
we'd know about it.

41
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,376
Like you knew about the raid?

42
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,716
Look, gentlemen...

43
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:57,180
I want to know why my brother
is sitting in a fucking cell.

44
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:02,394
And if any one of us is involved in this,
I want to know by the end of the day.

45
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,356
Of course. Consider it done, sir.

46
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,705
Miguel's paranoid.

47
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:28,420
Maybe they used one of their spy planes
and spotted Gilberto from space.

48
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,340
You're not taking this seriously.

49
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:35,177
Miguel doesn't think they got lucky.
He thinks there's a leak.

50
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,305
And the system would tell us
about the leak.

51
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,308
This is about the surrender, right?

52
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,102
You're worried your retirement plans
are ruined now.

53
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:49,816
Listen to me. People love drama,
brother. You know that.

54
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,818
This isn't drama. He wants names.

55
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,363
And there's no reason to think
they couldn't be ours, Carlo.

56
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,907
We designed the system.

57
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,212
Mr Cordova.

58
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,676
So? Anything good?

59
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,013
Just a bunch of shit-talking.
Gossip. Typical.

60
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,350
And what about internally?
Anyone suspicious you've flagged?

61
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,602
No, not really.

62
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,522
Truth is, I have no idea
who would rat these guys out.

63
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:32,734
I want to hear everything you've flagged
all the same. Quickly.

64
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,195
Yes, sir. I'll get that right away.

65
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,249
<i>These guys were supposed to have
all this under control.</i>

66
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,751
<i>But it's clear they don't.</i>

67
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,840
<i>I thought those guys
were supposed to surrender.</i>

68
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,675
<i>Does this mean it's not happening?</i>

69
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:01,638
<i>Somebody tipped off the Americans,
stabbed us in the back.</i>

70
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,937
<i>Where was his fucking security team?
What do they pay them for?</i>

71
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,775
<i>They better do something quick,</i>

72
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,486
<i>or else it's going to be
every man for himself.</i>

73
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,037
You have many powerful allies,
Don Gilberto.

74
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,290
Your situation pains them deeply.

75
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,002
We're confident this will soon be
behind us. The surrender will proceed.

76
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,547
But we need to wait.
It's a matter of time.

77
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,174
Wait for what?

78
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,886
For the government to do something
they already agreed to? Fuck.

79
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,471
What did Medina say?

80
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,643
Currently, we don't have an official
position from Santiago Medina.

81
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,978
Why not?

82
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,903
Because we're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting.

83
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,866
Are you fucking kidding me?
You haven't talked to him yet?

84
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,161
You're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting?

85
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,665
I don't wait on him!
He waits on me!

86
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,834
You go to his office and fix this mess!

87
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,588
And remind him who the fuck
Gilberto Rodríguez is!

88
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,134
For fuck's sake!
Open this damn thing!

89
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,972
Nicolás, your father needs to understand
his arrest changes things.

90
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,308
It's political now.

91
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,394
Dad?

92
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,940
Sometimes you have to put on
a little show.

93
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,150
Helps bring the best out of people.

94
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,905
- I need to talk to Medina.
- I don't want you anywhere near this.

95
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,825
Dad, the circle is too big.

96
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,579
Medina won't meet anyone he can't trust.
He won't trust the lawyers.

97
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,915
But he will trust you?

98
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,544
Yes, I'm your son.

99
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,005
That's right.
And you'll obey my wishes.

100
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,205
You want something to drink?

101
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,749
I never refuse.

102
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,222
That's a great shirt, no?

103
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,308
That pocket...

104
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,311
on the left.

105
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,733
Where the heart is.

106
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,997
Hey, this situation with Gilberto,

107
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,124
what a disgrace, huh?

108
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,879
After all your family's done
for this city. For this country.

109
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,552
Just the gringos meddling
where they shouldn't.

110
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,514
But our friends in Bogotá
are working to...

111
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,226
rectify the situation.

112
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,690
Business proceeds as usual, right?

113
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,611
And how does this clerical error
affect the timeline of the surrender?

114
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,240
As I said...

115
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,995
this was just a mistake,
nothing more.

116
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,541
Glad to hear that.

117
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,439
I see a lot of new faces.

118
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,093
Did you notice that?

119
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,637
The woman, the Salazar girl?

120
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,263
The fear.

121
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,100
Miguel was scared.

122
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,440
These guys are in big trouble.

123
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,160
Little early for number three, no?

124
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,538
The fuck else am I supposed to do
around here?

125
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,790
You didn't have to come.

126
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,417
Who else was gonna watch your back?

127
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,134
You gonna tell me
what went down in Juárez?

128
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,718
I told you...

129
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,929
we talked.

130
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,184
The Mexican made you an offer.

131
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,146
Didn't he?

132
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,652
Yes.

133
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,738
A pretty good one, too.

134
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,660
He says we're getting out
at the wrong time.

135
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,373
Maybe he's right.

136
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,752
Gilberto's in jail.

137
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,674
Maybe this is fate.

138
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,480
No. The bill, please.

139
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,816
Compliments of the gentleman.

140
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,368
Thank you, but I don't...

141
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,362
The bill.

142
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,909
And they don't appear
on the next flights either?

143
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,378
Motherfucking gringos never got
on a plane back to Bogotá.

144
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,174
- Our friend with the badge lied to us.
- Or he made a mistake.

145
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,218
There are no mistakes.

146
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,644
Hey. Here he comes.

147
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,355
There he is, the fucking bastard.

148
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,526
I would have gladly met you
in the usual place.

149
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,197
That's what you're worried about?

150
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,783
How about earning the money
we pay you to keep our bosses out of jail?

151
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,745
- You couldn't give a fuck about that.
- The fuck you want from me?

152
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,248
Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.
All that shit came out of Bogotá.

153
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,833
By the time we knew
what they were up to...

154
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,462
Martínez had already been
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,

155
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,839
you useless piece of shit.

156
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,469
You know what else is odd?

157
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:16,516
It looks like the DEA never left Cali,
and you were the one who confirmed.

158
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:23,314
You. Only you confirmed those two
fucking gringos took the plane to Bogotá.

159
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,237
Do you know where you are?

160
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:34,367
You want to hang me out to dry with
your boss? Do you know where you are?

161
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,747
I asked the Americans how they found
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?

162
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,750
They followed someone there.

163
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,465
I know it wasn't me.

164
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,027
Fucking Calderón.

165
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,947
What he said made sense.

166
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,492
The DEA followed someone
to Gilberto's house.

167
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:20,746
It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows
who he is and where he works.

168
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,166
They must've come back
and tailed him to Gilberto.

169
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:32,967
Didn't you say you drove Pallomari
to Gilberto's that night?

170
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,559
It could just as easily
have been me driving him.

171
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,981
Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?

172
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,525
You think Miguel will let this slide?

173
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,112
Not a fucking chance.

174
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,532
Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,
it comes back on you,

175
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,326
and then we're both fucked.

176
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:02,747
The only thing we need is a name,
and we have it.

177
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,626
We have to get on the same page here.

178
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,756
Calderón told us those fuckers from
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotá, right?

179
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:16,844
He burned us. He's the one
responsible for what happened.

180
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,180
He's a dirty cop...

181
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,392
who takes money from a drug cartel.

182
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:30,650
But you and me, we're brothers.

183
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,748
Let me cut to the chase.
My father still wants to retire.

184
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:54,298
I didn't realise you were taking such
an active role in your father's affairs.

185
00:27:55,966 --> 00:28:00,179
No other choice when friends
don't return our lawyer's calls.

186
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,348
Of course.

187
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:09,271
Well, then, tell your father
there is still a path

188
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:12,775
to what he wants most.

189
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,697
No one here is happy
with the current predicament.

190
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,907
The DEA blindsided all of us,

191
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,036
and it's been difficult
to carry out our old deal.

192
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,164
"Old deal"?

193
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:37,717
Politics is about appearances.

194
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:42,304
For us, it's extremely difficult
to accept the surrender terms of a man

195
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,306
who's already in prison.

196
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,309
That just looks bad.

197
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:55,359
But different terms, new terms...

198
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,530
What do you say?

199
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,333
So what did you find out?

200
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:17,715
The DEA team Calderón was escorting
never left Cali.

201
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,842
He reported that they had.

202
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,723
What do you think, Jorge?

203
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:30,478
It was a mistake.
Born of incompetence.

204
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,066
The DEA got lucky
and Calderón took the bait.

205
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,738
Well, we're not paying for incompetence.

206
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:45,534
Besides, that doesn't explain
how they found my brother.

207
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,705
How did they get that information?
Was that also Calderón?

208
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,999
It's unlikely.

209
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:58,631
It's possible the DEA used
some high-end aerial surveillance.

210
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,723
From here on out,
keep an eye on Calderón.

211
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,728
Limit what we tell him.

212
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,147
No more lapses in security.

213
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,607
Yes, sir.

214
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,625
Thank you, Jorge.

215
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,337
It's either him or us.

216
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,757
What if they kill him?

217
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,219
They wouldn't kill a cop.

218
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:51,141
But they can question him.
And then what? What?

219
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:56,730
By the time they get to it,
this shit will all be over.

220
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:29,722
<i>Good afternoon. Someone is here
for you, Mrs Jurado. A Mr Eliot Ness.</i>

221
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,718
Don't you even want to know
what he said?

222
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,346
How dare you disregard my wishes!

223
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,225
Nobody was going to get into a room
with Medina, and I did...

224
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,147
I don't want you involved.
I won't even discuss it.

225
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,275
The old deal is dead.

226
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,910
But we can make a new one,
with certain adjustments.

227
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,498
Motherfuckers.

228
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,461
Adjustments how?

229
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,632
There has to be some jail time.

230
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,886
For you, Uncle Miguel,
Pacho and Chepe.

231
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,516
- Three years.
- Three years? No chance.

232
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:06,980
You surrender your illegal assets,
do the three years,

233
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:10,609
and the legitimate assets, the cash,
the business, will all be retained.

234
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,196
That's not the deal.
And you won't speak of this again.

235
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,740
Dad, stop being so stubborn!

236
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,297
You don't get to surrender.

237
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:36,176
You are in jail.
You are a narcotrafficker.

238
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:41,390
No politician is going to stand up
and say, "Let him go,"

239
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,601
no matter how much money
you've put in his pocket.

240
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,273
But, son, it's three years...

241
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,866
It's not the old deal,
but it's a good one.

242
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,702
The best we're going to get.

243
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,124
But there's one loose end.

244
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,086
Medina is worried about his exposure.

245
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,176
More specifically,
the accountant... Pallomari.

246
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,095
He knows too much.

247
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,088
The Americans are back
on the accountant's office,

248
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,340
<i>hoping he shows.</i>

249
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,302
Knowing that idiot, he might.

250
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:28,015
If that's all they've got,
then they don't have much.

251
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:33,979
<i>Stay on them.
Find out where they sleep at night.</i>

252
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,481
All right.

253
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,651
Hey, boss. You doing OK?

254
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,362
<i>You sound tired.</i>

255
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,740
Yeah. I'm fine.

256
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,826
Keep me posted.

257
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,545
- How was the science test?
- Good.

258
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,673
Daddy! Daddy!

259
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05,218
My princess. Hello, my princesses.
How are you all?

260
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,262
Hello. What are you doing here?

261
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,638
Hi, my love.

262
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,058
Was it your turn or mine
to pick up the girls?

263
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:14,895
Yours. I was in the neighbourhood.
Just wanted to see how my girls are doing.

264
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,023
- Daddy, today we have piano lessons.
- I know, my love.

265
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,317
My little virtuosos.

266
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:24,112
- And you? Everything OK?
- I'm fine.

267
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,533
I just felt like I needed to see my girls.
That's why I came.

268
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,705
Excuse me.

269
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:41,046
Looks like I have to go.
Would you excuse me?

270
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,591
- Girls... I love you.
- Bye.

271
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,468
Bye, be good.

272
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,225
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- What can I do for you, David?

273
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,104
<i>My dad called a meeting.
Top personnel.</i>

274
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,565
What do you mean, a meeting?
We just had one.

275
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,651
<i>Well, we're having another one.</i>

276
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:06,238
<i>2611 Avenida 14. Out by Jamundí.
See you there.</i>

277
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,339
<i>It's Carlo Cordova.
Leave a message.</i>

278
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,425
Carlo, I just talked to David.

279
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,177
Are you on your way to the meeting?
Call me.

280
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,115
<i>It's Carlo Cordova.
Leave a message.</i>

281
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:11,673
I'm sitting there,
enjoying my dick getting sucked,

282
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,759
when all of the sudden she stops.

283
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,014
I open my eyes
and I ask her, "What's up?"

284
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,850
She's all quiet, looking at me like this.

285
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,768
Not a word.

286
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,563
I'm like, "What the fuck?"
I turn to see Toque.

287
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:32,444
Fuck, he has a gun pointed at him.
Like this.

288
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:36,239
And the other girl,
the one with the gun, says to me,

289
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:41,703
"Give me the money,
or she bites your dick off."

290
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,960
- So what did you do?
- I gave her the fucking money!

291
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:53,214
I even tipped her, Pacho.
You don't mess around with that.

292
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,009
- You want some ice?
- Sure.

293
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,306
I'm having a great time.

294
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:03,433
I'm heading to Juárez tomorrow.

295
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,771
Got some business with my partners.

296
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,900
What am I going to tell them, Pacho?

297
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:16,196
I want to give them an answer.
Some good news.

298
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:26,164
My turn to tell you a story, Amado.

299
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,794
About the time my father found me
in my room with a boy.

300
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:34,297
Hey, I never judged you for that stuff.

301
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,803
My father told me I wasn't a man,
that I'd never be one.

302
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:43,848
- It was the last time he spoke to me.
- What a fucking bastard.

303
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,687
For a long time, I thought he was right.

304
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:52,107
Even after I started working
for Gilberto and Miguel.

305
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:57,070
Up until the day some motherfucker
told them I was a faggot.

306
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,281
And that it was a mistake
to let me be part of the business.

307
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,412
You know what they did?

308
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:10,125
They made me a partner.

309
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:15,588
Gilberto, Miguel and Chepe,
they are my family.

310
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:20,009
I can't just leave them
when they need me the most.

311
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,890
What can I say?

312
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:31,479
I admire your loyalty.
You're one of a kind.

313
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,234
There you go.

314
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:26,743
You better get inside.
Don't want to be late.

315
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,308
Has your dad arrived?

316
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:53,478
No, not yet.

317
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,231
Let's go.

318
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,272
Let me go, asshole!

319
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,778
Let me go, motherfucker!

320
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,365
You don't have the balls!

321
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,118
Let me go!

322
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,047
Up!

323
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,469
You motherfucker.

324
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,972
What the fuck did you tell them,
motherfucker?

325
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:14,183
Gilberto getting caught
wasn't down to me.

326
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:18,730
You feel so safe, motherfucker.
When it's your turn...

327
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,919
He was a tiger.

328
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,924
Let's go.

329
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,955
What the fuck is this?

330
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,125
Tell him what you did.

331
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,087
Tell him.
Tell him where we caught you.

332
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,925
While you were visiting
your wife and children,

333
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,804
this fucking rat was
on his way to the airport.

334
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,974
With his wife, bags packed.

335
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:22,687
About to leave you holding the blame.
Your friend, Jorge.

336
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,398
You had your bitch follow me?

337
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:30,236
- What did you say?
- Me and my children?

338
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,282
You should be thankful,
motherfucker.

339
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:39,203
It's why you're standing there
instead of sitting next to him.

340
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,750
You're making a big mistake, David.

341
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,878
I don't give a fuck what you think.

342
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,923
He's a loyal man.
He always has been.

343
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,010
- He's a piece of shit, Jorge.
- He's a good man and loyal.

344
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,012
- A good man? Then why was he running?
- What are you doing?

345
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,598
- This is a good man...
- He's a fucking snitch!

346
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,945
Look at me.

347
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,656
Sophia is inside.

348
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:18,201
She's inside that room.

349
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:23,164
Don't let them touch her.
Don't let them put a hand on Sophia.

350
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:27,710
She has nothing to do with this, brother.
These fucking bastards are crazy...

351
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,253
David, no!

352
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:38,387
Your friend was right, Jorge.
Go check on Sophia.

353
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,802
My brother is in prison
because we were weak.

354
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,223
Because mistakes were made.

355
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:29,230
Because we allowed people
to be dishonest with us.

356
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,736
These are the consequences.

357
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,869
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

358
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,796
Jorge, when he tried to run,

359
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:58,134
he proved he was willing
to turn against us, all of us.

360
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:02,638
Men with nothing to hide don't run, right?

361
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:14,901
Now, I trust you can take over
Cordova's responsibilities.

362
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:22,158
As our new head of security, Jorge.
What do you think?

363
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,960
I'm glad I can count on you.

364
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:39,777
My little girl, you're going to eat
a little bit of salad, OK?

365
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:43,281
Vera is going to teach you.
Look how much she ate.

366
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,450
Just a bit, sweetie.
Please, just eat a little bit.

367
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:50,496
- Hi. I thought you'd be home later.
- Daddy's here!

368
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,252
Give me a minute.

369
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:27,885
