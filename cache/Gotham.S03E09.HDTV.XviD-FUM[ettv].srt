1
00:00:01,948 --> 00:00:05,063
- Previously on Gotham...
- Watch out!

2
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:06,180
Ivy's missing.

3
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:07,214
She'll turn up somewhere.

4
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:09,450
It was a long way down into water.

5
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:11,318
What's your name? My name's Ivy.

6
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,188
- Who the hell are you?
- Not yet.

7
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:15,923
This is too fun.

8
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,826
He loves me and I love him.

9
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,261
I am telling you one last time,

10
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:23,163
let Ed go.

11
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,598
- No.
- Very well.

12
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,933
Don't say I didn't warn you.

13
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,401
Oh, no.

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,905
Somebody help!

15
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:32,573
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

16
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,808
Welcome back, Detective.

17
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,143
Captain, I'm so glad you came.

18
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,178
I came to congratulate you.

19
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,682
If a person comes into contact
with my blood, it changes them.

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,183
You and I are gonna
make a difference in this city.

21
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,251
We're gonna clean it up.

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,325
Sentence served.

23
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,994
Symon.

24
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:55,129
Who did this?

25
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:56,964
Barnes.

26
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,439
So, seems anyone
could have gotten access

27
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:06,707
to that bathroom, not just the guests.

28
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,075
Suspect pool's wide open.

29
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:09,143
All right, start with statements

30
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,578
from everyone at the party.

31
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,276
Someone saw Symon go into that bathroom.

32
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,604
Okay.

33
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:17,985
I still can't believe it.

34
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm sorry things went down this way.

35
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:21,822
Don't apologize; you were right.

36
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,857
Did you give your statement already?

37
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,492
I'm afraid I wasn't very helpful.

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,928
Till about an hour ago,
I couldn't pick Symon

39
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:29,029
out of a crowd.

40
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:31,465
Did you talk to Barnes at the party?

41
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:34,701
A little. We had a drink.

42
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,237
Symon died around 10:30.

43
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,705
The attack happened just before.

44
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:40,140
What time did you talk with Barnes?

45
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,375
9:00.

46
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:43,844
What is this about?

47
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,748
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Really?

48
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,483
I can't talk about it.

49
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,451
No.

50
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,853
Lee, I cannot talk about it.

51
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,055
Jim, I hope you know what you're doing.

52
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,324
Me, too.

53
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,892
Barnes? No. No, no, no, no, no.

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,394
I asked Symon who attacked him,

55
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:01,695
and he said Barnes.

56
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,363
Symon was a psychopath

57
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,365
who gave face transplants to the mob

58
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,733
using stolen faces.

59
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,135
Hardly a credible witness.

60
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:09,269
And this guy, Barnes?

61
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,771
If he so much as jaywalked,

62
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,140
- he would write himself a ticket.
- I know.

63
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,209
"And now you're saying
he went to Lee Thompkin"

64
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,778
engagement party, and out of
nowhere, busted some guy's face

65
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,147
and chucked him through a wall?
- I know, Harvey.

66
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:22,783
- What's the motive?
- I don't know, maybe he...

67
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,151
He saw Symon,

68
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,252
he got pissed he was released,

69
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,787
and he lost control.

70
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,488
Okay. So, you're saying

71
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:30,691
that a man with a
spotless 20-year career,

72
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:32,759
just went ape. Is-is that your theory?

73
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:34,761
Something's been off about him recently.

74
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,064
You yourself said he
nearly beat Tetch to death.

75
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,733
And what's with him
insisting on running point

76
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,335
- in the Paulie Pennies case?
- Look,

77
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:43,537
I don't know, but that
does not make him a killer.

78
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,472
So where is he now?

79
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,708
Home. He spent the
better part of yesterday

80
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:50,010
chasing down Symon, maybe he's tired.

81
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:51,778
That doesn't mean he's guilty.

82
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:55,115
The last thing I want is
for Barnes to be guilty.

83
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:56,316
I look up to the man.

84
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,019
But if there is even a
chance then we have to know.

85
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,954
And something doesn't feel right.

86
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:04,057
Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna help you.

87
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,360
But just so you know,
I'm doing it to prove

88
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,061
he's innocent, not guilty.

89
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,997
That's fine. All right, so
I'll go back to the scene,

90
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,699
see if forensics can pull
some prints from the bathroom.

91
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,635
Barnes's should already be on file.

92
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:17,771
Jim. I know how to do my job.

93
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:21,208
I hope I'm wrong.

94
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:24,611
Yeah. Me, too.

95
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,127
It starts as a whisper.

96
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:42,095
You have to strain to hear it.

97
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:48,201
And then it grows louder and louder,

98
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,605
till it becomes a roar.

99
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:55,509
It's everything you can
do to just shut it out.

100
00:03:57,178 --> 00:03:58,712
And just like that...

101
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,682
you suddenly realize it's your voice.

102
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:04,451
The one you've been denying.

103
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,386
Telling you who you are.

104
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,190
What you have to do.

105
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,426
And then you stop fighting.

106
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,897
And this calm comes over you.

107
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,644
Sex trafficking.

108
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,513
Drugs.

109
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:36,216
Murder.

110
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:40,320
I've kept files on all
three of you for years.

111
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,089
Waiting for the proof we needed

112
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,825
while you sneered at the law.

113
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,460
Not tonight.

114
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,430
Tonight, I am the law!

115
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,202
And you are hereby tried.

116
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,806
Found guilty.

117
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,745
And sentenced.

118
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,957
Justice is served.

119
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:22,332
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -
- www.addic7ed.com -

120
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,558
So what's an antiquities dealer?

121
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,495
I buy and sell rare
and beautiful objects.

122
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,233
I like to think I have
an eye for beauty.

123
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,237
Is this a bug?

124
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,839
An Egyptian scarab.

125
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,441
More than 3,000 years old.

126
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,122
It's priceless.

127
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,232
Everything has a price.

128
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,047
What's upstairs?

129
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,849
The bedroom.

130
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,384
Hmm.

131
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,920
And the vault.

132
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,022
Vault?

133
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,692
It's where I keep my most
valuable acquisitions.

134
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,594
Can I see?

135
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,196
Ivy,

136
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,165
you are very beautiful.

137
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,201
But we've only just met.

138
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,304
We haven't had time to
get to know each other.

139
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,005
Who are you?

140
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,941
Where do you come from?

141
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,776
What do you do?

142
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,378
Well, I'm from Gotham.

143
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,280
And I meet men.

144
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,082
Like you.

145
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,350
They give me things.

146
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,187
And what do you give them?

147
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,223
Nothing.

148
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,674
I also like plants.

149
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:37,095
I've always been able to
get them to grow for me.

150
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,568
Lately, I've been using
them to make perfume.

151
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:42,701
Plants are so much more
powerful than people imagine.

152
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,403
They can poison you, heal you,

153
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,725
make you fall in love.

154
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:50,842
I made this from a strain
of cananga odorata.

155
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,879
Smell.

156
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,153
Now, open the vault.

157
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,394
COMPUTERIZED WOMAN'S
VOICE: Access granted.

158
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,540
Did they send you? You lying schlampe!

159
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,075
Did they?

160
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,714
Come back here!

161
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,617
You hear me? I'll find you!

162
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:17,729
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

163
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,800
You've been checking
your watch all morning.

164
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,002
You expecting... A call from Isabella.

165
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,371
She's at her librarian conference.

166
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,973
Ah.

167
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,841
Probably just busy.

168
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,343
Most likely.

169
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,111
I can imagine librarian conferences

170
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,113
can be hectic affairs.

171
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,349
- Not so much.
- Well,

172
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,551
I'm sure she'll call soon.

173
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,193
Hello.

174
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,030
This is Edward Nygma.

175
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,934
Why?

176
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,304
Very well.

177
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,043
That was the GCPD.

178
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,101
They want to see me. Wouldn't say why.

179
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,012
Oh?

180
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,934
You don't think that
something happened...

181
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,770
No!

182
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:47,166
The officer said Isabella
blew through a red light

183
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,569
and crashed into a train.

184
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,605
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

185
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:57,209
Yours was the last number in her phone.

186
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:01,347
I am... so, so sorry, Ed.

187
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,284
Did she suffer?

188
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,355
No.

189
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,028
Anything you need, Ed,

190
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,830
anything at all,

191
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:19,665
I am here for you.

192
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,223
Breakfast!

193
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,997
Still collecting strays?

194
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,766
Lady,

195
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,268
you got two seconds to get out of here

196
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:57,937
before I gut you like a fish.

197
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,839
You really don't recognize me?

198
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,475
Selina, it's me.

199
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,478
Ivy? Hey, you got anything

200
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,013
to eat around here?

201
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,682
I'm starving.

202
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,181
Yeah.

203
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,155
Jim, I'm outside the
scene. Forensics found tons

204
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:18,758
of prints inside the bathroom
where Symon was attacked.

205
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,159
Barnes?

206
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,527
That just means he was in there.

207
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,195
- It puts him at the scene.
- Listen,

208
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,665
I've been thinking. You got to
tell Barnes what Symon said.

209
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:29,001
Give him the right to defend himself.

210
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,970
I will.

211
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,972
When I'm ready.

212
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,722
Help you?

213
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,857
Captain.

214
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:56,328
I was, uh, looking for
the Paulie Pennies file.

215
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,432
Thinking the cases might be related.

216
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,541
Thanks.

217
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,983
Fill me in.

218
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:16,086
Nothing hard yet, but we'll get there.

219
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:17,454
Uh-huh.

220
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:20,124
I was reading through some
of the witness statements.

221
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:22,960
The couple from the alley...
They say when they found

222
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:24,628
Symon, he was still alive.

223
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,997
You were first on the scene.

224
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:30,134
- Did he say anything to you?
- No.

225
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:33,003
He didn't ID the killer?

226
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:37,441
No.

227
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,144
Ah. 'Cause one of the
witnesses seems to think

228
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,812
that you were talking to him.

229
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,848
He tried, sure.

230
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,883
But he couldn't speak. He died

231
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,459
almost right away.

232
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,953
Uh-huh.

233
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:53,988
Well, for what it's worth, I called

234
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:57,625
an old C.I. of mine with
deep ties to the mob.

235
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,094
He says that

236
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,497
once I collared Symon,
the higher-ups got jumpy.

237
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,966
You're saying the mob had him killed?

238
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,102
He was giving these guys new faces.

239
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,905
He's probably the only
one who can ID them.

240
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:14,508
That's a lot to protect. Makes sense.

241
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,810
My C.I. also had a name.
Mid-level enforcer,

242
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,946
goes by "Sugar," works
out of the East End.

243
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,815
- Says he actually did the killing.
- I'll have a team pick him up.

244
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:24,318
I'd rather you kept this
between us. Mob still has

245
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,354
their fingers in most
of these guys' pockets.

246
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:30,391
You never know who you can trust. So,

247
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,660
you ready to ride with the old man?

248
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:34,929
Sure. Just let me run
it by my, uh, partner.

249
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,196
Why bother him?

250
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:38,565
We'll be there and back
before you know it.

251
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,696
So where are we headed?

252
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:49,294
Sugar works out of an old
foundry at 133rd and 6th.

253
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,736
Oh, that reminds me.

254
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,308
It's Harvey. Leave a message.

255
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm with Barnes, heading
to 133rd and 6th.

256
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,109
Get there.

257
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:14,492
You never know what's gonna go down.

258
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:39,732
I have to say, Jim,

259
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,901
I'm disappointed with you.

260
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,270
Oh, yeah? How's that?

261
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:47,473
Lead detective for a
high-profile murder,

262
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,802
and you don't collect statements
from everyone present?

263
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:53,846
Me.

264
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,149
Well, let's do it now.

265
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:59,004
And for the record, I
waive my right to counsel.

266
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,054
- Captain...
- Ask your questions, Gordon.

267
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,916
Did you see Symon at the party?

268
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:08,616
Yes.

269
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,901
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I did not.

270
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:15,438
Did you see him go into the
bathroom before he was attacked?

271
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:17,507
Unfortunately, no.

272
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:19,909
Were you ever in it?

273
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,044
Yes.

274
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:26,115
Before it was a crime scene, obviously.

275
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,320
So, Detective, am I in the clear?

276
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,889
For now.

277
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:40,096
This city's a cesspool.

278
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:42,965
Don't you ever want to
do something about it?

279
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:45,568
I thought I was.

280
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,670
What, as a cop?

281
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,139
I would think that you, of all people,

282
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,208
would find that limiting.

283
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:54,477
Not anymore.

284
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,446
Came back to the GCPD
to do things right.

285
00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:59,682
Like you.

286
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,852
- Like me?
- Last year,

287
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,687
at Galavan's, when we were attacked,

288
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,558
you told me the law shows
you where the line is.

289
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,192
That stuck with me.

290
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,862
Some would say that our
job, first and foremost,

291
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,798
is to protect the citizens of this city,

292
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,800
even if it means bending the laws.

293
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:20,603
No. We break the law, we're
no better than the criminals.

294
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,806
Is that what you were thinking

295
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,775
the night that Galavan was killed?

296
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:27,343
The first time.

297
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:30,613
This city's at a crossroads, Gordon.

298
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:35,051
Question is... Will
good men fight for it?

299
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:38,087
Will they do what's necessary?

300
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:41,324
The decision is yours to make.

301
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:50,566
You passed our stop. 133rd and 6th?

302
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,969
Did I say that?

303
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:56,105
136th and 3rd.

304
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:59,008
It's an honest mistake.

305
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:03,913
- Mmm.
- I don't believe it.

306
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,015
- Mmm.
- Well, I should have known.

307
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,651
I saw what that freak Marv could do.

308
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,720
How he could age people, and when

309
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:13,856
he told me that the girl wearing
her sweater was older, I...

310
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,525
I should have realized.

311
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:17,893
That's really Ivy.

312
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,195
Trust me.

313
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:21,797
She came, and literally ate all my food.

314
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,699
Immediately ate all my food.

315
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,034
It's her.

316
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:28,270
So why is she back here?

317
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,139
Good question.

318
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,076
Ow! What was that for?

319
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:37,046
For being alive and not telling me!

320
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,852
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,093
I was just having fun.

322
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:52,338
Why did you come back?

323
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:54,964
I don't have to answer your questions.

324
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,198
Why'd you call him anyway?

325
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:57,833
'Cause you freaked me out!

326
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,236
Where have you been, and

327
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,238
why are you dressed like that?

328
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:04,707
Oh, it's so crazy, Selina.

329
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:06,308
When you look like this,

330
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,045
guys just come up to
you and give you stuff.

331
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,480
Half the time, you don't
even have to steal it.

332
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,416
Hmm. And what do you give them?

333
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:16,852
Hmm. I have ways of getting what I want.

334
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,008
- I'll bet.
- You do look nice.

335
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:27,163
So why did you come back?

336
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,532
And don't say it's 'cause you missed me.

337
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,434
It's true.

338
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,770
You may be ten feet tall, but
you're still a crappy liar, Ivy.

339
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,872
What's... going... on?

340
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,876
Well, I might be in trouble.

341
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:43,112
- I knew it.
- There was this guy...

342
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,348
- What was his name?
- Like I learn their names.

343
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,950
So I was at his place last night.

344
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:50,553
Total creep. Anyway, I stole a necklace.

345
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,123
I was surprised he noticed
'cause he had so much crap.

346
00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:56,325
But he caught me, and
he totally freaked out.

347
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,060
If only Marv's power
had made you smart, too.

348
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:00,563
- You steal all the time.
- Yeah, well,

349
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,298
- I don't get caught.
- Shh.

350
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:03,866
Rude.

351
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,167
No. Be-be quiet.

352
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:07,903
I hear something.

353
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:19,482
We have to go.

354
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:22,618
Someone's here.

355
00:19:22,686 --> 00:19:24,120
Ivy, in.

356
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,058
Bruce! Seriously?

357
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:44,740
So who is this guy again?

358
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,809
Just follow my lead.

359
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,744
GCPD!

360
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,080
- Don't move!
- Hey. Whoa. Whoa.

361
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,549
- Hiya, Sugar.
- What the hell is this?

362
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,417
We're here about the gas bill.

363
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,852
You're delinquent.

364
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,320
- Huh?
- Where were you

365
00:19:58,388 --> 00:19:59,922
last night, say about 10:00 p.m.?

366
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,924
At your mama's, like always.

367
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,116
Answer the question.

368
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,692
I was at the fights.
A dozen people saw me.

369
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:07,797
A dozen of your lying,
bottom-feeding friends?

370
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,099
The name Symon mean anything to you?

371
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,268
- No.
- No?

372
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,437
Plastic surgeon? Face
man for your mob buddies?

373
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,507
Wait... No.

374
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:24,046
Like I said, so whatever the
hell you think I did, I didn't.

375
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:25,581
I was at the fights!

376
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:27,383
People saw me!

377
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,937
- I'm innocent, man!
- You know what?

378
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:32,254
I think he's telling the truth.

379
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:34,957
He didn't kill anyone.

380
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,162
But you're not innocent.

381
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:04,798
I think we lost them.

382
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,434
Is that who you stole the necklace from?

383
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,136
Uh, no. I-I don't think so.

384
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,472
Then who were they?

385
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,507
I don't know. Maybe they work for him.

386
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,310
Oh, great, Ivy! Now my squat is burned,

387
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,579
and masked weirdoes
are trying to kill us.

388
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,548
So glad you came back.

389
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,705
You have to return it.

390
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:27,420
What? No way.

391
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,988
Ivy, he's right.

392
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,875
That dumb necklace almost got us killed.

393
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:33,026
It's mine. I worked for it.

394
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,661
And it's super valuable.

395
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:37,230
- How much?
- Wait. Bruce, don't.

396
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:40,600
If I buy it, you get paid,
but we can still return it,

397
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,902
and those men will have
no reason to harm us.

398
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,270
How much?

399
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:50,410
- One thousand dollars.
- Fine.

400
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:51,544
Idiot.

401
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,697
- Two thousand.
- Fine.

402
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,751
Five... No. Ten!

403
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,486
Well, how much should I ask for?

404
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,733
I'll get you
$5,000 in cash today.

405
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:04,724
Or you can try to avoid
those men on your own.

406
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,028
That's my offer.

407
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:20,807
Now, where does this man live?

408
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:27,547
Now, just raise your chin a mite higher.

409
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:33,277
Would you excuse me for a moment?

410
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:45,365
Ed.

411
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,033
Yes.

412
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,102
The music!

413
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,439
It's too loud. I'm sorry!

414
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,910
Isabella always loved Vivaldi.

415
00:22:56,977 --> 00:23:00,017
So you are just going to sit here.

416
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,248
- Yes.
- All by yourself.

417
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:03,983
Correct.

418
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:06,920
Okay then.

419
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:16,229
Apologies.

420
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:28,508
Ed, I, as much as anyone,

421
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:30,243
know how hard it is to lose someone.

422
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:33,046
Even if

423
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,715
you've only known them
for, like... a week.

424
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:39,018
But this is not healthy behavior.

425
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,553
It is depressing

426
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:43,056
and, if I'm being honest,

427
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:44,757
a bit scary.

428
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:48,161
Less scary.

429
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:49,429
Check.

430
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,297
No, you're not...

431
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,634
Ed, you need to heal.

432
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:56,836
And healing is about moving on.

433
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,841
No doubt you're right.

434
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,878
Of course I'm right.

435
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,686
I'll go to where she was taken from me

436
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,889
and say good-bye.

437
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,813
Isabelle would want you to be happy.

438
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,001
Isabella.

439
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,905
Of course.

440
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,217
That's good.

441
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,252
That's far enough.

442
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,990
I know what you're thinking, Jim.

443
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:52,725
You're thinking,

444
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:55,295
"Why would Captain Nathaniel Barnes,

445
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:56,896
"Mr. By-the-book, blow a hole

446
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:59,866
"in this unarmed scumbag?

447
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:03,002
Could it be that he
actually killed Symon, too?"

448
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,839
You see, I know that you've
been investigating me, Jim.

449
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,943
- Did you kill Symon?
- Is that

450
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,512
what he told you? I know he said
something to you before he died.

451
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,814
Yes, he did.

452
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:17,517
Probably the truest words
that bastard ever uttered.

453
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:21,521
And Paulie Pennies?

454
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:22,922
He chopped up bodies for murderers.

455
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,424
You gonna tell me he didn't deserve it?

456
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:26,159
That's for the law to decide.

457
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:28,127
Open your eyes, Jim.

458
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,896
I am the law.

459
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,465
What happened to you?

460
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,200
How did you become this?

461
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:35,868
This...

462
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,605
is who I've always been.

463
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:42,775
I just needed something to unlock it.

464
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,243
What are you talking about?

465
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,447
You're just gonna say that I'm sick.

466
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:49,315
Well, I'm not.

467
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:52,218
I have never been so clear,

468
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:55,421
so strong in my life.

469
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:57,590
Alice Tetch's virus.

470
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,159
The files on your desk. You're infected.

471
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,262
Oh, you are a detective after all.

472
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,964
Don't you see?

473
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,567
This means you're innocent. We c...

474
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:08,635
we-we can get you help.

475
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:09,936
Can we just skip the part

476
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:11,838
where you try to get
me to give myself up?

477
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,107
This isn't you. This is the virus.

478
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:16,442
No! I'm not insane.

479
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,178
And you are not seeing the big picture.

480
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:24,606
You're gonna frame me
for Sugar's murder.

481
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:26,519
That's up to you.

482
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,389
I deal in absolutes.

483
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:31,424
Black and white.

484
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,292
Innocence

485
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,761
and guilt.

486
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:38,598
Gotham, the people of this
city, need men like me,

487
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,333
men who can see what needs to be done

488
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:42,168
and have the courage to do it.

489
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:45,038
You have it within you

490
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,639
to be one of those men.

491
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:49,008
You want me to join you?

492
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,778
- Be a part of this?
- Oh, don't be so high and mighty.

493
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:54,380
You shot Galavan in cold blood.

494
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:55,982
And every day I wish I hadn't!

495
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,151
Thought I didn't have
a choice, but I did.

496
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,554
I lost my freedom.

497
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,489
I lost Lee.

498
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:05,558
I'd give anything to take it all back.

499
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,427
I didn't say it was easy,

500
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:08,995
Jim.

501
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:10,697
I said it was right.

502
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,398
Day after day, criminals

503
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,400
thumbing their nose at the law.

504
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,303
Well, today, I draw a line in the sand.

505
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:19,005
Only question is...

506
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,576
where do you stand?

507
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:31,951
Against you.

508
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,056
Well, I'm disappointed.

509
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,991
Good-bye, Jim.

510
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,760
Hey, Sugar! I got a... Whoa!

511
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,859
♪♪

512
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:14,153
And now I'm awake.

513
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:18,190
I wish I'd gone on sleeping.

514
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:22,461
I will never forget you, my love.

515
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:32,371
Good-bye, Isabella.

516
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,856
We are four blocks from her apartment.

517
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:50,295
Spare some change, sir?

518
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm sorry,

519
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,591
you weren't, perchance, in this
area at 11:00 p.m. last night?

520
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:58,904
Uh-huh.

521
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,363
So d... You saw the accident?

522
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,842
Haven't seen nothin' for 20 years.

523
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,143
But I heard it.

524
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,679
Girl screaming, "Help! Help!"

525
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,716
- Then bang!
- I'm sorry,

526
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,085
she was screaming before the crash?

527
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,920
Well, she were dead after.

528
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,347
But you d... you
definitely heard screaming?

529
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:20,492
Yep. Blood-curdling.

530
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,609
How... odd.

531
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,668
I'll give him the necklace

532
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:32,504
and explain there's no
need for further violence.

533
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:35,974
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

534
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:38,450
I kind of hit him over
the head with a vase.

535
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,178
'Course you did.

536
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,848
Door's open.

537
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:50,240
I did not do that.

538
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,821
We really got to go.

539
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,894
- Bruce.
- It was the men that came after us.

540
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,362
He was killed by the same weapon.

541
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,097
- I thought they worked for him.
- Oh, looks like

542
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,266
you were wrong again, Ivy.

543
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:03,435
Can we leave now?

544
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:05,570
Why is this necklace so important?

545
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,905
What'd make someone kill for it?

546
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,673
Who cares?!

547
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:13,078
Are you crazy? That's worth $5,000.

548
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,580
Whoa.

549
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,150
What is it?

550
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,484
A key.

551
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,894
We should really go, Bruce.

552
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:33,131
Oh, my God.

553
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,433
You two are a couple now?

554
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,403
- No.
- Yes.

555
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:40,839
We're not?

556
00:30:40,907 --> 00:30:43,275
I'm not talking about this right now.

557
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,377
We need to go somewhere right now.

558
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,579
And my place is toast,
thanks to this dimwit.

559
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:49,815
We'll go to my house.

560
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,632
You just had to come back.

561
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,264
Alvarez, hey,

562
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,300
- what is all this?
- Barnes called in.

563
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,368
Gordon went loco. Shot
an unarmed suspect,

564
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,070
then tried taking out Barnes, too.

565
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:14,005
No, no, no, no. This is not right.

566
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:15,473
Harvey, if I was you,

567
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,143
I'd find your partner,
have him come in quiet.

568
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,145
Otherwise, he's going down.

569
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,685
Jim? Hey.

570
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,154
Where the hell are you? Half
the precinct's looking for you.

571
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,489
Barnes killed Symon and Paulie Pennies.

572
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,558
And he just murdered someone
right in front of me!

573
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:36,361
What? I was
gone for, like, an hour.

574
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:38,363
He's infected with Alice Tetch's blood.

575
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:39,959
He's lost his mind.
He's trying to kill me.

576
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:43,969
- Oh, sweet gentle virgin...
- I need your help, Harvey.

577
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:47,205
- Okay, where are you?
- The old foundry.

578
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,411
Jim? Jim?

579
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,413
J...

580
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,186
Harvey, what's going on?

581
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:04,556
- They said Jim killed someone?
- It's a lie. It's Barnes.

582
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:07,359
It's Barnes. He's infected
with the Alice Tetch virus.

583
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,594
Oh, my God.

584
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,029
He was there when she died.

585
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:12,530
Yeah, and I figure we
got, like, ten minutes

586
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,833
before those trigger-happy
kill-bots find Jim

587
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:16,001
and take him out.

588
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,168
Harvey, you have to tell them.

589
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,970
Come on, they're not gonna believe me.

590
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,306
But they will believe
the medical examiner.

591
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:25,143
- What are you asking me to do?
- I need you to trust Jim.

592
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,444
Because right now,

593
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,613
you and I are all he has.

594
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,432
Stop!

595
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,503
Sorry, Jim.

596
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,909
End of the line.

597
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:58,980
Just as I suspected.

598
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:00,815
The brake lines are cut!

599
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:02,517
How is it...

600
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:05,453
that not one single
ignoramus from the GCPD

601
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:07,222
noticed that the brake lines were cut?

602
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:09,657
I don't know.

603
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,227
Someone paid 'em off.

604
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:13,728
The question is, who?

605
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:16,397
Who has that kind of
money and influence?

606
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:19,133
You don't know.

607
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:21,135
But I do.

608
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,875
End of the line.

609
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:32,013
No more running.

610
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,385
Just in time. In a few moments,

611
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:40,054
your brothers in arms are
gonna come up those stairs

612
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,490
and find your dead body,
and they'll believe me

613
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:45,796
when I tell them that
Jim Gordon is a killer.

614
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:47,595
It's a shame, really.

615
00:34:47,663 --> 00:34:49,731
Could've made a great team.

616
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:52,300
Doesn't have to be this way.

617
00:34:52,368 --> 00:34:53,468
You need help.

618
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:56,004
Are those really gonna
be your last words?

619
00:34:58,674 --> 00:34:59,841
Nothing to say to Lee?

620
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:04,345
Go to hell.

621
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:08,850
Captain Barnes!

622
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:10,685
This is Detective Bullock.

623
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:12,453
You're under arrest.

624
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:14,122
Throw down your weapons

625
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:16,758
and come out with your hands up.

626
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,326
We know you killed Symon.

627
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:20,328
We know you killed Paulie Pennies.

628
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:23,898
We know you killed the
suspects in the East End.

629
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:25,800
You're infected with the Tetch virus.

630
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:28,770
The M.E. has proof.

631
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,405
Now, we don't want any bloodshed, Cap.

632
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:32,106
It's up to you.

633
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,541
No.

634
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:34,976
Thompkins and Bullock.

635
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:37,812
They lied for you.

636
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,581
They turned the whole
damn GCPD against me!

637
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:44,118
We're going in. Come on!

638
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,677
Don't.

639
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,714
You're under arrest.

640
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,616
Drop it.

641
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:17,051
No.

642
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:21,656
Don't make me do this.

643
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:23,658
I'm not making you do anything.

644
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:26,094
Stand down, Jim. Let me go.

645
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:30,398
If the cops want to hunt me, fine.

646
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,133
But you...

647
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,468
let me go.

648
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:35,903
I won't do that.

649
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:38,339
You would condemn this city

650
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:39,707
when I would save it.

651
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:42,677
You've got it all wrong.

652
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,979
You're just the same as I am.

653
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:46,714
I just have the guts to admit it.

654
00:36:46,782 --> 00:36:48,616
No.

655
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,518
And I'll decide who I am.

656
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:54,122
Stand down.

657
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,393
No.

658
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:03,331
Then it is you that is guilty.

659
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:18,279
Jim, you okay?

660
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:21,749
Yeah.

661
00:37:21,817 --> 00:37:23,451
I'm okay.

662
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:44,850
Holy cow. Don't get any ideas.

663
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,218
Okay, Mom.

664
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:48,153
Tomorrow we'll look into
what this all means.

665
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:50,222
Who those men in masks were.

666
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,191
For now, I'll have Alfred
make up beds for you both.

667
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:55,394
There's food in the
kitchen if you're hungry.

668
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:56,795
I could eat.

669
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:58,397
Surprise.

670
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:05,637
I hope I didn't mess things
up with your boyfriend.

671
00:38:05,705 --> 00:38:09,174
I told you, he's not my boyfriend.

672
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,597
What happened?

673
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:07,599
Are you okay?

674
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:10,202
Yeah.

675
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:12,404
I'm fine.

676
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:17,376
And Barnes?

677
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:20,012
He's alive.

678
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,415
Bullock told me what you did.

679
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,318
- It was nothing.
- No.

680
00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:28,453
You could've done nothing.

681
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,489
You didn't. I suppose I did

682
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:32,958
fabricate a blood test
stating that my superior

683
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:35,460
had a psychosis-inducing virus.

684
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:40,532
And I'm glad I did.

685
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,067
Me, too.

686
00:39:51,244 --> 00:39:53,679
I suppose I better get going.

687
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:54,846
Lee?

688
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:02,087
Thank you.

689
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,603
Oswald!

690
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:21,139
Oswald. I need to speak with you.

691
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:23,043
Yes, but I have to show
you something first.

692
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,444
- This is important.
- So is this.

693
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:30,849
I was not compassionate this morning,

694
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,384
and I regret that.

695
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:36,121
What you are going through is terrible.

696
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:38,323
So...

697
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:50,502
You put me in your painting.

698
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,704
The artist went off a photograph,

699
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:55,807
but I think it's an excellent likeness.

700
00:40:58,211 --> 00:40:59,778
Isabella was murdered.

701
00:41:01,147 --> 00:41:02,347
What?

702
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,249
I went to the intersection
where she died.

703
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:08,220
It is four blocks from her apartment.

704
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:10,622
Who falls asleep four blocks
from their home? No one.

705
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,725
Also, a very fragrant homeless man

706
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:15,193
said that he heard her
scream before the crash,

707
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:16,595
so definitely not asleep. Now,

708
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:19,030
if she were awake, why didn't she brake?

709
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:22,367
- Why are there no skid marks?
- E-Ed, you are exhausted,

710
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:23,869
you are, you are emotional...

711
00:41:23,936 --> 00:41:26,271
Her brake lines were cut!

712
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,507
Which leaves one conclusion.

713
00:41:28,574 --> 00:41:30,675
Murder.

714
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:32,344
- No.
- Yes.

715
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,880
And I know who did it.

716
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:37,883
Who?

717
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:41,186
Butch.

718
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,964
- Butch?
- In retaliation.

719
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:49,327
For exposing him as the
leader of the Red Hood gang.

720
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,966
That makes perfect sense.

721
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,335
I swear to you, Ed, we will

722
00:41:57,403 --> 00:42:00,205
find him and make him
pay for what he has done.

723
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:02,340
Thank you.

724
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,644
I knew I could count on you.

725
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:18,790
I feel like this office is cursed.

726
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:21,026
You think Barnes'll be all right?

727
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:23,728
I don't know.

728
00:42:25,998 --> 00:42:27,999
I'm sorry I doubted you.

729
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:29,401
You didn't.

730
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:31,670
Not when it mattered.

731
00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:46,885
This never happens.

732
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:48,553
Oleg!
