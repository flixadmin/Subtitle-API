2
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:21,274
<i>That's the cleanup
crew up on the track,</i>

3
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:23,652
<i>and that's a lot of racers
involved there, folks.</i>

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,087
Jack, you realize you got
this in the bag, right?

5
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,410
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

6
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:45,664
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

7
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:46,800
- Last two laps.
- On it!

8
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:48,134
Get those plug wires!

9
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:49,803
Jakob! Now.

10
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:52,514
Hey, Pop.

11
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:53,765
Tell me what you see, Dom.

12
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,684
Got an oil spill
going into turn two.

13
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:56,768
Bell's driving safe.

14
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,885
Corbin's got a sponsor in
the stands, so he's pushing it.

15
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:00,188
Talking about me?

16
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,148
You got a real problem
with car 23.

17
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,234
- Linder.
- <i>About to whip your ass, Toretto!</i>

18
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,506
- <i>Settle down, pretty boy!</i>
- That's right. Yeah, you.

19
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,061
- <i>Shut up!</i>
- You want to tell your driver

20
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:09,562
- he's gonna get somebody hurt?
- <i>What'd you say?</i>

21
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:11,199
- Hey! Leave it!
- <i>Go home! You suck!</i>

22
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,399
He's just pissed
I got that spot

23
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,119
in the Busch Series
next season, not him.

24
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,663
Life's got no shortage
of guys like Kenny Linder.

25
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:17,914
You're good!

26
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,211
It's not about being
the stronger man, Dom.

27
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,879
It's about being
the bigger one.

28
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,119
I swear to God, this guy.

29
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:05,170
Pop, turn two, turn two!

30
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:11,885
Got it. I'm walking him in.

31
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:18,767
Shit!

32
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:29,569
Tell me what you see, Dom.

33
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,327
He's gonna
come at you for that.

34
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:45,710
Get ready on your left.

35
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,110
Three-eighths ratchet.

36
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:58,741
Three-eighths driver.

37
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,411
Six-inch extension.

38
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,333
Are you sure?

39
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:20,805
Remember what your
daddy told you.

40
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,640
Be precise in life.

41
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,935
It can make all the
difference. Now, watch this.

42
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:29,898
See how it's working now?

43
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,900
And you see
what's happening?

44
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,319
It's turning the screw.

45
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:35,904
You're right.

46
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,698
Water heater's out again.

47
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:41,367
It's the price we pay
for peace and quiet.

48
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,704
Want to come
and give us a hand?

49
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,501
Are you expecting someone?

50
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,715
Brian, remember
what we practiced.

51
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:22,450
Yo, yo!

52
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,080
We come in peace.
We come in peace!

53
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:30,583
It's me!

54
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:34,879
Roman? Maybe you
don't recognize me

55
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:36,923
'cause I've been tanning
all week, bro.

56
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,511
B, come out, son.

57
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,896
What you gonna do
with that thing, man?

58
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:54,261
What, you out here trying to
kill elephants or something?

59
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:55,608
We would've
called first.

60
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:58,987
Except you actually need
phones in order to get phone calls.

61
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,154
You know that, right?

62
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,823
- Little B!
- Hi.

63
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,324
- Wow.
- You're so big. Hi.

64
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:05,284
Now, I know you don't carpool.

65
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:08,746
So what's up?

66
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,873
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

67
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,501
<i>My plane is under attack
by a rogue agent!</i>

68
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:19,632
<i>We're being boarded. I've
got dangerous cargo on board.</i>

69
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:21,342
<i>I need you
to assemble the team.</i>

70
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:22,927
<i>...still alive.
I'll explain</i>...

71
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:27,724
It's an SOS transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

72
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,351
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

73
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:31,801
most of which
I'm still trying to crack.

74
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,886
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

75
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:35,523
He sent it only to us.

76
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,109
Why just us?

77
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,161
He caught Cipher.

78
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:51,539
But there was a midair attack,
and she was extracted.

79
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:54,709
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

80
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,128
over the northwest region
of Montequinto.

81
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,714
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

82
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:01,424
But the whole area's
sealed off.

83
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:03,593
Isolationist, run by military.

84
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:04,927
We're not on call anymore.

85
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:13,227
Wait, wait.
Dom, this is Cipher.

86
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,731
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

87
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,861
Things change.

88
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,536
Listen, we're wheels up
at 8:00 a.m.

89
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:32,288
if you change your mind.

90
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:34,123
Thank you.

91
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:39,462
Daddy,
do you know where God is?

92
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,839
- Where is God?
- In your heart.

93
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,383
He's in your heart, too.

94
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:46,135
And you know something?

95
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:48,721
I'll always be in your heart.

96
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:50,640
Hey, little guy.

97
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,558
I have a gift for you.

98
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,478
Your father
gave this to me.

99
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:58,648
And now I'm gonna
give it to you.

100
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,693
It's very special.

101
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,654
Take care of it.

102
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:22,547
Good night.

103
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,476
This isn't who we are.

104
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:42,233
Brian and Mia got out of the
game when they became parents.

105
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,278
We're not them.

106
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,280
<i>...under attack
by a rogue agent!</i>

107
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,617
<i>We're being boarded. I've
got dangerous cargo on board.</i>

108
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,660
<i>...assemble the team.</i>

109
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,245
<i>...still alive.
I'll explain...</i>

110
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:38,915
<i>...still alive.
I'll explain...</i>

111
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,027
Mia, it's Dom.

112
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,156
I need a favor.

113
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,251
You know, I would love to see
my nephew just a little bit more often

114
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,253
than, say,
world-ending emergencies

115
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:30,132
- and holidays, once in a while, maybe.
- Okay.

116
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,763
And how's the buster?

117
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,224
He's good.
He's really good.

118
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:42,395
You know,
now that I'm a father,

119
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,901
I can't stop thinking
about our dad.

120
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,821
And, uh...

121
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,866
What life would have
been like if he was alive.

122
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:01,580
We'd be a very different
people, don't you think?

123
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,710
Dom, what's happened?

124
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:08,379
Something I hope
I'm wrong about.

125
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,045
Coming up on the signal,
two miles...

126
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,964
It's deep in the militarized
zone of Montequinto.

127
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:53,966
- I hope everyone's ready.
- Ready?

128
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:57,428
Y'all want to make jokes about
me not making practical decisions?

129
00:12:57,803 --> 00:12:59,597
This is as prepared
as it gets.

130
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,432
We all see you, man.

131
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:04,351
Nobody thinks you're
compensating for anything.

132
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,404
- I'll take point.
- <i>Careful.</i>

133
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:17,782
Careful's when you get hurt.

134
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:35,007
Right now, we have a ten-minute
window between patrols.

135
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:38,552
Mr. Nobody's signal is close, but
we've got to move quickly, guys.

136
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:40,930
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

137
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:08,582
- It's inside.
- Cover us.

138
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:30,771
The source of the SOS signal
is coming from inside this thing.

139
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,026
Somebody wanted in.

140
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,488
Plane must have gone down
before they could cut through.

141
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,991
Or it was sent down on purpose
to stop 'em.

142
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:44,451
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

143
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,495
But just give me a minute.
I can get in.

144
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:50,875
Dom.

145
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,376
There's not
a soul in sight.

146
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,503
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

147
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,297
Got it.

148
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,763
What the hell is this?

149
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:07,850
Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody
wanted us to find it.

150
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:10,060
How's that work...

151
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,478
Go!

152
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,518
What? You don't know who I am?

153
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:53,562
You think I'm scared?

154
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,691
Roman, where the hell
are you?

155
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:30,159
Who's compensating now, Tej?

156
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,210
<i>"Peligro minas"</i>
What does that mean?

157
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:57,743
Tej, how fast we got
to go to clear 'em?

158
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,153
Please don't tell me
you're thinking

159
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,540
- what I think you're thinking.
- <i>Why?</i>

160
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,508
What does
<i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

161
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:04,426
- Tej, how fast?
- I don't know, man.

162
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,511
<i>Somebody answer me!</i>

163
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,279
What does
<i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

164
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:08,447
<i>"Peligro minas"</i> means

165
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,656
"Danger, land mines"!

166
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,741
What?

167
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,745
How fast, Tej?

168
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,872
Assuming
a 50-foot blast radius

169
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:19,750
and a half a second trigger
delay, I'd say about 80.

170
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,876
I can't!

171
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:24,088
My speedometer only
goes up to 70. What do I do?

172
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,547
You put your foot
to that floor,

173
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:26,715
and you pray!

174
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:15,848
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

175
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,181
Whoa!

176
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,651
Whoa!

177
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,490
Roman, you good?

178
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:20,454
My ass is <i>en fuego!</i>

179
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:31,965
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

180
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:49,209
How in the hell
are you not dead?

181
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:51,545
I'm fine.

182
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:02,180
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

183
00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:05,225
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

184
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,811
Good. The sooner we
get out of here, the better.

185
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:12,649
Letty, on the right.

186
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,314
The device.

187
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,628
Get in.

188
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,067
That was Jakob back there,
wasn't it?

189
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:10,392
- Always check your mirrors, bitches!
- Oh, my God.

190
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,477
Oh, hell no.

191
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:14,146
Are we supposed
to drive across that?

192
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:16,273
Well, I said
it looked like a bridge.

193
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:31,872
Oh, my God!

194
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:53,435
The military's not giving up.

195
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:54,978
We got to get
past the border.

196
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:53,745
Where's the bridge?

197
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,793
No. No, no.

198
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:00,919
Dom.

199
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,539
Well, that was new.

200
00:26:57,392 --> 00:26:59,019
Look, we're in the clear.

201
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:02,230
But this thing is a mess.

202
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:04,649
The headlines out there?

203
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,861
Secret spy plane
crashes in a hostile country?

204
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:10,614
Followed by some kind
of covert ops firefight?

205
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,241
I'll get you where you need,

206
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,328
and then I'm gonna need
to back off.

207
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,501
I appreciate the favor.

208
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:29,341
I got to stop
doing so many favors.

209
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,970
What we doing, Ramsey?

210
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:36,556
Like, where are we going?

211
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:39,184
I was able
to decrypt the data

212
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,269
that came through
with Mr. Nobody's SOS,

213
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:43,396
and I found
GPS coordinates,

214
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,231
definitely included
on purpose.

215
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:49,194
You knew about Jakob?

216
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:52,989
Question:
Who is Jakob?

217
00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:55,784
Jakob is,

218
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:57,702
or was, Dom's brother.

219
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:02,832
Oh, my... my bad.

220
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,876
I'm sorry.
I'm just processing.

221
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:07,128
Brother?

222
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:09,881
You got a brother?

223
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,718
Who also happens to be
some kind of super spy

224
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,679
with his own private army,

225
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:18,765
who drives literally
like a bat out of hell,

226
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:21,017
who preplanned an aerial jump

227
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:23,311
and landed
at the bottom of an airplane?

228
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,063
Who does that?

229
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,483
Who does that?
A Toretto.

230
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:33,405
That's my dad!
That's my dad!

231
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:36,449
He's gone! He's gone!

232
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:37,742
We got to get him
out of there.

233
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:40,245
We got to get him out
of there! That's my dad!

234
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,500
That's my dad! That's my dad!

235
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,252
That's my dad!

236
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:49,087
Get him out of there!

237
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:51,506
That's my dad!

238
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:59,764
There's a couple of release
forms we've got to sign.

239
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,142
Few clearances.

240
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:09,107
Everything else is down
there around the corner.

241
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:36,009
Hey.

242
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:38,470
Nobody's supposed
to be around here.

243
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,306
You Toretto's other son?

244
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:44,184
You're the useless one, right?

245
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,442
What is that?

246
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,611
Get out of here. Go.

247
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,781
So a man can't pay
his last respects?

248
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,157
That's what that is?

249
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,700
No.

250
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:03,036
No, not you. You're
the one that killed him.

251
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,412
No, racing killed him.

252
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:07,957
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall. He knew that.

253
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,908
Now, I don't know if he
dropped gear. I don't know.

254
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:12,128
I swear... I swear to God,

255
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,828
- if you don't get out of here...
- What? What?

256
00:30:13,838 --> 00:30:15,215
Go find Buddy.

257
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:16,966
Now!

258
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,930
Oh.

259
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:25,266
All right, well,
now we got the golden boy.

260
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:30,563
Leave.

261
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:33,608
You here
to make threats, too?

262
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:36,152
"Leave" is a simple word.

263
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:38,822
Man, what is it
with you Torettos

264
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,366
where you're all the heroes
in your own stories?

265
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,076
Look, I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

266
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:46,913
You, your dad, me,
we're all stuck,

267
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:50,083
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

268
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,168
And we ain't
never getting out.

269
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:56,965
You ain't half the man
my dad was.

270
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:01,010
- At least I'm alive, asshole.
- What did you say?

271
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:02,137
Get off me!

272
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:05,181
Dom! Dom!

273
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:06,349
Dom!

274
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,184
Dom, no! Dom!

275
00:31:08,768 --> 00:31:09,978
No, man!

276
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,913
In here.

277
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:54,147
Jakob.

278
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:57,108
I simply cannot believe that
magnet trick actually worked.

279
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,861
It looked so damn cool.
Look at this here.

280
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:01,321
I got this off
the cockpit feed.

281
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,656
Oh, I love being rich.

282
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,658
It was sloppy.
He almost had me.

283
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:08,119
- She say anything?
- Nope. <i>Nada.</i>

284
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,539
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

285
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:13,875
And sort of turned on
at the same time.

286
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,919
Is that weird?

287
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:20,924
Nice operation.

288
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:23,801
You snatched me off
Mr. Nobody's plane midair

289
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:25,929
without a scratch,
and you took him down.

290
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,431
Money well spent.

291
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,477
Do you know who I am?
I know who you are.

292
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:34,062
Do you?

293
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:39,150
East L.A. is a tough enough
place to grow up.

294
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,657
But it was your brother's
shadow that turned you into this.

295
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,408
Isn't it?

296
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:54,040
So your whole life, you pushed
yourself to be faster than Dom.

297
00:32:54,457 --> 00:32:56,042
Smarter than Dom.

298
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:59,462
Stronger than Dom.

299
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:06,052
Tell me, do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night?

300
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,306
Still?

301
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,602
All these years later?

302
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:19,941
I should've just hired you

303
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:22,568
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back.

304
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,237
I don't work
for the competition.

305
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,905
That's cute.

306
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:28,283
You thinking
you're the competition.

307
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:29,742
Says the woman in the box.

308
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:34,455
Look familiar?

309
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:38,584
The other half's hidden in one of
the agency's thousands of vaults.

310
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,212
I need you
to find out which one.

311
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:45,591
We secured the master drive
here from Mr. Nobody's plane.

312
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:48,094
The rest of the hardware
is a bit dated.

313
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:49,178
Pre-Internet.

314
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:52,765
To make sure you don't go hack
into anything we don't want you to.

315
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:57,020
Say you get what you're after.

316
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,107
A weapon so dangerous it
shouldn't exist for another half century.

317
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,567
What would you do with it?

318
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,360
Launch some
global attack?

319
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:06,863
Sell it to the
highest bidder?

320
00:34:06,946 --> 00:34:10,033
Or maybe you see yourself

321
00:34:10,158 --> 00:34:12,452
as a necessary
shock to the system.

322
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:16,122
I bet all you ever wanted
was a hug.

323
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,334
You read my psych eval.
Good for you.

324
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,794
I read your
second-grade report card.

325
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,088
That's what I do.

326
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:37,060
Your chin,
it's distinctive.

327
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,397
I know the Torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

328
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:44,233
but I never detected
a Nordic strain.

329
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:57,705
Finding the two halves of
Project Aries is the easy part.

330
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,957
Add in your brother Dom
to the mix?

331
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,168
You don't have a chance.

332
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,421
Plans are in motion.

333
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,927
Qasar Khan.

334
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:14,472
What?

335
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:16,682
Genghis Khan's little brother.

336
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:22,146
Nobody's heard of him either.

337
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:49,590
Talk about off the grid.

338
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:53,636
I don't think they had grids
when this place was built.

339
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:58,850
If a Ninja Turtle pop out on
me, tell you right now, I'm out.

340
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:01,727
No way this place
was sanctioned by the agency.

341
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:04,897
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

342
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:14,490
What now, Dom?

343
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,744
Whoever Jakob has become...

344
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,207
...and whatever he's up to...

345
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:29,380
...it's on me,

346
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,009
- and me alone.
- Nah.

347
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:36,929
Whatever's on you,
it's on us.

348
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:38,848
Let's get to work.

349
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,238
That's a rotary phone.

350
00:36:56,157 --> 00:36:58,910
Yes. Thank you. I know
what a rotary dial phone is.

351
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,081
Okay. Well, what's that?

352
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:06,500
It's a JX1000
reel-to-reel tape recorder.

353
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:08,377
What about that?

354
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,674
It's a GB Industries
4K telex machine.

355
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:15,051
Impressive.

356
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:16,135
What about these?

357
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:17,261
They're floppy disks.

358
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:19,597
And that's
a Rafutek micro recorder,

359
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,098
that's a Smithson
autoprinter,

360
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:24,393
and that thing there is an
Omaha 3010 fax machine.

361
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:25,686
It's like e-mail,

362
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,188
- but wasteful.
- Mmm.

363
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:29,232
Are we done here?
Did I pass your little test?

364
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:31,150
What's your mamma's
phone number?

365
00:37:34,278 --> 00:37:35,655
Right.

366
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:43,955
Y'all ever thought about how
many wild missions we've been on?

367
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:45,915
How we somehow

368
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:47,792
always survive?

369
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:48,876
Yeah.

370
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,086
So far, so good, I guess.

371
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:51,379
It's just luck.

372
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,339
No, no, no, see,
y'all not listening.

373
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:55,258
Think about this.

374
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:59,845
We've now been on insane
missions around the world,

375
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:03,683
doing what most would say
is damn near impossible.

376
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:07,144
And I ain't got one
single scar to show for it?

377
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:09,105
I mean, look at my jacket.

378
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:14,860
Those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head

379
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,404
clean off its shoulders.

380
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:19,532
We've taken out cars,
trains, tanks.

381
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:22,159
I'm not gonna even mention
the submarine.

382
00:38:22,243 --> 00:38:23,869
And yet we're still here.

383
00:38:24,537 --> 00:38:25,746
Exactly.

384
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:27,927
Ramsey, what happens
when you test a theory

385
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,668
over and over again only
to come to the same result?

386
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:33,754
A hypothesis becomes fact. But
you're not actually suggesting that...

387
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,717
I don't know, but when the
improbable happens again and again,

388
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,843
that's more than luck.

389
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:42,054
Maybe we're not so normal.

390
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,973
That's what I'm saying.

391
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,599
We are not normal.

392
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:49,603
Okay, um, just to clarify,

393
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:52,690
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're, what,

394
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:54,442
invincible?

395
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:57,862
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

396
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:01,782
Or maybe

397
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:03,743
you're just a dumbass.

398
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,416
Take your dumbass jacket
with you, man.

399
00:39:18,716 --> 00:39:20,676
Pretty impressive driving
out there.

400
00:39:22,678 --> 00:39:24,096
You miss the old life.

401
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:27,808
Do you?

402
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:31,270
Every day.

403
00:39:33,147 --> 00:39:34,357
Guys.

404
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:37,193
We got a little company.

405
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:39,528
Think you know this person.

406
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,909
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you.

407
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:47,787
Thank you.

408
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:49,288
Of course.

409
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,627
You should've told me.

410
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,089
She deserved to know.

411
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:02,802
Jakob's my brother, too.
I need to be here.

412
00:40:03,177 --> 00:40:06,472
You get involved here, you
put everything you have at risk.

413
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:10,893
Your kids and the
whole world that you built.

414
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:13,646
We're all risking something.

415
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:17,316
Dom, listen to me.

416
00:40:18,234 --> 00:40:22,029
My kids and yours are in
the safest hands possible.

417
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:23,197
With Brian.

418
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:26,575
Our world's grown, Dom.

419
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:29,703
I got this one.

420
00:40:47,972 --> 00:40:49,140
Guys!

421
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:54,186
Guys. Get over here.
You gotta come see this.

422
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:58,399
Don't ever say Roman
ain't look out for y'all.

423
00:40:58,482 --> 00:40:59,608
Huh?

424
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,445
Yeah. You get a stack.

425
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:05,698
And you get a stack.
And Roman gets...

426
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:08,826
Roman, this cash
is from Yugoslavia.

427
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:13,080
Yugoslavia hasn't been
a country since 1992.

428
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:14,915
What, you a expert
on history now?

429
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,918
No, no, no.
I'm an expert on cash.

430
00:41:21,088 --> 00:41:23,549
USD. Huh?

431
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,260
Yeah.

432
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,762
Professor Dumbass.

433
00:41:28,846 --> 00:41:32,308
I just need to find me some
luggage so I can put all this in.

434
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:35,728
The firewall on this old
thing is actually pretty good.

435
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:38,481
But, you know, port scan,
UDP message peek,

436
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,399
pop to root shell, and...

437
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:44,778
...say hello to Project Aries.

438
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:46,197
What is it?

439
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,990
It's what we got
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

440
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,325
Or at least
part of it.

441
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:53,746
Aries was designed to override and
assimilate anything that runs on code.

442
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:55,414
Any computer anywhere.

443
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:57,958
If it operates on zeros
and ones, it's vulnerable.

444
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,126
Aries can own it.

445
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,628
It can
weaponize anything.

446
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,213
Someone could
burn your house down

447
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:04,089
with your refrigerator
if they wanted to.

448
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,258
Oh, so, now my
refrigerator's gonna kill me?

449
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:07,468
It could be made to.

450
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,845
How about my George
Foreman Grill or foot massager?

451
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:12,431
Y'all...

452
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:15,276
Do you know how it feels to create
something that could end the world?

453
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,311
No.

454
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:18,854
Well, I do.

455
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:21,440
And this will.

456
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:24,443
If you take Aries and
upload it to a satellite,

457
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,111
it'll spread like a virus.

458
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:29,240
Then it'll be a matter of time
before someone can control

459
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:33,494
any weapon system, traditional,
nuclear, stuff we haven't even seen yet,

460
00:42:33,577 --> 00:42:35,371
and just point it
wherever they want.

461
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:40,918
Jakob reboots the world
order within minutes.

462
00:42:41,752 --> 00:42:43,796
Ares is
the god of war, right?

463
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:46,257
If Jakob gets his hands
on this,

464
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:48,801
he'll be the god
of damn near everything.

465
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:51,220
Because of how
dangerous it was,

466
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:55,140
the Aries prototype was recovered
and split into two halves by Mr. Nobody.

467
00:42:55,224 --> 00:42:57,851
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

468
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:01,021
Jakob now has
one of the pieces.

469
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:03,274
He'll be going
after the other half next.

470
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:04,817
As for the key, it's...

471
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:06,610
It's vanished.

472
00:43:06,694 --> 00:43:07,695
So, we find it.

473
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:09,780
If we're gonna beat
Jakob to it,

474
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:11,323
we're gonna
have to split up.

475
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:15,035
Roman, Tej, I know a couple of
guys operating out of Germany

476
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,745
that could get us
anything we need.

477
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,100
- I'm on it.
- Wait, there's one more thing.

478
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,127
Mr. Nobody's transmission had
one name connected to the key.

479
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,921
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

480
00:43:32,553 --> 00:43:33,846
No way.

481
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:36,015
That's exactly
what I said.

482
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:39,768
So you're saying Han's death
is connected to all of this?

483
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:41,937
He has to have
something to do with it.

484
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:43,397
I'll look into it.

485
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:46,442
Tej, can you send me all
the files you have on Han?

486
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:48,110
- Yeah.
- I'll go with you.

487
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:50,904
Letty.

488
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:55,326
I got this the day Han died.

489
00:43:56,118 --> 00:43:57,244
Mexico.

490
00:43:58,329 --> 00:43:59,538
Check the postmark.

491
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:02,791
Whatever he was up to,
it ended here.

492
00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:05,252
Tokyo.

493
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:07,880
What are you gonna do
about Jakob?

494
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:10,758
I'm gonna find him.

495
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:14,595
How?

496
00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:17,097
An old friend.

497
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:46,460
Yo, what do you think?

498
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:51,006
It doesn't matter.

499
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:53,634
It's all about how
you choose to see it.

500
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:56,197
- Shit. I told you I was right.
- Shit. I told you I was right.

501
00:44:57,137 --> 00:44:58,972
- I'm Leo.
- Santos.

502
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:01,558
Dom. What are you guys in for?

503
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:02,851
Driving while brown.

504
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:15,864
You see that?

505
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:17,658
Hairline crack
in the fuel line.

506
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,993
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

507
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:21,787
Lean condition?

Hey.

523
00:46:04,163 --> 00:46:05,956
You had another
eight months.

524
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:08,417
Good behavior.

525
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,466
Oh, Dom.

526
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:18,719
You didn't call.

527
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:22,139
I would have
picked you up.

528
00:46:22,806 --> 00:46:24,391
I'm here now.

529
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:30,272
Welcome home,
brother.

530
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:33,692
Come here.

531
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,493
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

532
00:46:42,576 --> 00:46:43,577
Whoo!

533
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,996
That's what
I'm talking about!

534
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,372
How you doin'?

535
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,084
Who wants next?

536
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:53,295
I said, who wants next?

537
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:54,463
I got next.

538
00:46:57,216 --> 00:46:58,509
Dom.

539
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:01,512
Well, when'd you get out, man?

540
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:03,680
I said I got next.

541
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:06,850
Come on, Dom.

542
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:10,687
You don't want to race me
in Buddy's old Charger.

543
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:12,523
No, it won't even be close.

544
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:15,526
My Mustang? With all
the mods that I put in it?

545
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:17,444
Car don't make the driver.

546
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:27,037
Here's how this goes.

547
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:28,872
You win,

548
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,250
you come back home.

549
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,544
You lose,

550
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:37,005
you keep driving,
you don't stop,

551
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:38,840
you don't ever come back.

552
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,009
Ever.

553
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:43,887
What do you mean, Dom?

554
00:47:43,971 --> 00:47:45,389
I know what you did.

555
00:47:47,474 --> 00:47:51,311
The day we lost him, Dad
kept talking about a misfire.

556
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:52,854
Remember?

557
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:56,483
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

558
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:00,696
A minute later, he was gone.

559
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:04,491
Tell me
why you killed Dad.

560
00:48:12,124 --> 00:48:13,417
Now let's race.

561
00:48:19,172 --> 00:48:20,591
Armed robbery in Echo Park.

562
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:22,301
Fourth Street Bridge is open.

563
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:23,427
Clear, clear, clear!

564
00:48:43,363 --> 00:48:44,573
Ready?

565
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:46,783

566
00:48:48,285 --> 00:48:49,369

602
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:33,366
Place still
looks the same.

603
00:51:35,535 --> 00:51:37,329
Just like
your dad left it.

604
00:51:38,205 --> 00:51:39,790
I'm looking for Jakob.

605
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,628
Can't help you, man.

606
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:49,508
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

607
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:53,303
The worst thing
you can do to a Toretto

608
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:55,263
is take away their family.

609
00:51:56,973 --> 00:51:58,809
That's what you did to Jakob.

610
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:01,686
You've got people
who love you,

611
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:04,272
count on you,
care for you.

612
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:06,274
He ain't got no one.

613
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:07,442
You get in his way,

614
00:52:07,526 --> 00:52:10,320
this ain't gonna end until one
of you guys are in the ground.

615
00:52:10,987 --> 00:52:12,823
I know you did the best
you could, Buddy.

616
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:17,577
But we both know he's
about to cause a lot of hurt.

617
00:52:30,298 --> 00:52:32,676
I did my best
to take care of Jakob.

618
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:36,680
But I'm no Jack Toretto.

619
00:52:53,947 --> 00:52:56,825
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

620
00:52:58,577 --> 00:53:01,079
If you want hope
for the future.

621
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:10,255
He's in London.

622
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:12,632
That's all I know.

623
00:53:23,643 --> 00:53:25,103
Dom.

624
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,817
I hope you find your peace.

625
00:53:33,903 --> 00:53:36,948
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

626
00:54:08,355 --> 00:54:10,190
Han's old shop.

627
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:15,278
God! It looks like this place has
been picked over a thousand times.

628
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,600
- Gotta start somewhere.
- It doesn't make any sense.

629
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:19,991
I mean,
Han ends up in Tokyo

630
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:22,744
and he's supposed to have
something to do with the key?

631
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,152
But police records
make it sound like

632
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:26,790
he was running around with
a bunch of small time crooks.

633
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:30,460
Don't mock it.
That's how we started.

634
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:33,296
Maybe Han was looking
for a change of scenery

635
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,923
after Gisele died.

636
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,384
People mourn
in different ways.

637
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,844
Letty, how did Mr. Nobody
get connected with Han?

638
00:54:40,178 --> 00:54:41,805
And they never...

639
00:54:41,888 --> 00:54:43,765
They never
crossed paths unless...

640
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:44,849
Gisele.

641
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:47,435
She's former Mossad.

642
00:54:47,977 --> 00:54:49,896
Mr. Nobody is a spy.

643
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:51,940
They could have run
in the same circles.

644
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:55,402
There's Mossad clearance all over
the files Mr. Nobody had on Han.

645
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:57,946
Mission spikes
going back to Mexico,

646
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:00,949
which is where Gisele was working
when she met Dom and Brian.

647
00:55:01,908 --> 00:55:03,410
Gisele's gotta be the link.

648
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:08,039
Leave it to Mr. Nobody
to confuse everyone.

649
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:13,670
This place is a dead end.
Let's get out of here.

650
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:15,588
I'll check in with
Tej and Roman.

656
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,604
She's ready to roll.

657
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:34,107
No. No!

658
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:35,817
No, Sean!

659
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,643
Tell me you are not modding the
quick disconnect valve on the LOX line.

660
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:39,863
Hey, man, chill out.

661
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:41,156
All right? It's all good.

662
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:44,075
- That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds.
- "All good"?

663
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:45,744
This isn't <i>Top Gun,</i> Maverick.

664
00:55:45,827 --> 00:55:47,427
You don't follow
the rules here, you die.

665
00:55:47,454 --> 00:55:49,539
Hey, come on.
That's a bit much.

666
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:52,542
When you know what too much
pressure in the LOX line can do,

667
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,711
come talk to me.
Till then, stay in your lane.

668
00:55:54,794 --> 00:55:56,629
Yo, you're lucky
to even be in my lane.

669
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:58,593
In case you forgot,
I'm the one that figured out

670
00:55:58,673 --> 00:56:00,967
how to let us build rocket
engines and get paid.

671
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,428
This whole thing was my idea.

672
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:05,805
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

673
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:07,599
this glorified mechanic

674
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,768
or a rocket scientist?

675
00:56:10,143 --> 00:56:12,353
Without me, you'd be
working at Jiffy Lube.

676
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:14,189
Guys, guys.
Look, it's all good.

677
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:15,398
Who cares about
who did what?

678
00:56:15,482 --> 00:56:16,858
Kind of hard
for you to do anything

679
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:18,981
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, Twinkie.

680
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:20,403
Did I hear that right?

681
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:23,198
You a runner and
you afraid of flying?

682
00:56:24,991 --> 00:56:26,409
"Twinkie"?

683
00:56:26,826 --> 00:56:30,371
So, you must be Ding Dong
and Sno Ball.

684
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:32,165
- Right?
- Yo... Uh-uh.

685
00:56:32,832 --> 00:56:34,375
I don't go
by that name anymore.

686
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:36,503
You went by
that name ever?

687
00:56:36,628 --> 00:56:37,837
Like, ever?

688
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:39,339
I... that's...

689
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,243
- Hey! We're up.
- Oh, good.

690
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:46,429
Hey, fellas.

691
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:48,389
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

692
00:56:49,557 --> 00:56:52,894
Well, say hello
to the two-second car.

693
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,904
Is that a Pontiac Fiero

694
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,031
strapped to
a rocket engine?

695
00:57:05,114 --> 00:57:06,825
Impressive, I know.

696
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:08,243
No.

697
00:57:08,326 --> 00:57:09,786
No, that's not impressive.

698
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:14,249
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

699
00:57:31,307 --> 00:57:32,392
Plane's taking off!

700
00:57:32,475 --> 00:57:33,643
Go, go, go, go!

701
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:51,369
Yes!

702
00:57:53,705 --> 00:57:54,747
We did it!

703
00:58:01,462 --> 00:58:02,630
Uh...

704
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,215
I'm confused.

705
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,718
Y'all didn't actually
beat the jet.

706
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,469
It didn't explode.

707
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,513
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

708
00:58:10,597 --> 00:58:12,015
She's still in one piece.

709
00:58:18,313 --> 00:58:19,564
You mean "pieces"?

710
00:58:19,856 --> 00:58:23,401
Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

711
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:27,280
Look, we heard y'all
could get us some wheels.

712
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:30,074
Preferably the kind
that don't explode.

713
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,035
Is that possible?

714
00:58:32,118 --> 00:58:35,038
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

715
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:36,998
Dominic Toretto sent us.

716
00:58:45,048 --> 00:58:46,466
Who's Dominic Toretto?

717
00:58:55,141 --> 00:58:56,601
<i>Arigato.</i>

718
00:58:59,479 --> 00:59:01,481
This place is a dead end.

719
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:04,442
Do you think Jakob could be
onto the Han connection?

720
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,570
If he has all the
information we do, probably.

721
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:14,035
I never told Dom,

722
00:59:16,162 --> 00:59:19,040
I stayed in touch with him for
a while after what happened.

723
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:23,336
He was over at Buddy's
for about a year, and then

724
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:25,797
he was gone, with a
message not to follow.

725
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:29,217
But after he disappeared,
I was so desperate to find him

726
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,803
that I would've...
Would've done anything.

727
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:35,556
I even broke into a police
archive, but I didn't find anything.

728
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,891
You what?

729
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,559
You were, like, 16.

730
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:41,646
I did what I had to do.

731
00:59:42,897 --> 00:59:44,190
Yeah.

732
00:59:47,485 --> 00:59:48,861
How about you?

733
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:50,780
How are you doing?

734
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:53,199
It's a change of pace, huh?

735
00:59:55,201 --> 00:59:57,245
Just as I was remembering...

736
00:59:59,288 --> 01:00:00,707
...who I was,

737
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:02,917
everything changed.

738
01:00:04,544 --> 01:00:05,878
It slowed down.

739
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:09,465
There's peace for me
in the chaos.

740
01:00:10,049 --> 01:00:14,303
It's like I... I need to face the world
head-on or something to feel alive.

741
01:00:16,222 --> 01:00:18,141
Seeing Little Brian

742
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,728
hiding in a hole because
we had unexpected company

743
01:00:23,438 --> 01:00:24,856
that got to me.

744
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:28,359
We never used to hide.

745
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:34,073
Hey, Dom's my brother, but
you will always be my sister.

746
01:00:35,616 --> 01:00:38,244
Funny how we all have secrets.

747
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:46,335
What?

748
01:00:46,419 --> 01:00:48,171
You got to be kidding me.

749
01:00:49,088 --> 01:00:50,339
What is it?

750
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:52,467
Remember what Han
used to say about Tokyo?

751
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:57,346
You mean how,
in all the old Westerns,

752
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,516
cowboys would make a run for
the border to get away from the law,

753
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,185
how Tokyo was his...

754
01:01:02,268 --> 01:01:03,269
Mexico.

755
01:01:07,565 --> 01:01:08,775
No way.

756
01:02:01,494 --> 01:02:02,703
Hmm.

757
01:02:05,498 --> 01:02:07,166
Nice necklace,
Queenie.

758
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:11,504
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

759
01:02:12,338 --> 01:02:14,215
Dominic Toretto.

760
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,095
The word on the street
is you got locked up.

761
01:02:19,178 --> 01:02:21,389
Yeah, well, in and out,
you know.

762
01:02:22,181 --> 01:02:23,766
When are they gonna learn

763
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:26,144
some birds
can't be caged?

764
01:02:26,227 --> 01:02:28,187
Are you looking
for one of me sons?

765
01:02:29,522 --> 01:02:30,857
Not tonight.

766
01:02:32,108 --> 01:02:34,652
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

767
01:02:39,073 --> 01:02:40,950
My thieving days are over.

768
01:02:42,285 --> 01:02:43,661
Mine ain't.

769
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:46,706
You coming?

770
01:03:18,779 --> 01:03:20,114
I'm looking for someone.

771
01:03:20,573 --> 01:03:22,700
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

772
01:03:23,284 --> 01:03:26,329
A lot of guys,
a lot of resources.

773
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:29,415
Oh, yeah, yeah, word did go
round on a crew that just turned up,

774
01:03:29,498 --> 01:03:30,750
led by an American.

775
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:39,216
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

776
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,886
Rumor had it he was into
something big up in Edinburgh.

777
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:48,601
Local seller, huh?

778
01:03:49,435 --> 01:03:52,063
She wouldn't happen to be wearing
a stolen necklace, would she?

779
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:54,774
He paid well. What was I
supposed to do?

780
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,948
This geezer was about
your height, actually.

781
01:04:02,657 --> 01:04:03,950
Similar features.

782
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:07,828
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your
cousin or something, is he?

783
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:09,789
He's my brother.

784
01:04:13,751 --> 01:04:15,551
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

785
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:27,682
Glad I'm not the only one
with a family full of eccentrics.

786
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:31,477
He offered payment
for something else.

787
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,398
You.

788
01:04:48,494 --> 01:04:51,664
<i>♪ I am the thorn in your crown ♪</i>

789
01:04:56,127 --> 01:04:58,921
<i>♪ Veneno you hold in your mouth ♪</i>

790
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:01,674
<i>♪ That you won't spit out ♪</i>

791
01:05:03,509 --> 01:05:06,512
You know, nothing's more
powerful than the love of family.

792
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:10,016
But you turn that
into anger and resentment,

793
01:05:10,933 --> 01:05:12,768
nothing's more dangerous.

794
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,442
Dom?

795
01:05:19,859 --> 01:05:21,861
Don't get yourself
killed, okay?

796
01:05:22,194 --> 01:05:24,030
You're my favorite American.

797
01:05:48,137 --> 01:05:50,014
Dominic Toretto.

798
01:05:50,097 --> 01:05:52,016
Tell me.
Why is the best fruit

799
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:53,559
always forbidden?

800
01:05:54,226 --> 01:05:55,686
You should know.

801
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:56,771
Mmm.

802
01:05:59,857 --> 01:06:02,151
This is your kind of party,
isn't it, Dom?

803
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:05,446
Beautiful women, best cars,
best everything.

804
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:07,114
You know,
best security, too.

805
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:09,033
I'm Otto. I'm your
brother's partner.

806
01:06:14,663 --> 01:06:16,123
Well, financier.

807
01:06:16,957 --> 01:06:18,501
But, you know, my dad,
he's a dictator,

808
01:06:18,584 --> 01:06:20,461
so we're not talking
regular people rich here.

809
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:23,130
No, no, no, no, no.
Everything you see here, I own.

810
01:06:23,214 --> 01:06:25,049
These girls, if you want
to meet one of them,

811
01:06:25,132 --> 01:06:27,718
maybe two, maybe three, just let
me know. They're on the payroll.

812
01:06:27,802 --> 01:06:30,721
I offer a bomb-ass
dental plan, too. Huh?

813
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,014
Where is Jakob?

814
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:33,682
He's inside.

815
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:16,058
The brother
you're looking for,

816
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:18,435
he's from an old life.

817
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,147
He's long gone.

818
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:24,817
All I see is the same scared
little kid that killed our father.

819
01:07:26,944 --> 01:07:28,404
That's your mistake.

820
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:32,408
The spy game,

821
01:07:33,576 --> 01:07:35,244
this is my world.

822
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:41,864
What do you think
happened, Dom,

823
01:07:41,876 --> 01:07:43,919
every time you
took somebody down?

824
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:47,256
Their territory just
stayed crime-free?

825
01:07:49,216 --> 01:07:51,719
The Trans, Braga...

826
01:07:53,095 --> 01:07:54,471
The Shaws...

827
01:07:56,098 --> 01:07:57,600
Cipher.

828
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,977
You paved the way for me.

829
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,271
So here's my offer.

830
01:08:03,022 --> 01:08:04,899
It's the same one you gave me.

831
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:08,819
You leave.

832
01:08:09,028 --> 01:08:10,237
Now.

833
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:14,742
You drive away,
and you never come back.

834
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:16,702
Ever.

835
01:08:17,453 --> 01:08:18,495
A deal?

836
01:08:19,955 --> 01:08:21,624
I showed you mercy!

837
01:08:24,084 --> 01:08:25,753
And I won't show it
to you again.

838
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,306
Toretto.

839
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:40,601
Since my dad
is head of state,

840
01:08:41,435 --> 01:08:43,562
it makes me
a foreign dignitary

841
01:08:43,646 --> 01:08:46,190
and this place
an embassy.

842
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:50,611
Which means you just trespassed
into my country and attempted murder.

843
01:08:50,945 --> 01:08:54,698
So, naturally, I called in a little favor
with all my good friends from INTERPOL.

844
01:08:55,074 --> 01:08:58,118
You keep digging around
in the past, Dom,

845
01:08:58,244 --> 01:09:00,246
you're not gonna like
what you find.

846
01:09:08,337 --> 01:09:10,881
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

847
01:09:12,341 --> 01:09:14,843
But your family
is a train wreck.

848
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:18,639
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

849
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,432
it's time
we go to Edinburgh.

850
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:24,228
Get the second piece, maybe
do a little sightseeing, huh?

851
01:09:26,355 --> 01:09:27,815
Any news on the key?

852
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:29,775
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

853
01:09:31,944 --> 01:09:35,781
One week from now, there
won't be a superpower in the world

854
01:09:35,864 --> 01:09:37,825
can take a piss
without our permission.

855
01:09:37,908 --> 01:09:40,995
One week from now, your dad
will be asking you for an allowance.

856
01:09:41,078 --> 01:09:42,788
I'd like that.

857
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:45,791
I'd like that.

858
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:01,265
Whew.

859
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:03,559
What's up?

860
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:07,021
- Well done, Leysa.
- Please.

861
01:10:07,146 --> 01:10:10,316
If it wasn't for you, I'd still
be stealing gas in the D.R.

862
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:12,109
So Queenie
treating you right?

863
01:10:12,401 --> 01:10:13,736
Like a <i>princesa.</i>

864
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:15,404
I'm her number-one pick,
you know.

865
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:17,990
- Cara's little sister done good.
- Good?

866
01:10:18,073 --> 01:10:20,242
You saw my fine ass
in that white dress.

867
01:10:20,326 --> 01:10:21,785
You see how
I been rocking shit?

868
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,705
All this crew,
this is mine. Huh?

869
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:26,498
I been around the world.

870
01:10:26,582 --> 01:10:28,208
Oh, I almost forgot,

871
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:29,626
you might need this.

872
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:32,588
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

873
01:10:32,671 --> 01:10:35,299
You'll have no trouble
tracking him now.

874
01:11:13,253 --> 01:11:14,421
Hey, Letty.

875
01:11:15,881 --> 01:11:16,882
Yeah.

876
01:11:16,965 --> 01:11:18,175
Come look at this.

877
01:11:19,468 --> 01:11:20,469
What the hell?

878
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:23,639
Han never mentioned
a girl, not ever.

879
01:11:25,307 --> 01:11:26,558
Letty, Mia!

880
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:28,560
Down, now!

881
01:13:24,551 --> 01:13:25,886
You okay?

882
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:31,118
Welcome to St. Giles'
Cathedral of Edinburgh.

883
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:35,581
The High Kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.

884
01:14:35,706 --> 01:14:38,458
Renowned for its
stained glass windows,

885
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:40,961
you can see the intricate
craftsmanship...

886
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,091
We're a go.

887
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,058
Ramsey, talk to me.
What do we got?

888
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,260
I pulled Jakob's biometric
signature off the gun,

889
01:14:57,352 --> 01:15:00,522
and the algorithm I've run says
Jakob's team is right on top of us.

890
01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:02,691
Anywhere between
80 and 100 meters.

891
01:15:02,774 --> 01:15:04,109
Eighty meters?

892
01:15:04,192 --> 01:15:05,652
That's a lot around here.

893
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:08,280
This whole area
seems pretty packed in.

894
01:15:08,697 --> 01:15:10,782
So, we don't know...

895
01:15:10,866 --> 01:15:13,619
<i>where the secret vault
facility Jakob is looking to hit is,</i>

896
01:15:13,702 --> 01:15:14,828
<i>now, do we?</i>

897
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:16,788
Wouldn't be a secret
if we did.

898
01:15:17,539 --> 01:15:18,582
<i>You know what?</i>

899
01:15:18,665 --> 01:15:20,667
<i>I'm starting to think
your little English accent</i>

900
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,836
<i>makes you sound
smarter than you are.</i>

901
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:31,219
Man, can I point out that a
good old-fashioned tracking chip

902
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:33,347
would've put us within,
like, six feet of this dude?

903
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,641
But, nah, instead,
we out here with biometrics

904
01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:37,434
and facial recognition
imaging.

905
01:15:37,643 --> 01:15:41,355
Feels like we looking for Where's
Waldo in Harry Potter world.

906
01:15:41,438 --> 01:15:43,190
Yeah, uh,
strong argument there,

907
01:15:43,273 --> 01:15:45,192
Tej, but tracking chips
follow the chip.

908
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:47,653
Before we know it, we'd
be chasing some expensive

909
01:15:47,736 --> 01:15:49,655
yet tacky jacket
to the dry cleaner's.

910
01:15:49,738 --> 01:15:52,407
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

911
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:55,702
Wait.

912
01:15:55,786 --> 01:15:57,579
Guys, okay,
we have a problem.

913
01:15:57,663 --> 01:16:01,166
Cameras are going down all around
us, and my equipment is freaking out.

914
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:04,795
What the hell, Jimmy?

915
01:16:05,462 --> 01:16:07,339
Security alert.
Cameras are down.

916
01:16:10,008 --> 01:16:11,301
Damn.

917
01:16:11,385 --> 01:16:12,761
You see anything suspicious?

918
01:16:13,095 --> 01:16:14,721
Uh, where do I start?

919
01:16:14,805 --> 01:16:18,058
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

920
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:20,519
I even seen these
two ladies walking

921
01:16:20,602 --> 01:16:23,980
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

922
01:16:24,064 --> 01:16:26,817
I feel like I'm in Transylvania
or some damn where.

923
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:41,206
<i>Ramsey, we're looking
everywhere.</i>

924
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:42,833
<i>I just grew a new bunion.</i>

925
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,501
This is hopeless.

926
01:16:46,378 --> 01:16:47,546
What?

927
01:16:47,629 --> 01:16:49,506
- You see that?
- See what?

928
01:16:49,756 --> 01:16:50,882
The ears.

929
01:16:51,383 --> 01:16:53,093
They got cauliflower ears.

930
01:16:53,343 --> 01:16:54,845
They fight for a living.

931
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:58,890
- Don't worry about it.
- Roman.

932
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:01,893
Hey, man, I ordered
a pair of Crocs

933
01:17:01,977 --> 01:17:04,438
three weeks ago,
and I'm still waiting!

934
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:10,527
Where are my shoes, man?

935
01:17:13,155 --> 01:17:15,741
Man, we really need
to work on your planning.

936
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,995
Hey, Dom, you should
get down to the cathedral.

937
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,247
Dumbass here just attacked
some delivery dudes

938
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:23,915
'cause he didn't like
their ears.

939
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:27,335
Wait, wait, wait.

940
01:17:27,419 --> 01:17:29,671
How much did you say
you paid for that again?

941
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,924
You know silver
ain't magnetic, right?

942
01:17:33,759 --> 01:17:35,469
You know what? Just shut up.

943
01:17:35,552 --> 01:17:36,678
Just shut up.

944
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:41,224
Ramsey, say we had a big
electromagnet turned up right around here.

945
01:17:41,892 --> 01:17:44,144
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

946
01:17:44,227 --> 01:17:46,897
Including security systems.
That's it.

947
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,982
That's how Jakob's
getting into the vault.

948
01:17:53,153 --> 01:17:54,404
<i>Guys?</i>

949
01:17:55,113 --> 01:17:56,198
<i>Guys?</i>

950
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:01,259
Okay, we've got police
coming from all sides.

951
01:18:01,295 --> 01:18:04,295
- <i>The area's locking down.</i>
- He ain't using roads.

952
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:20,806
I got eyes on Jakob.

953
01:18:29,314 --> 01:18:30,524
I see Otto.

954
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:34,069
I'm gonna tail him.

955
01:18:43,161 --> 01:18:45,205
He's heading towards
a blue Jaguar.

956
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:46,373
Okay, follow him.

957
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:48,416
Me? I can't.

958
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:49,709
Why not?

959
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:51,545
<i>Okay, this is a bad
time to tell you this,</i>

960
01:18:52,212 --> 01:18:53,505
but I don't drive. Okay?

961
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:55,590
I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

962
01:18:55,674 --> 01:18:57,717
And, you know, no one
really drives in London.

963
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,262
Okay? And that is not
my contribution to this group.

964
01:19:00,345 --> 01:19:01,429
It's you or no one.

965
01:19:14,776 --> 01:19:15,986
Shit.

966
01:19:16,444 --> 01:19:19,281
Guys, come on, man. I feel
like, between the six of us,

967
01:19:19,364 --> 01:19:20,866
we can work
this out, right?

968
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:31,585
Okay. I've got...

969
01:19:39,092 --> 01:19:40,594
Ramsey, shut it off!

970
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:42,053
Shut it off!

971
01:19:44,139 --> 01:19:45,181
Go, go, go!

972
01:19:45,307 --> 01:19:46,308
Okay.

973
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:48,768
Brake is on the left,
accelerator right.

974
01:20:45,575 --> 01:20:46,576
Shit.

975
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,331
Hey!

976
01:21:04,219 --> 01:21:05,845
Oh. Sorry!

977
01:21:23,989 --> 01:21:24,990
Whoa!

978
01:21:50,056 --> 01:21:51,057
Oh, no!

979
01:21:53,977 --> 01:21:55,145
Move!

980
01:21:55,437 --> 01:21:57,022
Hey, that was not my fault!

981
01:22:05,947 --> 01:22:07,824
Okay, that one was my fault.

982
01:22:43,276 --> 01:22:44,402
See?

983
01:22:44,486 --> 01:22:45,945
What'd I tell you?

984
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:47,405
Not even a scratch.

985
01:23:01,795 --> 01:23:03,588
Otto, sending you
new pickup location.

986
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:13,389
I've got it.
I'm headed to you now.

987
01:23:53,513 --> 01:23:54,597
Otto, where are you?

988
01:23:54,848 --> 01:23:56,599
Jakob, I'm there.
I don't see anybody.

989
01:23:59,018 --> 01:24:01,020
It's because you're
on the wrong street.

990
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:36,723
That's my car, pal!

991
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:37,891
Dom!

992
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:43,396
Go!

993
01:24:46,983 --> 01:24:48,443
Damn it.

994
01:25:20,433 --> 01:25:21,559
You're a natural.

995
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:23,895
Of course I am.

996
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:38,743
Okay, listen up!

997
01:25:38,868 --> 01:25:40,495
I want 50 of the best men!

998
01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:41,579
I want guns!

999
01:25:41,663 --> 01:25:44,958
I want wheels, freaking
X-wing fighters, I don't care!

1000
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:47,919
The <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> Chewbacca
if you can get ahold of him.

1001
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:49,545
Money's no object. Go.

1002
01:25:50,421 --> 01:25:51,673
Go!

1003
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,017
What?

1004
01:26:05,186 --> 01:26:06,646
What's so funny?

1005
01:26:07,647 --> 01:26:08,815
I...

1006
01:26:10,024 --> 01:26:12,860
I was thinking,
if this was a movie,

1007
01:26:13,278 --> 01:26:14,612
this would be the moment

1008
01:26:14,696 --> 01:26:17,991
where the villain
has an unexpected setback,

1009
01:26:18,116 --> 01:26:20,660
overcompensates without
thinking it through

1010
01:26:20,785 --> 01:26:22,829
and gets crushed
by the good guys.

1011
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:28,751
No offense, but you have no
idea what we're about to do.

1012
01:26:29,544 --> 01:26:32,046
And, for the record,
we're the good guys.

1013
01:26:32,338 --> 01:26:34,549
Me? I'm Luke
freaking Skywalker.

1014
01:26:34,841 --> 01:26:36,342
Are you sure about that?

1015
01:26:37,176 --> 01:26:39,387
I mean, I get
the daddy issues, but...

1016
01:26:41,431 --> 01:26:43,016
Look at what you've built.

1017
01:26:44,809 --> 01:26:46,477
Really? Luke?

1018
01:26:47,854 --> 01:26:49,147
You're right.

1019
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:51,524
No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

1020
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,860
No.

1021
01:26:56,529 --> 01:26:57,613
You're Yoda.

1022
01:26:57,905 --> 01:26:59,157
- Yoda?
- Mm-hmm.

1023
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:01,242
No. The little green guy?

1024
01:27:01,326 --> 01:27:02,535
- Yeah.
- No.

1025
01:27:03,953 --> 01:27:05,872
Ah, shit, I'll take it.

1026
01:27:06,581 --> 01:27:08,875
Because he's
a powerful Jedi, right?

1027
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:10,126
No.

1028
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:12,170
Yoda's a puppet.

1029
01:27:14,797 --> 01:27:17,175
With someone's hand
up his ass.

1030
01:27:41,407 --> 01:27:42,617
So, what now, Dom?

1031
01:27:43,284 --> 01:27:45,244
No one outruns their past.

1032
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:47,663
And yours just
caught up to you.

1033
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:58,674
Man.

1034
01:27:58,758 --> 01:28:02,095
There is literally zero industrial
or weapons-grade electromagnets

1035
01:28:02,178 --> 01:28:04,013
I can find that
are this powerful.

1036
01:28:04,097 --> 01:28:05,681
Look at the pull strength
level here.

1037
01:28:05,765 --> 01:28:07,266
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

1038
01:28:08,476 --> 01:28:09,685
Wait, watch this.

1039
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:28,621
Every time.
I can't believe it.

1040
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:29,914
What are you doing, bruh?

1041
01:28:30,415 --> 01:28:31,833
I'm hungry.

1042
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,584
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, damn.

1043
01:28:33,668 --> 01:28:34,961
Surprise.

1044
01:28:38,673 --> 01:28:40,299
Nice clubhouse.

1045
01:28:51,727 --> 01:28:53,104
'Sup, man?

1046
01:28:58,109 --> 01:28:59,235
Nice to meet you.

1047
01:29:15,209 --> 01:29:17,044
So you got
my postcard, huh?

1048
01:29:33,711 --> 01:29:36,839
Little B.
Yes, it's daddy.

1049
01:29:37,023 --> 01:29:40,526
How you doin'?
Stayin' out of trouble?

1050
01:29:42,778 --> 01:29:44,989
Of course not. Well,
at least you're honest.

1051
01:29:45,072 --> 01:29:47,116
And that's the most
important thing.

1052
01:29:48,868 --> 01:29:51,662
Oh, I miss you
so much more.

1053
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:54,415
And I'm coming home soon.

1054
01:29:55,541 --> 01:29:57,084
How's...

1055
01:29:57,168 --> 01:30:00,838
I'll tell you what, if I'm not home
by the time you count till 1,000,

1056
01:30:00,922 --> 01:30:03,132
you tell Uncle Brian

1057
01:30:03,216 --> 01:30:05,927
that I said you could have
a second treat before dinner.

1058
01:30:09,722 --> 01:30:11,474
It's a promise.

1059
01:30:14,185 --> 01:30:16,103
And I always keep my promises.

1060
01:30:19,273 --> 01:30:21,317
I'm just still trying
to figure out...

1061
01:30:22,235 --> 01:30:23,819
How are you still alive?

1062
01:30:26,322 --> 01:30:28,241
Well, after
Gisele died...

1063
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:31,577
...I didn't know what to do.

1064
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,330
I was aimless.

1065
01:30:35,998 --> 01:30:37,667
- Lost.
- Absolutely.

1066
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:39,293
But can you get
to the part where

1067
01:30:40,169 --> 01:30:42,769
the car exploded
and you're still alive?

1068
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:44,657
- Like, I'm trying to...
- Roman, can you...

1069
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,634
Can you just be quiet
for one minute?

1070
01:30:47,051 --> 01:30:48,552
We made plans.

1071
01:30:50,137 --> 01:30:51,264
We had dreams.

1072
01:30:51,889 --> 01:30:54,058
So what's our next
adventure after this?

1073
01:30:56,602 --> 01:30:59,897
How about we stay
in one place?

1074
01:31:01,315 --> 01:31:02,400
Where are you thinking?

1075
01:31:02,608 --> 01:31:03,609
Tokyo.

1076
01:31:04,318 --> 01:31:06,112
We always talk
about Tokyo.

1077
01:31:06,696 --> 01:31:07,905
Tokyo it is.

1078
01:31:09,448 --> 01:31:12,076
<i>You know, it's funny,
Gisele led me there,</i>

1079
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:14,870
and I wasn't even
looking for it.

1080
01:31:17,623 --> 01:31:18,958
But it became home.

1081
01:31:20,668 --> 01:31:22,837
Then, one day,
Mr. Nobody came calling.

1082
01:31:23,212 --> 01:31:25,047
<i>I worked with Gisele.</i>

1083
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:27,300
Back when I was
a CIA operative

1084
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:30,094
running the drug trade
in Central America.

1085
01:31:31,721 --> 01:31:32,888
The good old days.

1086
01:31:33,306 --> 01:31:34,932
Gisele was my best.

1087
01:31:35,766 --> 01:31:37,852
You can lose an asset
at any time.

1088
01:31:39,645 --> 01:31:42,315
Bullet, knife, wire.

1089
01:31:43,107 --> 01:31:45,359
But I never thought
I'd lose her...

1090
01:31:46,235 --> 01:31:47,570
...to love.

1091
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:52,199
What do you want?

1092
01:31:52,283 --> 01:31:54,577
I'm offering you a job, Han.

1093
01:31:55,536 --> 01:31:57,413
Here, in Tokyo.

1094
01:31:58,164 --> 01:31:59,332
Why me?

1095
01:31:59,415 --> 01:32:01,375
'Cause I saw your work
with Gisele.

1096
01:32:01,459 --> 01:32:03,753
I saw that
she trusted you.

1097
01:32:05,421 --> 01:32:07,256
And that means
I can trust you.

1098
01:32:08,341 --> 01:32:13,054
And that is very rare
in this line of work.

1099
01:32:18,976 --> 01:32:21,228
<i>And all I knew was that
I had to steal some tech</i>

1100
01:32:21,312 --> 01:32:23,189
<i>from the home
of a scientist couple.</i>

1101
01:32:27,443 --> 01:32:28,903
<i>But, as usual,</i>

1102
01:32:29,987 --> 01:32:32,073
<i>Mr. Nobody didn't tell me
everything.</i>

1103
01:32:33,741 --> 01:32:36,077
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

1104
01:32:41,207 --> 01:32:42,708
I was 11.

1105
01:32:43,793 --> 01:32:46,379
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

1106
01:32:46,462 --> 01:32:48,297
if I tried hard in school
during the week.

1107
01:32:49,548 --> 01:32:51,759
<i>I was so excited to go</i>

1108
01:32:52,093 --> 01:32:55,471
<i>I forgot my raincoat,
so I went back in.</i>

1109
01:33:02,228 --> 01:33:04,271
<i>At first, I didn't see it.</i>

1110
01:33:06,273 --> 01:33:08,442
By the time I looked out
the window...

1111
01:33:11,862 --> 01:33:13,572
...Mom and Dad were gone.

1112
01:33:13,656 --> 01:33:16,075
Turns out I wasn't the only
one looking for this thing.

1113
01:33:44,019 --> 01:33:45,312
Get down!

1114
01:33:55,114 --> 01:33:56,490
<i>Han saved me.</i>

1115
01:33:57,408 --> 01:33:58,868
<i>Wouldn't leave me behind.</i>

1116
01:33:59,743 --> 01:34:01,287
He knew I'd always
be a target,

1117
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:03,289
so he taught me
how to survive.

1118
01:34:06,292 --> 01:34:08,043
We became a family.

1119
01:34:10,796 --> 01:34:12,465
"Always be a target"?

1120
01:34:14,425 --> 01:34:15,593
Why?

1121
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:17,720
'Cause she is the key.

1122
01:34:22,475 --> 01:34:24,768
Everybody's been looking
for a thing.

1123
01:34:26,103 --> 01:34:27,688
It was a person all along.

1124
01:34:28,898 --> 01:34:32,359
My parents didn't want Project
Aries to fall into the wrong hands,

1125
01:34:32,443 --> 01:34:35,696
so they locked it with their
own DNA, something we share.

1126
01:34:36,906 --> 01:34:39,909
And then, one day, Mr. Nobody
gave me the heads-up

1127
01:34:39,992 --> 01:34:41,869
that one of his best agents
went rogue.

1128
01:34:42,536 --> 01:34:44,705
So when Deckard Shaw
came calling,

1129
01:34:45,164 --> 01:34:46,373
<i>we used it as cover.</i>

1130
01:34:52,546 --> 01:34:55,299
But you got killed
in a car crash, Han.

1131
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:59,637
Mr. Nobody had a way
of making things look real.

1132
01:35:07,603 --> 01:35:09,355
Pretty nifty magic trick.

1133
01:35:10,314 --> 01:35:11,982
Yeah, I've done better.

1134
01:35:14,068 --> 01:35:15,778
Now for the hard part.

1135
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,782
Keeping you dead.

1136
01:35:22,576 --> 01:35:23,786
My death...

1137
01:35:24,161 --> 01:35:25,996
...became the best way
to stay alive.

1138
01:35:31,627 --> 01:35:33,536
What's happening? It's
some kind of hidden subroutine

1139
01:35:33,546 --> 01:35:34,588
the system follows.

1140
01:35:58,445 --> 01:36:00,114
That's it, right there.

1141
01:36:00,489 --> 01:36:02,241
Yeah, nobody moves,

1142
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:04,868
everybody lives.

1143
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,084
Jakob.

1144
01:36:13,544 --> 01:36:14,670
I'm sorry, Mia.

1145
01:36:18,674 --> 01:36:20,175
I was the rogue agent.

1146
01:36:21,468 --> 01:36:22,553
Me.

1147
01:36:23,304 --> 01:36:25,723
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

1148
01:36:25,806 --> 01:36:28,267
Think he just dropped out
of the sky and chose you?

1149
01:36:28,684 --> 01:36:32,271
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

1150
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:37,901
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, Dom.

1151
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,738
And you just
handed her over.

1152
01:36:42,114 --> 01:36:43,365
I told you.

1153
01:36:44,742 --> 01:36:46,076
This is my world.

1154
01:36:47,077 --> 01:36:48,287
Got it.

1155
01:36:49,455 --> 01:36:51,123
Got a lot of guys here.

1156
01:36:51,832 --> 01:36:53,292
You trust 'em?

1157
01:36:53,792 --> 01:36:54,960
Trust this.

1158
01:37:00,424 --> 01:37:02,885
You know the only good thing
to come from Dad dying?

1159
01:37:05,888 --> 01:37:08,932
If he hadn't, I'd have spent
my entire life in your shadow.

1160
01:37:12,019 --> 01:37:16,065
And now you're gonna spend
the rest of yours living in mine.

1161
01:37:19,818 --> 01:37:22,237
Only good thing
about Dad dying...

1162
01:37:23,322 --> 01:37:25,699
...was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

1163
01:37:26,617 --> 01:37:29,036
You never deserved
the Toretto name.

1164
01:37:31,705 --> 01:37:33,123
You think
you knew Dad, huh?

1165
01:37:33,207 --> 01:37:35,407
What, 'cause you were his
favorite? You don't know shit!

1166
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:37,461
Okay?

1167
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:39,630
You want the truth?

1168
01:37:43,008 --> 01:37:45,386
Dad died 'cause he was
trying to throw that race.

1169
01:37:46,387 --> 01:37:48,097
We were in deep debt.

1170
01:37:48,806 --> 01:37:50,474
'Cause of how
he felt about you,

1171
01:37:51,558 --> 01:37:53,185
he had to ask me
for help.

1172
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,979
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

1173
01:37:57,189 --> 01:37:59,149
A good son would've said no.

1174
01:38:00,776 --> 01:38:02,945
And a real brother
would've come to me.

1175
01:38:03,028 --> 01:38:04,321
Come to you?

1176
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:11,870
He made me promise
you would never find out.

1177
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,873
And through all of it...

1178
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,210
...I kept that promise.

1179
01:38:25,843 --> 01:38:27,094
The girl comes
with me.

1180
01:38:27,594 --> 01:38:28,595
Jakob!

1181
01:38:31,849 --> 01:38:33,267
I will stop you.

1182
01:38:34,476 --> 01:38:35,853
And that's my promise.

1183
01:38:39,898 --> 01:38:41,191
Hey!

1184
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:47,990
Sue. Sue. Ah.

1185
01:38:48,657 --> 01:38:49,992
Come on. Come on.

1186
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:19,730
Down!

1187
01:39:30,115 --> 01:39:31,158
Go! Go!

1188
01:39:31,241 --> 01:39:32,284
Come on!

1189
01:39:42,878 --> 01:39:44,004
This way!

1190
01:40:04,608 --> 01:40:06,109
I'm always here.

1191
01:40:06,652 --> 01:40:07,736
Tell him.

1192
01:40:09,655 --> 01:40:11,573
No!

1193
01:40:13,116 --> 01:40:14,868
No!

1194
01:41:29,276 --> 01:41:31,194
No!

1195
01:41:49,379 --> 01:41:51,048
<i>Dom.</i>

1196
01:41:51,173 --> 01:41:53,216
<i>Tell me what you see, son.</i>

1197
01:42:00,974 --> 01:42:03,185
See, cars like this
are immortal.

1198
01:42:08,941 --> 01:42:11,652
'70 Chargers
are designed so well

1199
01:42:12,027 --> 01:42:13,570
that if you take care
of 'em,

1200
01:42:13,946 --> 01:42:15,739
they'll run for 100 years.

1201
01:42:16,365 --> 01:42:17,741
Immortal?

1202
01:42:20,911 --> 01:42:22,079
Just like a family, Dom.

1203
01:42:23,538 --> 01:42:26,124
Build it right,
you take care of it...

1204
01:42:28,043 --> 01:42:29,419
...it'll live beyond you.

1205
01:42:29,836 --> 01:42:31,046
Daddy.

1206
01:42:39,554 --> 01:42:40,639
Little B.

1207
01:42:41,473 --> 01:42:43,016
When are you coming home?

1208
01:42:43,767 --> 01:42:44,768
Come...

1209
01:43:02,828 --> 01:43:06,456
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

1210
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:50,323
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

1211
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:51,960
- Last two laps.
- On it!

1212
01:43:52,044 --> 01:43:53,587
Get those plug wires!

1213
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,257
Jakob! Now.

1214
01:44:23,325 --> 01:44:24,326
You're good!

1215
01:44:41,885 --> 01:44:44,012
No!

1216
01:45:29,724 --> 01:45:31,393
You came for me, Letty.

1217
01:45:32,185 --> 01:45:36,231
None of it is worth a thing
if I lose you.

1218
01:45:36,982 --> 01:45:38,441
Do you hear me?

1219
01:45:41,236 --> 01:45:42,863
Is this who we are?

1220
01:45:48,702 --> 01:45:49,703
Yeah.

1221
01:45:54,833 --> 01:45:56,543
From here,
things move quickly.

1222
01:45:56,626 --> 01:45:58,253
Jakob has all the pieces
he needs.

1223
01:45:58,336 --> 01:45:59,546
Once he activates Aries,

1224
01:45:59,629 --> 01:46:01,371
all he needs to do
is send the signal global.

1225
01:46:01,381 --> 01:46:03,466
And then there's
no stopping him, ever.

1226
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:05,927
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

1227
01:46:06,011 --> 01:46:07,846
something that'll act
as an amplifier,

1228
01:46:07,929 --> 01:46:10,348
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one.

1229
01:46:10,432 --> 01:46:13,018
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

1230
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:14,561
Our odds are
zero here, Han.

1231
01:46:14,853 --> 01:46:16,730
Satellite equipment
is easy enough to track,

1232
01:46:16,813 --> 01:46:18,493
but we're not gonna
beat Jakob to a launch.

1233
01:46:18,523 --> 01:46:20,192
Which gives us
a two-target problem:

1234
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:22,000
Jakob on the ground...

1235
01:46:22,002 --> 01:46:23,302
With his own private army.

1236
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:25,510
- And the satellite.
- Which can't be hacked.

1237
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:26,781
Not remotely.

1238
01:46:26,865 --> 01:46:27,981
We'd have to do it
physically,

1239
01:46:27,991 --> 01:46:30,994
Fifty miles above ground
while the satellite is in orbit.

1240
01:46:31,494 --> 01:46:32,621
Orbit?

1241
01:46:32,913 --> 01:46:34,080
We need help.

1242
01:46:34,206 --> 01:46:35,999
Otherwise, we have no chance.

1243
01:46:37,209 --> 01:46:38,460
We do it ourselves.

1244
01:46:39,669 --> 01:46:42,047
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

1245
01:46:42,464 --> 01:46:44,341
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1246
01:46:44,799 --> 01:46:46,343
Do y'all not understand?

1247
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:48,470
Clearly, y'all don't.

1248
01:46:48,595 --> 01:46:51,765
Because if you did,
you'd be pissing your pants

1249
01:46:51,848 --> 01:46:52,933
like a normal person.

1250
01:46:53,266 --> 01:46:54,267
Orbit.

1251
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:55,852
That's outer space.

1252
01:46:56,353 --> 01:46:57,896
That's another level.

1253
01:46:58,104 --> 01:47:00,941
What we gonna do?
Hijack a space shuttle?

1254
01:47:01,399 --> 01:47:02,943
Put rockets on our backs?

1255
01:47:04,611 --> 01:47:06,529
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

1256
01:47:07,322 --> 01:47:08,323
What?

1257
01:47:23,088 --> 01:47:25,882
There goes my father's
diplomatic ties with Eastern Europe.

1258
01:47:25,966 --> 01:47:28,885
This place is going to be
crawling with every cop in the city.

1259
01:47:29,552 --> 01:47:31,388
Time to get the hell
out of here.

1260
01:47:52,492 --> 01:47:53,576
Keep her close.

1261
01:48:04,421 --> 01:48:05,839
It's activated.

1262
01:48:09,551 --> 01:48:12,429
As soon as the satellite
reaches orbit, we start the uplink.

1263
01:48:15,932 --> 01:48:17,726
Oh, damn.

1264
01:48:18,518 --> 01:48:19,769
What?

1265
01:48:20,645 --> 01:48:21,980
You see that?

1266
01:48:22,564 --> 01:48:24,482
We can't have
an air leak, man.

1267
01:48:27,777 --> 01:48:30,739
Are you really patching
yourself up with duct tape?

1268
01:48:30,822 --> 01:48:31,865
Yes.

1269
01:48:31,948 --> 01:48:33,231
I don't know if
you've noticed or not,

1270
01:48:33,241 --> 01:48:35,744
but this whole operation
is Band-Aids and duct tape.

1271
01:48:35,827 --> 01:48:37,704
Man, this is insane.

1272
01:48:37,787 --> 01:48:39,706
We are headed
to outer space.

1273
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:42,625
You acting like we on
our way to Home Depot.

1274
01:48:42,751 --> 01:48:44,210
This is ridiculous, man.

1275
01:48:44,294 --> 01:48:47,547
I'm about to abort this whole
mission and take my Black ass home.

1276
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:50,759
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

1277
01:48:50,842 --> 01:48:51,968
Freefall?

1278
01:48:52,052 --> 01:48:53,345
What does that
even mean?

1279
01:48:53,428 --> 01:48:55,930
Roman, it means
numbers don't lie.

1280
01:48:56,222 --> 01:48:58,558
As long as we obey
the laws of physics,

1281
01:48:58,641 --> 01:49:00,560
then we'll be fine, okay?

1282
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:02,729
It's just all
math and science.

1283
01:49:02,812 --> 01:49:05,231
I knew I should've
listened to my teachers.

1284
01:49:05,315 --> 01:49:06,649
Four minutes to launch.

1285
01:49:06,733 --> 01:49:07,901
You fellas good to go?

1286
01:49:09,194 --> 01:49:12,530
Yeah, we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit.

1287
01:49:12,614 --> 01:49:14,157
You know,
that's what Tej do.

1288
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,077
Man, please hurry up so I can
stop hearing his damn mouth.

1289
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,410
- Yes, we're good to go.
- We're not good.

1290
01:49:19,437 --> 01:49:20,647
This is the same car

1291
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:21,856
that we watched

1292
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:23,900
do a test run and explode.

1293
01:49:24,084 --> 01:49:25,377
This is not smart, Tej.

1294
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:26,461
<i>Don't worry, man.</i>

1295
01:49:26,544 --> 01:49:29,130
With my ceramic polymer
coating, you're gonna be just fine.

1296
01:49:29,214 --> 01:49:31,091
You're 100% fireproof.

1297
01:49:32,467 --> 01:49:33,718
Exactly.

1298
01:49:33,802 --> 01:49:35,261
<i>All eight thrusters</i>

1299
01:49:35,345 --> 01:49:36,554
fully functional.

1300
01:49:39,891 --> 01:49:43,019
Hey, please don't tell me you're
still running launch simulations.

1301
01:49:43,144 --> 01:49:45,438
Virgin Galactic launched
at 36,000 feet.

1302
01:49:45,563 --> 01:49:47,774
The space shuttle tests
around 50,000 feet.

1303
01:49:47,857 --> 01:49:50,183
Our last test run with this load
means we'll have to go higher,

1304
01:49:50,193 --> 01:49:51,194
way higher!

1305
01:49:51,277 --> 01:49:52,557
If we don't get them
high enough,

1306
01:49:52,654 --> 01:49:54,906
these guys are
gonna be pancakes at IHOP

1307
01:49:54,989 --> 01:49:56,564
before the coffee
even gets to the table.

1308
01:49:56,574 --> 01:49:58,618
Hey! We can still hear you!

1309
01:49:58,701 --> 01:50:00,787
Don't worry, guys.
We got this.

1310
01:50:01,621 --> 01:50:02,789
We do got this, right?

1311
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:35,238
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

1312
01:50:35,572 --> 01:50:36,813
And I've got a lock
on the Aries signal.

1313
01:50:36,823 --> 01:50:38,223
It's coming from
the beast up ahead.

1314
01:50:38,241 --> 01:50:40,034
We need to get in there
to deactivate it

1315
01:50:40,118 --> 01:50:41,828
by the time Roman
and Tej are in position.

1316
01:50:41,911 --> 01:50:43,997
Ramsey, power us up.

1317
01:50:47,083 --> 01:50:49,002
Satellite is in low orbit.

1318
01:50:51,421 --> 01:50:52,464
Begin.

1319
01:51:08,438 --> 01:51:10,482
All right,
we're passing 50,000 feet!

1320
01:51:10,773 --> 01:51:12,525
Time to get ready, boys.

1321
01:51:12,609 --> 01:51:14,194
What we supposed
to be doing

1322
01:51:14,277 --> 01:51:16,488
with these old-ass suits

1323
01:51:16,571 --> 01:51:18,615
that ain't been used
since World War I?

1324
01:51:18,698 --> 01:51:19,866
Oh, I'm sorry.

1325
01:51:20,074 --> 01:51:23,203
Astronauts R Us
was closed for shopping today.

1326
01:51:23,453 --> 01:51:25,914
Listen, these suits
are just like space suits.

1327
01:51:25,997 --> 01:51:27,916
They both account
for pressure differential.

1328
01:51:27,999 --> 01:51:31,002
Only thing is we may blow
up like balloons just a little bit.

1329
01:51:31,085 --> 01:51:32,629
- That's the only difference.
- What?

1330
01:51:32,712 --> 01:51:34,255
We just hit
the launch altitude.

1331
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:36,716
- You guys ready for a five count?
- <i>No, man!</i>

1332
01:51:36,799 --> 01:51:40,178
I'm barely ready to go scuba
diving in this old-ass thing.

1333
01:51:40,261 --> 01:51:41,721
Don't listen to him.
We ready!

1334
01:51:41,804 --> 01:51:43,139
- "We"?
- Yes, I said "we"!

1335
01:51:43,223 --> 01:51:44,766
I thought you
was invincible.

1336
01:51:44,849 --> 01:51:47,519
Let's see how invincible
your Black ass is after this.

1337
01:51:47,602 --> 01:51:48,978
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

1338
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,984
Oh, my God!
I don't want to die!

1339
01:51:55,318 --> 01:51:56,736
Ignition!

1340
01:52:41,072 --> 01:52:43,700
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1341
01:52:48,079 --> 01:52:49,581
We're in outer space!

1342
01:52:50,873 --> 01:52:52,709
Told you numbers don't lie.

1343
01:52:53,585 --> 01:52:55,670
This is crazy, bro!

1344
01:53:06,973 --> 01:53:09,267
Man, how much candy
did you eat?

1345
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:11,936
Well, I... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

1346
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:14,897
If you shart in this Fiero,
I swear to...

1347
01:53:14,981 --> 01:53:17,525
Really? Really, Tej?

1348
01:53:26,618 --> 01:53:28,578
I thought you said
you took care of this.

1349
01:53:30,163 --> 01:53:31,706
Yeah. Hey.

1350
01:53:32,206 --> 01:53:35,209
You take them back to the
freaking junkyard right now!

1351
01:55:10,847 --> 01:55:12,682
All right, Han, Mia,
you're up!

1352
01:55:26,654 --> 01:55:27,655
Now.

1353
01:55:33,494 --> 01:55:34,662
Letty.

1354
01:55:54,807 --> 01:55:56,142
Han!

1355
01:56:54,116 --> 01:56:55,368
Not all of us.

1356
01:57:09,715 --> 01:57:12,343
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

1357
01:57:13,052 --> 01:57:14,262
There.

1358
01:57:14,345 --> 01:57:15,721
Right there.
You see it?

1359
01:57:16,097 --> 01:57:17,098
Got it.

1360
01:57:17,181 --> 01:57:19,350
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

1361
01:57:19,433 --> 01:57:22,395
Tej, numbers is
what you do, right?

1362
01:57:23,896 --> 01:57:25,606
Driving is what I do.

1363
01:57:32,738 --> 01:57:36,033
Two dudes from the
ghetto, outer space.

1364
01:57:38,119 --> 01:57:40,121
You know ain't nobody
gonna believe us, right?

1365
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,206
You're right.

1366
01:57:50,715 --> 01:57:52,550
Something's wrong
with the satellite array.

1367
01:57:52,633 --> 01:57:54,886
It's interfering
with the uplink.

1368
01:57:57,513 --> 01:57:58,848
I'll handle it.

1369
01:58:17,533 --> 01:58:18,534
Han?

1370
01:58:19,994 --> 01:58:21,203
Grab the wheel.

1371
01:58:21,579 --> 01:58:22,830
Something's up.

1372
01:58:24,665 --> 01:58:26,375
I think I can link
into their feed.

1373
01:58:40,097 --> 01:58:41,497
Something you want
to tell me, Otto?

1374
01:58:41,557 --> 01:58:44,268
My bad. Satellite uplink
is actually going splendid.

1375
01:58:44,769 --> 01:58:47,188
Oh, and, by the way,
I have a new business partner.

1376
01:58:47,271 --> 01:58:48,272
Maybe you know her.

1377
01:58:48,356 --> 01:58:50,650
Guess who's out
of the box, Jakob.

1378
01:58:52,276 --> 01:58:54,070
But I did try to warn you.

1379
01:58:56,822 --> 01:58:58,658
You were never my competition.

1380
01:58:59,283 --> 01:59:00,868
Otto, there's something
you should know.

1381
01:59:00,952 --> 01:59:02,662
Yeah, go on.
Lay it on me, dude.

1382
01:59:02,745 --> 01:59:03,913
You're a spoiled rich prick,

1383
01:59:03,996 --> 01:59:05,164
<i>and I'm gonna kill you.</i>

1384
01:59:05,247 --> 01:59:06,666
Oh, man, I am so sorry.

1385
01:59:06,749 --> 01:59:08,167
No one told you, huh?

1386
01:59:08,626 --> 01:59:12,296
Spoiled rich pricks
run the world.

1387
02:00:37,798 --> 02:00:39,216
Come on. Come on!

1388
02:00:57,735 --> 02:00:58,778
Go.

1389
02:01:38,275 --> 02:01:40,152
What's happening?

1390
02:01:40,236 --> 02:01:43,697
Well, we appear to have lost
our escort and Jakob.

1391
02:01:43,781 --> 02:01:46,659
And, well, Dom is making
things a little bit difficult here,

1392
02:01:46,742 --> 02:01:48,102
but it's fine.
Really, it's peachy.

1393
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:49,120
<i>Don't worry,
don't worry.</i>

1394
02:01:49,203 --> 02:01:50,621
I'll finish this myself.

1395
02:01:55,084 --> 02:01:57,503
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

1396
02:01:58,254 --> 02:01:59,296
You ready, Elle?

1397
02:02:12,726 --> 02:02:14,103
Crank it.

1398
02:02:14,186 --> 02:02:16,021
If we can't break through,
we stop it.

1399
02:02:47,344 --> 02:02:49,096
Guys, that thing
is not slowing down

1400
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:50,890
<i>and the download's
almost done.</i>

1401
02:02:51,015 --> 02:02:53,726
<i>Dom, we don't get out
of here now, we're dead.</i>

1402
02:03:03,652 --> 02:03:06,155
Letty, drop back and
line up with the front tires.

1403
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:07,239
What?

1404
02:03:07,323 --> 02:03:09,408
<i>If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,</i>

1405
02:03:09,491 --> 02:03:11,202
we flip it and we hit
the underside.

1406
02:03:11,285 --> 02:03:13,954
Goddamn it!
Why do I have to say this?

1407
02:03:14,038 --> 02:03:15,497
Flatten these clowns!

1408
02:03:34,308 --> 02:03:35,309
Letty, the wires.

1409
02:03:35,392 --> 02:03:36,393
You read my mind.

1410
02:03:36,477 --> 02:03:37,561
Han, get in front of me.

1411
02:03:39,688 --> 02:03:41,482
Dom, I can't get to you.

1412
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:44,068
<i>But I can.</i>

1413
02:04:59,643 --> 02:05:01,687
All right, the satellite
is in range.

1414
02:05:01,812 --> 02:05:03,731
Let's power up these
magnets and fry it.

1415
02:05:04,148 --> 02:05:05,482
All right, take our time.

1416
02:05:15,743 --> 02:05:17,202
Okay. All right.

1417
02:05:18,871 --> 02:05:19,872
Tej!

1418
02:05:19,955 --> 02:05:21,582
Hold on. Come on, baby.

1419
02:05:21,665 --> 02:05:23,625
Power up. Power up.

1420
02:05:26,128 --> 02:05:27,212
Shit.

1421
02:05:27,296 --> 02:05:28,672
Shit, shit, shit.

1422
02:05:28,756 --> 02:05:31,300
What? Talk to me.
What's going on?

1423
02:05:31,383 --> 02:05:33,664
The pressure of the launch,
it must have jammed the cables

1424
02:05:33,677 --> 02:05:35,095
to the power source.

1425
02:05:35,888 --> 02:05:37,931
Damn it, how did
I not think of that?

1426
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,392
<i>Guys, where are you?</i>

1427
02:05:40,476 --> 02:05:42,936
<i>The upload is almost complete.</i>

1428
02:05:44,396 --> 02:05:46,440
Why don't you just kill it?

1429
02:05:46,732 --> 02:05:48,817
Let's smash it.
Let's run it over, right?

1430
02:05:48,901 --> 02:05:52,279
No. If we crash into that
satellite, we'll probably die.

1431
02:05:52,363 --> 02:05:55,282
And even if we don't, the fuel
that it would take to smash it,

1432
02:05:55,908 --> 02:05:57,493
we'd be stuck
out here forever.

1433
02:05:58,744 --> 02:06:00,245
You got to have faith, bro.

1434
02:06:00,329 --> 02:06:02,790
Faith? Faith is not numbers.

1435
02:06:03,123 --> 02:06:04,625
You know what, Tej?

1436
02:06:06,126 --> 02:06:07,461
You're probably right.

1437
02:06:10,422 --> 02:06:11,632
<i>We're not invincible.</i>

1438
02:06:14,802 --> 02:06:18,055
<i>We probably just been
lucky this whole time.</i>

1439
02:06:23,811 --> 02:06:25,312
<i>This might be it.</i>

1440
02:06:28,232 --> 02:06:29,566
<i>But you know what?</i>

1441
02:06:31,193 --> 02:06:32,569
<i>If we're gonna go out...</i>

1442
02:06:34,488 --> 02:06:36,407
...let's go out
on top of the world.

1443
02:06:37,783 --> 02:06:39,785
<i>Guys,
what's happening up there?</i>

1444
02:06:39,868 --> 02:06:41,537
We've got seconds left.

1445
02:06:44,456 --> 02:06:45,541
Let's do it.

1446
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:47,167
Let's go.

1447
02:06:51,547 --> 02:06:54,758
Five, four, three,

1448
02:06:54,842 --> 02:06:56,552
two, one.

1449
02:07:15,696 --> 02:07:16,822
We did it.

1450
02:07:18,073 --> 02:07:19,283
We did it!

1451
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:20,451
Let's go.

1452
02:07:20,534 --> 02:07:21,785
Yes!

1453
02:07:22,453 --> 02:07:23,495
Shit.

1454
02:07:23,579 --> 02:07:25,038
Not bad, man.

1455
02:07:25,622 --> 02:07:26,457
Not bad at all.

1456
02:07:52,232 --> 02:07:53,525
Hold on!

1457
02:08:02,326 --> 02:08:03,493
Dom!

1458
02:08:59,925 --> 02:09:00,926
Yes!

1459
02:09:07,516 --> 02:09:09,017
Got to be kidding me.

1460
02:09:45,137 --> 02:09:46,138
Shit!

1461
02:10:38,357 --> 02:10:40,233
Think these
belong to you.

1462
02:10:50,285 --> 02:10:52,913
There's gonna be a lot of
people coming after you, Jake.

1463
02:10:53,413 --> 02:10:54,623
Yeah.

1464
02:10:55,624 --> 02:10:56,875
This is the world
I chose, Dom.

1465
02:10:58,794 --> 02:11:00,712
You know,
Dad wasn't perfect.

1466
02:11:02,339 --> 02:11:04,257
But he loved us
all the same.

1467
02:11:08,011 --> 02:11:10,806
Someone once gave me
a ten-second car,

1468
02:11:12,057 --> 02:11:13,392
as a second chance.

1469
02:11:15,268 --> 02:11:17,354
I owe you that,
little brother.

1470
02:11:30,826 --> 02:11:32,285
I lost you once.

1471
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:35,247
Don't let that
happen again, okay?

1472
02:12:17,038 --> 02:12:18,665
We come in peace!

1473
02:12:19,332 --> 02:12:20,542
Hey!

1474
02:12:48,945 --> 02:12:51,490
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

1475
02:12:53,783 --> 02:12:55,035
This is where he raced.

1476
02:12:55,577 --> 02:12:57,537
Did you race here, too, Daddy?

1477
02:12:57,871 --> 02:12:58,955
No.

1478
02:12:59,372 --> 02:13:00,957
But I'll tell you something.

1479
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:06,796
Everything I needed to know
about life, I learned on this track.

1480
02:13:07,088 --> 02:13:08,089
You did?

1481
02:13:09,090 --> 02:13:10,175
I did.

1482
02:13:53,802 --> 02:13:55,720
It's all gonna
be okay, Jakob.

1483
02:13:59,808 --> 02:14:01,851
We got some
rough times ahead...

1484
02:14:04,312 --> 02:14:06,189
...but it's gonna be okay.

1485
02:14:08,567 --> 02:14:09,985
'Cause we're family.

1486
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:37,262
- Fellas.
- Hey.

1487
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:45,061
What?

1488
02:14:45,729 --> 02:14:47,147
No way.

1489
02:14:57,407 --> 02:14:59,618
What's going on?

1490
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:04,497
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

1491
02:15:09,127 --> 02:15:10,545
It's a long story.

1492
02:15:11,671 --> 02:15:13,923
But, for now, let's just
enjoy the moment, huh?

1493
02:15:15,091 --> 02:15:16,217
Guys, this is Elle.

1494
02:15:16,426 --> 02:15:18,219
Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

1495
02:15:19,638 --> 02:15:20,639
Just call me T.

1496
02:15:20,722 --> 02:15:22,015
- I'm Earl.
- Nice to meet you.

1497
02:15:23,850 --> 02:15:24,934
Mia.

1498
02:15:28,772 --> 02:15:30,523
Hi. Nice to finally
meet you.

1499
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:41,400
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1500
02:15:42,369 --> 02:15:44,204
How much longer
on this food?

1501
02:15:44,621 --> 02:15:46,873
Like, I'm...
I'm ready to eat now.

1502
02:15:47,165 --> 02:15:49,626
I've been eating
space food for weeks.

1503
02:15:49,918 --> 02:15:52,754
Oh, so Tootsie Rolls
are space food?

1504
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:54,172
'Cause that's all
you ate.

1505
02:15:54,422 --> 02:15:55,924
It was fat free, bruh.

1506
02:15:56,007 --> 02:15:57,550
Snickers and Twix
fat free, too?

1507
02:15:57,634 --> 02:15:58,734
I'm forehead hungry.

1508
02:15:58,785 --> 02:15:59,995
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you later.

1509
02:16:00,011 --> 02:16:01,091
Your forehead
is overweight.

1510
02:16:04,474 --> 02:16:06,351
You drive just
like your dad.

1511
02:16:07,394 --> 02:16:08,395
I do?

1512
02:16:08,478 --> 02:16:09,562
Mm-hmm.

1513
02:16:10,563 --> 02:16:12,190
Do you know, this is...

1514
02:16:12,941 --> 02:16:15,360
This is where I met your
mom for the first time.

1515
02:16:15,694 --> 02:16:16,736
Right there.

1516
02:16:16,986 --> 02:16:18,780
She's watching over you
from heaven.

1517
02:16:19,072 --> 02:16:20,073
She is?

1518
02:16:20,156 --> 02:16:21,241
Mm-hmm.

1519
02:16:24,119 --> 02:16:26,246
I think Daddy
has a question for you.

1520
02:16:30,792 --> 02:16:32,669
You ready to say grace, kid?

1521
02:16:33,294 --> 02:16:35,088
But I don't know what to say.

1522
02:16:36,297 --> 02:16:37,507
Oh, it's easy.

1523
02:16:38,425 --> 02:16:40,427
Just say whatever is
in your heart.

1524
02:16:41,219 --> 02:16:42,637
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1525
02:16:42,721 --> 02:16:43,805
Come on.

1526
02:16:49,861 --> 02:16:50,904
Hey, guys.

1527
02:16:50,929 --> 02:16:52,299
Hey.

1528
02:16:53,365 --> 02:16:55,825
Little Brian's ready
to say grace with us.

1529
02:16:55,951 --> 02:16:57,369
- Uh-huh.
- Nice.

1530
02:16:58,111 --> 02:16:59,487
Now, hold on.

1531
02:17:00,655 --> 02:17:02,198
There's still an empty chair.

1532
02:17:03,158 --> 02:17:04,159
He's on the way.

Thank you.

1578
02:20:05,423 --> 02:20:06,591
Please.

1579
02:20:06,716 --> 02:20:09,469
I tell you where the drive
is, the plans we stole.

1580
02:20:09,552 --> 02:20:10,803
I tell you
where it is.

1581
02:20:10,887 --> 02:20:11,888
You mean this drive?

1582
02:20:13,139 --> 02:20:14,307
These plans?

1583
02:20:16,351 --> 02:20:18,102
But you already got it.

1584
02:20:18,186 --> 02:20:19,437
Yes, mate.

1585
02:20:20,063 --> 02:20:22,315
How else do you think
I stay in this good a shape?

1586
02:20:28,112 --> 02:20:29,697
