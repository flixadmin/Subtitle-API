[Zari] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,430
Astra. This place, it's twisted you.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,000
It's made me more like you.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,393
When you took on the wand's power,
you also took on its charge.

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,800
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,958
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from Hell.

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,355
Gary, you dick.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,193
I have created a simple app.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
What kind of egg is that?

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,636
[Gideon] It's a dragon egg.

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,120
My name is Zari.

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Ask Rory.

Ah. Ogre wins again.

Hey, fellas!

28
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,159
Sorry to break up all the fun,

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,152
but, uh, technically,
I wasn't supposed to allow

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,471
any magical creatures
out of the lab, so...

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,630
[growls]

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,600
On second thought,
why don't you two finish up here,

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,757
and I'll go, uh,
track down the Minotaur?

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,155
[slow music playing]

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,997
You're not a horrible mother.
You just had a lot on your mind.

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,198
I left our dragon egg in the care
of nine-year-old me.

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,113
[Agent Sharpe] Has anybody seen Gary?

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,429
Wait, what did you just say?

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,670
I was distracted.

40
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,456
I just found out the EYES app
is stealing people's souls,

41
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,711
and then baby me comes home and I...

42
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,712
You two need to grab that egg
before it hatches.

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,000
We can't risk Ne-Ray getting his hands
on a baby dragon.

44
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,736
It's already bad enough
that he has Charlie.

45
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,160
- Okay.
- Fair.

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,350
Get up. Time's a-wasting.

47
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,319
There are souls just waiting to be sold.

48
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,880
You're off your rocker, you old nag.

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,910
This here shapeshifter
don't take requests.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,232
Shapeshifter?
Is that all you think you are?

51
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,117
You may have
your human friends fooled, dearie,

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,989
but you and I both know
what you're truly capable of.

53
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,560
- You don't know me!
- Don't I?

54
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,597
This shape you're wearing,
though lovely, is a costume.

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,956
It's not who you really are.

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,960
You aren't meant to hide, my pet.

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,398
You are meant to show humans
their greatest fears.

58
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,153
And lucky for you,

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,790
helping monsters
fulfill their potential...

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,397
is what I do.

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,270
[Nora screaming]

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Yes.

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,676
[grunts]

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,035
Damn it, Gary.

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Oh.

66
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:51,839
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me...

67
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,317
Hi, pardon me, I just...
I don't belong here.

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,232
No, and I'm...

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,757
I'm a Fairy Godmother
sent to find John Constantine!

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
Really?

71
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,873
What, are the King and Queen of Hell
making their grand debut?

72
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,917
Not our debut, dearie.

73
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,073
No, no, no.

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,277
Stop! What are you doing?

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,273
As much as I'd like to pontificate
about my grander plan...

76
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,314
I've taught him better than that.

77
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,675
[screaming]

78
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Ah.

79
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,669
Who the hell are you?

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,240
Really? The dress doesn't sell it?

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,176
You didn't tell me
you had a Fairy Godmother, John.

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,873
Not his. Gary's.

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,856
[grunts] And I thought
I was the one being tortured.

84
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,314
[Calibraxis] Look, princess.

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,629
We got rules here in Hell.

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,154
All right, you can't just...

87
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
[Nora] Let's go.

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,670
What are you doing?

89
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,558
Going to find Ray
the same way I found you.

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,916
The only difference is,
Ray doesn't have a body.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,878
So, let's go find his soul.

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,189
His soul token.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,117
That's the currency in Hell.

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,714
While his soul is being tortured,

95
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,474
then his token is traded around town
like money.

96
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,710
As long as you have it,

97
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,598
then you'll always
have access to the soul.

98
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,720
[groans]

99
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,393
But since Neron is still topside,

100
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,958
then his token's likely locked
in his vault.

101
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,191
Then let's go find it.

102
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,394
Why isn't this working?

103
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm sorry, love, you can't just go

104
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
poofing yourself
into the vaults of Hell.

105
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,836
We'll have to find someone
to help us break in.

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,834
And I think I know just the person.

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,520
[Nate] I don't see her.

108
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,797
[Zari] How do you know
what nine-year-old me looks like?

109
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,512
I'm just looking for
the coolest kid in school.

110
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,519
Yeah, there's a lot I haven't told you
about my childhood.

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,476
There. That's the spot where
kids used to gang up on me and say,

112
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,274
"Zari, Zari,
why are your clothes so sorry?"

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Bah.

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,076
I would have said,
"Zari, Zari, you smell like calamari."

115
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,352
Bullying is bad. It's...

116
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,160
All right, let's break this up
and find out where I stashed the egg.

117
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,355
- [boy 1] He's so cool.
- [boy 2] Aw. Look how cute he is.

118
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,035
- [girl 1] I want a dragon.
- [girl 2] He's so adorable.

119
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,720
[girl 1] I wanna take him home with me.

120
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,790
Oh, my God. He hatched.

121
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,520
And I brought him to school.

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
- Okay, so, we gotta get him before...
- Wait, wait, wait, look.

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,914
Mithra, dance.

124
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,470
[chittering]

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,480
[sneezes]

126
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,675
[kids cheering]

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,439
- [girl 3] Awesome, Zari.
- Thank you.

128
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Mmm.

129
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,270
Come on.

130
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,872
What's going on, children?

131
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,000
It's okay. He's my pet, Mithra.
I named him after the...

132
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,515
Run, children! It's a monster.

133
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,159
[children screaming]

134
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,352
Wait, Zari, Zari. Wait! Wait.

135
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,516
Don't hurt him!

136
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Hmph.

137
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,519
Oh, my God, I lost him again.

138
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,830
[Gideon] Captain, I've located Neron.

139
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,311
[newsreader] <i>Now, live to Capitol Hill,
where the Palmer ex-CEO</i>

140
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,136
<i>is testifying before
the Senate subcommittee.</i>

141
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,391
[Ne-Ray] <i>Look, I know

that it's up to the private sector

unprecedented crisis.

144
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,072
But I should mention, not a single one
of my subscribers has been harmed

Senator, do you care to respond?

147
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,432
This bloke is just trying to scare folks

148
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,274
into downloading his evil,
soul-sucking app.

149
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,673
There ain't no such thing as...

This isn't me!

- [woman] Senator!
- I'm not doing this!

152
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,838
Like I said,
they could be hiding anywhere.

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,912
And only you can stop them.

154
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,549
Wait. He might be Charlie.

155
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,756
Who am I supposed to shoot?

[Mick] Come on.

162
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,394
Let her go. She's served her purpose.

163

[rock music playing]

164
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,673
Astra Logue.

165
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,673
The name's Neron.
I hear good things about you.

166
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,070
Now, that I'm taking over
for your former employers, I...

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,879
Give it a rest, John.

168
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,714
You think I can't see through
your cheap little parlor trick?

169
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,680
How'd you get out of
the torture pits, anyway?

170
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Nice sparkles.

171
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,240
Nice shoulder pads.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,275
What do you want, John?

173
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,920
And please tell me you're not here
to make some sad, sappy plea

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,559
for me to remember who I really am.

175
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,280
I know exactly who you are.

176
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,874
You're someone I can work with.

177
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,556
The triumvirate, they were
too short-sighted to take my deal,

178
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,717
and now,
they are roasting rats for supper.

179
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,280
But you're smarter than that, Astra.

180
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,514
All I need is access to one measly soul,

181
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,640
and in exchange, I'll go kill Neron,
and your boys will be back on top.

182
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,194
So, this soul you're after...

183
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,514
Must be pretty special.

184
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
He is.

185
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,672
I was special to you too, John.

186
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,430
Once.

187
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,513
And yet you left me down here
to rot all those years.

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,557
- Astra, you can't just...
- I'm over it.

189
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,551
I made the best of a bad situation,
and guess what?

190
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,710
I flourished.

191
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,996
Down here, I had prospects.

192
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,675
Until Neron wiped his ass with them.

193
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,439
So, do we have a deal?

194
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,114
Let's go rob the King.

195
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,856
[news reporter]
<i>Today's attack at the US Capitol</i>

196
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,271
<i>has sparked worldwide panic and paranoia
over the threat of magical creatures.</i>

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,198
Enough, Gideon.

198
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,549
Where is Neron in all this?

199
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,776
Why isn't he responding
to his magical creature alerts?

200
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,190
What alerts? All the creatures
are here on the ship.

201
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,736
You know what? It doesn't even matter.

202
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,696
Neron's shown the world
that anyone can be a monster.

203
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,880
People are turning on each other,
everyone's terrified.

204
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,416
I thought Neron wanted to collect souls.

205
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,016
How does hacking the app,
only to let it fail,

206
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,394
get him what he wants?

207
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,119
[Charlie] It's not about souls anymore.

208
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,475
It's something worse.

209
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,233
They didn't share their endgame,

210
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,640
but from what I could figure out,

211
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,136
they don't give a fart
about ruling Hell.

212
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,595
- It's actually fear that they're after.
- Why?

213
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,791
Fear is power. It's energy.

214
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,800
And thanks to me, they have
a wallop of it to muck about with.

215
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,395
[Gideon] That might explain
the strange meteorological event

Right above the Time Bureau.

Oh, calm down, Gary.

253
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,270
The longer we keep
the magical creatures locked up,

254
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,636
the more
they're gonna act like actual monsters.

They are monsters, you twit.

And so are you. We all are.

257

How are we supposed
to defeat fear itself?

258
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,639
I mean, people afraid of metas,

Monsters hated by everyone.

Yeah, this innocent moment
where kids aren't afraid,

270
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,757
it's resonating with people.

271
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,520
They don't see a monster,
they see something amazing.

272
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
So do I.

273
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Me on that playground,

274
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,797
surrounded by people
who wanna be my friend.

275
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,075
Even if it was just for a day,

276
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,436
that little baby dragon
changed my world.

277
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
You sound like my dad's pitch for...

278
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,280
Heyworld!

Oh, my God, guys, that's it.

What... What's... What?

281
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,038
My dad had a dream to build a theme park

282
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
that people would come to see
because of magic.

283
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,216
That's what the world needs right now.

284
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,551
A place for people to come and see
the wonder of these creatures in person.

285
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,757
What, so, they can
just shoot us all in one place?

286
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,056
Yeah, that's bloody brilliant, that.

287
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,720
No, so, they can see creatures

288
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,918
the way that you helped us
see creatures, Charlie.

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,313
Not as monsters, but as misfits
just trying to find their place.

290
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Look, if we can learn that lesson,
then so can the rest of the world.

291
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,157
We just need to bring people
and creatures together.

292
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,110
Think of it like a magical version
of Woodstock.

293
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,719
If we build it...

294
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,234
- [snaps fingers]
- They will come.

295
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,835
How long until
we can get it up and running?

296
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,709
Uh, if Mikey T and the boys
work weekends, quick math in my head,

297
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,269
two, maybe three years.

298
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Oh.

299
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,751
- He's not a coin.
- Observant.

300
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,832
No flesh bags, just souls.

301
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,592
That's why they call it
the Soul Exchange.

302
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,115
All right, then.
I'll be on me way, then.

303
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,238
This is John Constantine.

304
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,480
Oh.

305
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:31,473
And me without my autograph book.

306
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,520
No worries, love. Next time, yeah?
[clicks tongue]

307
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,519
Look, if you would like
to convert his soul into cash, you...

308
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,273
Maybe you don't get it.

309
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,955
Neron owns the marker on his soul.

310
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,357
And Neron wants to torture him
as soon as he gets here.

311
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,359
But, hey,
if you want to tell the new boss

312
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,911
why his prize victim
isn't waiting in his vault...

313
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
This way.

314
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Not so rough.

315
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,554
FYI, there's no bathroom in here,
and I'm not feeding him.

316
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,597
I'm a bank teller, not a zoo...
[grunts]

317
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,791
Pretty cool for a grown woman
wearing taffeta and a tiara.

318
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,599
How does this work?

319
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,796
We find a coin?

320
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,200
There are thousands.

321
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,758
Some of history's worst.

322
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,514
[Constantine] Yeah, I'd wager
he's keeping it somewhere special.

323
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,478
Hey, what are you doing?

324
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,155
What? Revolution's in the air.

325
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,038
I've got to look out for number one.

326
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,716
You were a golden opportunity
to bank roll my future.

327
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
I took it.

328
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,798
What about Brigid's diary?

329
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,317
If we put it in Nate's hands,
he could just dream us up a theme park.

330
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,517
Z! You are a genius!

331
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,516
Oh. It's in the Time Bureau.

332
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,557
It's okay. So, we just break in.

333
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,240
But it's not gonna be easy.
Even if it isn't demon central,

334
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,736
the vault that it's being held in
is practically impenetrable.

335
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,955
Oh, it's penetrable.

336
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,353
Oh, my God!

337
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,280
- I love you, Rory.
- Mmm-hmm.

338
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Give it back when you're done.

339
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:08,197
Buck and Garima's sexual odyssey
is far from over.

340
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,313
All right, team. Nate,
you have a theme park to dream up.

341
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,551
Gary, help Mona
<i>Pretty Woman</i> our creatures

342
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,176
into something
a little more kid-friendly.

343
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
And the rest of us...

344
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,238
It's time to come up
with a marketing plan

345
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,233
for the happiest place on the planet.

346
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,516
[Gideon] Ms. Tomaz,
your simulation program

347
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,520
has detected a change

348
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,353
in your presently predicted future.

349
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,760
A good change or bad change?

350
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,559
In one potential 2042,

351
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,390
building Heyworld leads to an era
of understanding and tolerance.

352
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,598
The Anti-Meta-Human Act of 2029
never passes,

353
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,400
your parents live out their lives
peacefully in Seattle.

354
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,672
The future, as you know it,
would be completely changed.

355
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,440
My parents... Behrad...

356
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,160
That means a piece of this crazy plan
actually works.

357
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,594
This is great news, right?

358
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,110
God, I have been running
that stupid program for so long,

359
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,590
I had given up hope
of it actually working.

360
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,198
If this works, my brother survives,

361
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,190
I never steal his totem back from ARGUS,
I never join the Legends.

362
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,437
The last two years
wouldn't have happened.

363
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,474
Who knows where I'll be or who I'll be?

364
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,194
[Sara] You'll be you.

365
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,955
Because while we're at Heyworld,
you'll be here on the ship,

366
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,874
in the temporal zone,
and you'll be safe.

367
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,031
Sara, I can't, I can't sit this one out.

368
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,629
Look, I'm not gonna lose another Legend.

369
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,110
And who said
we're not putting you to work?

370
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,637
Look, we need to make sure what happens
at Heyworld is seen globally.

371
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,839
I can use the EYES app as a backdoor
into the phones that downloaded it.

372
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,877
- Thank you.
- [inaudible]

373
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,754
I found it. I found it. Ray's coin.

374
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,431
So long, then, John Boy. For now.

375
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,749
Oh, hold on a minute.

376
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,560
Our deal was for his soul,
not a bleeding coin.

377
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,234
Fine. A promise is a promise.

378
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,114
[Ray screaming]

379
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,496
What are they doing to him in there?

380
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,749
Prepare yourself, love.

381
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,877
What's behind this door,
it won't be pretty.

382
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,518
Down here, they twist a man's soul
until he's no longer human.

383
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,056
After what they've done to the big man,
he might not even be...

384
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,515
- [Ray] No!
- Ray! Ray!

385
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,395
Nora! John!

386
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,600
We're just about to start another game
of giant Jenga.

387
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,736
You gotta meet my old friend.

388
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,559
Well, technically, my new friend.
We used to be mortal enemies.

389
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,077
Oh, hi, guys.
You're just in time for the next round.

390
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,877
[Sara] <i>When the world
needs heroes, they answer the call.</i>

391
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,519
We'll be at Heyworld,

392
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,991
the new adventure capital
of Eastern Maryland.

393
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,434
Where we will hit fun...

394
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,036
in the bull's-eye.

395
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,759
And we'll give your children a...

396
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,639
flash of excitement.

397
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,918
And... cut!

398
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,536
- That was good, guys.
- That was a good take.

399
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,517
- Yeah.
- That was a great take.

400
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Uh, guys, I feel like

401
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,896
that would have worked
a little bit better

402
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,559
with the real trinity.

403
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,077
Yeah, well, I asked,
and they said, "Hard pass."

404
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,776
- We should have done the crossover.
- Yeah.

405
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,272
Who needs the trinity anyway, right?
I mean, the Legends are super enough!

406
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,238
But Heyworld isn't a superhero park.

407
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,551
Promising them something
and giving them something else

408
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,472
feels wrong, doesn't it?

409
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,031
People aren't going to go to a park
filled with things they're terrified of.

410
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,080
People need franchise superheroes
to feel safe,

411
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,040
so, that's how we're gonna
get them in the door.

412
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,591
- [creatures growling]
- [Mona] Okay, everyone,

413
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,037
let's just go around the room one by one

414
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,511
and say what talent you can contribute
to the Heyworld review.

415
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,591
Oh, Minotaur, let's start with you.

416
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,558
I hear you like guitar.

417
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,518
Don't tell her nothin', Bullface.

418
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,638
- [Ogre] Let us out of here.
- We can't do that, Mr. Ogre.

419
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,154
It's not safe out there.

420
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,754
Well, we ain't helping you,

421
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,311
what with you moving us around
from one prison to another.

422
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,710
So, why should we trust you?

423
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,474
Listen up, if you lot don't want
to go back to a real prison,

424
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
then this is your chance.

425
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,120
This is your chance to change the way
that humans see you.

426
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,955
Show them that
just because you look scary...

427
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,960
doesn't mean you are scary.

428
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,997
[Charlie] That's right, Wolfie.

429
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,879
Look, I know how infuriating
humans can be.

430
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,759
They have a hard time seeing past
their own noses, don't they?

431
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,719
But they can change.

432
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,439
If you help them to look deeper.

433
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,358
And if they see the amount of good
that you lot are capable of,

434
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,559
then maybe, maybe they'll believe in you
even when you doubt yourself.

435
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
[purrs]

436
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,432
Now, I know there's more to all of you
than meets the eye.

437
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,914
Like you, Ogre.

438
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,238
My name is Frederick.
But what's the point?

439
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,677
Every time I try
to show a human who I really am,

440
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,274
they run away or try to kill me.

441
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,960
And that must really hurt your feelings.

442
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,035
Yeah, it does.
All I ever wanted to do was sing.

443
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
[grunts]

444
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,032
It looks like
we found ourselves a double act.

445
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,839
Now, who else has a hidden talent?

446
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,111
Brilliant. Beautiful.

447
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,799
I think we've got ourselves a show.

448
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,216
[Ray] Wait. What are you doing here?

449
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,311
Are you dead?
Oh, please tell me you're not dead.

450
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,000
What are you doing in that dress?
Not that I don't like it, but...

451
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Wow.

452
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Idiot!

453
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,995
What were you thinking,
selling your soul to a demon? Ray?

454
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,311
- I...
- You doomed the whole planet.

455
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,536
Look, I didn't have a choice.

456
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,600
He was going to kill Nate.

457
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,456
And it was the only way I could
make sure my best friend would be safe.

458
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,631
So, that was the deal you made.

459
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
His life for your body.

460
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,791
Oh, Raymond, you sweet,
dumb, son-of-a-softie.

461
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,951
Yeah, right? What a guy.

462
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,800
I was sent here to torture him,
but then we got to talking.

463
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,552
Oh, it got really deep, man.

464
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,676
It really did.

465
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,278
What were we even fighting about
all those years ago?

466
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,432
Your compulsion for world domination
and inability to accept rejection.

467
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
[Vandal] Ah.

468
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,754
Translation, it was about a girl.

469
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,030
A girl? What girl?

470
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,395
Doesn't matter. We should go.

471
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,834
Wait.

472
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Something's happening.

473
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,951
I think I fulfilled Gary's wish.
Ray, take my hand. John.

474
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,998
Oh, all right. Ciao for now.

475
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,751
Say hi to the Legends for me, will you?

476
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,430
Oh, I love those groovy guys.

477
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,909
Jenga time!

478
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,354
[laughing]

479
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,560
Oh.

480
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:14,793
Almost forgot, extra hot sauce
for the Chupacabra.

481
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
[bottle shatters]

482
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
What in the hell?

483
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,720
More like, out of it, mate.

484
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,395
- It worked! You got Constantine.
- All right.

485
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,915
- Okay, just be cool. Simmer down.
- Okay.

486
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Where's Ray?

487
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,480
He was just here, he...

488
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,635
Yeah, that's the only way he can travel
as long as Neron's using his body.

489
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,278
Fairy Godmother, I wish for Ray
to get his body back.

490
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,598
All magic has its limitations, you know,

491
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,320
stroke of midnight and all that,
but don't worry.

492
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,631
I'm sure the Legends have
something up their sleeves.

493
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,519
This isn't playtime, you twits.

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,232
Neron is using fear
to open up the gates of Hell.

495
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,576
Well, that's why we have to fight fear
with something wonderful.

496
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,520
We have to show the world

497
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,671
that these magical creatures
are just that.

498
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,680
They're magical.

499
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,353
And everyone else is
on board with this?

500
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,749
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Pretty much.

501
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,136
- Bloody hell.
- [Sara] All right. Great.

502
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,231
Now, that you're all on board,
we have work to do.

503
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,714
There is another way.

504
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,519
Whilst in Hell, we learnt that

505
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,873
Neron's possession of Ray's body
is contingent on Nate not being killed.

506
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,829
Is that why Ne-Ray didn't strangle me
when he had the chance?

507
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah.

508
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,601
That demon is only as good as his word.

509
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,816
If Neron breaks that deal,
he'd be ejected from Ray's body.

510
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
I could kill him.

511
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,630
And once I do,

512
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,474
all the souls he's nabbed
will be released.

513
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,676
And all Neron has to do is...

514
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
[clicks tongue]

515
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:42,881
me?

516
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,033
No. Absolutely not.
Look, there is no plan B.

517
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,157
Only plan A. Got it?

518
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,396
Yeah. Got it.
[clears throat]

519
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,156
Look, I meant what I said earlier.
I am not losing another Legend.

520
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,190
So, forget what you heard back there
because we are all in on Heyworld.

521
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,030
Now, I believe in you.

522
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,190
And if I'm not mistaken,

523
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,034
someone has a theme park to build.

524
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Yeah.

525
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
[sighs]

526
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,114
I can't believe
it all comes down to this.

527
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,311
After years of anxiety of whether or not

528
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,279
I could live up
to my dad's expectations.

529
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,397
I'm about to
bring his crazy dream to life.

530
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,278
Knowing what it could cost me.

531
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,033
Nate, I'm not going anywhere.

532
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
You got this.

533
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,796
[inhales deeply]

534
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Okay.

535
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,592
Let's do this.

536
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,754
I'm standing in front of Heyworld,
a new superhero-inspired theme park

537
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,878
that seems to have sprung up overnight,
like magic.

538
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,877
Welcome to Heyworld,
the happiest place on the globe.

539
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,350
Hey, kid, welcome to Heyworld.
Try the churros.

540
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,955
And not just because
the real money is in the concessions.

541
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,110
They're also delicious.

542
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,918
Z, um, you and your mom are here.

543
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,435
I see them. I mean, us.

544
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,876
All right, stream's up.
You look great, by the way.

545
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,031
Ah, thank you for noticing, I showered.

546
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,680
How's the clickety-clackety-hackety
coming along?

547
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,160
Once Ava hits record,

548
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,120
this will stream out to about,
you know, three billion people or so.

549
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
No pressure.

550
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,470
Come one, come all,
to our thrilling stage spectacular,

551
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,840
superheroes versus monsters.

552
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,116
Okay. You got the choreography down?

553
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,715
Everyone, follow her lead. Uh...

554
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,314
Oh, Baba Yaga, remember,

555
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,393
those kids are audience members,
not appetizers.

556
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,995
Mike, watch your language out there.
All right?

557
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,456
We don't want those gormless wankers

558
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,597
from standards and practices
up our you-know-whats.

559
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,150
Everyone, they're gonna love you guys.

560
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,074
All right, gang. It's showtime.

561
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
[growling]

562
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,470
[cheering]

563
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,519
Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't call them heroes,

564
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,193
call them Legends.

565
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,278
Now, let's see what derring-do
the Legends of Tomorrow get into today.

566
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,760
[applause and cheering]

567
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,229
[both grunting]

568
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,959
And that'll teach those bad guys
that crime doesn't pay.

569
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,475
<i>Thanks for the assist, Green Arrow!</i>

570
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,438
<i>See you later, Supergirl.</i>

571
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,954
Whoa. Did you see that?

572
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,475
That's The Flash,
and he wants to hang out.

573
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,199
Should we go hang out?

574
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,350
[cheering]

575
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,200
Break a leg, guys.

576
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,189
Wait a second! Shh.

577
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,637
I think that I hear something.

578
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
[Nate] Monsters!

579
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,760
What do you think, White Canary?
Should we show 'em what we got?

580
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,513
Wait. Hold on.

581
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,594
What if, instead of showing 'em
what we got,

582
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,152
we ask them what they have?

583
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,276
Hmm?

584
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,949
You mean, get to know them?

585
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,240
What if, getting to know them,
we realize that we have nothing to fear?

586
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,119
[Nate] Minotaur, your passion is music.

587
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,840
Why don't you show us what you got?

588
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
[booing]

589
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,680
They said this was a superhero show.

590
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,558
These brats don't respect art.

591
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,509
Hey, hey, I think we're losing them.

592
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,919
[roaring]

593
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
What was that?

594
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,400
[audience exclaiming]

595
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,515
[footsteps thumping]

596
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,600
Bloody hell. I know that sound.

597
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,520
[screeching]

598
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,640
Finally, a real life dragon.

599
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,115
[roars]

600
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,595
Oh, no, is that...

601
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Wicksty?

602
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,478
Now, this is a show!

603
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,032
You really thought you could stop us?

604
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,115
These fools you brought here
will only serve our hellish end.

605
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,272
Everyone remain calm!

606
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,398
This is all just a, a part of the show.

607
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,714
[roars]

608
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
[groans]

609
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,117
Damn it, Gary. Now, I'm powerless.

610
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,798
Enough, filling your heads
with this silly, little morality play.

611
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,511
Now, all of you will bear witness
to the birth of a new era.

612
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,790
She wants these people scared.
They'll open up the portal right here.

613

[audience screaming]

614
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,876
This way.

615
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,189
Go, go!

616
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,680
We gotta get that staff.

617
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,960
We gotta get these kids out of here. Go!

618
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Follow them!

619
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,200
[roars]

620
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,237
Everybody go back inside, back inside!

It's all right. It's all right.

625
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,033
Burn her! Burn them all!

626
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
[young Zari] Stop!

627
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Stop.

628
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,474
Burn the child!

629
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,279
Do it, now!

630
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,599
Kid, you gotta run.

631
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,514

Rise!

It's gonna take
more than a musical number to stop this.

Neron!

This fight is between me and you.

00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,315
So, let's settle it once and for all.

Killing you is just a bonus.

You might take me, Neron,

649
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,151
but the Legends will always win.

[Gideon] I must advise
against that course of action.

Hello, Nate.

I missed you so much, Dad.

It sure does.

Believe me,
I went through all the emotions.

I mean, uh, anger, worry, uh...

In you, Nate.

698
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,232
And I was right to believe
that my boy and all his freaky buddies

would see this thing through.
