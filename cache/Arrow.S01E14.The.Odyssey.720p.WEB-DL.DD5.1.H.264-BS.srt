1
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:03,361
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,393 --> 00:00:06,510
For 5 years I was stranded on
an island with only one goal--

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,579
Survive.

4
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:11,115
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:13,734
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:16,087
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:18,923
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:22,126
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:25,797
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:27,298
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,550
Slade Wilson.
There's an airfield

12
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:31,919
10 clicks from here.
It's key off this island.

13
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,310
I think Yao Fei sent you

14
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,480
because he knows I cannot
take the airstrip alone.

15
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:38,976
You bugged my mother?
Just listen.

16
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:41,628
I made it clear
to him persuasively

17
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,848
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,466
What are you going to do?

19
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:48,319
I need to have another chat
with my mom.

20
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:52,656
And I'll need the Unidac merger
finalized by the end of the week.

21
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:54,658
We're on something
of a clock here.

22
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:09,040
Moira Queen,

23
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:12,676
you have failed this city.

24
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:18,265
Stand still!

25
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,851
Please don't kill me.

26
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:24,105
Do you know anything about
your husband's disappearance?

27
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:26,557
What?!
Is Walter Steel still alive?!

28
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:28,342
I don't know
where my husband is.

29
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:30,394
I swear.

30
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:33,447
Do you know anything
about the Undertaking?

31
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,566
I said don't move!

32
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,902
I'm--I'm a mother.

33
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:39,787
I have a son--Oliver.

34
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,689
A daughter,
her name is Thea.

35
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,868
She's just a teenager.

36
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:45,682
Please don't take me
from my children.

37
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,295
They lost their father.

38
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:51,215
They can't
lose me, too.

39
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:54,868
Please, whoever
you are, please.

40
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,004
Okay.

41
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:02,543
I'm not going to hurt you.

42
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:13,887
This is Moira Queen,
I'm on the 39th floor,

43
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,556
I need help.

44
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:17,558
There's an intruder.

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,277
Please!

46
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:34,979

48
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,825
Ohh!

49
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:52,526
I'm not going to hurt you,
Felicity.

50
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:54,145
How do you know my name?

51
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:56,397
Because you know my name.

52
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,484
Oliver, oh...

53
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:02,102
Wow.

54
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:05,022
Everything about you just
became so unbelievably clear.

55
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,657
You're bleeding.

56
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,075
I don't need to be told that.

57
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:09,627
You need a hospital.

58
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,463
My--my father's old factory,
in the Glades.

59
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:14,498
No, you-- you need a doctor,
not a steelworker.

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,051
Felicity...you have
to promise me

61
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,587
that you are going to take me
to my father's factory

62
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:21,372
and nowhere else.

63
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,457
Yeah, promise.

64
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:30,097
Something tells me blood stains
are not covered under my lease.

65
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,600
So far the police
are unwilling to comment,

66
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,485
but unsubstantiated
eyewitness reports

67
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,688
claims that the Starling City
vigilante attacked Mrs. Queen

68
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,356
in her office earlier tonight.

69
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:41,859
She was unharmed
in the assault.

70
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,577
Excuse me.

71
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,080
Can you help me?
He's really heavy!

72
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:55,839
Oh, damn it.

73
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,541
He just missed
a carotid.

74
00:03:57,543 --> 00:04:00,177
It's a zone two wound.
Press there.

75
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,012
I should have taken
him to a hospital.

76
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,848
No, Felicity, that's why he
asked you to bring him here.

77
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,899
Because he knew the police

78
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:08,134
would want to know how
and why he got the wound.

79
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,058
I'm guessing how and why
are Oliver Queen's

80
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,806
least favorite questions.

81
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:16,193
Yeah, well, there's also when
and where, he's not too fond of.

82
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,312
So if we can't bring him
to the hospital...

83
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:21,115
We bring
the hospital to him.

84
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:22,533
Is that...

85
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:25,569
Yeah. His blood.
He stored it for a rainy day.

86
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,738
And I say right now,
it's pouring.

87
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,189
I got it.
Over there.

88
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:30,908
Do you know what you're doing?

89
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,626
Yeah, I had some
medical training

90
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:34,211
in the army.

91
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:37,030
I just hope
it's enough.

92
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:40,000
Remember playing "Operation"
when you were a kid?

93
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:42,553
Yes.

94
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,555
And it never made me
want to throw up.

95
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:47,308
Hey, Felicity, listen, trust me.
He'll be fine.

96
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,871
He's been through
a lot worse than this.

97
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,483
Ah, dead.

98
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:09,780
How did you survive here
for six months?

99
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:13,000
I know girl scouts who
have more fight in them.

100
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:14,735
Fighting girl scouts now,
Slade, huh?

101
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,036
Oww!

102
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:17,771
What the hell?!

103
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:19,540
Listen, kid.
We have ten days

104
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,292
until the supply
plane lands.

105
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:24,645
Ten days to turn you
into at least half a soldier.

106
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:27,798
So start taking it
seriously.

107
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:34,772
What is the point of this?!

108
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:37,024
These soldiers
don't carry bamboo!

109
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:38,892
They have guns!
So what am I supposed to do

110
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:41,145
if one them jams
a gun in my face, huh?

111
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,147
Threaten them with my stick?!

112
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:46,533
Jam this in my face.

113
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:50,070
Do it.

114
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:03,250
I give up.
I give up.

115
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:06,804
There is no giving up
to these guys!

116
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:10,758
No crying, or buying
your way out of it!

117
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,727
You have two choices--

118
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:17,181
escape, or die.

119
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,516
So choose.

120
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:21,018
Escape.

121
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,970
Then let me show you

122
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:26,023
how not to die.

123
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:37,551
Lian Yu.

124
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:40,137
It's the name
of the island, I know.

125
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,789
It's Mandarin for "Purgatory".

126
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,541
It is? Wonderful.

127
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,660
Is that the air strip?

128
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:50,214
A.S.I.S. took satellite images
of the whole island.

129
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:51,932
This is Fyers'
main camp,

130
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,384
where I was held
for almost a year.

131
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:56,253
Do--do you think
that's where Yao Fei is now?

132
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,855
'Cause we could get
a message to him.

133
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:59,640
We can tell him we found
a way off the island.

134
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,442
Forget about him.

135
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,961
This is the airstrip.

136
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:06,530
And these infrared
images show

137
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:07,781
there are at last
ten soldiers guarding

138
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:09,383
the perimeter
at any given time.

139
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:10,818
Too many of 'em
for you?

140
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
No.

141
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,422
My problem is the guy
here in the tower.

142
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:18,375
It's a PTAC. A portable
air traffic control tower.

143
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:20,377
The U.S. government
set up these for disaster zones,

144
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,679
like Thailand
after the Tsunami.

145
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:25,749
So what's the problem?

146
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,751
The glass is bulletproof.

147
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:30,671
I can't take out the tower guard
with my sniper rifle.

148
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:32,322
And if he suspects
anything's wrong,

149
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:35,592
he'll radio Fyers
and we're cancelled.

150
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:38,262
It'll be up to you
to take him out.

151
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,330
Up close and personal.

152
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:42,349
Are you ready for that?

153
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,252
Do you think
I'm ready?

154
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:49,440
What I think is there's only
one supply plane every 3 months.

155
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:52,493
We leave tomorrow,
or we die soon afterwards.

156
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:55,562
I pick leaving.

157
00:07:56,865 --> 00:08:00,451
So get some sleep.
We leave at 0600.

158
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,427
Don't worry.

159
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,963
You'll be back with your girlfriend
soon enough.

160
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,173
Morning.

161
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:43,911
Please don't hate me.

162
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:47,164
Why would I hate you?

163
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,250
For cheating on you with Sarah.

164
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:55,722
Did it hurt, Ollie?

165
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,007
Did what hurt?

166
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,726
When they killed you?

167
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:03,430
Rise and shine.

168
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:21,415
Come on.

169
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:24,768
We're moving out.

170
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,568
All clear.

171
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,521
Hey, can we, um, can we rest
for a second?

172
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,824
You can rest on the plane.

173
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:06,076
Gosh, well, really
looking forward

174
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:07,661
to that
in-flight movie.

175
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:11,531
Oh, God.
Don't move.

176
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:14,251
Is it a mine?

177
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,394
Yeah.

178
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:25,879
The soldiers
mine the island?

179
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,180
No, it's probably Japanese,

180
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:28,932
left over from World War II.

181
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,018
Still active.

182
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,552
Impressive.

183
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:35,272
Can you disarm it?

184
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:37,941
Without disarming you?

185
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:44,351
Soldiers.

186
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:53,139
Can they see us?

187
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:55,391
They can only see you.

188
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:57,560
Wait! Stop!

189
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:11,207
What are you doing
so far from camp?

190
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,009
I got separated
from my unit.

191
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,477
Come with us.

192
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,497
I--I can't.

193
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:21,167
I'm kind of having
a bad day, you know?

194
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:36,015
Be still.

195
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:46,693
Thanks.

196
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:56,536
Yao Fei.

197
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:59,339
Come in. Sit.

198
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:03,126
Now the first time

199
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:06,930
I saw you with
this contraption...

200
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:10,300
I thought you looked
utterly ridiculous.

201
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:13,519
That is, until you took out

202
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:15,889
three of my best men
with it.

203
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:18,758
25 compound bows
will be arriving

204
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,994
on tomorrow's supply plane.

205
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:25,448
I'd like you to train a few
of my men on how to use them.

206
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,736
Archery can take years
to master.

207
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:33,539
Well, I trust you'll be
a proficient instructor.

208
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,159
That'll be all.

209
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:45,050
I hope you are steadfast

210
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,151
in your commitment
to our cause, Yao Fei.

211
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:49,756
For her sake.

212
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:52,842
I am.

213
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,933
Obviously you were never
a boy scout.

214
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:02,602
Yeah? What
tipped you off?

215
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:05,204
We better hurry.

216
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:07,240
The wolves come out at night.

217
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:10,493
There are wolves here?

218
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:12,812
Right. Of course
there are.

219
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,530
Because what would
the worst place on earth be

220
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,282
without wolves.

221
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:19,002
The only thing that will
keep them out is fire.

222
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,787
Well, you know,
you're welcome to help.

223
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:31,014
Seriously?

224
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:32,966
I've been working on
this for two hours.

225
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:35,601
I know. I was watching you.

226
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:39,171
Thank you for the entertainment.

227
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:52,485
You're going to wear that thing out
just by looking at it.

228
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:54,120
Don't worry.

229
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:57,457
She'll be waiting for flowers
when you get back.

230
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,492
I doubt it.

231
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:02,795
Remember how I told you
I was shipwrecked here?

232
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:06,032
Her sister was with me
when the boat went down.

233
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:08,634
That's funny. I never took you
as being the bad boy.

234
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,803
You seem to lack the spine.

235
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,306
That's why I've got
to get home.

236
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:15,008
To make this right.

237
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,094
If you think you can sleep
with your girlfriend's sister

238
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:20,096
and still make it right...

239
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:23,483
You're dumber than I thought.
And believe me when I tell you

240
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:26,235
that is saying something.

241
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,071
Yeah, well, you don't really
strike me as the type of guy

242
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,323
who accepts
apologies, so.

243
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:33,242
Well, everybody is in
this life for themselves.

244
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:36,162
Learn that at Australian
spy school?

245
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:39,782
No. I learned that here.

246
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,667
Do you remember I told you
that I had a partner?

247
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,669
Yeah.

248
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,539
Do you remember
the guy who tortured you?

249
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:54,714
That freak show
was your partner?!

250
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:56,382
His name's Billy Wintergreen.

251
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:57,850
Oh. Ok.

252
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,752
Our mission was
to exfiltrate Yao Fei

253
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:02,588
and to find out why Fyers and his men
were so interested in him.

254
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,391
But our bird got shot out of the sky
before we even saw the airstrip.

255
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:07,927
That's where
I found you.

256
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,697
When Fyers took us prisoner,

257
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,950
he asked if we would
join him and his men.

258
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:17,036
Billy accepted
Fyers' invitation.

259
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:19,322
I declined.

260
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:24,043
He was the godfather
to my son Joe.

261
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:27,713
And yet, he turned
his back on me

262
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:31,667
without even thinking twice
about it.

263
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,221
Everybody is in this life
for themselves!

264
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:54,690
If you let him radio camp,
we're done.

265
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:59,645
What about the others?
You worry about your one.

266
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:01,414
I'll worry about my ten.

267
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:26,772
Good job.

268
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,007
I think.

269
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,609
His heart rate's elevated,

270
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,943
but at least
the bleeding stopped.

271
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,778
Thanks for your help.

272
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,113
You kept your head on.

273
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:36,115
Well, I always wondered
how I'd react

274
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:39,202
if I found my boss shot
and bleeding inside my car.

275
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:40,903
Not that I helped
because he's my boss.

276
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,789
I'd help anyone
who was shot

277
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,459
and bleeding
in my car.

278
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:49,745
I was thinking all of this
would be more of a shock.

279
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:52,915
What, are you saying
you called this all along?

280
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:55,301
I'm not saying
anything.

281
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:58,087
Except Oliver brought me
a laptop riddled with bullet holes,

282
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,872
had me trace
a black arrow,

283
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:03,476
and research a company involved
in armored car heists.

284
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:06,429
I may be blonde,
but I'm not that blonde.

285
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:09,432
Yeah, Oliver's not too great with
the cover stories.

286
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:11,234
Neither are you.

287
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,735
The two of you
with that whole

288
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:16,105
energy drink hangover cure?
Please.

289
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,908
What was really
in that vial, anyway?

290
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,028
Vertigo.
I knew it!

291
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,230
I mean, I didn't know
it was Vertigo for sure,

292
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,782
but I definitely knew it wasn't
something that could cure a hangover.

293
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:29,144
Yeah, we needed it analyzed
so we could take down the count.

294
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:32,571
That was you and Oliver?

295
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,423
And you, Felicity.

296
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:37,343
Without you, we never
would have found him.

297
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:40,796
But why come to me?

298
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:46,052
Hard as it probably is
for him to admit,

299
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,855
even Oliver
needs help sometimes.

300
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:43,672
What's happening?!

301
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:44,840
There's a syringe
labeled Ativan.

302
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,642
It should stop
the seizure. Go.

303
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,428
His heart stopped.

304
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,219
I'm calling 9-1-1.

305
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,921
No. Wait, you can't.

306
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,940
You know how to use
one of those?

307
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:59,610
We are about
to find out.

308
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:02,980
You didn't say clear!

309
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,566
I heard the charge.

310
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:07,952
That's good news.
How's that?

311
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,436
It means it might not
be the machine,

312
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,205
it could be the wiring.

313
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,773
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

314
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,292
Try again.

315
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:16,127
Clear.

316
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:34,095
What the hell
did you do?

317
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:36,764
I've been building computers
since I was seven.

318
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,649
Wires are wires.

319
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:40,768
What do we do now?

320
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,437
Pray we don't have
a heart attack ourselves.

321
00:20:57,652 --> 00:21:00,004
One job to do,

322
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:02,957
and you manage
to screw up even then.

323
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,330
I'm going to go make sure that
everything is clear.

324
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:11,599
Stay here,
keep the door locked.

325
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:14,135
Do not let anybody in
except for me.

326
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:16,470
You got that?
Yeah.

327
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:20,274
Here. Keep this.

328
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,310
And try not to shoot
yourself by mistake.

329
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:00,014
Hello?

330
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,935
Hello?

331
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:11,525
Is anybody there?

332
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:16,530
Have you lost
your mind?

333
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:18,699
They might be
monitoring the calls.

334
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:23,564
Island tower.
This is Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot,

335
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:26,381
we are 700 kilometers
southeast of your position.

336
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:30,376
ETA, three hours,
22 minutes, over.

337
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:37,550
Island tower,
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

338
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:40,269
Acknowledged.

339
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:45,391
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

340
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:46,993
Acknowledged.

341
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:50,062
Of all creatures that breath
and move upon the earth.

342
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:53,699
What is that?

343
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:55,168
It's a challenge code.

344
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,921
They're trying
to verify our identity.

345
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:02,575
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

346
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:04,127
Please repeat.

347
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:08,181
Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the earth.

348
00:23:08,183 --> 00:23:11,050
Wait.
What?

349
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:13,352
Wait, I know this.
I know this.

350
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:17,423
They picked the one book
that I read in college.

351
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:18,941
What the hell are
you talking about?

352
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:21,394
A quote, from "The Odyssey".

353
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:23,362
Ohh.

354
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:28,767
Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the earth,

355
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:30,453
nothing--nothing is born

356
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:33,372
that is weaker than man.

357
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:35,641
Are you sure about this?
Because if you're wrong,

358
00:23:35,643 --> 00:23:36,942
this plane
will turn around.

359
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:39,579
Yes, yes. I'm positive.

360
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:42,748
Nothing is born

361
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,133
that is weaker than man.

362
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:45,968
Say it.

363
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:48,921
Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

364
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,456
Sorry. Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

365
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,625
Bred.

366
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:54,793
Not born, bred.

367
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:57,346
Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

368
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,465
That's it.

369
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:03,569
Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

370
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:06,606
Roger that.
See you in a few hours.

371
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,691
Out.

372
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,160
"The Odyssey".

373
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:13,863
Yeah! It's, uh, well,
it's a story about a guy

374
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:17,166
who's trying to get home, so.

375
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:18,229
Well,
after a few days

376
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,978
at Langstughl Airbase,

377
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,511
you'll be
on your way home.

378
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:24,713
But you sound like
you're not coming with me.

379
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,315
I'll be coming
with you.

380
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:30,486
After I radio in an airstrike
on this location.

381
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:35,408
I'm going to send Fyers and
all his men straight back to hell.

382
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:44,377
Wait.

383
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:48,402
You can't blow up the island.

384
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,537
Yao Fei is still out there.

385
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:52,659
He is not my concern.
Really?

386
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,160
He's the only reason
you came here.

387
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:56,430
Rescuing him
was your mission!

388
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:57,664
Well, the mission
has changed.

389
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,666
Edward Fyers
is a mercenary

390
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:01,835
and he is not on
this island by mistake.

391
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:03,503
He has plans
for me and you

392
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:04,671
that involve Yao Fei.

393
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:07,691
And whatever they are,
they must end.

394
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:12,195
Yao Fei saved my life.

395
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,648
That is your debt
to repay,

396
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,367
not mine.

397
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,073
Where are you going?!

398
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:28,211
All my life,

399
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,864
all that I've ever
thought about is myself.

400
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:33,834
I took my family
for granted.

401
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:36,169
I betrayed people
that I loved.

402
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:42,259
And I'm not going to be
that person anymore.

403
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:48,715
I can't leave
Yao Fei here to die.

404
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,600
I won't.

405
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,237
The plane leaves
in three hours.

406
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,356
If you and your friend
are not on it,

407
00:25:56,358 --> 00:25:58,892
I am going to leave
without you.

408
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:11,254
If I don't make it
back in time,

409
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:15,509
and you get out
of here...

410
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:19,746
I want you
to call my family.

411
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:22,265
Call my family.

412
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:25,936
Sure, kid.

413
00:26:52,881 --> 00:26:55,082
He's going into
cardiac arrest again.

414
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:56,466
No.

415
00:26:56,468 --> 00:26:58,802
Ah. The leads
just came loose.

416
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:01,054
Arghh!

417
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:04,424
It's less stressful when
he's jumping off rooftops.

418
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:08,929
Ohh.

419
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:13,016
This bow has put arrows
in quite a few people.

420
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,469
Yeah, bad people.

421
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:19,790
That doesn't bother you?

422
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,809
Because...

423
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:24,978
And I mean this
in a good way,

424
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,281
you seem like the kind
of guy it would bother.

425
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,719
When I was in
Afghanistan,

426
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:36,840
my unit was tasked
with protecting this local war lord.

427
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:39,843
Gholem Qadir.

428
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:42,045
Qadir was less than
human, sold opium.

429
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:43,680
Sold children.

430
00:27:43,682 --> 00:27:45,582
One day,

431
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,717
we were accompanying
him to Mosul

432
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:50,854
when my convoy
was ambushed by insurgents.

433
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:52,472
We had them outgunned.

434
00:27:52,474 --> 00:27:53,857
Fire fight didn't last more
than a minute.

435
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,143
When the smoke cleared,

436
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:58,011
I moved in
on their position.

437
00:27:58,013 --> 00:28:02,365
They were all dead.
I knew which one I had killed.

438
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,852
When I pulled off
his keffiyeh,

439
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:08,822
I could see it was just
a kid, no more than 18.

440
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:11,892
Shot him in the throat.

441
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:14,644
I killed this kid
to protect

442
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:16,163
this human piece
of garbage,

443
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:18,665
and I thought,
am I still good?

444
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:22,385
Am I still
a good man?

445
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:27,874
Doing this with Oliver;

446
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:30,393
doing what we do,
I feel good again

447
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,979
for the first time
in a long time.

448
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:37,350
And that's worth
all the collateral damage?

449
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:39,519
I haven't killed anyone, if that's
what you're asking.

450
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,521
But he has.

451
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,858
Unfortunately,

452
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,778
there are always casualties
when you're fighting a war.

453
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,210
How did you...

454
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:39,612
Come on, let's go.
I'll explain on the way.

455
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,548
Stupid boy. You should never
have come back here!

456
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,967
I found Slade Wilson
and he has a way off the island,

457
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:45,969
but we have to go
right now.

458
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:47,971
No. No!

459
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:49,789
What? What
do you mean, no?

460
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,444
This is our chance.

461
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:52,810
What--what reason
could you possibly have

462
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:54,311
for staying here?!

463
00:29:54,313 --> 00:29:57,264
Not what. Who.

464
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:05,805
Ah, Mr. Queen,
I think it's past time

465
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:08,992
you left this island.
Permanently.

466
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:24,210
Island tower, this is
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

467
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:26,912
We are 5,000 feet
and holding, over.

468
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:30,716
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

469
00:30:30,718 --> 00:30:32,468
This is island tower.

470
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,138
You're clear to land.

471
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,718
Simply to satisfy
my own curiosity,

472
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,903
why aren't you
already dead?

473
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:52,905
I saw Yao Fei
choke you to death.

474
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:55,475
I guess he's not as strong
as he looks.

475
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,128
Still,
you return for him.

476
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,264
So you're either a fool,

477
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:04,884
or is it possible you now think
yourself a hero?

478
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:07,553
I'm not a hero.
Of course not.

479
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:08,921
It's not possible
to be a hero

480
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:11,941
when there's nobody
worthy of saving.

481
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,812
Is this what you want?

482
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:18,431
Did you want me
to fight him again?!

483
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:19,732
Oh, no, Mr. Queen.

484
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:22,268
That's where
you're mistaken.

485
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,103
This is not a match.

486
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:26,139
It's an execution.

487
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:28,991
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:39,836
It's Wintergreen, right?

489
00:31:39,838 --> 00:31:42,371
Bill Wintergreen?

490
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:50,263
I know all about you.

491
00:31:50,265 --> 00:31:53,516
I know you work
for the Australian government.

492
00:31:53,518 --> 00:31:55,668
And that you used
to fight for your country.

493
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:59,171
You used to stand
for something!

494
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:15,238
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll triple it.

495
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:25,331
How many of them
are there?!

496
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:38,877
Slade. Come back to die?

497
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,609
Was it so easy
to betray me, Billy?

498
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:15,464
You know, Billy...

499
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:20,052
You always had a good kick.

500
00:34:05,204 --> 00:34:08,823
There goes our ride.

501
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,408
Wow.

502
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,294
I'm impressed.

503
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,246
You didn't puke.

504
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:28,081
I swallowed it.

505
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,334
You can
untie me now.

506
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,289
Why'd you want me
to tie you up in the first place?

507
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,809
A man in pain is unreliable.

508
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:42,346
I was afraid
I might kill you.

509
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:44,848
Thanks.

510
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,767
What?

511
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,134
It's just...

512
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,803
What?

513
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:51,488
I'm trapped
on an island

514
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,858
and my only friend
is named Wilson. So.

515
00:34:58,112 --> 00:34:59,780
What now?

516
00:34:59,782 --> 00:35:01,915
We hope my fireworks
show set Fyers back,

517
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:03,834
maybe enough for those
who hired him in the first place

518
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:05,452
to call things off.

519
00:35:05,454 --> 00:35:06,753
Hired him?

520
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,790
Well, Fyers is a merc.
He follows the money.

521
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:13,260
So he's on this island
under someone's employ.

522
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:15,546
Then what do we do?
We have to make sure

523
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:18,765
that neither of us dies on this
godforsaken island.

524
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:21,185
I though you said
if we didn't get on the plane...

525
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,687
We weren't going to make it.

526
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,107
Well, that dumb kid
that I trained,

527
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:29,175
he would never
have made it.

528
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:31,478
You?

529
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,034
You might just
have a chance.

530
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,621
Yep, it's Fyers.

531
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:43,457
Satellites showed
multiple heat blooms on the island.

532
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:44,791
What the hell
is happening there?

533
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:47,244
There was a complication.
Slade Wilson?

534
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:48,695
I'm handling it.

535
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:50,363
Well, handle it better.
I've worked too hard

536
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,866
and planned for too long
to have complications arise

537
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:54,301
so close to the end.

538
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:55,669
I assure you,
it won't happen again.

539
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:56,703
What about Yao Fei?

540
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:58,972
I've ensured his cooperation.

541
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:01,708
Good. Paid you a lot
of money, Fyers.

542
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,595
I expect a return
on my investment.

543
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,897
You sent for me.

544
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:08,899
I'm a man of my word.

545
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:12,352
You made the right call today,
turning in your young castaway.

546
00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:15,856
And for that,
I'll grant you five minutes.

547
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,531
Shado? Shado!

548
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:27,034
Shado!

549
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,594
Shh, shh, shh.

550
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,791
I guess I didn't die.

551
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,127
Again.

552
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,279
Cool.

553
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,472
It's not bad.

554
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:25,175
So how am I going
to explain this one?

555
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,960
Hickey gone wrong?

556
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:31,917
The police collected a sample
of your blood at Queen Consolidated.

557
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:35,805
I just hacked the crime lab and
ordered the sample destroyed.

558
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:37,773
Oops. Heh.

559
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,812
I hope it's all right.

560
00:37:42,814 --> 00:37:44,429
Your system looked like it was
from the eighties,

561
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,449
and not the good part
of the eighties,

562
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:49,735
like Madonna
and, well, legwarmers.

563
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:52,238
It's a lot of work.

564
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,123
Does that mean you're in?
You mean in

565
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,992
as in I'm going
to join your crusade?

566
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:59,962
Well, you're practically an honorary
member of the team already.

567
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:02,331
Hmm. So Mr. Diggle said.

568
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:05,617
No.

569
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:06,919
Then why'd
you upgrade my system?

570
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:08,587
First, because
seeing a network

571
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:11,957
that poorly set up
hurts me. In my soul.

572
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:15,344
And second...
I want to find Walter.

573
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:18,147
My stepfather.

574
00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:20,465
He was nice to me.

575
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,935
And Mr. Diggle told me that
the notebook you use

576
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:26,105
to fight crime is the same notebook
that got Walter abducted.

577
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:30,109
I'll help you rescue him,
but that's it.

578
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:34,497
Then I want to go back to my
boring life of being an I.T. girl.

579
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:38,150
That's my offer.

580
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:40,703
Ok.

581
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:45,424
So I've been
meaning to ask...

582
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:48,677
Is there a bathroom? 'Cause
I've had to pee since I got here.

583
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,662
It's upstairs to the left.

584
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,998
Great.
Felicity.

585
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:00,856
Thank you.

586
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,309
Yeah.

587
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,652
Oliver, I know you don't
want to hurt this girl

588
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:16,455
and you didn't have any choice
in telling her who you really were,

589
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:20,292
but we're asking her to get involved in
some pretty dangerous stuff.

590
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,527
We can protect her.
How?

591
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,663
Your mother
just shot you, Oliver.

592
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,332
You can't even keep
yourself safe.

593
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,700
She was scared.
She was defending herself.

594
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:32,338
Or, she was hiding something.
Like maybe her involvement

595
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,423
in Walter's disappearance,
or worse.

596
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:38,010
Diggle, we don't always know
why people do what they do.

597
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,845
But what I do know

598
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,713
is that when I was
standing in her office

599
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,649
with an arrow
aimed at her heart,

600
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:45,985
she begged me
to spare her,

601
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:51,190
all on behalf
of me and Thea.

602
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:53,859
Now, I've taken down
a lot of bad people.

603
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:56,528
None of them brought
up their kids, Dig.

604
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,582
Oliver, she had the list.
Now she may not be in charge

605
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:01,166
of whatever "it" is,

606
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:03,735
but she's definitely involved.
Involved in what?!

607
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,789
We don't even know
what "it" is,

608
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,374
and until we do,

609
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:10,943
she is off limits!

610
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:14,630
Am I clear?

611
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,041
But Oliver, are you saying
this because you truly

612
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:32,050
believe she's innocent?
Or because you don't want

613
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,215
to face the fact that
your mother might be guilty?

614
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,751
6'1,

615
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:55,004
and a deep voice. I--

616
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:56,472
Hey.

617
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:57,473
What's going on?

618
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:58,790
Where have you been?

619
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,309
I've been calling you
all night.

620
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,094
I was at the club. I get
zero reception in there.

621
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:03,762
Maybe it's time
you invest in a land line.

622
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,981
Thea.
Your mother was attacked last night.

623
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:09,301
By the Vigilante.
What?!

624
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:10,736
He came after me
at the office.

625
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,237
Did he hurt you?
Are you ok?

626
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,772
Actually, she hurt him.
She shot him point blank

627
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:16,025
with a gun hidden
in her office.

628
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:17,326
That should help
with your investigation.

629
00:41:17,328 --> 00:41:18,911
Did you get
any evidence,

630
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:22,448
like a blood
sample, or...

631
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,167
There was a screw-up
at the lab.

632
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:26,502
That's too bad.

633
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:28,370
Hmm.

634
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:31,123
We'll be in touch.

635
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,375
Thank you.
Yes.

636
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:39,715
Oh, sweetheart.

637
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:40,933
I was so scared.

638
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,834
I'm just glad
you're ok.

639
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:45,888
I thought he was
going to kill me.

640
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,840
Hey.

641
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,200
I promise you,

642
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:56,337
he's never going
to bother you again.
