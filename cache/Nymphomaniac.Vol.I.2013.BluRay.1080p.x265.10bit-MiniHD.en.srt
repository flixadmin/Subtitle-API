1
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,027
Man: Hello?

2
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,493
You've had an accident.

3
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:12,788
You need an ambulance.

4
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,916
I'll call for one.
I'll be right back.

5
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,253
- Lie still here.
- No.

6
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,921
No.

7
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,215
Man: No what?

8
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,593
I don't need an ambulance.

9
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,678
Man: I can clearly see you do.

10
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,764
I'll call for one.

11
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,474
In that case,
I'll be up and gone

12
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,102
before you have time
to come back.

13
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,064
Man: That will hurt.

14
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,152
That's possible.
But it doesn't matter to me.

15
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:50,284
Man: I assume you don't want me
to call the police either.

16
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,455
Yes, that's exactly right.

17
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,171
Man: Is there anything you want?

18
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,558
I'd like a cup of tea
with some milk.

19
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,605
Man: Well...

20
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,443
You have to come with me.

21
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,196
I don't serve tea in the street.

22
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,117
Can you walk?

23
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,203
Woman: Yeah.

24
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,124
I've even bought a cake.

25
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,840
Here's a pajama.

26
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,426
Thank you.

27
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,720
I've made up the bed for you.

28
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,931
With clean sheets.

29
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,368
- Man: Sorry.
- That's okay.

30
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,622
Man: There.

31
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,801
- I'll wash your clothes.
- Not my coat.

32
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,054
It smells rather badly.

33
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,140
It's my coat.

34
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,892
The smell won't come off anyway.

35
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,770
It's your coat.

36
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:49,278
- Man: Do you take sugar?
- Woman: No, thank you.

37
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,781
There you go.

38
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,326
Thank you.

39
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:03,959
So what happened?

40
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,712
Were you robbed?

41
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,968
It's my own fault.

42
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,638
I'm just a bad human being.

43
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,184
I've never met
a bad human being.

44
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,852
Well, you have now.

45
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,648
Do you want to talk about it?

46
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,942
You wouldn't understand.

47
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,197
Well, try me.

48
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:37,993
But I wouldn't know where to start.

49
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:51,465
Why is that ridiculous
fishhook hanging there?

50
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,717
Man: That's a fly.

51
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,221
I caught a fish with it once,
a rather big one.

52
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:59,264
Strangely enough.

53
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,853
Fly fishing
is about tying feathers

54
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,897
and other things to a hook

55
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:10,943
so it resembles something
the fish likes to eat.

56
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,071
And then because
the fly is very light,

57
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,782
you have to have a line
that is heavy.

58
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:20,077
It creates the velocity
when you cast.

59
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:35,092
- You fish a lot?
- Well, some.

60
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,387
But I don't catch much.

61
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,599
The locals catch a lot more.

62
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,562
When I was young, I...
I had a book I...

63
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,230
I worshipped.

64
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,738
Man: It was an old book
by Izaak Walton

65
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,407
called "The Complete Angler.”

66
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,164
It was like a romantic
nature bible to me.

67
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,261
Maybe I know where to start.

68
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:25,809
But if you're to understand, I'll...

69
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,812
I'll have to tell you
the whole story.

70
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,856
And it'll be long.

71
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,902
Long is good.

72
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:38,822
And moral, I'm afraid.

73
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,877
Woman:
To begin with the bait,

74
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,005
I discovered my cunt
as a two-year-old.

75
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,550
Man:
"Cunt” is a very strong word.

76
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,929
Woman: Let's call it
"Pandora's Box" then.

77
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:06,016
Man: Um... No, no, no.
"Cunt" is better.

78
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,519
Woman:
So, I was a nymphomaniac.

79
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:12,147
Man: Wait a moment, no.
Nobody can be a nymphomaniac

80
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,774
when they're only two years old.

81
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,359
I don't think even the strictest God

82
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:19,196
would see anything else
than a child's normal behavior.

83
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,199
What about fetuses?
It's common knowledge

84
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,410
that fetuses often touch
their genital organs.

85
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,914
Can a fetus somehow be sinful?

86
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:31,708
Why not?

87
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,169
Not according to any religion I know,

88
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,797
unless it's an original sin.

89
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,340
Ancestral.

90
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,721
Or perhaps according to a religion
that doesn't exist yet.

91
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,809
According to a god that hasn't
yet manifested himself.

92
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,353
But then you can imagine anything.

93
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,611
Woman: At an early age,
I was mechanically inclined.

94
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:04,574
Kinetic energy, for example,
has always fascinated me.

95
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,620
And my friend,
let's call her "B,"

96
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,956
always came up with the ideas.

97
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:16,044
Playing frogs was one
of B's classics.

98
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,070
Woman: Joe, are you all right?

99
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,114
Joe: Just a moment.

100
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,701
Woman: Are you done?

101
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,006
For Christ's sakes,
leave them alone.

102
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,259
Joe: I loved my father very much.

103
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,802
He was a doctor.

104
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:09,139
My mother's name was Katherine.

105
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,350
My father called her Kay.

106
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,688
I suppose she was what
you'd call "a cold bitch."

107
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:20,942
She always had her back turned
when she played solitaire.

108
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,195
I hated solitaire.

109
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,579
Joe: When we had P.E.,
I'd climb up into the ropes

110
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:37,125
and hang there for ages
with the rope between my legs.

111
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,420
"The Sensation” we called it.

112
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:45,008
I remember very distinctly
this word, "sensation.”

113
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:55,143
Perhaps the only difference
between me and other people

114
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,106
was that I've always demanded
more from the sunset.

115
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,778
More spectacular colors
when the sun hit the horizon.

116
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,199
That's perhaps my only sin.

117
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,247
Why are you insisting
that children are sinful?

118
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,749
Not children.

119
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,834
Me.

120
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,212
I don't see sin anywhere.

121
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:24,673
But then I'm not religious.

122
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,509
Well, that's because you don't
know the rest of the story.

123
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,053
And by the way,
I'm not religious either.

124
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,348
Why would you take the most
unsympathetic aspect

125
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,935
of religion such as
the concept of sin...

126
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,564
and let it survive beyond religion?

127
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,862
I don't understand this self-hatred.

128
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,156
Well, that's what I said.

129
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,783
- You wouldn't understand.
- No, I'm...

130
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,744
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

131
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,165
Please continue.

132
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,099
Nervus... pudendus.

133
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:25,192
Nervus dorsal is clitoridis.

134
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,574
When the ash tree was created,

135
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:17,452
it made all the other trees
in the forest jealous.

136
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,914
It was the most beautiful tree.

137
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,169
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

138
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:31,049
It was the World Tree
in Norse mythology.

139
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,802
Remember, Odin...

140
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,264
He hung from the ash tree,
Yggdrasil, for nine days

141
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,140
in order to gain insight.

142
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,812
The ash tree had
the strongest wood.

143
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,111
Then in the winter...

144
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,657
When the ash tree
lost all of its leaves...

145
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,329
all the trees noticed
its black buds,

146
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,914
and started laughing.

147
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,250
"Oh, look.

148
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,212
The ash tree has had
its fingers in the ashes."

149
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,091
See?

150
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,970
You can always tell
the ash tree in winter

151
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,221
by the black buds.

152
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:30,734
Now...

153
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,196
Now this is a lime tree leaf.

154
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,533
- Remember?
- I forgot about the lime tree.

155
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,827
I've told you 100 times.

156
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,164
Joe: My dad loved
telling me about the trees,

157
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,666
and their leaves,
and considered it

158
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,752
part of a good education.

159
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,757
He especially loved the childish
educational stories he told

160
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:56,718
to help me remember
what I had learned.

161
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:00,263
I knew how much he loved
telling those stories.

162
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,725
Sometimes I pretended
I'd forgotten them.

163
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,481
Father: Originally, the lime
tree's leaves were round.

164
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,026
A fox had her den
beneath its roots

165
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,861
where she had four cubs.

166
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,490
One day, she went out
looking for food for them.

167
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,576
There was a hunt in the forest.
She was shot.

168
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,622
Wounded, she crawled back to the den

169
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,917
where she and the four cubs died.

170
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,880
This made the lime tree so sad.

171
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,882
And from then on,

172
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:39,135
the lime tree decided to have...

173
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,555
heart-shaped leaves.

174
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,811
Oh, yes, that's right.
Heart-shaped.

175
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,235
Am I boring you?

176
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,737
Man: No, no. I'm just
looking forward

177
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:00,365
to how you'll get fishing
weaved into your tale.

178
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,452
You could start with the fly
on the wall there.

179
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,329
It's called a nymph.

180
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,915
It will tie in elegantly
with your discussion

181
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:14,045
about nymphomania.
A nymph is an early stage

182
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,047
in the life of an insect.

183
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,510
Joe: As a quite young nymph,

184
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,514
it was imperative for me
to get rid of my virginity.

185
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,558
Hopla.

186
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,728
I kind of knew this boy, J,

187
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,980
who had a moped.

188
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,899
So in my eyes he was
rather sophisticated.

189
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,819
I was 15,

190
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,530
and perhaps my girlish,
romantic expectations

191
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,198
were a bit high.

192
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,037
Joe: But he had good, strong hands.

193
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,125
I liked his hands.

194
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:00,383
Hello?

195
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,969
- Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:20,236
If I asked you to take my virginity
would that be a problem?

197
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,115
No, I don't see a problem.

198
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:29,954
So, um...

199
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,083
Where shall I go?

200
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,989
It's the fucking carburetor.

201
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,118
I just can't work it out,
you imagine that?

202
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:13,998
- That's not very good.
-Hmm?

203
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:16,084
- It's not very good.
- No, it bloody isn't.

204
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,294
Ruins the whole idea
of having a moped.

205
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,259
You should probably take off
your knickers, yeah?

206
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,932
Joe: He shoved his cock
inside me and humped me three times.

207
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:24,777
Joe: Then he turned
me over like a sack of potatoes.

208
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:35,455
Then he humped me
five times in the ass.

209
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,274
Joe: I never forgot those
two humiliating numbers.

210
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,987
Man: Three and five?

211
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:50,738
Those are Fibonacci numbers.

212
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,160
That may be.

213
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,413
In any case, it hurt like hell.

214
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,166
I swore I'd never sleep
with anyone again.

215
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,670
But of course that only
lasted a short while.

216
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,715
And now to get back
to your fishing.

217
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,968
A couple of years later,

218
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,220
I was at my friend B's,

219
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,889
and as always,
she had a new idea,

220
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,393
financed by her younger
brother's piggy banks

221
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,603
which she regularly emptied.

222
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,028
We put on clothes later known as

223
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,031
the "fuck me now" clothes.

224
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,826
The idea was a competition.

225
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,495
We were to go on a train trip.

226
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:42,540
B said there was
no need for tickets.

227
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,585
The one who would fuck
the most men

228
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,920
when we reached the destination

229
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:50,131
would win the chocolate sweets.

230
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,635
J

231
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,198
Man: May I interrupt here?

232
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,368
What you were doing when you
walked down that corridor.

233
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,454
You were reading the river.

234
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,387
Man: Most of the large
fish stay sheltered from the current

235
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:40,932
to save energy,
and to hide from the prey.

236
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,434
Where the fish hides in the stream

237
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,728
entails a very
complicated hierarchy.

238
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:51,067
The topography decides where
the most attractive places are,

239
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,528
and the biggest fish
choose the best positions.

240
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:03,621
What do I do?

241
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,998
Smile and make eye contact.

242
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,209
But what if it doesn't work?

243
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:11,504
If you have to talk, remember
to ask lots of "wh" questions

244
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:13,297
if you want more than
a yes or no answer.

245
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:14,757
Then it'll just happen on its own.

246
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,219
You just take them to the lavatory
and you have sex with them.

247
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,556
Oh. What if it's nasty?

248
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:24,267
Then you just think of the bag
of chocolate sweeties.

249
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,635
What... What time is it?

250
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,972
Ten.

251
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,323
Where do you come from?

252
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,117
From home.

253
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,169
Who knows where
the lavatory is?

254
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:36,547
Well, if you take a right,
you will arrive at a lavatory

255
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,174
at the end of the car.

256
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,302
At the same time it is
so cleverly arranged

257
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:46,015
that if you take a left turn you
will also arrive at a lavatory

258
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,935
since at the end of the next car
there is also one.

259
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,789
Let me show you
where the lavatory is.

260
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,115
Joe: It turned out to be
shockingly easy.

261
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:48,452
In no time,
B was ahead five to three.

262
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,162
And it was exactly right.

263
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,790
Look them in the eye and smile.

264
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,210
But then suddenly, it stopped.

265
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,672
That's a very clear parallel
to fishing in the stream.

266
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:04,176
As it happens, either none
of the fish are feeding,

267
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,886
or they all feed
at the same time.

268
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:09,598
They go into feeding frenzy.
All bite.

269
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:12,518
And then just as suddenly
as it started, it stops.

270
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:17,690
It's observable, but it's
highly unpredictable.

271
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,276
And it has to do with,
I don't know,

272
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,154
weather, barometric pressure,

273
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:28,701
maybe some fish psychology.
If that's possible.

274
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,747
Anyway, the fish most readily bite
at the beginning of a light rain,

275
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:35,291
and I think that's because
they feel safe

276
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,460
when they swim in the stream.

277
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:39,545
Because they can't be seen
from above.

278
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,006
The water's surface is disturbed.

279
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,344
But then it started again.

280
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,971
Although, a bit more slowly.

281
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,724
Yeah. I think I know how.

282
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,061
Because fly fishing can be
done in several phases.

283
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:59,440
And if the fish stop biting,
you move on to phase two.

284
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,902
And in phase two, you not
only imitate an insect,

285
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,529
but an insect in trouble.

286
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,366
You pull... You pull the line.

287
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:12,495
You tug it irregularly,
so the fish gets the impression

288
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:15,748
that it's dealing with
an injured and easy prey.

289
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:20,836
And then helplessly, let the fly
float down the river again.

290
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:24,757
Then half-heartedly,
make a few jumps forward again.

291
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:30,513
It can be done... It can
be done very elegantly.

292
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:45,403
Hey.

293
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,571
Sorry.

294
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,616
Nothing to feel sorry about.

295
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:54,495
I'm just not feeling
very well today.

296
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,081
What could be so bad?

297
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:00,167
Oh, thank you.

298
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:05,131
I can't talk about it right now.

299
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,925
Can I just sit here
for awhile?

300
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:11,011
Yeah. Sure.

301
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,227
Man: Is it better now?

302
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,062
No.

303
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,327
- Are you all right?
- It's Betty.

304
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,373
I was just told
that she's very ill.

305
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,460
Is Betty a close family member?

306
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,423
You could say that.

307
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,758
She's my dwarf hamster.

308
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:53,554
Man: Dwarf hamster?
You can't be serious.

309
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,764
Joe: Well, what was I to do?

310
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:59,560
And then, I did have a dwarf
hamster when I was young.

311
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,729
Man: That you were very close to?

312
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,440
Joe: Not at all.
A bloody nuisance.

313
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,526
Dwarf hamster?
That's not so bad.

314
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,322
Would have been worse
if it were a person.

315
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,449
Don't say that.

316
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,702
I'm extremely fond of my hamster.

317
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:21,123
Yes, I think that's a rather
cynical thing to say about Betty.

318
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,252
Yes, I made the cage nice
and cozy for her when...

319
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:27,796
- When I got her.
- I bet she liked that.

320
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,633
Betty was excited.

321
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,554
Joe: One of nature's
most meaningless creatures.

322
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,724
Man: You're aware that
the choice of a dwarf hamster

323
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,228
possibly suggests certain
sexual connotations.

324
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:43,646
Joe: I can see that now

325
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:46,732
but it was really not
a conscious choice.

326
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,153
How long does a dwarf hamster
actually live?

327
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,405
Months, years?

328
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:56,283
Its life is much too short.

329
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,169
Would you show me
where the lavatory is?

330
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,298
I... have to blow my nose.

331
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,778
Joe: Just the same,
we were running out of subjects,

332
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,489
and B was ahead on points,

333
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:39,285
which led us to S's
first-class compartment.

334
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:45,207
Conductor:
Tickets, please.

335
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,549
Thank you. Ladies?

336
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:56,218
Tickets.

337
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:08,731
Joe: Well...

338
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:12,359
I think I might have lost it.

339
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:14,194
Conductor: Perhaps.

340
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,615
Drop yours as well, did you?

341
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,577
I haven't bought a ticket
for your shitty train.

342
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,163
It's so bloody slow,
we should have been

343
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,040
at the end of the track
half an hour ago.

344
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:29,084
Regardless of delays, you still
need a ticket, sweetheart.

345
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,503
Eight pounds each, please.

346
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,591
Ooh!

347
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:38,677
I accidentally tore it up.

348
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,430
Can't expect me to pay
for scraps of paper.

349
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:44,141
- Have another one.
- Oh, great idea.

350
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,852
Oh, that one's disappeared too.

351
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,354
I can always just get the police

352
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,522
to collect your payment
at the next station...

353
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:53,067
Let's just take it easy here,
shall we?

354
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,944
Apparently, the young ladies
have left without any money.

355
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:57,905
If it's okay with you, I'd like
to pay for their tickets.

356
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,866
No, sir, it's not.
Leave your money where it is.

357
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,660
We'll let the police
deal with these two.

358
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,370
We did have sort of an agreement

359
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:06,538
that I was to pay.
I just forgot about it.

360
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,921
I see. Two first-class tickets...

361
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,548
for two first-class ladies.

362
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,094
Enjoy the rest of your journey.

363
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,014
Tickets, please.

364
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,609
Now that you've been
so nice to us...

365
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,072
we'd like to be nice to you, too.

366
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,700
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but there's no need.

367
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:48,914
I mean that.

368
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,254
You have to split them up
into whether they have

369
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,548
a goal and a mission or not.

370
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,967
That one doesn't.

371
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:02,594
Joe: Well, I've already lost anyway.

372
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:08,225
I'm willing to give you
five extra points...

373
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,063
if you can get that one in there.

374
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:18,152
Joe: I decided,
perhaps a bit desperately,

375
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:20,404
that the only thing
standing between me

376
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,322
and the bag of chocolate sweets,

377
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:26,785
was an unequivocal provocation
of this man.

378
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:30,205
Man: Excellent. An induced take.

379
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:33,417
When all other attempts fail,
a dramatic provocation

380
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,129
can get an otherwise completely
passive fish to bite.

381
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,006
A salmon or a trout,
for example,

382
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,592
eats itself fat
while in salt water,

383
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,677
and then basically
has no need to eat

384
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,556
as it makes its way upstream
to the spawning grounds.

385
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,933
They're not hungry but they
will react instinctively

386
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,852
to the right provocation.

387
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,563
Which would not be a fly,
but for instance,

388
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,275
a brightly colored wobbler,
preferably red,

389
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,195
served immediately
in front of the fish.

390
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:04,698
The very best is one we call
the Finnish Weapon.

391
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,742
The so-called "Rappala.”

392
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,371
Joe: I don't know if it's comparable,

393
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:14,416
but I decided in any case
to find out

394
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,502
why he hadn't taken the bait,

395
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,046
and to use my
psychological abilities,

396
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:23,133
which B, in my opinion,
didn't possess to the same degree.

397
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:26,512
Joe: You've bought a gift.

398
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:29,056
Yes.

399
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:32,267
It's for my wife.

400
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,773
- No gifts for the children?
- No.

401
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:41,068
We don't have any, actually.

402
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,030
Well, you seem rather well-to-do.

403
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:51,495
You travel first-class,
and you bought us our tickets.

404
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,541
Why then not buy a decent gift
for your wife?

405
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:58,460
I can see it comes
from the station.

406
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:06,343
Of course I should have...

407
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,345
bought her something...

408
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:10,472
something better, but...

409
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,685
Let's just say I was suddenly
in a hurry to get home.

410
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,397
Why would a man like you

411
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,692
with such an orderly life
suddenly have to hurry?

412
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:27,364
It has to do with family.

413
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,494
My wife and I have decided
that we...

414
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,791
we miss having children, after all.

415
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:41,253
And that if we are to have children,
it has to be now.

416
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:46,341
So my wife called yesterday
to say that she...

417
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,177
She started ovulating.

418
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:55,392
And all signs point to maximum
fertility precisely tonight.

419
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:57,561
You see?

420
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,064
That's why I bought her
a gift at the station.

421
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,942
I had to get a ticket home
as quickly as possible.

422
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:10,407
- Well, I understand now.
- What is it you understand?

423
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:13,201
Why you didn't have sex with us.

424
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:19,416
It wasn't because I didn't want to.

425
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,420
So you've been saving your sperm.

426
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:28,300
For weeks. I mean,
you and your wife are...

427
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,595
seem to be at an age
where every attempt

428
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,016
to become pregnant has to be
taken very seriously.

429
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:39,978
Right now, my...

430
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:46,109
My sperm quality
is at its peak, I'm told.

431
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:02,167
Please...

432
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,465
I'm begging you, please don't.

433
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,258
It's okay.

434
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:12,844
Please don't.

435
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,724
You've been as horny as hell.

436
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,727
But you wouldn't
give up your load.

437
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:22,729
Please don't.

438
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:34,533
Oh, fuck.

439
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:15,699
Wow.

440
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:31,965
In your case, it wasn't
the taste of a Madeleine cake,

441
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,842
moistened with lime blossom tea,

442
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,012
but the combination
of chocolate and sperm.

443
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,139
What?

444
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:44,770
That was a piece of
culturally blasphemic digression.

445
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,482
It's a story about memory.

446
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,525
How the combination
of two flavors

447
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:52,778
set off a chain of memories.

448
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:59,451
So oral sex became,
in the eye of the angler,

449
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:04,247
your... your Finnish weapon.

450
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,416
Joe: Is that your only comment?

451
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:10,462
What else... What else
do you want me to say?

452
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:14,424
That I behaved reprehensibly.

453
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,803
That already my actions exemplify

454
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:20,972
that I'm a...
I'm a terrible human being.

455
00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:24,351
That's not the way I see it.

456
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,937
On the contrary, I saw it as a...

457
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,648
A very pleasurable
and humorous story.

458
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:34,194
Not at all sad, or...
or weighed down by sin.

459
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,196
Like all that talk
about Pandora's Box.

460
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:40,242
I've consciously used
and hurt others...

461
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:43,245
for the sake of
my own satisfaction.

462
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,706
And what I've told you so far
only begins to suggest that.

463
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:49,334
But when you told the story,
you were cheerful.

464
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,919
Full of humor.

465
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:55,132
It wasn't as if you embarked
on some tragic tale.

466
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,384
Well, that's the way I am.

467
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,889
Joe: I've always loved
the chills at the start of a fever,

468
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:06,351
knowing only too well that
sickness will soon follow.

469
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,026
Man:
The only thing you've done,

470
00:44:15,193 --> 00:44:18,071
except giving a few people
an experience to remember,

471
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,573
is that you...

472
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,200
You relieved S from his load

473
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,287
in some... some youthful hubris.

474
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,375
I read somewhere that if you
keep the load too long

475
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,877
the sperm will die.

476
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:34,296
Or worse, degenerate.

477
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,883
Maybe thanks to you,
Mr. S and his wife

478
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:40,510
now have a healthy
and well-functioning child.

479
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:44,973
I discovered my power as a woman

480
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,601
and used it without
any concern for others.

481
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,061
That's completely unacceptable.

482
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:52,314
Oh, little darling...

483
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:54,149
Don't you "little darling” me.

484
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:57,903
No.

485
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,824
What I wanted to say was that

486
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,577
if you have wings, why not fly?

487
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,371
Allow me to digress.

488
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,625
I read a book about
Sikorski and helicopters

489
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,543
where the author
stressed the fact that

490
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,005
in order to take off, you tilt
the helicopter forward.

491
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,090
It looks like you're trying
to force the helicopter

492
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:23,345
down into the ground,
but the effect is the contrary.

493
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:25,388
That the velocity
takes the helicopter

494
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:29,226
and sweeps it up in the air.

495
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:32,229
The pilots say the helicopter
wants to fly.

496
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,066
It's like when you're
in a glider plane,

497
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,069
and suddenly you're lifted,

498
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,906
because of the spontaneous
emission of thermals.

499
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:48,203
Thermals is when the sun
is warming up the field,

500
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:52,499
and it emits a thermal bubble
of warm air that rises.

501
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,627
These aircraft, they want to fly.

502
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,046
It's just a little
unpredictable when.

503
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,842
You flew on that... on that train.

504
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,471
And that surprised you.

505
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:43,091
No more stories.

506
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,970
You need to sleep.

507
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,014
No, no.

508
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,850
This is beginning to amuse me.

509
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,442
I don't even know your name.

510
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,445
My name is Joe.

511
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,406
I'm Seligman.

512
00:47:08,074 --> 00:47:10,118
What a fucking ridiculous name.

513
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,039
It's Jewish.

514
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,666
You said you weren't religious.

515
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,127
No, but my great-grandfather was.

516
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,380
And my parents gave me
the name as a sort of...

517
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,842
sentimental association to Judaism.

518
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:34,642
Why let the sentimental part
of religion, as you said,

519
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:37,854
outlive religion itself?

520
00:47:41,232 --> 00:47:42,650
You have a point.

521
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:48,573
But we've always been anti-Zionists,

522
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,452
which is not the same
as being anti-Semitic,

523
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,373
as certain political powers
try to convince us.

524
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,792
Seligman...

525
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:02,379
means "the happy one.”

526
00:48:05,673 --> 00:48:07,342
So, are you happy then?

527
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:12,055
Well, I suppose I am.

528
00:48:14,015 --> 00:48:15,642
In my own way.

529
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:17,560
Even if I'm the kind of person

530
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:19,854
who cut the nails
of the right hand first.

531
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,481
What does that mean?

532
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,526
Well, I divide humanity
into two groups:

533
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:27,487
the people who cut the nails
on the left hand first,

534
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:30,615
and the people who cut the nails
of the right hand first.

535
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,410
My theory is that the people
who cut the nails

536
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:36,746
of the left hand first,
they're more light-hearted.

537
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,332
They have a tendency
to enjoy life more,

538
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,836
because they go straight
for the easiest task, and...

539
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,339
save the difficulties for later.

540
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:56,266
- So what do you do?
- Always the left hand first.

541
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,268
I don't think there's a choice.

542
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:02,230
Go for the pleasure first, always.

543
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,483
And then when you've
done the left hand,

544
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,360
only the right hand remains.

545
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:10,655
That's the easiest one left.

546
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,081
I never thought of it like that.

547
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,836
Well, you're never too old.

548
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,963
Never too old to learn.

549
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,599
Joe: That's rugelach.

550
00:49:37,765 --> 00:49:40,101
Seligman: Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it's a Jewish cake.

551
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,688
- There's that sentimentality again.
- Oh, but it's more than rugelach.

552
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,524
It's rugelach served
with a cake fork.

553
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:51,070
A rugelach, in my opinion, is pastry,

554
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:54,240
which there is no excuse
for eating with a cake fork.

555
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:58,203
To serve it with a cake fork
is irritatingly unmanly,

556
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:01,206
not to say downright feminine.

557
00:50:03,374 --> 00:50:07,128
However, it can bring us
further with the story.

558
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:13,468
I also knew someone who
consumed rugelach every day,

559
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,387
almost ritually,
with a cake fork.

560
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,891
And although we'll be
jumping a bit in time,

561
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,937
I have to tell you about Jerome.

562
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,272
As far as I can see,
the next chapter

563
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:28,942
doesn't contain
as direct an accusation

564
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:32,570
against my person
as the rest of the story.

565
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:35,532
But as you've read
a great deal, apparently,

566
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:38,159
you know that in a story
things have to be good

567
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,119
before they can be bad.

568
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,086
The chapter will also make
a sentimental soul like you happy

569
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:52,840
as it contains observations
on the subject of love.

570
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,962
Can I tell you something?

571
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:15,923
Sure.

572
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,133
Sure.

573
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,094
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

574
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:21,971
It might not be important to you...

575
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,222
But it is to me.

576
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:24,807
But it is to me.

577
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,519
I've never had an orgasm before.

578
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:33,858
Really?

579
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,864
You're my first one.

580
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,410
You don't know how happy
that makes me.

581
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:50,208
I love you.

582
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,382
You're my first.

583
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,346
Well, I have to admit,

584
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,807
quite a lot of girls say that.

585
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,729
Joe: The train trip
had increased my appetite,

586
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:14,273
and soon B and I started a club

587
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,151
that we called
"The Little Flock."

588
00:53:18,611 --> 00:53:21,948
Mea vulva, mea maxima vulva.

589
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,324
Joe: B, of course, took the lead

590
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,284
as she was the most
daring of us.

591
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,871
She was raised Catholic.
I'm sure you're familiar

592
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:31,791
with the practices
of the Catholic Church.

593
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:36,087
All: ...mea maxima vulva.
Mea vulva, mea...

594
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,714
Seligman: That's interesting.

595
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,967
Blasphemic, satanic.

596
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:46,222
The music. The interval
between "B" and

597
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,142
It's a tritone.
The devil's interval.

598
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:52,687
It was banned from music
in the Middle Ages.

599
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,691
Well, the Vacuum Cleaner invented it.

600
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,735
She took piano lessons.

601
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,653
Vacuum Cleaner?

602
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:04,866
The Vacuum Cleaner possessed
a special talent for floppy cocks.

603
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,995
She had some kind of vacuum
in her cunt.

604
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,706
I was imagining something like that.

605
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,625
Fourteenth of the eighth.

606
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:17,336
I was at a place called The Donkey.

607
00:54:17,503 --> 00:54:20,548
The boys were staring,
University hangout.

608
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,633
I approached the stupidest
one of the lot

609
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,219
and asked for directions
to the underground.

610
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:27,180
He studied literature.

611
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:31,225
I told him I read a lot,
and that I really admired people

612
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:33,644
that chose to study subjects
in depth.

613
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,856
As I said, he was very stupid.

614
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,649
Told me all about Kierkegaard.

615
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:40,485
I nodded, smiled.

616
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:42,111
Then he asked
if we could go elsewhere.

617
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,865
The idiot thought he'd pulled me
after five minutes of his bullshit.

618
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,493
I told him I was on my period,

619
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,538
and I took out his cock
and gave him a hand job.

620
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:57,627
Ugly, little shriveled cock,
with a tight foreskin.

621
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,005
When I pulled it back,
it sort of collapsed

622
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:05,134
but it worked in the end.
University boys are disgusting.

623
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,470
And then I jacked him off
until he shook

624
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,681
in that way they do, you know.
Just before they come.

625
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,476
Then I let go of his cock and got up.

626
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,230
I left him standing up against the wall

627
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:20,817
with his pants round his ankles
looking stunned.

628
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:26,531
Now, B's message wasn't
exactly representational.

629
00:55:26,697 --> 00:55:28,991
She just had to be the tough one.

630
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,578
It was directed at the men.

631
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:37,542
It was about fucking,
and about having the right to be horny.

632
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:41,963
We masturbated together,
that kind of thing.

633
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,091
But it was rebellious.

634
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,011
We weren't allowed
to have boyfriends.

635
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:51,639
No fucking the same guy
more than once.

636
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:56,936
You said you were rebellious.
What did you rebel against?

637
00:55:57,436 --> 00:55:58,271
Love.

638
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:01,190
Love?

639
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,611
We were committed to combat
the love-fixated society.

640
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:27,592
Joe: I really believed
in our Little Flock.

641
00:56:27,758 --> 00:56:30,261
But of course,
that was naive of me.

642
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,681
Over time, even the strongest

643
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,225
couldn't stay true to our manifest.

644
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:40,313
Third of the fifth.
My third intercourse this week,

645
00:56:40,479 --> 00:56:42,273
- again with Alex.
- Third?

646
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,737
Haven't we stated that
we fuck each guy once?

647
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:50,781
Yes, but he was rather sweet.

648
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,783
Joe: Sweet?

649
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,829
- Well, you know, sexy.
- Well, then, say sexy.

650
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:00,333
He squeezed my earlobes.

651
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:03,711
Earlobes? Great.
What else did he squeeze?

652
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:10,176
I don't think
you can understand Alex.

653
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,178
I don't want to.

654
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,680
- Our relationship--
- Relationship.

655
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:16,015
There you are.

656
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,728
The way you're describing it,
which should be full of lust,

657
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,814
is just a nauseating analysis
of his future abilities

658
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:25,900
as a father to your child.

659
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,904
You think you know
everything about sex.

660
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:37,787
The secret ingredient
to sex is love.

661
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:48,422
For me, love was just lust
with jealousy added.

662
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,425
Everything else was total nonsense.

663
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:55,930
For every 100 crimes committed
in the name of love,

664
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,016
only one is committed
in the name of sex.

665
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,852
That's quite a statement.

666
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:06,357
Well, it all strengthened my
wish for a serious education.

667
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:33,426
Glasgow.

668
00:58:37,054 --> 00:58:38,139
Aberdeen.

669
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,600
Joe: Why are you smiling?

670
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:44,520
Well, I just pictured

671
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,690
how an education would be
conveyed in your storytelling.

672
00:58:48,899 --> 00:58:50,776
Well, that's nothing to smile about.

673
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,279
Oh, I understand that.

674
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:57,033
So what kind of education
did you get?

675
00:58:57,908 --> 00:59:01,120
I began studying medicine,
like my father.

676
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,249
Today we are going to perform the
procedure that's called an abortion.

677
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:09,587
We open up our cervical channel
to enter the uterus,

678
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,922
and to get access to the fetus,

679
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:15,217
for which we use
the so-called Hegal sticks.

680
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:19,513
We enter the vagina tract,
and go into the cervical channel.

681
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:22,349
We start with a small sized stick

682
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:25,436
to cause a minimum of damage
to the tissue.

683
00:59:25,811 --> 00:59:28,898
And then we increase
the size of the stick.

684
00:59:29,273 --> 00:59:32,234
Joe: But it was harder and
harder for me to concentrate,

685
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:36,655
so I studied less and less,
till finally I dropped out.

686
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:42,745
My dad was very disappointed
when I stopped.

687
00:59:43,662 --> 00:59:46,123
But it was the only time
I saw my mother really smile

688
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,293
when she said,
"What did I tell you?"

689
00:59:52,546 --> 00:59:55,091
So instead, I began
to look for a job.

690
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,386
It turned out
it was hard to get a job

691
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:02,181
that paid even halfway decently.

692
01:00:03,265 --> 01:00:06,143
I didn't really know
how to do anything.

693
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:09,605
So I didn't have high hopes
when I applied for a position

694
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,441
as an assistant
at a printing house.

695
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:15,861
Woman: So, could you tell me
a little bit more

696
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:19,031
about your background?

697
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,825
Um...

698
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:24,328
- Woman: Education-wise.
- Oh.

699
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:29,834
Well, I finished high school,
and decided to study medicine.

700
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,670
But I didn't finish.

701
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,339
I know it sounds a bit
pointless coming here.

702
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,925
- Right.
- I just really need a job.

703
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,969
And I've tried everywhere.

704
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,764
I don't usually give jobs to people
just because they need one.

705
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:49,645
What about secretarial skills?
Do you have any of those?

706
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,398
No, I didn't think
you needed skills.

707
01:00:54,191 --> 01:00:56,861
You didn't think you needed
skills for this position

708
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:59,405
- as a secretary?
- No.

709
01:00:59,905 --> 01:01:01,740
Can you open an envelope?

710
01:01:02,366 --> 01:01:05,411
Yes, I... Yes, I think
I can open an envelope.

711
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,580
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

712
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:13,377
I shall discuss this conversation
with Mr. Jerome, my boss.

713
01:01:16,046 --> 01:01:19,133
Joe: Do you think
there's a chance?

714
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:23,095
- I doubt it.
- Oh.

715
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:47,328
Well, apparently,
having absolutely no experience

716
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,914
is absolutely fine for this job.

717
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,457
You've got it.

718
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,378
Does that mean
I should start tomorrow?

719
01:01:57,254 --> 01:01:58,839
Yeah, I suppose it does.

720
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:03,093
- Joe: Good morning.
- Woman: Right.

721
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:12,645
Yes?

722
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,733
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

723
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,361
I just wanted to introduce you
to our new junior secretary.

724
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:23,239
Joe? I believe you wanted
to explain her work duties.

725
01:02:23,405 --> 01:02:24,907
- Hi.
- This is the new junior secretary.

726
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,533
Liz, can I have another coffee?

727
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,993
- Yes, of course, sir.
- Thank you.

728
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,206
Hi.

729
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,338
- Jerome.
- Your first love.

730
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,638
I bet you didn't think I'd make
something of myself, right?

731
01:02:48,013 --> 01:02:49,473
And now, here I sit.

732
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,850
The director's chair
of M & J Morris, Ltd.

733
01:02:56,188 --> 01:02:58,274
- Yeah, it's quite surprising.
- Surprising?

734
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,609
It's a sign from God.

735
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,366
You know, I've thought
about you often since then.

736
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:10,828
Have you thought of me?

737
01:03:13,747 --> 01:03:16,000
- Well...
- What?

738
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:19,378
Usually, you know,
my uncle sits here.

739
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,005
But he's developed a bit
of a tummy problem,

740
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:22,715
so he's at the spa,
taking long baths,

741
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:26,135
drinking lots of water, poor guy.
And no one knows for how long.

742
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,596
So now I'm the "J"
in M & J Morris, Ltd.

743
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:31,098
How about that?

744
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,393
We print cards and envelopes,
nonsense like that.

745
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:36,937
It's a bloody complicated
business, you know.

746
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,522
I don't understand a word of it.

747
01:03:39,773 --> 01:03:42,401
Come, I'll show you around. Yes?

748
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,069
- Ladies?
- Woman: Yes, sir.

749
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:46,280
Oh, look, there you are.
Good job.

750
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,657
Every time you do a good job,
I say, "Good job, Liz."”

751
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:50,492
- Thank you, sir.
- What's her name?

752
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:52,328
- Liz.
- Good job, Liz.

753
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:54,538
- Good job, Liz.
- Good job, Liz.

754
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,641
It stopped.

755
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,518
Fuck.

756
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,106
Yes.

757
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,527
- Well, isn't there an alarm?
- Which?

758
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,447
- Isn't there...
- Alarm, right, yes.

759
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,367
Good thinking.

760
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:35,913
Imagine...

761
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:39,249
you look just as great
all these years later.

762
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:40,918
Oh, no.

763
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:47,591
- No.
- No?

764
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,220
No, Jerome, this won't work.

765
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,972
- Which won't work?
- This.

766
01:04:56,683 --> 01:04:57,726
Why not?

767
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:00,270
You're not really my type.

768
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,108
That's how it's gonna be?

769
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,860
- Yes.
- All right.

770
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:14,743
Fuck's sake.

771
01:05:24,586 --> 01:05:25,546
Okay.

772
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,974
Joe: Um...

773
01:05:37,182 --> 01:05:38,434
Give me your hand.

774
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,562
We'll do fireman's grip.

775
01:05:43,605 --> 01:05:45,107
- You okay?
- Yeah.

776
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,903
Why didn't you
have sex with him?

777
01:05:52,072 --> 01:05:54,366
You must have had sex
in a lift before.

778
01:05:56,577 --> 01:06:00,372
I'm not quite sure.
I've shagged lots of idiots.

779
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,167
Including worse idiots than him.

780
01:06:05,335 --> 01:06:06,753
Of course, I...

781
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,923
I regretted that it had
been him back then.

782
01:06:10,966 --> 01:06:13,427
But that's just sentimental drivel.

783
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,887
And I'm not sentimental.

784
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,973
I suppose he fired you then.

785
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,560
No. If he had fired me,
then he would have lost.

786
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,482
Joe: As I didn't recall anyone

787
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:28,358
having defined my work duties,

788
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:32,279
I decided to clean up in order
to smooth the waters.

789
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,371
Liz: Good morning, sir.

790
01:06:41,538 --> 01:06:43,540
- Any calls?
- No, sir.

791
01:06:49,963 --> 01:06:53,842
- What have you done?
- Oh. I cleaned up.

792
01:06:54,384 --> 01:06:56,094
You cleaned up.

793
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,597
- It was quite messy, and--
- Liz?

794
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,600
- Yes, sir?
- She cleaned up.

795
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,353
I know, I... I didn't know, sir.

796
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,647
- I was away from my desk.
- Are you completely mad?

797
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,572
What is the tea
and pastry doing here?

798
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,366
I thought that's
what you wanted for--

799
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,661
You thought?
You're not supposed to think.

800
01:07:20,827 --> 01:07:23,080
I don't pay you to think, do 1?
This is a do-over.

801
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,623
- A do-over...
- Right.

802
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,543
Pick it up. Take it outside.
And do it again.

803
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,182
One moment.

804
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,858
Come in.

805
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,197
Would now be a good time
for some tea and cake?

806
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,657
Sure, why not?

807
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,911
Where the fuck's my cake fork?

808
01:08:03,328 --> 01:08:04,913
- Cake fork?
- Right.

809
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,793
Well, I would have got you one,
but it just... feels inappropriate.

810
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:29,187
Unmanly.

811
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:30,647
Feminine.

812
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:32,608
Well, on the other hand,

813
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:36,862
you must say that a cake fork
is a rather practical tool.

814
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:42,075
It's like a cross between
a knife and a fork.

815
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,703
The point is that you're
supposed to be able

816
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,705
to hold the cake dish
with one hand

817
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,540
and then cut it with the other.

818
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:52,377
And then eat it with the fork.

819
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,631
It's not feminine,
it's at least bourgeois.

820
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:58,842
It's said that the Bolsheviks,

821
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,011
during their rampage
through Russia,

822
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:02,721
to separate the men from the boys,

823
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,641
or rather the bourgeoisie
from the proletariat,

824
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,810
they brought a boy,
and before burning down a house

825
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:12,522
they sent him in to make sure
they had cake forks.

826
01:09:17,277 --> 01:09:20,197
That's not true.

827
01:09:22,532 --> 01:09:24,576
I don't have the story first-hand.

828
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,036
Joe: Hello.

829
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:28,664
- Man: Hi.
- Joe: Hi.

830
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:31,166
I was wondering
if you could help me.

831
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,795
It's suddenly gone very dirty.
See, yes?

832
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:38,340
See, you've got your dirty
fingers on there.

833
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,425
Maybe we should
wash your hands.

834
01:09:40,592 --> 01:09:42,052
Yeah, better.

835
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:46,056
Mm-hmm.

836
01:09:46,264 --> 01:09:48,850
- You must be very talented.
- Yeah, sure.

837
01:09:49,017 --> 01:09:49,768
Hmm.

838
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,397
You see, here's got a stain.

839
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,119
Joe: If you'd asked
Jerome, he would have said

840
01:10:07,285 --> 01:10:09,413
that I was the one
who'd declared war.

841
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:16,169
Many times he'd take me into town
just so I could hold his coat.

842
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:19,047
- Joe: There.
- Jerome: Where?

843
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:21,174
Joe: There, behind the green car.

844
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,096
- It's not big enough.
- It is, there's plenty of space.

845
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,351
I saw it, it's not enough space.

846
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,770
I'm telling you,
there's plenty of space.

847
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,911
No. It's too small a space
for such a long car.

848
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:54,374
Can |I try?

849
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,254
- Can you try?
- I'm a wizard at this.

850
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,797
I just tried, it's not enough space, Joe.

851
01:11:00,964 --> 01:11:03,675
You just saw me do it.
It's not enough space, okay?

852
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,471
-Can I try?
- Fuck. You want to try?

853
01:11:10,056 --> 01:11:11,183
Why not?

854
01:11:26,114 --> 01:11:27,491
Stupid.

855
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:09,616
Joe: It was about
this time that a dramatic change

856
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:11,701
happened inside of me.

857
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,666
I could suddenly see a kind
of order in the mess.

858
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:31,304
Are you just standing here looking?

859
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,810
Yeah. I've begun to like his mess.

860
01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:39,229
How do you mean?

861
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:43,608
Well, these are all things
placed by Jerome.

862
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:46,152
I mean, by Jerome's hands.

863
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:50,615
Sounds to me like you would like
to be handled by Mr. Jerome.

864
01:12:52,492 --> 01:12:54,744
Darling, you're in love with him.

865
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,085
It was all very, very wrong.

866
01:13:03,503 --> 01:13:06,089
I wanted to be one of Jerome's things.

867
01:13:06,923 --> 01:13:11,553
I wanted to be picked up
and put down, again and again.

868
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:15,348
I wanted to be
treated by his hands

869
01:13:15,515 --> 01:13:18,476
according to some
sophisticated principle

870
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:20,729
that I didn't understand.

871
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,939
His strong hands?

872
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:26,902
Yes, but now it was no longer
just about his hands.

873
01:13:27,068 --> 01:13:30,322
It's as if everything
about him was different,

874
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:34,200
which, of course, it wasn't
and I knew that in my head.

875
01:13:34,367 --> 01:13:38,079
And I scolded myself
for seeing him in this new light.

876
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,084
- Love is blind.
- No, no, no, it's worse.

877
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:45,921
Love distorts things.

878
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,633
Or even worse...
love is something

879
01:13:49,799 --> 01:13:51,468
you've never asked for.

880
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:57,098
The erotic was something I asked for,
or even demanded of men.

881
01:13:57,265 --> 01:14:00,018
But this idiotic love...

882
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:03,897
I felt humiliated by it,

883
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:07,275
and all the dishonesty that follows.

884
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:12,113
The erotic is about saying yes.

885
01:14:13,865 --> 01:14:16,868
Love appeals to
the lowest instincts,

886
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,954
wrapped up in lies.

887
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:23,541
How do you say "yes"”
when you mean "no," and vice versa.

888
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:29,673
I'm ashamed of what I became.

889
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,676
But it was beyond my control.

890
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:39,057
- You know what you're doing now?
- No, what am I doing?

891
01:14:39,599 --> 01:14:41,851
You're defending your personality.

892
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,980
I thought the point was to reveal it.

893
01:14:57,117 --> 01:15:01,287
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

894
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,166
Thank you meaning, "That's all.”

895
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,424
You can go now.
Goodbye, Joe.

896
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:29,983
Joe: At this time,
I took up walking again.

897
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,568
Seligman:
You walked in the forest?

898
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:34,195
Joe: Yes, I walked in the forest.

899
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:42,162
The forest of my childhood.

900
01:15:43,371 --> 01:15:46,416
I took the same walk
again and again.

901
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,878
Right turn after the gatehouse,

902
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,756
and right again by the ash tree,

903
01:15:52,922 --> 01:15:55,633
which has the most beautiful leaves
in the forest,

904
01:15:57,302 --> 01:16:00,847
and further on,
past a lady with her poodle,

905
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,767
and the old man on the bench.

906
01:16:11,107 --> 01:16:14,194
I couldn't free myself
of the image of Jerome

907
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,321
and his careless elegance.

908
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:26,247
And during this time,
when I was with other men,

909
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,418
I forbade them to touch
my body with their hands.

910
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:37,717
And soon, I stopped
having sex altogether.

911
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:42,138
I tried to meet him all the time.

912
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,891
I found out where he lived,

913
01:16:45,558 --> 01:16:48,269
but of course,
never dared ring his doorbell.

914
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:55,068
I even started humiliating
myself on purpose

915
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:57,362
in order for him to notice me.

916
01:17:17,632 --> 01:17:19,509
You broke a taillight.

917
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,178
I did.

918
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,765
I thought you were such
a wizard at parking.

919
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,017
So did I.

920
01:17:29,018 --> 01:17:30,979
It'll be deducted from your salary.

921
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,942
It's a long car.

922
01:17:39,612 --> 01:17:42,323
Joe: I worked for
a long time on a letter

923
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:45,285
in which I told him about
my feelings for him,

924
01:17:45,451 --> 01:17:48,246
but couldn't bring myself
to hand it over.

925
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,750
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

926
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:54,836
Joe: A month would pass

927
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,882
before I had built up
enough courage to deliver it.

928
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,242
Well, I've written him
a letter after all.

929
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:31,456
Do you think that the letter
is a bad idea?

930
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,544
No, I think it's
the right thing to do.

931
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:42,217
I'm just... I think maybe
you should wait until Friday.

932
01:18:42,383 --> 01:18:43,468
Why?

933
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:46,512
He's always in a good mood
on Fridays.

934
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:49,057
Okay.

935
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,622
I'm sorry, isn't this...
Jerome's office?

936
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:16,459
I'm happy to say that this
never has been

937
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,920
and never will be Jerome's office.

938
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:23,508
My nephew has been standing in for me
while I've been unwell.

939
01:19:24,008 --> 01:19:26,970
What's that? A letter for him?

940
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:28,972
Yes.

941
01:19:29,138 --> 01:19:32,267
Give it to me
and I'll make sure he gets it.

942
01:19:36,896 --> 01:19:40,817
Can't promise when that might be
because he's long gone.

943
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:45,405
How the young finance
their irrepressible desire

944
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:47,323
for travel is a mystery to me.

945
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:51,411
- So he's gone?
- Deserted us, yes.

946
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,081
Raving about a trip around the world,

947
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:57,625
- and married, and all.
- Married?

948
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,460
Marriage, yes.

949
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,922
Flown the coop with my secretary.

950
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:04,757
Liz.

951
01:20:12,932 --> 01:20:14,517
And your job?

952
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,186
Well, it turned out
that Jerome's uncle

953
01:20:17,353 --> 01:20:20,857
demanded a bit more knowledge
about the business, so...

954
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:21,858
I see.

955
01:20:23,192 --> 01:20:25,570
Well, as for evidence of you
being a bad human being,

956
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:27,739
there wasn't much to go on
in this chapter.

957
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:32,035
Yes, as I said.
At least superficially.

958
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:36,414
- I suppose you were jealous.
- No, I wasn't jealous.

959
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,915
I didn't know that feeling.

960
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:42,086
It's almost superhuman
not to feel jealousy.

961
01:20:43,546 --> 01:20:45,465
Well, that was the end of love, then?

962
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:50,219
Well, maybe not quite as simple.

963
01:20:51,804 --> 01:20:56,601
But more about that later,
as they say in the novels.

964
01:20:56,976 --> 01:20:59,645
And Jerome just disappeared?

965
01:21:00,938 --> 01:21:05,860
Yes. Though I'd tried to keep him
in my own way, mentally,

966
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:09,697
as I masturbated on the train
amongst other people.

967
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,118
You masturbated on the train,
on the seat?

968
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:17,205
- Yes, of course.
- And that's possible?

969
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:21,292
Easily.
You just put your coat in your lap.

970
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:25,671
It can be done silently
without expression.

971
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:27,715
The only thing
that could give me away

972
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:31,803
and mostly to women,
was my open mouth when I came.

973
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:48,694
Joe: I did a jigsaw puzzle.

974
01:21:48,861 --> 01:21:50,905
Seligman: A jigsaw puzzle?

975
01:21:55,034 --> 01:21:58,037
Joe: I found details
in the other passengers

976
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:00,373
that reminded me of Jerome.

977
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:56,762
Joe: But in the long run,

978
01:22:56,929 --> 01:22:59,098
I couldn't hold onto
the details of him,

979
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:01,684
no matter how hard I tried.

980
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,187
So, you could say that in a way,

981
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:07,857
Jerome followed you
as a kind of silhouette.

982
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:11,569
Yes, but gradually disappearing
as a sexual being.

983
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:16,782
Maybe that's how it is with memory.
You remember silhouettes.

984
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:18,659
The essentials.

985
01:23:18,826 --> 01:23:21,746
But that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

986
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:28,002
Joe: Of course
there's silhouettes in the winter.

987
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,296
The trees are difficult
to tell apart.

988
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,881
These buds...

989
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:33,799
Joe: My father
wrestled courageously

990
01:23:33,966 --> 01:23:36,969
with his flora
and tree type guides.

991
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:40,056
It's actually...

992
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:45,937
the souls of the trees
we see in the winter.

993
01:23:46,562 --> 01:23:48,189
In summer, everything's
green and idyllic,

994
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:53,027
but in the winter, the branches
and the trunks, they all stand out.

995
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,446
Look at how crooked they all are.

996
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,451
The branches have to carry
all of the leaves into the sunlight.

997
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:04,914
It's one long struggle for survival.

998
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:11,003
Joe: My father surprised
me by calling the naked trunks

999
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:13,381
the souls of the trees.

1000
01:24:14,131 --> 01:24:16,759
A poetic thought
that was rare for him,

1001
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:20,596
as by his own account, he preferred
the empirical sciences.

1002
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,893
Seligman: And after Jerome?

1003
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,772
I reacted, um...

1004
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:33,317
Well, let's just say... aggressively.

1005
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,906
- How?
- By intensifying my hunt for men.

1006
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:43,661
Joe: You know
these supermarket doors

1007
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:46,747
that open and close by way
of some kind of sensor?

1008
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,251
Now compare these doors
to my cunt,

1009
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,713
and add an extraordinarily
sensitive sensor.

1010
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,468
My sensitive door opening
gave me an opportunity

1011
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:04,432
to develop my morphological studies
from knees to genitals.

1012
01:25:09,478 --> 01:25:14,317
I embarked on a trip through, what,
in the lingo of children's books,

1013
01:25:14,483 --> 01:25:18,321
one might call, "The Country
of the Big, Bad Cocks."

1014
01:25:20,906 --> 01:25:24,869
"The Country of the Small
Yellow Cocks," and so on.

1015
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:27,663
And most of all, I battled my way

1016
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:30,666
through an untold number
of circumcised cocks.

1017
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:35,254
By the way, did you know
that if you combine

1018
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:38,007
all the foreskin cut off
through history,

1019
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:41,135
it would reach to Mars
and back again?

1020
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:01,781
Joe: "Mrs. H."

1021
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:20,257
Joe: By now, I had
built up a sizable circle of men,

1022
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:24,053
and was starting to have trouble
remembering who was who.

1023
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,097
Man: Hello, sweetheart.
Want to meet?

1024
01:26:26,263 --> 01:26:27,723
Man 2: It's Fisher.

1025
01:26:27,973 --> 01:26:30,685
I'm lying here thinking
of you and what you said.

1026
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:32,812
I'm not angry at all if that's
what you're thinking.

1027
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,481
Man 3: Hi, Joe. It's Rob again.

1028
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:37,149
I had a really
good time seeing you.

1029
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:38,734
Give me a... Give me a call.

1030
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:40,820
Man 4: Hi, Joe.

1031
01:26:40,986 --> 01:26:43,239
I left a couple of messages.
Is everything all right?

1032
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,950
Joe: I quickly gave up
trying to remember

1033
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:50,663
the individual relationships.
It was impossible.

1034
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:54,250
And impossible to predict
what they wanted to hear.

1035
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:57,461
So |I invented a method.

1036
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:03,342
Joe: It was all based on chance.

1037
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:09,807
Joe: A one meant
an overly loving answer.

1038
01:27:13,227 --> 01:27:16,439
A two, not quite as passionate,
but still positive.

1039
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:20,317
And so on, up to five,
which was a complete rejection.

1040
01:27:20,484 --> 01:27:23,320
And six, no answer at all.

1041
01:27:25,948 --> 01:27:29,827
The trick with this method
was that I didn't have to worry about

1042
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:31,912
the individual relationships,

1043
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:35,124
but instead became
completely unpredictable,

1044
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:38,461
which, of course,
drove the men even wilder.

1045
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:42,131
Hey, Eddie, it's me.

1046
01:27:42,298 --> 01:27:44,008
Listen, I've given this
a lot of thought,

1047
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:47,261
and I've come to the conclusion
that we're done. Bye.

1048
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:51,474
I was just wondering
if you wanted to come back,

1049
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,684
and maybe we can
do something nice.

1050
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:56,437
Hi, Patrick, it's Joe.

1051
01:27:56,604 --> 01:28:00,065
I had a really lovely time with you,
and I'd love for you to come back.

1052
01:28:00,232 --> 01:28:03,402
If you're interested,
let me know. Bye.

1053
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:07,490
I really don't think we match,
and you're quite annoying,

1054
01:28:08,365 --> 01:28:11,911
so I don't want to see you anymore.
Please don't call back.

1055
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:14,830
Seligman: That sounds rather stressful.

1056
01:28:14,997 --> 01:28:16,832
Joe: Yes, actually, it was.

1057
01:28:16,999 --> 01:28:20,920
But fortunately, I had
my little book of comfort.

1058
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:28,052
When I needed comfort or peace,
I took out my herbarium

1059
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:30,095
and looked at my favorite leaves.

1060
01:28:30,262 --> 01:28:34,683
Ash, trembling aspen and lime.

1061
01:28:42,733 --> 01:28:44,985
When you're dealing
with a larger group of lovers

1062
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:49,740
as I was, there will typically be
a difference in their qualities.

1063
01:28:50,032 --> 01:28:52,201
H was a sticky bastard.

1064
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:56,372
I had invited A for dinner,
as he was my favorite,

1065
01:28:56,539 --> 01:29:00,709
while H, who was present,
had become quite irritating.

1066
01:29:00,876 --> 01:29:03,045
You have to leave.
I've got guests for dinner.

1067
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:04,922
But he's not coming until seven.

1068
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,301
No. But seven isn't that far away.

1069
01:29:17,768 --> 01:29:19,436
Do you love me?

1070
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:24,608
Joe: A was to arrive at seven,

1071
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:27,486
and I needed to get H
out of there.

1072
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,740
I love you too much.

1073
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:36,495
You keep promising,
but I understand now

1074
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:40,207
that you'll never leave
your family for my sake.

1075
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:44,044
It's sad, but...

1076
01:29:46,088 --> 01:29:47,256
it's your choice.

1077
01:29:49,091 --> 01:29:52,261
It's not satisfying for me that
I can't have you completely.

1078
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,517
Which is why we can't
see each other any longer.

1079
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:04,273
Goodbye.

1080
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:09,820
Look...

1081
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,994
Have a nice life.

1082
01:30:42,978 --> 01:30:46,023
My darling, I'm yours.

1083
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:47,983
I've left her.

1084
01:30:56,241 --> 01:30:59,161
- Woman: Has he gone inside?
- Boy: Yes.

1085
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:02,289
Woman: Is the door closed?

1086
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:16,637
- Woman: Uh, hello.
- Joe: Hello.

1087
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:19,682
Apologize. We, uh...

1088
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:22,351
had promised not to come up.

1089
01:31:22,518 --> 01:31:25,270
We just wanted to...

1090
01:31:25,437 --> 01:31:28,774
make sure he got here safely,
now that he's...

1091
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:30,484
made the big decision.

1092
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:35,698
May the children see him inside?

1093
01:31:35,864 --> 01:31:38,492
They say that the experience
of saying goodbye

1094
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:41,620
can be very useful later
when dealing with trauma.

1095
01:31:58,554 --> 01:31:59,847
What a nice place.

1096
01:32:01,348 --> 01:32:04,268
It's, uh... so bohemian.

1097
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:07,980
We used to have a place
like this before we were...

1098
01:32:08,147 --> 01:32:09,857
we were married.

1099
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:13,485
Before the children,
me and my husband.

1100
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:19,033
Oh, I'm sorry.
He isn't anymore, is he?

1101
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:22,369
It's all so new and confusing.

1102
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:30,085
He wanted to give us
everything, but, uh...

1103
01:32:31,253 --> 01:32:33,297
Of course we couldn't accept that.

1104
01:32:35,549 --> 01:32:37,009
Oh, that's right.

1105
01:32:37,843 --> 01:32:40,679
- You need the car key.
- No, I don't need the car.

1106
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:42,723
Oh, yes, you do.

1107
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,391
He likes the car.

1108
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,394
Here.

1109
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:49,438
- Please, just take it.
- I don't want it.

1110
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:52,316
- Just take it.
- I don't want the fucking car!

1111
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:59,948
It's all right.
We'll get the bus home.

1112
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:03,619
Children might as well get used
to public transport now, right?

1113
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:08,540
Of course, their standard of living
won't be the same anymore, but...

1114
01:33:12,961 --> 01:33:15,214
I'm not saying that
to bother anyone.

1115
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:17,800
One has to be realistic.

1116
01:33:22,012 --> 01:33:23,263
Hey.

1117
01:33:25,432 --> 01:33:26,600
What's this?

1118
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,685
It's a present.

1119
01:33:29,603 --> 01:33:32,773
A pillow he has embroidered himself.

1120
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:36,193
- Wife: And who's it for?
- Daddy.

1121
01:33:38,237 --> 01:33:40,322
I do hope it's all right
if the children

1122
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:41,824
call their father "Daddy" here.

1123
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:45,536
If you prefer, they can call him...

1124
01:33:45,702 --> 01:33:49,706
"him,"” or simply, "the man."

1125
01:33:49,873 --> 01:33:52,417
Whatever.

1126
01:33:56,338 --> 01:33:58,006
"Whatever."

1127
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:01,593
Must be hard when
you've got everything,

1128
01:34:02,469 --> 01:34:04,012
to know what to say.

1129
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:06,974
To be honest,
my first thought was never,

1130
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,143
ever to let either
of you see the children,

1131
01:34:09,309 --> 01:34:11,562
but then I changed my mind.

1132
01:34:11,728 --> 01:34:14,106
I thought it only right that
their father be confronted

1133
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:16,775
by the little people
whose lives he's destroyed.

1134
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:20,654
Give Daddy your present.

1135
01:34:24,324 --> 01:34:27,494
Wife: It's a car the little dear
has embroidered.

1136
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:32,124
I'm aware that
not everyone can see it, but...

1137
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:34,960
with the heart one can see much,

1138
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:38,463
however unimportant that
information may be to you.

1139
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:44,845
Would it be all right if I show
the children the whoring bed?

1140
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:49,474
After all, they also had
a stake in this event.

1141
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:55,272
Wife: You need to see it.
Right?

1142
01:34:56,273 --> 01:34:58,150
Let's go see
Daddy's favorite place.

1143
01:34:59,234 --> 01:35:01,403
Come on, boys.

1144
01:35:02,779 --> 01:35:04,698
Oh!

1145
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:11,079
So this is where it all happened.

1146
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:20,547
You should try to
memorize this room.

1147
01:35:21,173 --> 01:35:23,217
Especially the bed.

1148
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,511
It'll stand you in good stead
later in therapy.

1149
01:35:26,678 --> 01:35:28,013
Oh.

1150
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,599
Here I sit rambling on about therapy

1151
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,809
without a thought
of what it might cost.

1152
01:35:32,976 --> 01:35:36,021
I do hope you don't think
we're here to beg.

1153
01:35:39,858 --> 01:35:41,276
I'm sorry.

1154
01:35:41,443 --> 01:35:43,612
I'm sorry.

1155
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:46,406
Being silly. Mommy's being silly.

1156
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:49,493
Let's have a cup of tea.

1157
01:36:08,136 --> 01:36:10,305
Wife: Hope it's not too weak.

1158
01:36:10,472 --> 01:36:13,183
Afraid I'm rather nervous.

1159
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:23,151
The children's father likes
two lumps of sugar in his tea.

1160
01:36:41,503 --> 01:36:43,130
Wife: Mm-mm.
I'll get it.

1161
01:36:43,338 --> 01:36:45,549
- Joe: Mm-mm.
- No, no, please, please.

1162
01:36:47,634 --> 01:36:50,012
- Hello.
- Hello.

1163
01:36:50,178 --> 01:36:52,014
- Yes?
- Uh...

1164
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:54,558
How nice. Lovely.

1165
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:58,103
- Boys, come here.
- Is Joe here?

1166
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:59,438
This might be interesting.

1167
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,816
- This is my son.
- Yes.

1168
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:04,568
- Yes.
- Hello, hello.

1169
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:07,237
- Look him in the eyes.
- I'm Andy. Hello.

1170
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:09,281
- Friend of Joe's then?
- Yeah.

1171
01:37:09,448 --> 01:37:12,909
- You known each other long?
- Uh... Not that long, no.

1172
01:37:13,076 --> 01:37:14,703
- Not very long?
- No.

1173
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:15,746
Oh.

1174
01:37:23,628 --> 01:37:25,922
Wife: A menage-a-trots.

1175
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,052
It's all so exotic.

1176
01:37:30,218 --> 01:37:33,013
So broad-minded.

1177
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:38,435
On that point... I failed.

1178
01:37:39,436 --> 01:37:40,771
No doubt about it.

1179
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:47,069
Boys, now is the time to be alert,

1180
01:37:47,235 --> 01:37:50,739
and ask all the questions
your heart's desire.

1181
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,618
Because...

1182
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:57,913
I hope that you shall
never have to encounter

1183
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,333
such people or be in such
a situation ever again.

1184
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:06,880
Wife: Well, hmm?
You don't have any questions?

1185
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:09,132
No?

1186
01:38:11,635 --> 01:38:14,262
Well, I'll start, shall I?

1187
01:38:14,429 --> 01:38:16,932
Approximately, how many lives...

1188
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:20,352
do you think she has time
to destroy in one day?

1189
01:38:20,519 --> 01:38:23,605
Five? 507

1190
01:38:24,731 --> 01:38:26,733
Or several hundreds?

1191
01:38:27,859 --> 01:38:30,737
I admit the latter sounds improbable,

1192
01:38:30,904 --> 01:38:34,741
but where there's a will
there's a way.

1193
01:38:42,999 --> 01:38:46,628
Look, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

1194
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,051
Boys?

1195
01:38:55,303 --> 01:38:57,431
I don't... I don't love your father.

1196
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:01,268
Wife: She's just saying that
to make us feel better.

1197
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:03,270
I'm sure you understand that.

1198
01:39:04,062 --> 01:39:06,356
Because if it were a joke,
I mean...

1199
01:39:07,482 --> 01:39:12,279
If... this were really a joke,
then it would be a joke so cruel.

1200
01:39:17,742 --> 01:39:21,204
No one can be that cruel.

1201
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:27,586
They say that even the Huns
on their rampage

1202
01:39:27,752 --> 01:39:31,548
were rather unreserved,
but to split up a family...

1203
01:39:34,885 --> 01:39:38,805
To destroy a mesh of feelings
woven over 20 years

1204
01:39:38,972 --> 01:39:42,017
is no joke, I can assure you.

1205
01:39:52,027 --> 01:39:53,278
Well...

1206
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:57,574
If three's a crowd,
then seven must be

1207
01:39:57,741 --> 01:40:00,410
a bit of a challenge
for the pretty miss.

1208
01:40:02,537 --> 01:40:07,125
I must say I have a hard time
picturing her enjoying loneliness.

1209
01:40:09,544 --> 01:40:12,881
I think we better grab
the chance to get away

1210
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:15,467
before things become grotesque.

1211
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:21,556
No, no, no!

1212
01:40:24,142 --> 01:40:27,312
You wouldn't want to give your father
a guilty conscience now, would you?

1213
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,519
So how did this episode
affect your life?

1214
01:41:08,895 --> 01:41:10,230
Not at all.

1215
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:15,193
- Not at all?
- No.

1216
01:41:16,152 --> 01:41:19,197
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

1217
01:41:23,827 --> 01:41:25,662
Well, that's true.

1218
01:41:28,665 --> 01:41:32,085
Some people... blame the addict.

1219
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:36,256
Other people feel sorry
for the addict.

1220
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:41,052
But I was an addict out of lust,
not out of need.

1221
01:41:41,803 --> 01:41:43,597
You would say that, wouldn't you?

1222
01:41:44,472 --> 01:41:47,892
And lust that led to
destruction around me,

1223
01:41:48,059 --> 01:41:49,519
everywhere I went.

1224
01:41:51,229 --> 01:41:55,775
Seligman: Well, addiction
sometimes leads to an...

1225
01:41:55,942 --> 01:41:57,777
absence of empathy.

1226
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:00,780
You can't fight a lion

1227
01:42:00,947 --> 01:42:03,575
and blow the noses
of your children at the same time.

1228
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:09,247
For me, nymphomania
was callousness.

1229
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,210
Seligman: You're very stubborn.

1230
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:17,339
But what about yourself?

1231
01:42:18,256 --> 01:42:20,759
How did you feel during all this?

1232
01:42:30,727 --> 01:42:33,772
Did you feel good,
or did you feel bad?

1233
01:42:41,821 --> 01:42:44,324
It's funny because
when I think about my life

1234
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:49,162
as a whole, I can only say
that I felt good.

1235
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:53,875
But when I try and remember
a specific episode,

1236
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:57,295
I'd say that just then
I felt rather bad.

1237
01:42:57,462 --> 01:42:59,047
Seligman: In what way?

1238
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:07,764
Mrs. H was right
about the loneliness.

1239
01:43:08,556 --> 01:43:12,852
I'd be lying if I said it hadn't
been my constant companion.

1240
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:19,818
Seligman: So you were with all
these men, and you still felt alone?

1241
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:29,285
I didn't want to tell you about it.

1242
01:43:30,912 --> 01:43:33,415
But you've led me into a trap.

1243
01:43:36,668 --> 01:43:39,212
It was a certain feeling.

1244
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:48,596
Oh, how awful that everything
has to be so trivial.

1245
01:43:58,106 --> 01:44:00,859
Joe: When I was seven
I had to have an operation.

1246
01:44:01,025 --> 01:44:04,320
Nothing serious, but it did
require anesthesia.

1247
01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:10,994
I had already been pre-medicated,
and was feeling all right.

1248
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:14,998
But when I looked into the room
where the doctors and nurses

1249
01:44:15,165 --> 01:44:18,251
were preparing for the operation,

1250
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:20,754
it was as if had to pass through

1251
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:24,883
an impenetrable gate
all by myself.

1252
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:29,846
It wasn't just that
I missed my mom.

1253
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:32,390
I don't think I missed my dad,

1254
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:34,350
even though he was
the nice one.

1255
01:44:35,185 --> 01:44:39,606
It was as if I was completely alone
in the universe.

1256
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:46,488
As if my whole body was filled
with loneliness and tears.

1257
01:45:09,719 --> 01:45:13,515
And I'm still not allowed
to feel sorry for you?

1258
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:17,101
Shall we go on?

1259
01:45:42,877 --> 01:45:44,712
Joe: What are you reading?

1260
01:45:44,879 --> 01:45:47,674
Seligman: I'm not
reading it really, I'm just...

1261
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,510
reacquainting myself
with Edgar Allan Poe.

1262
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:52,887
I don't know him.

1263
01:45:54,305 --> 01:45:56,224
Well, he was a...

1264
01:45:58,226 --> 01:46:00,353
very anxiety-ridden man.

1265
01:46:06,442 --> 01:46:10,405
He died in the most fearful way
you can imagine,

1266
01:46:10,572 --> 01:46:12,574
in something called delirium tremens.

1267
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:20,248
It occurs when the long-time
abuse of alcohol is followed by...

1268
01:46:20,415 --> 01:46:22,667
by a sudden abstinence.

1269
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:28,256
Your body goes into some kind
of hyper-sensitive shock.

1270
01:46:29,257 --> 01:46:32,260
You can see the most
horrifying hallucinations

1271
01:46:32,427 --> 01:46:37,724
or rats and snakes, and cockroaches
coming out of the floor,

1272
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:41,144
and worms slithering the walls.

1273
01:46:44,022 --> 01:46:47,609
One's entire nervous system
is on high alert,

1274
01:46:47,775 --> 01:46:50,403
and you have a constant
panic and paranoia.

1275
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:54,782
And then the
circulatory system fails.

1276
01:46:55,617 --> 01:46:57,994
But the panic and horror...

1277
01:46:58,161 --> 01:47:01,164
remains until
the moment of death.

1278
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,641
I know what delirium is.

1279
01:47:23,978 --> 01:47:25,146
Seligman: "During the whole

1280
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:26,898
of a dull, dark and soundless day

1281
01:47:27,065 --> 01:47:30,109
in the autumn of the year,
when the clouds hung

1282
01:47:30,276 --> 01:47:32,862
oppressively low in the heavens,

1283
01:47:33,029 --> 01:47:36,115
I had been passing alone
on horseback

1284
01:47:36,282 --> 01:47:39,827
through a singularly
dreary tract of country;

1285
01:47:39,994 --> 01:47:41,704
and at length found myself

1286
01:47:41,871 --> 01:47:44,624
as the shades of
the evening drew on,

1287
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:48,920
within view of the melancholy
House of Usher.”

1288
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:20,576
Hey, Dad.

1289
01:48:32,255 --> 01:48:33,256
Hi, love.

1290
01:48:35,883 --> 01:48:37,218
How are you?

1291
01:48:39,137 --> 01:48:40,638
I fought with Mom.

1292
01:48:42,432 --> 01:48:44,934
She's... She's not coming.

1293
01:48:49,522 --> 01:48:51,816
You ought not to fight with her.

1294
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:54,360
You know Kay's fear of hospitals.

1295
01:48:58,031 --> 01:49:00,074
I know
she's not coming.

1296
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:02,952
We already said everything
we needed to say.

1297
01:49:05,913 --> 01:49:07,749
Kay and I said goodbye at home.

1298
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:11,210
I don't want her here at all.

1299
01:49:14,672 --> 01:49:18,676
- I can't accept that.
- You'll have to.

1300
01:49:19,635 --> 01:49:22,430
She's a cowardly, stupid bitch.

1301
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:25,600
No, she's not.

1302
01:49:26,851 --> 01:49:28,644
- Yeah.
- No, she's not.

1303
01:49:28,811 --> 01:49:30,188
- Yes.
- No, she's not.

1304
01:49:30,354 --> 01:49:32,940
Yes, she is.
You've never understood that.

1305
01:49:48,122 --> 01:49:49,791
Doesn't it scare you?

1306
01:49:51,793 --> 01:49:53,169
No.

1307
01:49:55,922 --> 01:49:57,507
No.

1308
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:02,678
How can you not be afraid?

1309
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,602
I've seen so many die.

1310
01:50:11,979 --> 01:50:15,149
And there's that Epicurus quote

1311
01:50:15,316 --> 01:50:17,068
about not fearing death.

1312
01:50:18,486 --> 01:50:21,989
"When we are, death has not come.

1313
01:50:22,156 --> 01:50:26,619
When death has come... we are not.”

1314
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,251
You know it's going to happen.

1315
01:50:33,876 --> 01:50:37,171
I also know all the drugs
the doctors have to offer.

1316
01:50:37,338 --> 01:50:38,881
So, no.

1317
01:50:39,841 --> 01:50:41,592
I am not...

1318
01:50:41,759 --> 01:50:43,886
I am not afraid.

1319
01:50:45,805 --> 01:50:48,599
Hmm. My beautiful girl.

1320
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,478
Beautiful dad.

1321
01:50:59,735 --> 01:51:01,362
Hello, Doctor.

1322
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:04,407
Hello, Doctor.
This is my daughter Joe.

1323
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:06,200
- Hey, Joe

1324
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:10,705
Doctor: Do you need anything?

1325
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:14,125
As I've said, I've decided to be

1326
01:51:14,292 --> 01:51:16,711
an exemplary patient,
completely subjecting myself

1327
01:51:16,878 --> 01:51:19,547
- to doctor's orders.
- Are you in pain?

1328
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,633
I don't think so, no.

1329
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,886
We're going to give you
a splash all the same.

1330
01:51:46,365 --> 01:51:47,909
Your hair is longer.

1331
01:51:50,494 --> 01:51:52,163
No, it's not.

1332
01:51:55,249 --> 01:51:57,335
They're giving you
too much medication.

1333
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:08,679
No.

1334
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:11,724
Dad.

1335
01:52:12,516 --> 01:52:15,937
It's okay, Dad.
You're just dreaming.

1336
01:52:16,103 --> 01:52:18,314
You're having a nightmare.

1337
01:52:18,481 --> 01:52:20,691
You're having a nightmare.

1338
01:52:22,193 --> 01:52:23,778
It's okay.

1339
01:52:23,945 --> 01:52:25,571
It's okay.

1340
01:52:43,214 --> 01:52:45,716
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1341
01:52:48,427 --> 01:52:51,555
Okay. Don't worry, I'm going
to get the doctor. Don't worry.

1342
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,283
You must be exhausted.

1343
01:53:11,951 --> 01:53:13,244
I'm fine.

1344
01:53:14,078 --> 01:53:16,497
I think you should go home,
get some rest.

1345
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:21,377
No. Someone needs to be here.

1346
01:53:23,254 --> 01:53:26,132
Perhaps you could share
with some other family members.

1347
01:53:29,552 --> 01:53:31,345
There aren't any others.

1348
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:07,214
Kay!

1349
01:54:07,381 --> 01:54:10,259
Daddy, it's okay.

1350
01:54:10,551 --> 01:54:13,471
Kay?

1351
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:18,684
Kay.

1352
01:54:18,851 --> 01:54:21,645
Kay. Kay.

1353
01:54:27,318 --> 01:54:30,696
Kay.

1354
01:54:30,863 --> 01:54:33,366
Kay! Kay.

1355
01:54:33,532 --> 01:54:36,535
- Kay!
- I'm going to get the doctor.

1356
01:54:36,702 --> 01:54:38,079
Kay!

1357
01:54:38,245 --> 01:54:39,872
I'm going to get the doctor, Daddy.

1358
01:54:43,292 --> 01:54:47,254
Excuse me. My dad is really unwell.

1359
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:49,673
Sit. I'll go have a look.

1360
01:54:51,425 --> 01:54:53,302
Maybe you could give him
some more morphine.

1361
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:56,138
There's something
I'd like to explain.

1362
01:54:57,723 --> 01:54:59,350
I can certainly give him
more morphine,

1363
01:54:59,517 --> 01:55:02,728
but most likely it won't
make much difference.

1364
01:55:03,729 --> 01:55:08,067
Most deaths, fortunately,
are uneventful,

1365
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:13,322
as long as you medicate the patients
to keep them free of fear and pain.

1366
01:55:13,781 --> 01:55:16,617
In a few cases,
the process of dying

1367
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:18,577
causes brain damage,

1368
01:55:19,787 --> 01:55:22,039
which triggers
what we call delirium.

1369
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:27,628
That's not something we can soften
with morphine, unfortunately.

1370
01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:47,731
Daddy.

1371
01:55:57,950 --> 01:55:59,660
It's gonna be okay.

1372
01:56:11,505 --> 01:56:14,383
I don't know
what's happening to me.

1373
01:56:31,317 --> 01:56:33,402
Don't you want to take a little walk?

1374
01:56:33,569 --> 01:56:35,905
I'll stay with your father
in the meantime.

1375
01:56:36,447 --> 01:56:39,158
You'll stay?
You'll stay here?

1376
01:56:39,325 --> 01:56:40,326
Yes.

1377
01:57:37,758 --> 01:57:39,677
Ash tree leaves.

1378
01:57:42,137 --> 01:57:43,931
Where did you find them?

1379
01:57:44,431 --> 01:57:46,308
They were in the park.

1380
01:57:54,441 --> 01:57:57,403
It truly is the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

1381
01:58:01,699 --> 01:58:03,826
But Dad...

1382
01:58:03,993 --> 01:58:06,954
How do you recognize it
in winter?

1383
01:58:07,955 --> 01:58:09,873
Told you 100 times.

1384
01:58:11,917 --> 01:58:13,627
I can't remember.

1385
01:58:18,382 --> 01:58:21,427
When the ash tree was created...

1386
01:58:24,054 --> 01:58:27,016
it made all the other trees
in the forest jealous,

1387
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,893
because it was...

1388
01:58:32,187 --> 01:58:34,815
It was the most beautiful tree
in the forest.

1389
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:40,154
It had the strongest wood.

1390
01:58:41,322 --> 01:58:43,115
It could be used for anything.

1391
01:58:45,784 --> 01:58:49,663
It was the World Tree
in Norse mythology.

1392
01:58:51,165 --> 01:58:54,126
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

1393
01:58:58,339 --> 01:59:01,967
And then when all the other
trees saw the ash tree

1394
01:59:02,134 --> 01:59:05,220
with its black buds...

1395
01:59:06,305 --> 01:59:08,390
they all started laughing.

1396
01:59:09,308 --> 01:59:10,809
"Oh, look.

1397
01:59:12,061 --> 01:59:15,648
The ash tree's had its fingers
in the ashes.”

1398
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:35,918
Dad. Daddy!

1399
01:59:36,085 --> 01:59:37,961
Daddy. Daddy, what's wrong?

1400
01:59:38,128 --> 01:59:39,421
Daddy, what's wrong?

1401
01:59:43,008 --> 01:59:45,427
Daddy, it's me!
It's me, then. It's me!

1402
01:59:45,636 --> 01:59:48,514
Help! Help!

1403
01:59:51,225 --> 01:59:52,267
Okay.

1404
01:59:52,434 --> 01:59:54,603
Okay.

1405
01:59:57,648 --> 02:00:00,109
Okay. It's okay, it's okay.
It's all right.

1406
02:00:03,987 --> 02:00:05,781
Woman: It's all right.

1407
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:18,210
Doctor: We have to fixate him.

1408
02:00:18,377 --> 02:00:21,922
Father: What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?

1409
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:30,264
Father: Joe! What are
you doing to me?

1410
02:00:44,486 --> 02:00:45,446
Father: Joe!

1411
02:00:45,988 --> 02:00:48,699
Father: Joe!

1412
02:00:48,866 --> 02:00:51,368
I'm sorry.

1413
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:57,958
Doctor: You should take a break.

1414
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,512
Joe: Excuse me.

1415
02:02:40,811 --> 02:02:42,479
Okay, don't worry.

1416
02:02:42,646 --> 02:02:45,315
Just clean that up.

1417
02:03:32,362 --> 02:03:33,780
Woman: Ready?

1418
02:04:37,094 --> 02:04:41,390
Joe: When he died,
I had no feelings left.

1419
02:04:42,349 --> 02:04:44,685
Seligman: Well,
that's certainly understandable.

1420
02:04:45,477 --> 02:04:48,563
Joe: No. I don't know
what happened to me.

1421
02:04:49,815 --> 02:04:51,358
It was very shameful.

1422
02:04:52,484 --> 02:04:56,238
Seligman: Shameful?
I don't understand.

1423
02:05:22,097 --> 02:05:24,307
Joe: I lubricated.

1424
02:05:42,034 --> 02:05:44,202
I know you like to present
yourself in a negative way,

1425
02:05:44,369 --> 02:05:46,788
and that you have this,
kind of dark bias

1426
02:05:46,955 --> 02:05:49,041
that you're worse
than everyone else.

1427
02:05:49,708 --> 02:05:51,626
But this story doesn't
add to that belief.

1428
02:05:54,004 --> 02:05:57,382
It's extremely common
to react sexually in a crisis.

1429
02:05:58,175 --> 02:06:00,594
It may be shameful to you, but...

1430
02:06:00,761 --> 02:06:04,264
in literature,
there is many worse examples.

1431
02:06:08,018 --> 02:06:10,353
But I did inherit
my father's caliper.

1432
02:06:12,856 --> 02:06:17,527
I found it so beautiful
and worn by its use.

1433
02:06:18,737 --> 02:06:20,989
What else did you receive?

1434
02:06:23,742 --> 02:06:25,035
Nothing.

1435
02:06:26,828 --> 02:06:29,122
I didn't have the strength
to argue with my mother,

1436
02:06:29,289 --> 02:06:32,501
so I wrote off any further
part of my inheritance.

1437
02:06:32,667 --> 02:06:37,714
Really?
Well, that's a dramatic gesture.

1438
02:06:41,009 --> 02:06:44,304
- You listen to music, I see?
- Seligman: Yes.

1439
02:06:44,471 --> 02:06:48,475
I like it a lot.
Shall I find a tape?

1440
02:06:48,642 --> 02:06:53,480
No, if there's a tape already
in the machine? I'd like to hear that.

1441
02:06:54,022 --> 02:06:55,899
It's something I've been
listening to a lot lately,

1442
02:06:56,066 --> 02:06:59,361
though it's not an entirely complete
recording, unfortunately.

1443
02:06:59,986 --> 02:07:02,489
- What is it?
- It's Bach.

1444
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:05,408
From his little organ book.

1445
02:07:12,415 --> 02:07:14,709
The theme is originally a hymn,

1446
02:07:15,585 --> 02:07:18,964
Bach rearranged it
and embellished it a little.

1447
02:07:19,965 --> 02:07:23,009
He was the master at polyphony,
if you know what that is.

1448
02:07:23,176 --> 02:07:25,679
No, yet another thing I don't know.

1449
02:07:25,846 --> 02:07:28,890
Seligman: Polyphony is
from the Middle Ages.

1450
02:07:29,057 --> 02:07:31,560
It's an entirely European phenomenon.

1451
02:07:32,394 --> 02:07:35,230
It's distinguished
by the idea that,

1452
02:07:35,397 --> 02:07:38,525
every voice is its own melody,

1453
02:07:39,985 --> 02:07:41,945
but together in harmony.

1454
02:07:43,822 --> 02:07:47,868
Bach's forerunner, Palestrina,
he wrote many words

1455
02:07:48,034 --> 02:07:50,537
for several choirs at the same time,

1456
02:07:50,704 --> 02:07:53,123
wallowing in polyphony.

1457
02:08:03,091 --> 02:08:05,177
But in my eyes, Bach perfected

1458
02:08:05,343 --> 02:08:07,679
the melodic expression
and the harmony.

1459
02:08:08,722 --> 02:08:12,976
And also mixed up with some
rather incomprehensible

1460
02:08:13,143 --> 02:08:15,353
mystique regarding numbers,

1461
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:19,274
most likely based on
the Fibonacci Sequence.

1462
02:08:20,859 --> 02:08:23,028
You know the one that
starts with the zero,

1463
02:08:23,195 --> 02:08:24,404
and then comes the one.

1464
02:08:25,113 --> 02:08:29,201
The sequence is created by
adding the two previous numbers

1465
02:08:29,367 --> 02:08:32,495
to create the new one,
so it's zero plus one makes one.

1466
02:08:32,662 --> 02:08:35,373
And one plus one makes two,
and two plus one makes three

1467
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:38,793
and three plus two makes five,
and five plus three makes eight,

1468
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,962
and eight plus five makes 13.

1469
02:08:41,129 --> 02:08:42,714
The sequence has an
interesting connection

1470
02:08:42,881 --> 02:08:45,634
to Pythagoras' theorem
of the Golden Section.

1471
02:08:47,385 --> 02:08:50,680
It was all about finding out
a divine methodology

1472
02:08:50,847 --> 02:08:52,599
in art and architecture.

1473
02:08:52,766 --> 02:08:54,559
A bit like the way a tri-tone,

1474
02:08:54,726 --> 02:08:56,686
which was played on the piano
in your little club

1475
02:08:56,853 --> 02:08:58,813
was supposed to be
a satanic interval.

1476
02:09:00,482 --> 02:09:04,653
The sum of the numeric values
represented in Bach's name is 14,

1477
02:09:05,654 --> 02:09:07,739
a number he often used
in his compositions.

1478
02:09:07,906 --> 02:09:09,574
The clever thing about Bach's name

1479
02:09:09,741 --> 02:09:13,161
is that the numeric value
of the individual letters

1480
02:09:13,328 --> 02:09:15,080
are all Fibonacci numbers.

1481
02:09:18,166 --> 02:09:20,585
This piece has three voices:

1482
02:09:20,752 --> 02:09:21,920
the bass voice...

1483
02:09:27,759 --> 02:09:29,636
The second voice
played with the left hand.

1484
02:09:34,391 --> 02:09:36,142
The first voice played
with the right hand.

1485
02:09:36,309 --> 02:09:40,063
That is called
Cantus Firmus, or Cantu firm us.

1486
02:09:40,230 --> 02:09:44,401
And together, these three voices
create the polyphony.

1487
02:11:15,241 --> 02:11:18,370
Well, if I should compare
this with my story,

1488
02:11:18,536 --> 02:11:21,748
it's reminiscent of
a quality of nymphomania,

1489
02:11:21,915 --> 02:11:25,293
which is normally ignored,
but nonetheless essential,

1490
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:29,130
and namely the relationship
between the various intercourses.

1491
02:11:31,758 --> 02:11:33,843
That's interesting.

1492
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:36,721
They create a... a completeness?

1493
02:11:38,098 --> 02:11:40,266
As, for example, the handshake,

1494
02:11:40,433 --> 02:11:43,520
which for all people
is the sum of

1495
02:11:43,686 --> 02:11:46,439
all the different handshakes
that together

1496
02:11:46,606 --> 02:11:49,818
form our view
of what a handshake is.

1497
02:11:49,984 --> 02:11:52,737
The good, the bad handshake,

1498
02:11:52,904 --> 02:11:54,572
the firm, the limp.

1499
02:11:56,616 --> 02:11:59,327
Normally, a nymphomaniac
IS seen as...

1500
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:02,664
someone who can't get enough,

1501
02:12:03,581 --> 02:12:05,792
and therefore, has sex
with many different people.

1502
02:12:05,959 --> 02:12:07,502
Well, that, of course, is true,

1503
02:12:07,669 --> 02:12:12,257
but if I'm to be honest,
I see it precisely as

1504
02:12:12,424 --> 02:12:17,053
the sum of all these different
sexual experiences.

1505
02:12:18,888 --> 02:12:23,017
So in that way,
I have only one lover.

1506
02:12:27,772 --> 02:12:30,442
Joe: Since the music
has three voices,

1507
02:12:30,608 --> 02:12:34,320
I will limit myself to talking
about three lovers.

1508
02:12:34,487 --> 02:12:38,324
The bass is easy.
That's F.

1509
02:12:38,908 --> 02:12:42,287
F had a red car
that he'd bought used.

1510
02:12:45,206 --> 02:12:46,332
Joe: As I was having sex

1511
02:12:46,499 --> 02:12:50,503
with seven or eight men
every night at the time,

1512
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:52,797
scheduling was tricky.

1513
02:12:52,964 --> 02:12:55,550
And they all had to have
precise appointments.

1514
02:12:55,967 --> 02:12:58,845
F was a good man.

1515
02:12:59,012 --> 02:13:01,556
If he was scheduled
for ten o'clock,

1516
02:13:01,723 --> 02:13:05,852
he always showed up around nine
and parked down in the street.

1517
02:13:06,019 --> 02:13:08,313
I always smiled when I saw him.

1518
02:13:10,148 --> 02:13:13,651
Often I took pity on him,
and gave him a cup of coffee,

1519
02:13:13,818 --> 02:13:16,029
although I was finishing
with the one before.

1520
02:13:18,656 --> 02:13:21,993
It's hard to say why I'm
choosing to talk about F,

1521
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,828
but he was reassuring,

1522
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:27,665
and he knew exactly what
I wanted when we had sex.

1523
02:13:28,583 --> 02:13:32,045
No, I'd go even further,
and say that there was

1524
02:13:32,212 --> 02:13:35,423
a kind of telepathy going on
when we had sex.

1525
02:13:36,508 --> 02:13:40,720
Without words, he knew
exactly what I wanted,

1526
02:13:40,929 --> 02:13:44,015
where he should touch me
and what he should do.

1527
02:13:45,683 --> 02:13:50,021
The most sacred goal for F
was my orgasm.

1528
02:13:50,897 --> 02:13:53,650
Why? And then...

1529
02:13:53,816 --> 02:13:57,779
The swans answered
in the same voice.

1530
02:13:57,946 --> 02:13:59,906
Joe: And granted him privileges

1531
02:14:00,073 --> 02:14:02,242
none of the others received.

1532
02:14:08,831 --> 02:14:10,875
F was the bass voice.

1533
02:14:11,042 --> 02:14:14,796
Monotone, predictable
and ritualistic.

1534
02:14:14,963 --> 02:14:16,756
No doubt about it.

1535
02:14:16,923 --> 02:14:20,426
But also the foundation
that is so important,

1536
02:14:20,593 --> 02:14:23,721
even if on its own
it doesn't mean much.

1537
02:14:56,796 --> 02:14:58,715
G was quite different.

1538
02:14:59,799 --> 02:15:03,553
The only one I had to,
and wanted to wait for.

1539
02:15:04,554 --> 02:15:07,974
When he finally turned up
and I opened the door,

1540
02:15:08,141 --> 02:15:10,351
he didn't immediately enter,

1541
02:15:10,518 --> 02:15:13,313
the way a cat doesn't
when you let it in.

1542
02:15:13,479 --> 02:15:15,815
As if,
once the door is open,

1543
02:15:15,982 --> 02:15:18,109
it has all the time
in the world.

1544
02:15:24,991 --> 02:15:27,201
But he was more
than a cat.

1545
02:15:27,368 --> 02:15:30,496
He was like some kind
of jaguar, or leopard.

1546
02:15:31,873 --> 02:15:34,083
He moved like them,

1547
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:36,878
which turned me on no end.

1548
02:15:47,639 --> 02:15:49,932
Joe: When he laid down on my bed,

1549
02:15:50,099 --> 02:15:52,560
it was clear to me that
I should approach him,

1550
02:15:52,727 --> 02:15:54,604
and not the other way round.

1551
02:15:55,188 --> 02:16:00,443
And when I did touch him,
it was with some hesitation,

1552
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:03,863
as his reactions
were unpredictable.

1553
02:16:04,030 --> 02:16:07,033
He was in charge.
That's the way it was.

1554
02:16:09,410 --> 02:16:11,704
J /

1555
02:16:57,542 --> 02:16:59,711
Joe: Despite my success in managing

1556
02:16:59,877 --> 02:17:02,964
the complicated logistics
involved with arranging

1557
02:17:03,131 --> 02:17:06,467
up to ten daily
sexual satisfactions,

1558
02:17:06,634 --> 02:17:09,303
while also having
a full-time job,

1559
02:17:09,470 --> 02:17:12,682
I was still prone to
a certain sadness.

1560
02:17:12,849 --> 02:17:15,643
So when my busy life
allowed a few breaks,

1561
02:17:15,810 --> 02:17:18,104
I used them
to take my walks.

1562
02:17:19,105 --> 02:17:22,400
These repeated walks
became a kind of metaphor

1563
02:17:22,567 --> 02:17:25,653
for my life.
Monotonous and pointless.

1564
02:17:28,364 --> 02:17:32,076
Yes, precisely like the
movements of a caged animal.

1565
02:17:33,661 --> 02:17:36,456
Basically, we're all waiting
for permission to die.

1566
02:19:04,126 --> 02:19:05,628
Seligman: No.

1567
02:19:06,504 --> 02:19:09,340
No, no, no. No, there...

1568
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:12,093
There are some completely
unrealistic coincidences

1569
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:13,928
in your story about Jerome.

1570
02:19:16,138 --> 02:19:19,809
First, by chance, he hires you as...
As an assistant.

1571
02:19:19,976 --> 02:19:21,394
And then you take a walk in a forest,

1572
02:19:21,561 --> 02:19:23,229
and it's littered
with photographs of him.

1573
02:19:23,396 --> 02:19:26,357
And not only that... he's present.

1574
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:31,654
And then like a god,
pulls you up to him through the clouds.

1575
02:19:32,113 --> 02:19:35,825
So what?
That's the way this story goes.

1576
02:19:36,617 --> 02:19:39,662
And I'm the one telling it,
and I know what happened.

1577
02:19:40,913 --> 02:19:42,832
Do you want to hear it or not?

1578
02:19:46,377 --> 02:19:48,129
Seligman: Goodness gracious.

1579
02:20:00,266 --> 02:20:02,143
What a strange way to meet.

1580
02:20:03,978 --> 02:20:04,979
Yes.

1581
02:20:06,939 --> 02:20:08,816
It's a very strange way.

1582
02:20:08,983 --> 02:20:11,402
Joe: Jerome was there
because he'd just had a fight

1583
02:20:11,569 --> 02:20:14,447
with his wife, who in anger
tore up the photographs

1584
02:20:14,614 --> 02:20:16,699
they just had developed
from their travels.

1585
02:20:16,866 --> 02:20:19,452
I don't know if I can believe this.

1586
02:20:19,619 --> 02:20:21,203
Joe: Which way
do you think you'd get the most

1587
02:20:21,370 --> 02:20:22,580
out of my story?

1588
02:20:22,914 --> 02:20:25,291
By believing in it
or not believing in it?

1589
02:20:26,459 --> 02:20:27,835
Seligman: Yeah, you're right.

1590
02:20:28,002 --> 02:20:29,670
You might have a point
with all this.

1591
02:20:33,799 --> 02:20:37,762
The secret ingredient
to sex is love.

1592
02:20:41,891 --> 02:20:44,769
The third voice,
the secret ingredient.

1593
02:20:45,686 --> 02:20:47,271
Cantus Firmus.

1594
02:22:22,324 --> 02:22:25,619
Fill all my holes.

1595
02:22:27,621 --> 02:22:32,543
J ;

1596
02:23:24,887 --> 02:23:25,888
What's wrong?

1597
02:23:26,138 --> 02:23:28,641
Hmm?

1598
02:23:28,849 --> 02:23:31,852
- I can't feel anything.
- Huh?

1599
02:23:32,019 --> 02:23:33,521
I can't feel anything.

1600
02:23:36,357 --> 02:23:38,359
I can't feel anything.

1601
02:23:40,611 --> 02:23:43,114
I can't... anything.

1602
02:23:48,536 --> 02:23:53,207
