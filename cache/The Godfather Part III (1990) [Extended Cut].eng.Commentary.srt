1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,090
This is Francis Coppola, and I'm
here to give you my impressions,

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,596
my memories, my feelings about
the third film in what became a series.

3
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,766
This film is titled
<i>The Godfather Part III.</i>

4
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:29,106
Ironically, the real title that Mario
Puzo and I had given this film

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,608
was <i>The Death of Michael Corleone.</i>

6
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:36,238
Usually sequels of films in
the past had independent titles,

7
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,571
or at best it was <i>The
Bride of Frankenstein.</i>

8
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,498
The notion of the more literary <i>Part II</i>

9
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,372
had never really
happened in this country,

10
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,955
and <i>The Godfather Part
II</i> was the innovating film.

11
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,499
Ironically, many years later,

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,130
it's an indication of
my lessening influence

13
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,346
that Paramount prevailed
and the film, against our wishes,

14
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,844
was called <i>The Godfather Part III,</i>

15
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:04,395
but I would like to have the
audience think of the films, really,

16
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,189
as two sequels and an epilogue.

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,149
As we begin the story of the third film,

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:21,405
there were the haunting images of
the Corleone compound on Lake Tahoe,

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,126
that really we shot as a kind of pre-unit
even before we made the second film.

20
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:32,291
It was that estate that I stumbled
upon one day with some friends,

21
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:38,513
that seemed to suggest to me,
especially in that it was in ruin,

22
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,012
that there had been a powerful
family, perhaps, who had lived there.

23
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,015
Indeed it was true, it
was the Kaiser Estate,

24
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:51,484
and in a period in the '60s, perhaps,
they were there with their young people

25
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,403
and their speedboats,
and enjoying the boathouse

26
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,571
and the parties and the dances,

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,195
but now, as I discovered the estate,

28
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,278
it was being swallowed up by the lake,

29
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,454
and it was a ruin.

30
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,660
It suggested to me that perhaps this
was the ruin of the Corleone family,

31
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,005
and although we had originally
thought to begin the film

32
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,001
much as we had begun the first <i>Godfather,</i>

33
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:21,589
in fact, in general our plan
was to have this epilogue

34
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,267
be more like the first <i>Godfather</i>
than the second <i>Godfather,</i>

35
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,062
which of course was
told in two time periods.

36
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,937
But originally we were going to
begin just on the business deal

37
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,236
of the Cardinal coming
to Michael Corleone

38
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,312
and making his plea

39
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:41,659
that the Vatican had gotten themselves
in a bit of financial difficulty.

40
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,824
But later my collaborator, Walter Murch,

41
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:50,417
felt that we might be better off to stress
more the family and the personal side

42
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,165
before we got into the business.

43
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,216
You know, the famous sentence,
"It isn't personal, it's only business,"

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,589
well, in this case we wanted to say,
"It isn't business, it's only personal,"

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,140
which of course is the real truth
of Don Corleone's famous line.

46
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,685
We eventually decided
to begin in a ceremony

47
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,763
in which Michael was to
be honored by the Church

48
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:16,819
for his wonderful charitable gifts
of the Vito Andolini Foundation

49
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,945
and as Michael is given this
wonderful award from the Church,

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,994
we realize that he's a man who
almost has used this occasion

51
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,789
to pull back his family,

52
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,618
which effectively he
has lost due to his deeds.

53
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,001
And however good his deeds meant to be,

54
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,509
they were not good
deeds, they were evil deeds,

55
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,301
and consequently as we see him,

56
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,471
even in his Commendatore finery

57
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,392
receiving the highest award
the Vatican can bestow,

58
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,310
his face is a mirror of his soul.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,442
It's ravaged and sickly,
and very, very heartbroken,

60
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,865
because what he values the most

61
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,986
is the thing that he has lost.

62
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,909
But he has his children.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,209
And his children at
this point, I would think,

64
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,332
to Michael, mean everything.

65
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,504
His daughter and his son.

66
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:23,215
The Michael that we're dealing with is
very different than the Michael we know,

67
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,841
and interestingly enough,

68
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,549
one of the toughest decisions
and most heated debate

69
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,180
was over Al Pacino's hair in this film,

70
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,185
because I felt as
though it would be truthful

71
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:40,645
to show that Michael was no longer
that same handsome young man

72
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:45,074
with the beautiful hair which Al
has and which is so well known,

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,452
but he had more of that steel,
man-approaching-60 crew cut.

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,210
When I cut Al Pacino's hair it was
almost like cutting Samson's hair,

75
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,834
'cause it meant that this would
not be the Michael Corleone

76
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,168
that the audience had come to love.

77
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,548
This was a man, really, more in a crisis.

78
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,973
That was more interesting to
me because I was in a crisis.

79
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,018
I, at this point, was very
much like Michael Corleone.

80
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:17,390
And so when I thought
of making a third film,

81
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:22,399
I only could imagine we had to deal
with Michael Corleone as an older man.

82
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,735
Now, obviously this flies in the face of

83
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,239
a conventional notion
of movie-sequel making,

84
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:34,449
in which you try to really hang
on to the successful formula.

85
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,250
In the case of <i>The Godfather,</i>

86
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,625
what made the <i>Godfather</i> films
so successful to popular audiences

87
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:45,502
was how this figure, Michael
Corleone, seemed always to come on top,

88
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,347
and I was viewing Michael
from a much different perspective,

89
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,220
more how I felt about
myself, at the age I was,

90
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,599
trying to understand, really,
what is important in a man's life,

91
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,398
beyond fame, beyond wealth.

92
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,534
Those things don't
seem to really fulfill,

93
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,780
and I knew that what
does fulfill are your children

94
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,950
and seeing the life of the family go on.

95
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,954
Whenever I meet someone and they tell me,

96
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,123
"Oh, I have six children
and I have 23 grandchildren,"

97
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,709
I say, "Oh, you're a very rich man."

98
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,005
And they look at me and say, "Oh, no, no.
Not really,"

99
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,956
and I say, "Oh, no.
You're a very rich man."

100
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,805
And my mother, you see
her singing behind Eli Wallach,

101
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:37,262
my father you see to the left of
the frame conducting the band.

102
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:42,142
This really was the last time I was
to be with my mother and father.

103
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,478
My father passed away shortly after this,

104
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,280
on the night of the Academy
Awards, hit by a stroke,

105
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,325
by the shock of not having
won the Best Song category.

106
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,498
How typically wonderful of him.
He died in the way he lived.

107
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,833
Vincent is the son of Sonny
Corleone, with Lucy Mancini.

108
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:09,385
We remember in the first <i>Godfather,</i>
Lucy was one of the bridesmaids

109
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,305
and I imagined that there
would be a classic character,

110
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,725
the bastard son of
Sonny who, on one hand,

111
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:21,180
brings vitality and youth and
strength, very much like the old Sonny

112
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,231
and on the other hand is a dark sheep.

113
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,811
He wasn't raised in the
comfort and the affluence

114
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,397
of the immediate Corleone family.

115
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,448
Obviously we had to interweave the
beginnings of a conspiracy, of a plot.

116
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,622
So we introduced Joe
Mantegna as Joey Zasa,

117
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,042
interwoven with all of
this legitimacy and wealth,

118
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,793
there still are the
vestiges of the mob world.

119
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:08,277
Ah, there's my little granddaughter
Gia, the little pink girl on the floor,

120
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,728
as a little baby.

121
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,865
Don Novello plays a
kind of family PR fellow,

122
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,123
handling the journalists so that
it all comes out right for Michael,

123
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,204
because above all, what he craves

124
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,711
is the legitimacy that his
father had wished for him.

125
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:49,773
And we have the little girl cousins,
carrying notes to the older boys.

126
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:56,617
Of course, Vincent is so handsome
and one of the cousins, Mary,

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,658
has always had a shine for him

128
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,707
and just like an awkward 17, 18-year-old,

129
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,251
she comes and flirts with him

130
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,293
and of course, my own daughter
Sofia, plays Mary Corleone.

131
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,672
It's one of my favorite parts of
the film, because she is so real.

132
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,557
She is not an actress. She wasn't
an actress. She was an art student.

133
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:23,181
But she was Mary Corleone,
and I can remember as kids,

134
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:28,141
them interacting and having
little crushes on their cousins

135
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,602
and it was all so unacceptable
and so naughty, but they did it,

136
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:36,156
and flirted and of
course, this was the basis.

137
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,110
It was really Sofia that
was what I had in mind

138
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:45,996
when I created the character of Mary,
the kind of apple of her father's eye,

139
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,286
who would be able to be
the one to give the check

140
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,498
of all the enormous amount of
money they were going to bestow.

141
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:02,558
It moves me to this day to see that
scene and her little playful banter,

142
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,430
so real and…

143
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:10,391
It's true, you know, Sofia
came in for tremendous criticism,

144
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,148
because she was plunged
into an important role

145
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,230
without really having the credentials,

146
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,692
but mainly because I had
seen the story that way,

147
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,324
and at this point, I was making
the movie out of characters

148
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,496
who were in fact my sister or my
father or my mother or my daughter.

149
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,170
And since I meant Sofia
to be the vulnerable one

150
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:37,338
who would ultimately express the
great tragedy of Michael Corleone,

151
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:42,343
I chose to give my own,
and indeed, just as in the story

152
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,549
it was Sofia that they
shot the bullets at,

153
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,270
but they were really shooting them at me,

154
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,719
and I knew that.

155
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,977
But I'm thrilled to have
captured the reality of the family

156
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,559
by having Sofia play this part,

157
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:58,648
despite really what was a
conspiracy on many people's behalf

158
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,484
and all culminating in that
first article in <i>Vanity Fair,</i>

159
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,573
Tina Brown's <i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine,
that just pointed the world at Sofia

160
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,250
as if to say, "Look, he's vulnerable here.
Kill him here."

161
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,620
And that is what the
film ultimately was about,

162
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,924
that there is no worse
way to pay for your sins

163
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,548
than to have your children
be included in the punishment.

164
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,615
Obviously when you attempt
a work of many characters

165
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,041
with serious themes,

166
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,666
certainly that interweave
personal feelings,

167
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,466
psychological, perhaps,
feelings and plot and action,

168
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,796
one tempts a notion of going
where Shakespeare went

169
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:10,227
and few, if any, people ever
can be compared to Shakespeare.

170
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:16,267
In fact, that is the subject of Goethe's
<i>The Apprenticeship of Wilhelm Meister,</i>

171
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:22,448
as he compares himself really against
this extraordinary genius of our time.

172
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,825
One can be guided by Shakespeare and
I looked in Shakespeare for inspiration

173
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:34,581
in the story of an elderly man trying
to assure some place for himself

174
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:40,299
in the midst of a family in which
certain people were true and faithful

175
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,969
and others were more manipulative,

176
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,720
trying to gain from the ultimate
succession of power and wealth.

177
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,769
My sister, Tally, who
had been in all three films,

178
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:57,600
now was emerging as a stronger figure,

179
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,812
more like that woman in the
Scottish play of Shakespeare.

180
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,611
Of course, Andy Garcia as the bastard.

181
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,820
Kay, as the woman who
loved Michael Corleone

182
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:13,407
so deeply and so
romantically and so lastingly

183
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,327
and yet was forced to turn against him

184
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,710
because of the horror
that he became in her eyes.

185
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:26,178
All of these were the
potential that I hoped I could,

186
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,471
with Mario's great collaboration,

187
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,888
that I hoped that I could weave
together into a satisfying drama,

188
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:38,682
even though it would not really be able
to repeat the classic <i>Godfather</i> formula,

189
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:44,362
which is Michael in the end beating all
his enemies and emerging triumphant,

190
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,693
because, indeed, this film was
about the death of Michael Corleone.

191
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:18,181
Also, many of the family friends,
who had important functions…

192
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:24,195
Al Martino as Johnny Fontane,
now singing in his inimitable style

193
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,569
a song that our family jokingly
referred to as "Za Zeach His Own."

194
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,276
I had to get "Za Zeach
His Own" into the film

195
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,831
because after all, that's
what we sang in our house.

196
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,250
And of course, the son, the
little boy, Franc D'Ambrosio,

197
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,334
who just like Michael,
might have had the resistance

198
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,260
to tell his father that he
would go his own way,

199
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,682
this boy also tells his
father, but for another reason,

200
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:58,262
because just as my family
was made up of artists,

201
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,475
I would imagine that, "What if a
young man in the Corleone family

202
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,980
wanted to pursue an artistic career?"

203
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,484
And I always thought it
would be interesting if one day,

204
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,066
out of nowhere a young man came along,

205
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,572
sort of like Mario Lanza
did when I was a kid

206
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,030
and wanted to be an opera singer

207
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,992
and that would present
Michael with a real dilemma,

208
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:25,957
because as much as he might
want to suck his son in to be with him,

209
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,261
shoulder to shoulder in this new
charitable vision that Michael had

210
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,556
to pay back these
enormous amounts of money,

211
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,134
to undo the way that they were earned,

212
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:41,096
he could never fully capture his
son, because his son was an artist

213
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,978
and artists really do stand alone

214
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,810
and work to other
motivations than other people.

215
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:53,196
An artist is alone in his desire to
pursue the beauty and the tradition

216
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,153
that the artist's
tradition lays before him

217
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,954
and would never be involved,

218
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,625
be a lawyer or be a businessman,
as Michael seems to hope for him.

219
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,620
This was such an interesting experience,

220
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:42,120
because really it was many years
after the first two films had been made

221
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,748
and really it would never have been made

222
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,456
except for the difficulties
and the aftermath

223
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,542
of that extraordinary
period of productivity,

224
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,221
which took us through two
<i>Godfather</i> films, <i>The Conversation,</i>

225
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,674
<i>Apocalypse Now</i> and then ultimately,

226
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,103
what I like to think of
as "the ping-pong shot,"

227
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,020
that everyone was able to slam down

228
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,437
and put me into a position
of great debt and servitude,

229
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,190
which is of course, where
they like artists to be.

230
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,407
I always joke that if you ever want to
understand who's running the world,

231
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,327
or at any time in history
who's running the world,

232
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,120
just check who's employing
the artists and it will tell you.

233
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,663
So to revisit this
material was so interesting

234
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:31,248
because not only were we going
back to the story of this family,

235
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:35,256
we were working with it with
characters that we had begun

236
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,464
who were young people.
Al Pacino was a young man.

237
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,847
Diane Keaton was a young woman.
Everyone, my sister was a young girl.

238
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,099
I was young. My father was young.

239
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,739
Everyone was young and
here we worked on these films

240
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:53,274
and now, many years later, we're
all going to be brought together again.

241
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:59,200
In fact, I was in Rome, working
on a different film, a personal film,

242
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,621
which I hoped to make,
one called <i>Megalopolis,</i>

243
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:07,873
and you know, we were in a
position of somewhat limited resources,

244
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,671
and Paramount proposed
the idea of a third <i>Godfather</i>

245
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,885
and they had a script.
It was a very different kind of a script.

246
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,633
It didn't have very much in it
about Michael Corleone at all.

247
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,967
It tended to be more about
the Vincent Mancini character,

248
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,801
or a character like him,

249
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,980
and really featured
more a similar story of…

250
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,899
Except now drugs and cartels

251
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,820
and pretty much echoing the
kind of story it had done before.

252
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,450
And I felt, "Well, gee, if
you're going to go back,

253
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,994
let's go back and really make Michael
Corleone be the central character."

254
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,367
Indeed, he always was
the central character,

255
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,416
so how could you make another film

256
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,166
without showing what had become of him

257
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,374
and in what ways he paid for his sins?

258
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,627
I like to think that at the
end of <i>Godfather Part II,</i>

259
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,180
when you see those
final images of Michael,

260
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,516
that he's sort of been
given his comeuppance.

261
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,684
It's pretty clear that he's lost
everything and he's punished.

262
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,191
And then I began to feel, well,

263
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,110
maybe he wasn't punished
enough for what he did.

264
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:17,563
I mean, he killed his own brother.
He killed countless other people.

265
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,034
You know people who kill, I mean,
if you could just take two minutes

266
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,361
before you pull that
trigger or make that decision

267
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,123
and realize how many
people you're killing.

268
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,620
It's not just the person you're
killing, that person has got it easy.

269
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,704
It's the mother and the father
and the brothers and the friends

270
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,505
and the people who love them.

271
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:40,301
Any death is a hundred deaths
and more hours of heartbreak

272
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,880
than you can almost count.

273
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:48,886
So I have very, very strong
feelings about those people who,

274
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,805
for their greed or
for their self-interest,

275
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:56,268
would use violence and use
horror and use terror indiscriminately

276
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,400
without thinking what they're
doing to so many people.

277
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,825
So I really…
Especially that Michael was a good man,

278
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,288
and a young, attractive,
and promising young man,

279
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,364
his conversion from a
good man to an evil man

280
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,497
is more horrible than just some cretin
who never had a moral idea in his eyes.

281
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,582
So I just felt that Michael
had to be punished.

282
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:24,589
He had to die, and not in an
easy way, to express how I felt,

283
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,925
although I had great sympathy for him,

284
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,683
because in many ways I felt I
was like him in my own category,

285
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,767
not as a criminal, but in a
person who had gone, really,

286
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,649
from a sort of innocent
guy who just loved movies

287
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:45,075
into something involving
power and influence.

288
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:52,332
So I did, as with all characters,
Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Tucker or Mr Corleone,

289
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:57,458
I have tremendous personal feelings
myself that I might be like them.

290
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,855
George Hamilton was styled after
any number of Hollywood lawyers.

291
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,191
And a very funny situation, I'm
trying to get his hair to be gray.

292
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,269
It turned orange, it turned red.

293
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,527
Obviously, <i>The Godfather</i>
was a famous movie

294
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,779
and many people were
anxious to participate.

295
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,610
You'll notice in the family scene,

296
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,571
as another indication
of the Corleones' power,

297
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,124
and the parallel with the Coppola family,

298
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,496
you'll see Willie Brown,

299
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,546
who is of course, now the
mayor of San Francisco,

300
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,716
but a very charismatic and
important person in California politics

301
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,668
and was friendly with our family.

302
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,719
My brother August worked with him

303
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:35,599
to create the wonderful Fine Arts
Film Building in San Francisco State

304
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,226
and again, like the Coppolas,
these people would wander in and out

305
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:43,150
and Willy Brown came to
Rome to be in this scene.

306
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,361
It was a collection of important people,

307
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:58,245
people from the Vatican,
people in politics, family friends,

308
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,002
and uncomfortably for Michael,

309
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,088
the vestiges of his
father's early gang origins

310
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:09,510
as different small-time hoods,
such as a kind of Joey Zasa,

311
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:15,846
more in the fabric of the hoods,
perhaps, in the '70s and '80s

312
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,051
who were taking over,

313
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:22,186
who were really kind of a new
breed of tough businessmen.

314
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:27,271
Obviously these types of
wise guys have been portrayed

315
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:32,109
in many wonderful movies,
notably Marty Scorsese's films.

316
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:36,787
I sort of had, in this picture,
the obligation to try to do it all,

317
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:40,242
to satisfy myself with a personal story

318
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:45,126
of a man about my age at the
time of the story, Michael Corleone,

319
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:50,047
who no longer had the passion for success

320
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,845
and to beat everyone, and to get richer.

321
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:58,177
But was more thinking of the things
that really matter, which is to say,

322
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,303
your relationship with your children,

323
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,524
or the lack of relationship
with your children.

324
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,693
I myself have never
allowed that to happen.

325
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:23,334
Joe Mantegna was an actor
I had known for years before.

326
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,912
A wonderful person I have always enjoyed,

327
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,842
and it was really just a
question of trying to find a role

328
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,509
that would be suitable for him

329
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:38,513
and try to be a little bit of the more
well-dressed don of the era, in the '80s.

330
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:44,647
Bring that sensibility into
the mix of this chronicle, really,

331
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,270
that kind of spans so many years.

332
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:44,665
This picture also had another very
difficult handicap, if I may call it that,

333
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,790
is that it had to be
made, really, in a rush.

334
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,623
From the time we started the movie

335
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,880
till the time it actually
came out in the theaters,

336
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,802
I remember on Christmas Day,

337
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,345
was less than a year,

338
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,924
although even in the
scriptwriting phase, I said,

339
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,931
"What's the difference if it
takes another six months?"

340
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:09,141
It would give me and Mario a chance
to hone this complicated material,

341
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:13,145
but the company needed
the film that December

342
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,947
and my requests ultimately
were shrugged away

343
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,948
by the then-head of the
corporation in New York,

344
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,781
who I don't feel understood
anything about the <i>Godfather</i> films

345
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,617
or why they were successful.

346
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,748
It was clearly more for the stock price.

347
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:34,127
Ultimately I think they
were correctly assessing

348
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,051
that unless they had some big windfall,

349
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,639
that the company was vulnerable
and it would be taken over.

350
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,339
And indeed it was.

351
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:47,721
And so I had no strength to be able to
ask that the film be delayed six months,

352
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,650
which caused me a
lot of fear and frustration

353
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,945
because I didn't feel I
had it all quite together,

354
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,613
especially the ending,

355
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,567
which I spent countless
nights staying up over

356
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,121
and trying to reconcile in my mind
as to what would be appropriate,

357
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,834
although I must say that I'm extremely
happy with the ending of this film

358
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,833
and the way it echoed
the other <i>Godfathers</i>

359
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:17,042
in terms of an ending
sequence that was interposed

360
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,254
or parallel-cut with another event,

361
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,510
in this case the opera
<i>Cavalleria Rusticana.</i>

362
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:34,414
Interesting in this scene of Joey Zasa
confronting the bastard Vincent Mancini,

363
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,500
there is an incident
where he bites his ear.

364
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,333
That is right out of <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>

365
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,421
when the same thing happens
between Turiddu and Alfio,

366
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,101
and I've often felt that the music
from <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> and the story,

367
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:54,021
rustic chivalry and the
strange Sicilian notion

368
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,816
of revenge and insult,

369
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,894
this peasant village mentality,

370
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:04,073
really runs through all
of the <i>Godfather</i> stories,

371
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:09,241
and of course, maybe any
modern Italian mafioso story

372
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,288
and so I was very anxious to…

373
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,163
Since I had this third
opportunity to make a film

374
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,712
that hadn't been something I really
thought was ever going to happen,

375
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,961
that I could really use
<i>Cavalleria Rusticana,</i>

376
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:27,513
as part of, now, a story of the family
as they were on the highest, here,

377
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,341
of economic and social success.

378
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,099
When they were truly
wealthy and truly powerful

379
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:38,604
and truly longed to be
out of the criminal milieu.

380
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:54,457
The notion of the family photograph
as also an indication of who's included

381
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,704
and who's not included.

382
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,130
As you recall in the first <i>Godfather,</i>
they took the family photograph

383
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:03,629
and the father was very
anxious that Michael be included.

384
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:09,556
In this case, the fact that Michael
includes this kind of rough son,

385
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,602
illegitimate son of his brother Sonny
into the family obviously echoes that,

386
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:20,476
but also portends that some of the
story is going to deal with this collision

387
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,854
between the old ways, the old
passions, the old gangster behavior,

388
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,110
and the new sophistication.

389
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,004
That's my dad, as I always
remember him, conducting the band.

390
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,426
He never missed a cue in all my
knowledge in doing things with him,

391
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,599
since I was a young kid.

392
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,393
But on this picture, he missed a cue

393
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,353
and when he missed that cue, and I said,

394
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,523
"Dad, you missed the cue," he says,
"No, no, no. I didn't miss the cue,"

395
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,348
and I said, "Dad, you missed it."

396
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:05,650
And he sloughed it off but I knew
then, if my father would miss a cue,

397
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,445
that he didn't have much
longer to be with us, and he didn't.

398
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,530
Now Sofia was going
to dance with Al Pacino,

399
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,366
neither of whom could dance,

400
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,076
and quite on her own,

401
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:26,086
my little granddaughter Gia ran out on
the floor and wanted to dance with Sofia

402
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:31,342
and didn't want Sofia to dance
with Al and all through the scene,

403
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,469
the big ending, you could
see Gia, very, very upset

404
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,891
that Sofia was dancing with Al,

405
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,437
and just held onto her and held onto her.

406
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,140
It was so real.

407
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:47,236
You know, when you use non-actors
and you encourage them to play with you

408
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,782
and to participate with
you as, in effect, Sofia was,

409
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:56,578
you get something that
isn't poised and slick.

410
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:01,542
You get something that's real and
that's what, of course, I was going for.

411
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,712
It's hard for me to imagine now

412
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,837
the Corleone family
at this level of wealth.

413
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,214
I mean the Coppola
family became successful,

414
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:16,261
but not to the point where you could
give a $ 100,000,000 check to charity,

415
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,433
although it would be a nice thing to do.

416
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:25,187
But it was fun to put our family in
some sort of context with this family,

417
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,227
although there was much tragedy to come.

418
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,151
You know when film sequels are made,

419
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:56,733
they're made because above
all the studio wants to basically

420
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,989
keep mining the same mine
and make the same movie,

421
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,119
because works of art as
money-making endeavors

422
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,416
are extremely problematic.

423
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:10,209
You don't know when you give
someone some money to write a script

424
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:14,087
or some people to get together
and make a film, you have no idea

425
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:18,136
whether what they're going to
come up with will please an audience

426
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:22,217
to the extent that would make
that audience come to see it.

427
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:29,228
So the studio ultimately is in
the position of wanting to repeat

428
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,772
what they have that's successful,
try to do it as much like it,

429
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:37,151
and that's why you have
these successions of sequels…

430
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,785
Or even when they're not
sequels, you watch a movie,

431
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:44,409
I mean, it isn't surprising to see a
movie and realize it's the same plot

432
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,786
that you had already
seen in another film.

433
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,368
So I realized that
of course, in this film,

434
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,964
although my heart more was with
the family and the children of the story,

435
00:34:54,050 --> 00:35:00,296
that I really had to have action
and the type of gangster violence

436
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:05,305
that people might have expected
from the previous <i>Godfather.</i>

437
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,605
And of course, Vincent
Mancini was the vehicle,

438
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,851
because he was young and a hothead,

439
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,310
when he was put in the
situation with this lovely journalist,

440
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,942
somewhat willful journalist
played by Bridget Fonda,

441
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:23,365
he had to demonstrate the kind
of cool, calculating personality,

442
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:28,081
that maybe you would have thought of
from Sonny, or in some sense, Michael,

443
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,878
in that he would even say,
"Ah, she means nothing to me.

444
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,548
What do I care?
Kill her if you want, I don't care."

445
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,341
Yet, he had to turn out
to be something of a hero

446
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:41,671
and win the audience's
attention as a man of action

447
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:47,306
because Michael wasn't going to
be that kind of man of action any more

448
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:52,147
and I couldn't think of, nor was
I interested in, making him that.

449
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:57,103
I was interested in the man's sense
of what he had done with his life,

450
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,987
rather than how he was going
to beat his new adversary.

451
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:08,073
So Vincent Mancini was clearly
the young man who was going to,

452
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,876
in a funny way, parallel the Michael
Corleone story of the earlier films

453
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:19,925
and show that rise to power
through his cunning and his bravery.

454
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,391
It's funny. I mean even as a director,

455
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:31,721
I had become like Michael and I
really wasn't interested in the blood hits

456
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,774
and how could we dream up some
spectacular way to shoot somebody

457
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,476
that no one had ever seen.

458
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,189
I just… To me, now, at my age,
the idea of being out on a set,

459
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:47,866
and having to tell the actors how to
hold their gun as they run into the room

460
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:54,209
to cover the FBI guy, I mean I just
could not possibly be interested in that,

461
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,921
and no doubt that's a great weakness,

462
00:36:56,005 --> 00:37:01,091
as is, in this film, Michael's
lack of interest in those things,

463
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:07,215
which gave Connie Corleone the
chance to emerge as a strong woman,

464
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,841
almost like the original <i>Godfather.</i>

465
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:15,272
I heard from Mario Puzo that the
real person he based Don Corleone on,

466
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,607
and all those sayings and that wisdom,

467
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,733
that the real person he based
that character on was his mother.

468
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,538
It's interesting that
there are many things

469
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,959
that my power and youth and
passion and clout got me through

470
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,288
in <i>Godfather II</i> say,
where actors would say,

471
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,634
"Well, I'm not doing it unless
you pay me so much money,

472
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,049
or I won't participate,"

473
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:48,722
that I was able to very nimbly avoid
the problems in this third <i>Godfather,</i>

474
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,469
I didn't have the power any more.

475
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,979
So when I said, "Oh, it has to be
called <i>The Death of Michael Corleone,"</i>

476
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,055
which puts the whole film
in a totally different context,

477
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:01,527
or if Robert Duvall told me, "Oh,
well, if I'm going to be in the film,

478
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,071
I want to be paid as much as Al Pacino,"

479
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,615
or whatever he told me,
I don't even remember.

480
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,535
But I no longer had the
persuasiveness or the…

481
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:15,332
They didn't fear me, to
use a phrase from the movie.

482
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:19,662
So I ultimately lost Robert
Duvall very late in the game.

483
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,173
He was very pivotal to me,
because he was a brother.

484
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,672
He was really from the
first movie in the family

485
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:30,472
and I greatly reduced
the role of that lawyer.

486
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,016
My idea was that Robert
Duvall was the character

487
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,433
who had become very close

488
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,013
to the charities and the Vatican

489
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,017
and who had, as a brother,

490
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:44,569
brought to Michael this opportunity
to work with the Vatican Bank

491
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,156
and when I lost that, I
did a very fast rewrite

492
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,530
and tried to approach it a different way,

493
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,113
making the character of the
lawyer less a family character

494
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,869
and more like the kind
of lawyers I had met.

495
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,827
But when you lose someone in your family,

496
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,834
to me, it's the loss
that keeps on losing.

497
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:07,130
You don't lose them once.
You lose them every day from then on.

498
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,556
It's over and over, because everything
is different than it would have been

499
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,386
had you had that son
or father or brother.

500
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:22,605
In this case, losing Robert Duvall to
play Tom Hagen in this new modern story

501
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,152
was a profound loss
to me and to this movie.

502
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:36,326
Here we are in a scene that really
was the beginning of the whole movie.

503
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,625
This is the scene where the
representative of the Vatican Bank,

504
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,581
custodian and
businessman for the Vatican,

505
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,919
explains his dire problem
to Michael Corleone

506
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,927
in the hope of getting the
Corleone family to bail them out.

507
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:59,637
This material on the Vatican,
it's very hard for anyone,

508
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,893
especially when dealing with the Vatican,

509
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,475
to say something is true or not true.

510
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,896
But anyone who has read any history
knows that anything anyone has said

511
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:13,151
about the Vatican over the
thousands of years, that it was true.

512
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:17,780
The Vatican was as much an
institution of secular activity…

513
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,456
I mean Borgias were popes.

514
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,410
Every possible
conceivable crime and horror

515
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,713
was committed within
and without those halls.

516
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,212
So we're dealing with a fact

517
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,967
and I would respectfully submit

518
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,971
that everything I put into the
film dealing with the Vatican,

519
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,927
its manipulation of money,

520
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,972
the shadows around the
death of the Pope of that era,

521
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:48,937
I felt was true and learned of
that from people who told me.

522
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:56,111
Not the least of whom told me the
very strange manipulations of the fact

523
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,204
that the Vatican Bank for a
while owned Paramount Studios,

524
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,660
something that I just took
great glee in thinking about,

525
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,711
given that it was Paramount Studios

526
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,880
who wanted so badly to make this picture,

527
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,174
for whatever their financial reason was.

528
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,003
And way back at the time that I
was making the first <i>Godfather</i>

529
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:19,308
when I went up in the elevator
to visit Charlie Bluhdorn,

530
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,510
I would see mysterious men,

531
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,642
some of whose names are now legendary,

532
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:29,689
who played a role in the
enormous scandals of a later period

533
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:34,273
with the Vatican Bank and who
ended up dying either by hanging

534
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:38,031
or by a sort of mysterious execution.

535
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,988
So, I feel that what I did

536
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:47,829
in trying to take the
corruption and financial power

537
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:54,677
and improprieties to the highest level of
one of our highest spiritual institutions

538
00:41:55,179 --> 00:42:01,266
was justified by personal information
and things and people I saw.

539
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,522
An interesting note of the
actor playing the Cardinal.

540
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,404
Obviously he is a kind of villain,

541
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,828
although a supposedly sympathetic one,

542
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,999
but he's Donal Donnelly, and
when I was a young filmmaker,

543
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:30,295
I desperately wanted to
have him play the leprechaun

544
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,793
in the film <i>Finian's Rainbow,</i>

545
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,293
and I tried so hard
to convince the studio

546
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:41,424
that the character of Og the
Leprechaun should be shy

547
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,225
and almost frightened of his own voice

548
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,100
because he was the
one they sent after Finian,

549
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:53,444
and of course the studio was sure
that the best person was Tommy Steele,

550
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,698
who was the least shy
person I have ever known,

551
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,819
very talented but the least shy.

552
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,309
And I wanted Donal Donnelly,

553
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,998
so years later I had the pleasure of
casting Donal in quite a different part,

554
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:10,499
but those are the little footnotes that
you bump up against that are amusing.

555
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,893
The scene of the Banco
Immobiliare takeover

556
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,689
was the first scene we shot
on this <i>Godfather III</i> picture,

557
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:17,394
and of course, it's always
a very frightening time.

558
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21,857
Making sure that everyone looks
well and that the characters all seem to

559
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,533
suggest who they are.

560
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,283
There were some interesting
people who were extras in that scene.

561
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,911
One is Gregory Corso, who is the famous

562
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:36,088
and very, very interesting
Beat poet, friend of Kerouac

563
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,840
and Allen Ginsberg, he's in there.

564
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,963
I'll point him out when he pops up.

565
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:45,138
This was the first
day that, I think, Sofia…

566
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:49,434
No, we shot Sofia later, because
at the time of shooting this

567
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,181
we thought Winona Ryder

568
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,684
was going to play the
part of Mary Corleone

569
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:58,985
and so we had to go back
and save the alleged place.

570
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,780
That's Gregory Corso coming.
He just passed away this year.

571
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,918
That's Helmut Berger playing…
I forget his name now in the story.

572
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:24,219
But he was… I thought Helmut
was appropriately sinister

573
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:29,800
and very much like the real-life
figure that he's meant to stand for,

574
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,812
and the man who was
standing in the elevator

575
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,230
when I went up to the top of
the Gulf and Western Building.

576
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:58,291
This particular scene
was very traumatized

577
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,712
for a lot of reasons.

578
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:04,293
It had to do with the
fact that they didn't tell me

579
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:08,096
that they were ready for
the scene and the ADs, who,

580
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,594
especially in New York,
tend to be like jocks,

581
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:14,303
just kind of pulled her up
there and stuck her in there

582
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,310
with the photographer and
they said, "Okay, do the scene."

583
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,018
And they didn't… They wanted to
get the lighting or what have you.

584
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,401
And Sofia was a young
kid and I was furious

585
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,529
that they didn't have me go
up and prepare her for the scene

586
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,327
rather than traumatize
her in the way they did.

587
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,748
So whenever I see that scene…

588
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:35,995
That scene was in and out of
the picture and it obviously is not

589
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,952
as good a scene as
some of the earlier ones.

590
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,287
So, it annoys me that that was done.

591
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,750
Movie crews can be like
football players most of the time.

592
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:51,548
You have to realize that
Sofia had by now become

593
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:56,011
a cause célèbre, the
publicity of a father who had

594
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:59,564
put his daughter in the
movie, seemingly irresponsibly,

595
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,190
but my standpoint is that
we only put Sofia in the role

596
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:08,737
because the day before we
were to shoot it with Winona Ryder,

597
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,820
Winona Ryder dropped out and
there was absolutely nothing left

598
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,747
to shoot without the character
of Mary because we had been

599
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,997
stalling, waiting for a month

600
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,751
and the studio wanted me
to close down and was like

601
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,754
sending me lists of young women…

602
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,381
Wonderful actresses like Madeleine Stowe

603
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:34,258
and other women who were the
talented, beautiful actresses of the day

604
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:38,311
but I very much wanted an 18-year-old.

605
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:42,186
Someone that I believe
could be a girl like Sofia.

606
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,939
So, pressed with the pressure from
the studio to want to stop shooting

607
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:52,947
for three weeks to search for a
more conventional kind of actress,

608
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:58,032
I just basically exercised my
rights to put someone in the film

609
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,786
that I thought would be best.

610
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:04,212
That decision was then vilified
and became a story in itself,

611
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,801
but it's a decision that I've never
regretted and as I watch the film here,

612
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,300
and I get to see Sofia
and how real she was,

613
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,099
just like the kind of kid
she was supposed to be.

614
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:19,644
I'm happy I made that decision,

615
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,937
although Sofia is of course now

616
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,813
a woman of 29 and a successful director.

617
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:30,151
It's great for me to
have this record of her,

618
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,824
when she was a kid, and
even though it was rough on her

619
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:38,121
and to this day, follows
her, I think very unjustly,

620
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,323
I'm thrilled to have
this great home movie

621
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,410
that I can look at her as I
remember her at that age.

622
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,990
This is an interesting notion,
the Vatican would not allow us

623
00:49:56,076 --> 00:50:00,991
to depict us going into the Vatican,
and there was a big fuss about it

624
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,667
and we were there shooting,
and no one knew what to do

625
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,790
and so what I did is I went on
the public street, by the Vatican,

626
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,746
and last minute, just had them set up

627
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,424
the costumed guard,
and the crossing gate,

628
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,878
but it was really just
going down the street.

629
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,008
Had nothing to do with the Vatican.

630
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,850
So it looked as though
the car was going in,

631
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,641
but of course it wasn't.

632
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:28,523
You know, these institutions
tend to, through the idea of…

633
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:32,728
Although they're public institutions,
be it the army or the Vatican

634
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:37,110
or anyone, nowadays, they
choose to control their image

635
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,943
by giving you access
or not giving you access

636
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:44,747
and since they owned the Vatican
and have for several thousand years.

637
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,119
Though it's…

638
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,579
I don't know how legal that
is, really, if you read the history.

639
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,084
Nonetheless, they control it

640
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,836
and then they're able to
perpetuate their position.

641
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,474
This was a fabulous
room in a great palace

642
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,680
where we were able to
introduce what was something

643
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:11,983
similar to the power
struggle in Italy at that time.

644
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,437
This is old history now,
but there was, in those days,

645
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:20,071
a very mysterious
Masonic group known as P2,

646
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,326
and it was perhaps an
alliance of very powerful

647
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:30,786
Catholic businessmen,
who were in control of things

648
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:34,838
and this was the almost mysterious

649
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,338
Mafia-like organization
on a higher level.

650
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,842
I felt that the story
of the Corleone family

651
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:46,847
seems to be a continual rise,
up higher and higher into politics,

652
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,895
into, you know, the
very citadels of power,

653
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:54,522
such as the Vatican and
organizations of foreign businessmen

654
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:58,401
and it was just more of the
same, that the higher you go,

655
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,358
you just run into the
Mafia, in a new form.

656
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:06,367
Not the Mafia in actuality
but in terms of practices

657
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:10,667
and it's very interesting to
me that wherever I go I am told,

658
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:16,465
be it the Mayor of New York or..
. People tell me things, of how,

659
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:21,302
"Saddam Hussein loves <i>The
Godfather</i> and always, to his inner circle,

660
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,550
quotes the lines of the Godfather."

661
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,384
And so in a funny way, it's
true that the higher you go

662
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,891
in this politics and language of power,

663
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:35,316
you run into the same
stuff that is going on,

664
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,645
when people are fighting
over a couple of city blocks.

665
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,082
This character, of course, was meant to

666
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,254
portray a highest level
of power in politics,

667
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:59,750
and all Italians know

668
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,427
who this man is meant to
be by a quote that is given

669
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,757
at the end of the picture
which he is very famous for,

670
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,184
as well as for his thick glasses.

671
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:14,559
But I was always very surprised
when this movie came out in Italy,

672
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:19,937
how none of the Italian journalists or
people were the slightest bit shocked

673
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,273
by any of the allegations
it was making about

674
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,867
the involvement of their
government with the Mafia,

675
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,287
or in the possibility that
their pope was murdered.

676
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,123
And the truth was that they sort of..
. It was old news.

677
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,292
They sort of all have known about it

678
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,997
and digested it and so there was
nothing the slightest bit controversial

679
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,799
about it in this movie.

680
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,890
That is Martin Scorsese's mother, Katy,

681
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:58,225
a most wonderful lady and a
great cook and a wonderful actress

682
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,312
and really a delightful,
delightful lady that we've lost.

683
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,864
But I'm so happy to
have her in the movie,

684
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,488
so I know I can see her, if I miss her.

685
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,672
When I was talking to
George Lucas recently,

686
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:29,552
and we were talking about
an actress and discussing her,

687
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,102
about how beautiful she was
and George looked at me and said,

688
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:36,771
"Yeah," he said. "She's okay.
But Sofia, she's really beautiful."

689
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:52,536
I found Andy Garcia just a very,
very nice young man to work with,

690
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,911
very talented, very self-motivated,

691
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,835
very much working for the project.

692
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:03,335
I do have to say that in my
career, one of the joys of my career,

693
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,093
of all the different movies I worked on,

694
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:09,717
is the cast have always
been my greatest friend,

695
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,881
or my greatest allies.

696
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:16,139
They've always helped the project
and always with such intelligence

697
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,813
and self-sacrifice.

698
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:24,562
I really, almost unanimously
throughout my career on all the projects,

699
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,114
I found that to be the
case and here was Andy,

700
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,534
working with this
now-controversial daughter of mine,

701
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,738
who had never really
acted except as a child,

702
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:38,541
when she was the little sister
in <i>Peggy Sue Got Married</i>

703
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,163
or she was in <i>Rumblefish.</i>

704
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,962
Sofia was always like my good luck charm

705
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,880
to have her be in my movies.

706
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:50,007
And Vincent was so kind to her in
the midst of the raging controversy

707
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,556
that we tried to make this movie with.

708
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:02,016
I loved the story of the daughter
who has a crush on her cousin,

709
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:06,398
because indeed, the
Coppolas, my side of the family,

710
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,026
really come from a union of two cousins.

711
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:14,903
My great-grandmother was a
young girl in the south of Italy

712
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:18,581
who was very talented with
embroidery and crocheting

713
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:22,706
and would occasionally scratch
her nose with her darning needle

714
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,163
and her nose became infected.

715
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:29,376
And the doctors, of course, of
that day only knew to amputate it.

716
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,587
And so my…
This beautiful young woman had no nose

717
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:36,470
and she was forced to
marry her own cousin,

718
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,269
so that someone would
take her and so my whole line,

719
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:44,349
my grandfather, Augustino
Coppola, was born of two cousins,

720
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,653
which of course, certain
aunts and relatives said,

721
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,320
"Yeah, that's why the
whole family is crazy."

722
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:54,776
So that love between the
cousins, I found especially intriguing,

723
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:59,364
but I think Michael's real
desire not to allow a sanction,

724
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:04,624
that love she had, was because
he knew that as far as he had come

725
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:08,422
from his father's roots,
that era before World War II,

726
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,136
the part that will never be made,
that was written but will never be made,

727
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,259
the rise of the Corleones.
Mario used to say, "Yes, the good years,

728
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,308
when we killed everyone
and no one killed us."

729
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,978
But Michael knows that
Vincent is a throwback to that

730
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:27,150
and for his daughter to love
him and perhaps marry him,

731
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,146
that it would put her in danger.

732
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:33,322
Ironically, who put her in
danger was him, himself.

733
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:46,289
Here we have a scene in which Joey Zasa

734
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:52,296
tries to enlarge his
piece of the crime family,

735
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,753
senses that Michael has lost interest.

736
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,930
I feel you can tell, I
have always said that

737
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,851
you know whether a man is on
his way up or on his way down.

738
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:07,683
I myself, you know, in years past
could say, "You know, I clearly am

739
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:12,191
"so full of anxious passion
to do these movies."

740
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,648
I'm certainly on the way
up," and just as I record this,

741
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:20,282
equally, I'm on the way down,
because I don't have the passion

742
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:23,785
for the kinds of things
that you must do in movies,

743
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,333
to have them be popular today.

744
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,458
I feel the only thing that
could give me that passion

745
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,166
is if I would be allowed to
try to explore something new,

746
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,797
but to be condemned
to make the same movie,

747
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,556
over and over again, it's
sort of like Jean-Paul Sartre.

748
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,928
It's sort of like
somebody's idea of hell,

749
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,306
that you have a medium, the cinema,

750
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:48,435
which maybe we've touched
8% of what its language is

751
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,856
and what it can do.

752
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:54,695
And to be told by the people who
own it, who make money with it,

753
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,991
who buy jewelry for
their wives with it, that,

754
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,692
"No, you can't any
more experiment with it.

755
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,579
"You can't take it into new territory."

756
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,746
You must do the same
thing over and over again."

757
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,621
That is a bitter, bitter pill to swallow.

758
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:23,387
Obviously, the big scene like this
harkens back to earlier <i>Godfathers</i>

759
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:29,348
when we have the so-called
five families, the old Mafiosi,

760
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,435
clearly this is the old kind of
story in which Michael Corleone

761
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,361
usually proves to outsmart them all.

762
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:39,816
There were many obligations
to try to have this film,

763
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,448
not only have some of the
values that I've been talking about

764
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,540
that were personally
more important to me,

765
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:49,709
but we had to drum up interesting
violent sequences or action sequences.

766
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:53,459
We had to kill a bunch of people in
a way we hadn't killed them before,

767
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:59,670
so we just did our best.
And I kind of went to my…

768
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,219
"I've got to kill 20 people.

769
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,970
God, I hate doing scenes
where I've got to kill 20 people."

770
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,427
Unless it was really something totally…

771
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,138
That I'd never imagined before.

772
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,644
And in the scene we had this idea that,

773
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:16,102
"Well, if you were in the
top of some Las Vegas hotel,

774
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,563
"how would you wipe out,"

775
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:23,072
"as was Michael's style to
do, all the opposition at once?"

776
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:28,327
"What if the tables were
turned and a guy like Joey Zasa,"

777
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:31,875
"this more new-style mobster"

778
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:37,378
"in more the image of
the Teflon Don of fame,"

779
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,879
how would he approach this?"
And I thought,

780
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,678
"How intriguing it
would be if just suddenly,

781
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,932
"everything just started vibrating
and you didn't even know why"

782
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,223
"and the walnuts were
rolling on the table"

783
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,145
"and the oranges were
rolling off the table"

784
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:54,019
"and turned out that the bad
guys had just engaged a helicopter,"

785
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:57,028
they'd just fly right up to the
window and machine-gun everyone."

786
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,854
So that's the way we thought we would go

787
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,406
and we would perhaps
never show the helicopter.

788
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,735
That would be sort of far out,

789
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,330
for filmmakers always love to do
things without showing anything

790
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,793
and usually those are the
best things, but in this case,

791
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,710
we did break down and
got some extra shots,

792
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:19,040
I believe, of the
specter of the helicopter.

793
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:23,753
Of course, Vincent Mancini
senses something wrong,

794
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:29,217
especially when this wily old
guy with one foot in the grave,

795
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:35,307
kind of goes out of the room,
to try to mollify Joey Zasa.

796
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,767
Vincent, who's sort
of closer to the street,

797
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:41,900
senses something amiss that
perhaps even Michael doesn't.

798
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,857
But Michael doesn't care
about this stuff anymore.

799
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,864
Michael doesn't care about

800
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:52,949
the gain of having
this turf or that turf.

801
01:01:55,545 --> 01:02:00,415
This is an interesting little custom
that I think someone told me about,

802
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:03,751
that at these parties they
would just pass around

803
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,964
a tray of beautiful jewelry
and watches, probably hot,

804
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,720
and anyone could take what they wanted.

805
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,857
There's the vibrating
which just starts in now,

806
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:23,779
out of the glass window was this notion

807
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:29,736
of wiping out all of your
opponents in one easy move.

808
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,787
And of course all Michael has to really

809
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:36,833
lead him to freedom would
be this young nephew.

810
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,092
The incident of the coat, it
was something I read about

811
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:49,555
that this one guy really was
so hung up on getting his coat

812
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:53,475
that he ends up getting
massacred with the others.

813
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,928
It's a little bit based on Apalachin,

814
01:02:56,022 --> 01:03:01,233
I think, when the FBI came upon
all of the Mafia leaders in one place,

815
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,311
eating steaks and having a good time.

816
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,566
So we imagined, how can
we make an unusual sequence

817
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:13,993
that could live up to some of the violent
sequences in the earlier <i>Godfathers.</i>

818
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:17,996
Violence is a hard thing to do, you know.

819
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:20,794
It's a… Without repeating yourself.

820
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,595
That's a funny statement,
"Violence is a hard thing to do

821
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,138
without repeating yourself."

822
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,340
In the end, it's about flesh
being torn, and blood. I hate it.

823
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:47,526
Michael, here, is clearly
not the guy in command of…

824
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:52,826
His wits are not as tuned to
survival as his young nephew is.

825
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:57,122
The younger Michael perhaps
would have outsmarted them.

826
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,542
And I ultimately feel
that's what audiences

827
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,915
who saw this picture wanted him to do.

828
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:06,624
They wanted to see the old Michael
who just was one step ahead of them

829
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:11,713
and it was hard to have him
be that and at the same time,

830
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:17,726
be more concerned with
matters of his heart and his soul.

831
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,891
This scene echoed,
quite a bit, <i>Godfather I,</i>

832
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,189
where after an attack,

833
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:27,061
the family sat around in the
apartment, had bodyguards.

834
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,692
Here, note that Michael
is drinking lots of water

835
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,076
and if you look through
the three films, you'll see

836
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,618
he has this tremendous
thirst to drink water.

837
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,536
This is his diabetes.

838
01:04:55,558 --> 01:05:00,553
Now I had made two
<i>Godfather</i> films after really only

839
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:04,436
intending to make one, not
even very happily doing that

840
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,234
as it turned out, and
making a second one,

841
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,527
which was a very happy experience for me,

842
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:12,948
because we were able to
do it without any interference

843
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,527
and many years later, just as Michael

844
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,909
feels anxious to want
to get on with your life

845
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:24,118
and to mature and to
try to be a better man,

846
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:29,127
a better artist, you get pulled
back into something of your youth.

847
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:32,050
The past is always
having a war with the future.

848
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:37,428
I find I try so hard to be in the
future and to think of new things

849
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,472
and new thoughts, and always,
I'm pulled back by the past.

850
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:43,645
As I sit here, recording this commentary,

851
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:47,068
what is it other than being pulled
back into something of the past?

852
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:52,647
Because no one is ever interested
in the future, except artists, really.

853
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,153
Artists are the ones who
want to step forward, move on,

854
01:05:56,244 --> 01:06:00,363
but every other part of
society wants them to stay back

855
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:05,413
where everyone is all huddled
against the storm, the past, you know.

856
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,653
They call it the
present, but it's the past.

857
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:20,383
Now characters like Neri,
played by Richard Bright,

858
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:24,436
are emerging as the Caporegimes.

859
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:28,982
Talia herself is the main
Caporegime in the family

860
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:32,982
as they plan to brace themselves

861
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:38,112
against this very, very
well-organized and financed onslaught.

862
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:45,992
Here, of course, Michael
really shows his vulnerability.

863
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,248
He is a man very sick from diabetes.

864
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:54,425
And I think this type of thing,
to try to express Michael's

865
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:59,096
ultimate aging and disillusion, is
what people did not want to see.

866
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:03,551
They don't want to see
Michael Corleone as a mortal,

867
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:07,687
as a man struggling with
what is a horrible disease.

868
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:12,689
They want to see him cool
and always on top of his enemies

869
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,942
and I think that was
one perhaps strong way

870
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,900
that in pleasing myself, I
disappointed my audience.

871
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:07,456
I feel it would have been
a wonderful dimension

872
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:12,628
that the character that, I think,
George Hamilton valiantly played…

873
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:16,298
Because people felt it was
very inappropriate that he be cast.

874
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:20,218
He's such a wonderfully funny
person and charming person.

875
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:23,969
The notion of having
him be in a <i>Godfather</i> film

876
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,049
was considered inappropriate.

877
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,020
And I think he valiantly played his part,

878
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,187
but you can see how much more complex

879
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,141
it would have been had
it been Bobby Duvall,

880
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:37,148
who was the family lawyer arranging these

881
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,151
high-level machinations with the Vatican.

882
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,734
And partly being even suspect.

883
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,415
Of course, with the <i>Godfather</i>
stories it's always a puzzle

884
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,869
as to who is really responsible.

885
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:59,675
Obviously we know that Joey
Zasa, played by Joe Mantegna,

886
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:02,503
was the front man, but you always wonder,

887
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,840
"Well, who's really behind it?
Who's really the villain?"

888
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,516
We've learned from
previous <i>Godfather</i> films,

889
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:11,061
that it's never the one that you suspect.

890
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,731
There's always someone
higher up, very high up.

891
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:43,173
Here, Tally begins to emerge as a…

892
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:47,927
I guess like the Caporegimes, there
was originally Tessio and Clemenza

893
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:52,511
and here you have Tally, or Constanza,

894
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:57,975
and Neri as the two main
lieutenants who are trying to…

895
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:02,734
Much as in <i>Godfather I,</i>
when Marlon Brando was

896
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,408
attempted to be killed and the family was

897
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:10,579
trying to protect him and
trying to protect themselves.

898
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,665
There is a parallel throughout
this movie with <i>Godfather I,</i>

899
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,869
more than the other
work I did on the films.

900
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:28,969
And whereas, for some reason, it
was all right to see Marlon Brando,

901
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,971
as Vito Corleone, the first Godfather,

902
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:36,305
in a state of weakness and illness,

903
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:41,106
it doesn't feel right to a certain
interpretation of <i>The Godfather</i>

904
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,562
to ever see Michael
Corleone in this status,

905
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:47,399
although to me, what is
about to happen here is

906
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:52,863
the beginning of a rebuilding of
what really means most to him.

907
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,540
I have no doubt that Michael,

908
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:59,369
despite the limitations of his
Sicilian-American upbringing

909
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:02,582
and how men are supposed to be
and how women are supposed to be

910
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:07,044
and wives are supposed
to be, he really loved Kay,

911
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:10,551
much as Diane and
Al really love each other

912
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:14,802
or loved each other or probably
will always love each other.

913
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:21,268
I felt we were dealing with real things
in the context of this romantic novel.

914
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,773
And I wanted to look at Al more like

915
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,652
a Marlon Brando figure
in the first <i>Godfather,</i>

916
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:33,029
although that character, Don Corleone,
in all of this jeopardy was at peace

917
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,363
because although he
had done terrible things,

918
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:40,248
somehow he had
managed to outwit the devil.

919
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:43,831
He had managed to emerge,

920
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,213
though a murderer and a gangland leader

921
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:52,139
and obviously a person who…
You would have to say an evil man,

922
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:56,640
he managed somehow to have
us feel that he was a good man.

923
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,369
This scene once happened to me.
I remember it very vividly.

924
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,496
I shot it just the way I remember it,

925
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,544
my son and my daughter,
coming in at a time

926
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:27,420
when it looked pretty bad for me

927
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,217
and for our family.

928
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:34,764
It's very touching to me to
have been able to encapsulate

929
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:40,847
something that I really remember,
with fiction, albeit with my daughter.

930
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,945
There was always
something intriguing to me

931
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:54,242
of the Italian girl who was privileged,

932
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:57,787
who, as we see there, had a
beautiful Alfa Romeo sports car

933
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,333
and was so fashionable and yet

934
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:04,787
drawn to these mean streets,

935
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:09,921
these rank hangouts, to
pursue the cousin she loved,

936
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:14,762
even though it was very, very
dangerous and forbidden by her family.

937
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:27,852
I find the story of Mary Corleone and her

938
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,734
relationship between
her father and her cousin,

939
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:36,739
were very moving to me, to
think what that must really mean.

940
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:40,493
Go against your father's will
because you love your cousin.

941
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,314
For those of you who
want to learn how to cook,

942
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:15,111
and I always felt <i>The Godfather</i>
at least should give a recipe

943
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:20,696
every once in a while, this is a pretty
authentic method of rolling gnocchi.

944
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:25,125
The whole secret of
rolling gnocchi really is

945
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,629
the touch when you flip
them over with your finger.

946
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,045
You can do it with a fork, too.

947
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:34,968
Gnocchi is made with an equal
part of flour and mashed potatoes,

948
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:38,843
a little bit of salt, and
you create the dough,

949
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:42,346
it's really a potato dumpling,
and then you roll it out

950
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:46,976
in these long tubular
strips as you'll see them do.

951
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:50,316
Then with a knife cut them into
little three-quarter-inch sections

952
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,987
and then you have to have the touch.
So you need your cousin

953
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:57,441
to help guide your
finger as you flip it around.

954
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,286
You get a little dimple in the gnocchi

955
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,486
and that's what makes them more tender

956
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,665
so they're not just
like little pellets of lead

957
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,083
when they come out of the water.

958
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,085
When they're cooked
they'll rise to the top,

959
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:13,290
so you don't have to dump the water.
You can just scoop them off the top.

960
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:17,878
And, you know, most gnocchi in
restaurants are too soft and mushy.

961
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:22,557
My gnocchi, I don't know
why, are just a little more firm,

962
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,475
but this is how you roll them.

963
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,599
You see the little dimple?

964
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:31,808
That's the secret, that little
dimple when they flip over.

965
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:36,521
I find this love story so sweet,
you know, so touching to me.

966
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:40,028
And both of them so young and…

967
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,570
I mean this holding of her hand

968
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,952
is just going to make such
unhappiness for the two of them,

969
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,784
it makes me want to cry.

970
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:07,560
Nothing but trouble will come from this.

971
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,387
And tragedy.

972
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:37,506
Here we are on very familiar turf.

973
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:42,087
We're at the Festa of San Gennaro.

974
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,719
The policemen on horseback
is an important element

975
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:49,765
that's established earlier
and of course, you know,

976
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:55,100
Joey Zasa, like any number
of civic-minded men of affairs,

977
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,276
John Gotti or others,

978
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:02,449
you know, really always tried
to reward the neighborhoods

979
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,776
and throw festivals with fireworks

980
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,204
and I think that's what
Joey Zasa is doing here.

981
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:13,831
The society of Anthony Meucci
is going to raffle off a Cadillac.

982
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:17,755
Meucci, for those who don't
know, is the Italian-American

983
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:22,047
who invented the telephone, they
say before Alexander Graham Bell.

984
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:25,472
At any rate, the two of them
long have been associated

985
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,640
with the invention of the telephone

986
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:31,560
and Italians always like to
say that it was really Meucci.

987
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:35,311
But many great technological
inventions have more than one inventor.

988
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,769
Television has three
or four that I can think of.

989
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:42,151
These great innovations
come about of the times

990
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:46,656
and sometimes more than one
person thinks of them, so, yes, it's true.

991
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,487
Meucci was an inventor of the telephone.

992
01:17:56,463 --> 01:18:00,502
This is Elizabeth Street in New
York, incidentally where I live

993
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,051
when I'm in New York myself now.

994
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,229
I have a little apartment at
the end of it, maybe I'll see it.

995
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:33,449
You can see the way the horse
is being woven through this,

996
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,660
somewhat hopefully, mysteriously.

997
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:02,022
The little girl whose
face is shocked with…

998
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:04,900
Her name, I think, was
Jessica, a very sweet little girl

999
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,697
and I still get letters from her.

1000
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,240
She must be a big girl now.

1001
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:34,889
We always wanted to have a coup de grâce

1002
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:39,268
performed by a guy on a horse,
dressed up as a New York cop,

1003
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,770
so we got to do it for this movie.

1004
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:59,459
So it was just like <i>Godfather I,</i>
while Michael was clinging for life,

1005
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,129
or in a weakened state,
the family went ahead

1006
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:07,254
and engaged in violence
which Don Vito Corleone

1007
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:11,008
would have objected to
and now Michael does.

1008
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:14,682
Of course, his sister, Connie,

1009
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,635
and his Caporegimes
and Vincent himself said,

1010
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:21,018
"What were we to do?
They were coming after us."

1011
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:25,147
And Michael seems to
understand that it has to end.

1012
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:29,777
That you just can't keep
outsmarting your enemy in this

1013
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:35,579
back and forth, <i>Oresteia</i> type
of violence begetting violence.

1014
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,827
To do that is to sacrifice your youth,

1015
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:42,501
because ultimately it
will destroy the future.

1016
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,831
Well, in all the trouble spots
of the world, I always wonder

1017
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:50,506
in the Middle East and other places,
don't they think of their young people?

1018
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:55,803
Don't they think that to constantly
trade violence for violence,

1019
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,258
only begets more violence,

1020
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:00,188
that they're just eating up
their own children, in a way.

1021
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:05,563
But it goes on, even as I'm speaking
and will, no doubt, long after I'm gone.

1022
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,918
That's a nice set.
That's Dean Tavoularis,

1023
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:25,415
once again working with us in Rome,

1024
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:29,044
shooting a film that was
supposedly set in New York in Rome.

1025
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:32,718
It would have been wise, had
we perhaps had a little budget

1026
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:36,264
to shoot more of a second
unit in New York than we did.

1027
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,513
We did go around and
shoot streets and entrances,

1028
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,897
but it would've been nice to have
more of the texture of New York in this.

1029
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:46,849
You don't really feel it as
much as you should, I think.

1030
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:07,753
Of course one of the
exciting things of this movie

1031
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,753
was the fact that not only
did the cast come back

1032
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:14,211
but all of the main
collaborators, those living,

1033
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:18,590
and we had as our director
of photography, Gordon Willis.

1034
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,675
We had Dean Tavoularis,

1035
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:24,307
for wardrobe, however,
we worked for the first time,

1036
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:30,269
with a new designer of the
costumes, was Milena Canonero,

1037
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:32,273
picking up from the wonderful work

1038
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,981
that Johnny Johnstone
had done on the first film

1039
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:39,285
and Theodora Van Runkle
had done on the second film.

1040
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:44,624
And also on the editorial team,
Walter Murch and Barry Malkin,

1041
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,075
long-term collaborators.

1042
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,962
And associate editor was Lisa Fruchtman,

1043
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,458
who had worked also on <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

1044
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,756
So it was a family,

1045
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:57,754
both in the crew and the team.

1046
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:01,967
The producers were Fred
Roos and Gray Frederickson

1047
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:06,770
and then Chuck Mulvehill provided
essential productorial services.

1048
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:11,146
So the difficulty had to do with

1049
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:14,649
trying really to get it all
done, get it all written,

1050
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:18,984
pull these themes together all in
time to be released that Christmas.

1051
01:23:56,907 --> 01:24:00,025
I found it really pleasurable
to work with Eli Wallach.

1052
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:03,201
His family came to visit one day

1053
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,791
and they… Right in front of him,
they said, "Oh, don't let Eli overact."

1054
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,912
And I laughed and smiled

1055
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,835
because I just got such
a kick out of what he did.

1056
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:15,665
I suppose one could say
that he laid it on a little thick,

1057
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,878
but I certainly enjoyed
it and if it's a little broad…

1058
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:22,714
It's I who enjoyed it. So I did it.

1059
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,721
I always liked Eli Wallach.
I loved him in <i>Baby Doll</i>

1060
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:29,270
and he was a pleasure to be around.

1061
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:34,226
I love the idea of a character
who's this old, old, old, old man

1062
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,686
who's always giving you advice, you know,

1063
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,067
like "Well, I don't have
much longer to live,"

1064
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:41,239
but really he's going to outlive you all

1065
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:45,160
and he's going to have
the last laugh, almost.

1066
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:48,911
His resolution in this movie
is particularly amusing to me.

1067
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:08,555
And here in another <i>Godfather</i> tradition

1068
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:14,607
suddenly we're in the beautiful
sunny setting of Sicily and…

1069
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:18,777
This was a very
beautiful part of the shoot,

1070
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:21,947
because we were really in Palermo

1071
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:25,402
and outside of Palermo where
the people are so wonderful.

1072
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:29,363
And anyone who sees this movie

1073
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:34,210
and sees Sicily as a beautiful place,

1074
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,628
this is not even a tenth of it.

1075
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:41,755
It is the most beautiful island and
such sweet and hospitable people.

1076
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:45,213
I think perhaps that's where
the Sicilians get the reputation

1077
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:50,473
as being especially tough, it's
only because they are so open,

1078
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:55,648
and so arms-embraced, that
if you take advantage of them,

1079
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:58,522
you do something that can only be

1080
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:02,355
responded to with the
most harsh response,

1081
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:07,319
because they are very
trusting and great people.

1082
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:19,506
These were beautiful settings in
Sicily, these wonderful palaces and…

1083
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:24,715
Indeed, many of them were
the same locations we used

1084
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:28,639
for the first and second
<i>Godfather</i> pictures.

1085
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:34,186
This particular villa where he meets with

1086
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:37,765
the old timers is the very first villa

1087
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:41,397
where Michael had taken
his young wife, Apollonia.

1088
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:07,044
Here we have, again,
actors from the past.

1089
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:10,131
Franco Citti, who was
one of the two shepherds

1090
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:13,388
who had been Michael's loyal bodyguard,

1091
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:16,971
is now back, more elderly.

1092
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:22,060
This is a new actor, playing the
part that Corrado Gaipa played,

1093
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:27,274
if you remember, the old uncle
who had taken care of Michael

1094
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:30,280
when he stayed at the villa.
This is his villa.

1095
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:36,331
The name Lucchesi is
the man I referred to earlier,

1096
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:41,504
who was the gentleman with the
thick black glasses and represents,

1097
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:46,585
I won't say his name, the highest level
of political power at that time in Italy

1098
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:51,806
and only recently has been
through many, many inquiries,

1099
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:54,350
regarding his association with the Mafia,

1100
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:58,270
which has all conveniently,
seemingly, been dealt with,

1101
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:01,599
but everyone knows the truth.

1102
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:50,568
I feel Al Pacino was very

1103
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:54,159
brave in working with me

1104
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:58,615
to take Michael outside
of the pre-fabricated,

1105
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:02,326
Michael Corleone-type role.
I mean, starting from day one,

1106
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,627
when we cut his hair,

1107
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:08,833
which sort of really determined
the course we were going to go.

1108
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,509
He wasn't going to be

1109
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,513
the Michael Corleone
of the other two pictures

1110
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:17,012
who was going to be one step
ahead of all the adversaries.

1111
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:22,688
That he was going to be a
combination more of Marlon's character

1112
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:26,813
in the first <i>Godfather,</i> and a kind of man

1113
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:30,191
more concerned with
his hope of redemption,

1114
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:33,365
and hope to be reunited with his family

1115
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,988
to a hope of earning back,

1116
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,367
if not the respect, but
the regard of his wife.

1117
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:42,916
These were his concerns rather than

1118
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:47,668
who was going to control the
cocaine business in West Long Beach

1119
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:54,717
or these idiotic concerns that
the powerful men of our time are…

1120
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,052
Who's going to own
cable or who's going to

1121
01:29:57,142 --> 01:30:00,225
figure out how they
can sell air to people.

1122
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:05,057
Michael's concern is, I think, deeper.

1123
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,767
And nothing is higher,
I would think for him,

1124
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:09,570
than his relationship with his son,

1125
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:13,318
who, while he wants to be
independent of his father,

1126
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,618
still wants to express
something to his father,

1127
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:21,493
"Accept me and how
I'm different, but also,

1128
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:25,793
"understand that it means really more"

1129
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:29,588
"that I can go my own
way and yet be your son,"

1130
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,801
and love you, and
respect you as a father."

1131
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:35,048
And I was moved by the thought

1132
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:40,759
that this boy would sing an
old Sicilian song to his father

1133
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:45,938
and not even know that it
was bringing back memories

1134
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,935
of Michael Corleone's young wife,

1135
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,896
who had been sacrificed in

1136
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:59,235
the insane warfare between thugs.

1137
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:06,626
At this point, we had the
footage of those old movies

1138
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:10,750
and we said, "Oh, people will know
that he's thinking of the young bride."

1139
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,002
And then we said,
"Well, maybe they won't.

1140
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,255
"So, what the hell.
Let's just cut it in."

1141
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:17,552
And also it was a parallel

1142
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,926
to his beautiful daughter, who…

1143
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:25,386
He recognizes, and very aptly,
that Apollonia was murdered

1144
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:30,020
because she was the
wife of a Mafia gangster

1145
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,977
and if the love of Vincent

1146
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:37,781
was to not be exterminated,
that one day his own daughter,

1147
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:40,950
Mary, would be killed
perhaps in the same way

1148
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:42,823
that his young wife was.

1149
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:59,215
These scenes with the
kids were very tough.

1150
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:03,014
At this time, in Palermo, there
were Paramount executives,

1151
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:07,186
kind of visiting and
staying in the hotel rooms

1152
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,890
and at that point, Sofia was so frazzled

1153
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:15,194
by the enormous lack of support

1154
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,772
that she felt from all these people

1155
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:23,949
and the idea that it had been such
a self-serving mistake to cast her.

1156
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:29,034
I remember this scene in particular.
The pressure, poor kid.

1157
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:32,870
Sofia showed that
she had a lot of strength

1158
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,922
and grace during that period
and, of course, it didn't stop.

1159
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:39,923
It went on for years, but it was…

1160
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:41,845
This was a tough scene

1161
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:46,092
and her confidence was pretty
much smashed at this point,

1162
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:50,554
and the young boy too, you
know, who was a newcomer as well.

1163
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:14,378
I think I stole that image
from a Visconti film,

1164
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:17,752
the idea that there would
be just this old castle

1165
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,173
and the curtain blowing

1166
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,093
and some rock and roll music coming out.

1167
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:56,453
At this time, in Palermo,
I was pretty much

1168
01:33:56,548 --> 01:34:00,462
hysterically trying to figure
out the ending of the movie.

1169
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,590
There had been an ending of the script,

1170
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:08,550
which basically was that sort
of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton,

1171
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,135
and the characters of Michael and Kay,

1172
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:13,436
have something of a reconciliation

1173
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:16,811
and she does accept him

1174
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:21,145
and when they go to church one Easter,

1175
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,651
as they come out of their church,

1176
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:27,655
some gunmen come and
shoot him and he falls down

1177
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:31,989
onto the steps, bleeding, and
Kay goes up to him and says,

1178
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,700
"Michael, Michael, are you dying?"

1179
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:39,584
And he looks at her and says, "No.
" And then he dies.

1180
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,006
Lying to her for the last time.

1181
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,427
And I liked that ending
and that was the ending

1182
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:48,096
and then I became really troubled

1183
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:53,845
that just to kill him at the
end somehow wasn't enough.

1184
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:57,772
You know the movie, in my mind,
was <i>The Death of Michael Corleone,</i>

1185
01:34:57,859 --> 01:35:01,773
so of course I have that gene
injected the wrong way into me,

1186
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:04,865
that if it's going to be called
<i>The Death of Michael Corleone,</i>

1187
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,867
then of course I'm not
going to have him die,

1188
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,113
you know, perverse as that might be.

1189
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:13,614
And I just…
I don't know, I just couldn't…

1190
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,198
I couldn't digest that ending

1191
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:18,786
and it's a little bit like the
experience on <i>Apocalypse Now,</i>

1192
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,962
where the more I worked on the film

1193
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,627
and the more I made it
more and more surreal

1194
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,967
and more and more kind of philosophical,

1195
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:29,888
the more the typical ending
of just a big battle at the end

1196
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,556
just didn't satisfy me.

1197
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:36,388
And so I really began to

1198
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:40,816
try to think of another ending,
and I went into my typical mode

1199
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:43,815
of staying up all night and writing

1200
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:47,315
and trying to write
and talking to everyone

1201
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:51,026
and asking Mario, "What can I do?
What can I do for the ending?"

1202
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:54,996
And I must say that, this has
happened to me on other films,

1203
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:57,324
and if you want to know which ones,

1204
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,587
it happened to me for the
ending of <i>The Cotton Club.</i>

1205
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:02,754
It happened to me for the ending of…

1206
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,626
Recently, <i>The Rainmaker.</i>

1207
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:08,502
And I really was troubled over
the endings, for different reasons.

1208
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:11,255
For <i>The Rainmaker,</i> it
was because, in the book,

1209
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:15,434
everyone knew that the kid
was going to win the law case.

1210
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,262
So what was the drama in a movie?

1211
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:22,190
I just struggled and tried
and tried and tried and…

1212
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,860
For all of you young writers and stuff,

1213
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:27,238
the amount of hitting
my head against the wall

1214
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:30,441
and staying up all night and
then hating what I've done

1215
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:31,946
and trying again…

1216
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:35,620
But I must say that I very much

1217
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,866
like the ending of this picture

1218
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:43,121
of <i>The Death of Michael Corleone,</i>
partly because he doesn't really die.

1219
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:44,830
It's worse than dying.

1220
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:08,149
Here we have this mysterious
figure, Mr. Lucchesi, and you'll see,

1221
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,197
he has these formidable-looking police.

1222
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:14,819
So he's clearly a very important
person in the government,

1223
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,903
if not the head of the government,

1224
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,158
and he clearly is involved

1225
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:24,666
with this traitor, whom
we now see as a traitor.

1226
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:29,592
So just as we thought
Joey Zasa was just small-fry

1227
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:33,508
in a simple, very shallow
level of the conspiracy

1228
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,090
that Michael is up against,

1229
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:40,269
not only the highest
levels of the Vatican,

1230
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:45,020
but, surprisingly, that also puts
him at the highest levels of the Mafia,

1231
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,192
which takes him to the
head of the Italian state.

1232
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:52,864
The guy couldn't be in more trouble
with more powerful people if he tried.

1233
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:29,902
This was a beautiful scene that

1234
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:35,153
Mario had really been the
instigator of, as is, of course,

1235
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:38,326
the case with so many of
the great scenes of this movie,

1236
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:41,576
where the two plots really come together

1237
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:47,287
and we have Michael's
personal story in his desire for,

1238
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:49,413
really, redemption and forgiveness

1239
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:54,751
and to be taken in the arms of God

1240
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:58,510
and be still welcome as his child.

1241
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:02,934
And equally the high
levels of the Vatican,

1242
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:07,856
which is, in fact, so corrupt
and has always been so.

1243
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:12,444
And so venal and mercenary.

1244
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:15,613
So it takes you to two places at once…

1245
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:22,029
And this story of the stone,
of course is a beautiful…

1246
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:25,286
Says more than I can say about the Church

1247
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,959
and the institution of the Vatican.

1248
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,814
He is still being ravaged

1249
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:01,652
by the diabetes, as my grandfather was.

1250
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:06,490
He needs to have
information to understand

1251
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:10,248
what forces are really
ranged against him.

1252
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:13,501
But more important, and
again more important to me,

1253
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,582
as it was to Michael

1254
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:19,169
is these other issues that a man

1255
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,255
sometimes comes to,
which are more personal

1256
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:25,934
and more related to,

1257
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:30,932
really, how he stacked
up as a man in his lifetime.

1258
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,360
A lot of people ask me,
"Oh, you know, when you die,

1259
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,863
"what do you want on your gravestone?
Do you want to be remembered"

1260
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:37,608
for a movie?"

1261
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,360
And I look at them and
I say, "Oh, you know,

1262
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:43,454
just put, 'He liked little
children,' or something like that."

1263
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:46,200
That's really what I was like.

1264
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:50,204
And this is the point he's at,

1265
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:53,036
except he's not so simple as I am

1266
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:56,964
and he has darker ghosts

1267
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:59,543
to exorcise from his life.

1268
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:02,800
And here we have

1269
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,549
the ancient tradition of confession.

1270
01:41:05,643 --> 01:41:09,136
But imagine taking Michael
Corleone's confession.

1271
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:16,150
A wonderful actor, Raf Vallone,

1272
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:19,571
movie star from years before,

1273
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:23,491
played this scene and
contributed so much to this film.

1274
01:41:56,277 --> 01:42:02,068
But, you know, those guys watching
<i>Godfather</i> movies in New Jersey,

1275
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,692
the fellows who know the
Soprano family and what have you,

1276
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:08,445
they're not interested

1277
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:10,906
in Michael Corleone's
confession, I assure you.

1278
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,092
They're interested in what
he's going to do to all those guys.

1279
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:29,299
Here, just visually, we
wanted to give the impression of

1280
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:31,643
looking through the
grating of a confessional.

1281
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,146
Of course, they were
outside in the garden.

1282
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:37,474
So we shot through the flowers to
try to give the sense of the privacy

1283
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,981
or the intimacy of a confessional.

1284
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:36,040
I knew men like Michael
Corleone, it seemed to me,

1285
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:39,870
those steel-haired, crew-cutted

1286
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:44,709
men who were the leaders of

1287
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:48,215
merchants' groups and Catholic charities,

1288
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:50,216
Knights of Columbus,

1289
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:54,559
former military people.

1290
01:43:54,645 --> 01:44:00,561
In a way, Michael is that, isn't he?
He is a former military man.

1291
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:04,815
Those are the kinds
of strong, steel-like men

1292
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:07,405
that I tried to base him on,

1293
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:11,155
but show him really

1294
01:44:11,287 --> 01:44:14,405
in touch with his great, great regret

1295
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:16,489
and his great, great guilt

1296
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:20,578
and the weight of what
he had done all his life,

1297
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:24,414
weighing on him with no one, no wife,

1298
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:27,174
to comfort him anymore,

1299
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:30,421
because he had also
destroyed that relationship.

1300
01:45:12,515 --> 01:45:16,224
A project that has so
many main characters

1301
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:20,474
needs to provide an
introduction for each of them

1302
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:24,728
and ultimately continue
their involvement in the story

1303
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:29,400
and then obviously needs an emotional…

1304
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:35,073
If not a resolution, but
an emotional culmination.

1305
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:38,822
And, here, given so
much that has happened

1306
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:41,078
to Michael Corleone,

1307
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:44,077
his long relationship with his sister,

1308
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:48,081
dating back to where he
had her husband killed,

1309
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:52,336
and through the period
in the Lake Tahoe days,

1310
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:55,922
when he was so
disapproving of her behavior

1311
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:59,426
and now, almost as a collaborator

1312
01:45:59,562 --> 01:46:04,728
in this mob life that she
seems to have taken a shine to.

1313
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:07,942
I thought it was moving
that she would help him

1314
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:10,357
with his insulin shots.

1315
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:14,441
I confess that this interest in diabetes

1316
01:46:14,577 --> 01:46:20,198
comes from my childhood experience
with my grandfather, seeing it.

1317
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,706
He was blinded from diabetes.

1318
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:25,125
I remember he used
to just touch our faces

1319
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:27,795
and cry, 'cause he…

1320
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:33,213
Especially with my sister Tally,
because he had seven sons.

1321
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:35,466
He never had a daughter.

1322
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:49,730
Everyone knows that it's so difficult,

1323
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,563
chemistry between families,
the tremendous love you have,

1324
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:58,242
and yet you have this
familiarity, you know them so well.

1325
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:01,822
So that you know their positive
issues and their negative issues,

1326
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:05,245
and you have such
resentment and jealousy,

1327
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:08,920
and a sense of what wasn't fair,

1328
01:47:09,006 --> 01:47:11,247
what was fair.

1329
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:15,336
The relationship with
Michael and his sister,

1330
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:19,430
I would imagine, is as complicated
as my relationship with my sister,

1331
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:21,598
who is playing his sister.

1332
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:24,177
It's too much for me to think about.

1333
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,529
In the great Mario Puzo style,

1334
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:46,033
one must always introduce

1335
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:48,785
an infallible killer.

1336
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:52,463
You know, a killer who's better

1337
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:56,213
than the last infallible killer
that had been in the story,

1338
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:59,053
or someone invulnerable.

1339
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:03,553
A kind of Luca Brasi figure who is so…

1340
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:06,143
So formidable.

1341
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:10,144
This young man is
actually a Coppola relative,

1342
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,317
albeit his name is Russo,

1343
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:18,490
from the town of Bernalda,
where my grandfather was from,

1344
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:22,409
where the cousin with no nose and..
. He was quite a character.

1345
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:26,990
I didn't know him,
obviously, until I went to Sicily

1346
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:31,248
and he arrived in Rome and…

1347
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,247
I know enough about

1348
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:37,925
the family from the old
country to understand

1349
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:41,004
who his part of the family was and…

1350
01:48:41,098 --> 01:48:43,840
So I tried to create a role for him

1351
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:49,600
as the apprentice to this Sicilian

1352
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:52,932
"ace in the hole,"

1353
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:55,689
as Eli refers to him.

1354
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,771
Mario's work always has these

1355
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:02,860
forces set in motion,
invulnerable killers that you figure,

1356
01:49:02,953 --> 01:49:07,368
"Oh my God, as long as you
have Luca Brasi on your side,

1357
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:08,875
nothing can ever happen to him."

1358
01:49:08,959 --> 01:49:10,335
And then all of a
sudden he kills that guy.

1359
01:49:10,419 --> 01:49:12,504
So you don't have him any
more and you begin to say,

1360
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:15,376
"My God, we're totally vulnerable now."

1361
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:17,628
On the case of Michael,

1362
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:21,382
he was given these legendary bodyguards

1363
01:49:21,472 --> 01:49:25,966
who are the twins, who are
two identical twin brothers,

1364
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:28,217
who indeed were twins,

1365
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:33,648
the actors who played them,
who also were legendary,

1366
01:49:33,776 --> 01:49:35,642
never-can-be-defeated bodyguards.

1367
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:39,396
So you get those kinds
of forces in the works

1368
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:42,074
and then you surprise everyone

1369
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:43,775
with who was able to kill whom.

1370
01:50:07,309 --> 01:50:09,425
Now we begin to prepare for the end,

1371
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,763
with the poster of <i>Cavalleria Rusticana.</i>

1372
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:15,734
It's always a great pleasure for
me to see Sofia in these scenes.

1373
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:17,729
I must say it's…

1374
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:22,984
It really warms my heart.

1375
01:50:23,075 --> 01:50:25,988
There I have my sister,
I have my daughter,

1376
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,991
I have Diane, I have Al.

1377
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:33,533
It was an unusual
experience working on this film

1378
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:36,912
and to be with them all,
and so many years later.

1379
01:50:45,264 --> 01:50:49,258
I see in Sofia a little
bit of my mother, Italia.

1380
01:50:54,606 --> 01:50:58,190
Yes, the third film,

1381
01:50:58,277 --> 01:51:00,939
<i>Godfather Part III,</i> or <i>The
Death of Michael Corleone,</i>

1382
01:51:01,071 --> 01:51:04,109
it's very different than the other two.

1383
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:07,233
It tries to hearken to them

1384
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:09,986
through the many years,

1385
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,998
but it's trying to do
something quite different.

1386
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:17,293
It's about themes, I think, that
are more uniquely reserved for it.

1387
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:22,131
I mean, the fact that the main
character performs such a different role

1388
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:25,845
than he does in the other films,
where, of course, he's the driving force

1389
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:29,968
that is the opposition to the conspiracy.

1390
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:34,139
In this case, Michael is
really made vulnerable

1391
01:51:34,271 --> 01:51:38,765
by his own concern for
things other than business,

1392
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:40,608
for personal things.

1393
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:20,185
That's the real drawing
that my son made for me.

1394
01:52:25,197 --> 01:52:27,939
He did that, and it was in <i>Godfather II,</i>

1395
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:31,196
and I'm surprised, when it opened up,

1396
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:32,989
that we still have it.

1397
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,836
These are the legendary twin bodyguards.

1398
01:52:41,964 --> 01:52:45,423
I thought I had some incident
which showed their prowess.

1399
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:48,761
Maybe I didn't have time to include
it, but I thought it would be a good idea

1400
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:51,764
to show them do something,
like, so spectacular that you figure,

1401
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:55,716
"Well, these guys, no one is ever
going to get at Michael Corleone

1402
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:57,138
while they're around."

1403
01:53:01,817 --> 01:53:07,233
There is my little granddaughter,
Gia, being carried by my daughter Sofia.

1404
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:10,273
Gia's a nice girl.

1405
01:53:10,367 --> 01:53:13,530
She's now 14 years old.

1406
01:53:13,662 --> 01:53:15,244
I just saw her.

1407
01:53:15,372 --> 01:53:19,081
She's just turning into that
kind of lanky, tall teenager.

1408
01:53:20,419 --> 01:53:25,380
Here we begin an interlude in
which Michael sort of kidnaps Kay

1409
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:30,089
and really was the sequence between them

1410
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:34,714
that leads to a more of a
rapprochement, if not a romantic one,

1411
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:38,593
but a spiritual one, in
which ultimately then

1412
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:41,096
he was to be shot and that was the end.

1413
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,563
And the whole superstructure

1414
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:47,606
that I came up with,
with <i>Cavalleria Rusticana,</i>

1415
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:51,606
and the interposing
the story of the opera

1416
01:53:51,742 --> 01:53:55,110
with the story of the family,
with the story of the daughter

1417
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:59,785
being absolutely told
not to see the cousin,

1418
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:05,457
all hopefully can be stirred
up and then ultimately resolved.

1419
01:54:25,067 --> 01:54:28,731
Again, when we shot Sicily
we always fought so hard

1420
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,278
to have it be sun,

1421
01:54:31,406 --> 01:54:33,647
which is not the case, by the way.

1422
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:35,991
So we always had to wait.

1423
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:40,329
This little pathway down to the
door is the very same pathway

1424
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:43,119
in a small town in Taormina,

1425
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:47,791
where the men had come to take
Vito Andolini to the Mafia chieftain.

1426
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:51,336
So just as Italian-Americans do,

1427
01:54:51,468 --> 01:54:53,459
we were visiting the actual places.

1428
01:54:53,595 --> 01:54:57,133
This church we used for the scene

1429
01:54:57,265 --> 01:55:00,803
when the little boy, Vito
Andolini was hidden in the mule,

1430
01:55:00,936 --> 01:55:03,177
and taken off to America.

1431
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:07,022
So we did have the great pleasure
of going back to these towns…

1432
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,357
And I see a donkey going by,

1433
01:55:09,486 --> 01:55:13,605
that's probably the director
trying to indicate or remind you

1434
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:17,191
of the fact that the little
boy had been smuggled,

1435
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:21,662
Michael Corleone's father, had
been smuggled out of this very spot.

1436
01:55:21,873 --> 01:55:24,160
I'm very interested in time

1437
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:27,768
and in the unity of time
and how these things repeat.

1438
01:55:30,507 --> 01:55:33,420
This story of the puppet
show is so interesting.

1439
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:36,377
It's the story of the Baroness of Carini,

1440
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:40,177
and how she falls in
love with her own cousin

1441
01:55:40,308 --> 01:55:42,549
and is killed by her father.

1442
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:48,056
I thought I was so fortunate
to find an Italian folktale

1443
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:51,229
that is indeed done in puppet show,

1444
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:53,898
that tells the story of

1445
01:55:54,197 --> 01:55:56,655
really what is sort of
happening in our story,

1446
01:55:56,741 --> 01:55:58,823
with the love of Mary for her cousin

1447
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:02,574
and the fact that her father
condemns her to death.

1448
01:56:10,005 --> 01:56:12,793
These scenes were always
such a pleasure for me.

1449
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:17,218
I always would go early, and
as I would drive to the location,

1450
01:56:17,345 --> 01:56:21,509
I would hear the band
rehearsing and I knew that my dad,

1451
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:26,140
who was so fastidious
and serious about his work,

1452
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:29,893
that he'd be there, you know,
an hour before everyone else,

1453
01:56:30,025 --> 01:56:32,016
having found some local musicians

1454
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:33,942
and bringing the arrangements

1455
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:36,402
of the source music
that he had just written.

1456
01:56:36,531 --> 01:56:40,115
And it was such a
pleasure to sit in the chair

1457
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:43,486
while they were rehearsing
and put in my two cents

1458
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:46,823
about how they should play the
music, which of course, you know,

1459
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:50,158
not being a musician, I'm not
very much of an expert at anything.

1460
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:54,247
But it was great, great,
great pleasure for me.

1461
01:57:57,654 --> 01:58:02,649
Here is the same courtyard where
Michael's young wife, Apollonia,

1462
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:05,993
was killed when the car, the Alfa Romeo,

1463
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:11,907
was blown up by the traitor bodyguard

1464
01:58:12,002 --> 01:58:15,495
who was played by Angelo Inf anti.

1465
01:58:15,672 --> 01:58:18,289
It is interesting to
have the same settings,

1466
01:58:18,383 --> 01:58:19,965
the same places.

1467
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:24,545
This is the same room where
Michael opened the window

1468
01:58:24,681 --> 01:58:28,925
and beheld his young bride and
ironically, as life sometimes does,

1469
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:33,104
here is his wife, standing
in the same place.

1470
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:38,901
I guess, in life, there is some director
who puts people in the same place,

1471
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:40,940
or who creates these

1472
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:45,901
similarities and parallel reminiscences.

1473
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:49,370
In a movie, you need
people like myself to do it,

1474
01:58:49,497 --> 01:58:52,205
but in life it happens very often.

1475
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:41,756
I found, on this picture, Diane
Keaton such an intriguing person.

1476
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:46,795
She really at this point
in her life, her career,

1477
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:52,220
is such a kind of
gifted, brilliant woman.

1478
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:56,137
She works very much in solitude

1479
01:59:56,272 --> 01:59:59,264
and has techniques to concentrate

1480
01:59:59,401 --> 02:00:03,486
and what she gives you
is really part of herself.

1481
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:08,865
I guess always, but on
this picture all the cast,

1482
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:13,241
all the people coming
together, there was a…

1483
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:16,375
You know, they're so much wiser
and older and more world-weary.

1484
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:20,168
There's a kind of
skepticism that they bring,

1485
02:00:20,296 --> 02:00:23,038
that the younger versions
of themselves didn't have,

1486
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,092
when they were just
anxious to be in a project.

1487
02:00:25,176 --> 02:00:28,339
And, of course, when you
have intelligent people like this,

1488
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:31,759
they all had opinions.
They had opinions on everything.

1489
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:37,016
I'm sure, to this day they might
feel, "Oh, it would have been better

1490
02:00:37,147 --> 02:00:38,933
"just to end the film…"

1491
02:00:41,443 --> 02:00:44,526
As it was originally at the
end of this relationship,"

1492
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:48,397
or not to have cast my daughter

1493
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:50,983
or this or that.

1494
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:54,237
But I was much more aware

1495
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:58,745
of these actors as being
really fully-developed

1496
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:03,545
adults with strong opinions,
and it makes it a little harder

1497
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:07,758
to direct them because
you're constantly trying to

1498
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:09,710
make sure the material is…

1499
02:01:09,846 --> 02:01:14,556
I won't say worthy of them, but
conforms with their view of things.

1500
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:20,054
Naturally, of course, all actors tend
to think that the film is about them.

1501
02:01:21,065 --> 02:01:23,065
There's that wonderful line in the movie

1502
02:01:23,193 --> 02:01:25,685
where they ask the
nurse in <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

1503
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,279
"What's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> about?"

1504
02:01:27,363 --> 02:01:29,695
And he says, "Well,
it's about this nurse."

1505
02:01:29,824 --> 02:01:34,614
But that's a good thing, that the
cast puts you through that demand,

1506
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:38,572
that they really ask you to
think through their characters,

1507
02:01:38,708 --> 02:01:42,076
as though they're the
only character in the piece.

1508
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:46,710
But, yeah, I ended up
on this picture, feeling that

1509
02:01:46,841 --> 02:01:51,506
Diane Keaton was some sort of genius or…

1510
02:01:53,097 --> 02:01:56,089
That's a word I don't use very often.

1511
02:01:56,226 --> 02:02:00,436
What's the next level, you know?
Just some extremely

1512
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:05,182
talented, brilliant, intelligent person.

1513
02:02:23,294 --> 02:02:26,412
The love of a man and a woman
when they have been through

1514
02:02:26,506 --> 02:02:30,465
so many years and have
seen and shared together

1515
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:34,928
tragedy and shared great fortune,

1516
02:02:35,014 --> 02:02:38,598
almost is more difficult
than sharing poor fortune.

1517
02:02:40,937 --> 02:02:44,896
It's a wonderful thing.
It's a heartbreak to me that

1518
02:02:44,983 --> 02:02:48,396
so few people are willing to

1519
02:02:48,486 --> 02:02:52,275
withstand the difficulties of marriage,

1520
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:56,154
to get to that point when

1521
02:02:56,286 --> 02:03:01,952
they're with a partner who's been
with them more than half their own ages.

1522
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:05,826
It's a pity

1523
02:03:06,838 --> 02:03:08,829
that more people don't

1524
02:03:10,216 --> 02:03:13,550
preserve what a
long-term marriage can be.

1525
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:30,522
I guess here we're
indicating for the first time that,

1526
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:34,112
and of course showing
it in regards to Kay,

1527
02:03:34,198 --> 02:03:35,698
that things will never change,

1528
02:03:35,825 --> 02:03:38,533
that she'll always be the
woman behind the door

1529
02:03:39,996 --> 02:03:43,159
and that Michael,
although Michael has been

1530
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:45,786
pretty not-attentive to business.

1531
02:03:45,877 --> 02:03:51,338
He suddenly, I guess, feels that
now with killing Don Tommasino

1532
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:55,213
and the fact that they're
after him, that he has to.

1533
02:03:55,345 --> 02:03:58,633
Here we show somewhat authentically

1534
02:03:58,723 --> 02:04:00,964
what the selection of
the Pope would be like.

1535
02:04:01,059 --> 02:04:03,269
Of course, we've only
built a teeny part of a set.

1536
02:04:03,353 --> 02:04:05,936
I mean, what you see is what we built.

1537
02:04:17,742 --> 02:04:21,827
This is actually a curious
plot point, is that this pope,

1538
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:25,747
whom we have had the experience of

1539
02:04:25,875 --> 02:04:29,243
knowing is a good man
and a spiritual man and a…

1540
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:33,789
Really above any notion of corruption

1541
02:04:33,883 --> 02:04:35,965
is now to be the Pope.

1542
02:04:36,052 --> 02:04:38,259
It changes the plot,
when you think about it.

1543
02:04:38,388 --> 02:04:42,507
This is the customary
signal of the white smoke

1544
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:45,934
from the Vatican that a
new pope has been selected

1545
02:04:46,062 --> 02:04:50,772
and the way that it's
done, we try always in films

1546
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:54,484
that we work on to be authentic.

1547
02:04:59,409 --> 02:05:01,776
I believe these are probably

1548
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:06,951
derived from some of the
lines of the real John Paul I.

1549
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:12,453
From all indication, John
Paul I was a wonderful man

1550
02:05:12,588 --> 02:05:17,628
and a man who was really willing to

1551
02:05:18,469 --> 02:05:21,632
march into the future in a good way,

1552
02:05:21,764 --> 02:05:24,756
and it was perhaps the reaction

1553
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:28,810
of more conservative
elements within the Vatican that…

1554
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:31,680
And also the fact that he was aware

1555
02:05:31,774 --> 02:05:33,765
of so much of the financial corruption

1556
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:37,444
that had been evident.

1557
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:42,031
I won't mention names,
but in terms of the cardinals

1558
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:44,906
who were entrusted to that,

1559
02:05:45,038 --> 02:05:49,748
that perhaps the notion of
a truly good, honest pope

1560
02:05:49,834 --> 02:05:53,577
would have been anathema to the forces

1561
02:05:53,671 --> 02:05:58,165
that had been woven around

1562
02:05:58,301 --> 02:06:00,508
that aspect of the Vatican.

1563
02:06:01,345 --> 02:06:05,384
Those who wish can read
the history of this period

1564
02:06:05,475 --> 02:06:08,308
and will recognize many

1565
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:12,854
of the figures that I've tried
to depict in Mario Puzo's style,

1566
02:06:12,982 --> 02:06:16,145
which is to say, they're
sort of like real people,

1567
02:06:16,527 --> 02:06:17,983
but not really.

1568
02:06:40,426 --> 02:06:45,171
This scene was shot after
the film returned from Italy.

1569
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:49,007
It was shot in New York and
it was shot because it was felt,

1570
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:53,478
and I didn't disagree, it was
felt by the Paramount executives

1571
02:06:53,564 --> 02:06:55,475
and by Frank Mancuso in particular…

1572
02:06:55,566 --> 02:07:00,185
Who's a very, very sweet and nice man

1573
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,737
and a good film executive,

1574
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:04,947
who was in a tough
position at that point,

1575
02:07:05,034 --> 02:07:07,867
because they really needed
this picture to be done

1576
02:07:08,037 --> 02:07:10,904
and they needed it to be
a big financial performer,

1577
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:16,126
and so they really wanted
it to be as much of a thriller

1578
02:07:16,212 --> 02:07:22,003
and to focus on the so-called
action parts of the plot, the revenge.

1579
02:07:22,135 --> 02:07:28,427
Here I have this character who's wailing
about his inability to be a good man

1580
02:07:28,766 --> 02:07:34,057
in his life, and it was felt that we
really needed a transfer of power.

1581
02:07:34,147 --> 02:07:36,982
That, "Okay, guys, enough of
this guy feeling sorry for himself.

1582
02:07:37,066 --> 02:07:38,816
"Let's get Vincent Mancini in there"

1583
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:41,028
"and have him be like
the old Michael Corleone"

1584
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:43,444
and get in there and
kill all the enemies."

1585
02:07:43,573 --> 02:07:45,985
So that's what this
scene was meant to do.

1586
02:07:46,117 --> 02:07:51,032
Of course, working with Al, I was
anxious to give Al the opportunity

1587
02:07:51,122 --> 02:07:54,956
to use his formidable
intelligence and talent

1588
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:59,328
to really express the
other personal aspects

1589
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:03,006
and in a sense, it was
a welcome opportunity

1590
02:08:03,134 --> 02:08:07,924
to let Al hand over the reins to Vincent,
knowing that Vincent was a hothead,

1591
02:08:08,014 --> 02:08:09,630
like his brother Sonny had been.

1592
02:08:09,765 --> 02:08:13,804
We're just going to get this movie
back into the kind of plot that, you know,

1593
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:16,355
many people felt it should have
had right from the beginning.

1594
02:08:16,439 --> 02:08:20,933
I mean, who needs this
Michael Corleone mid-life crisis?

1595
02:08:21,027 --> 02:08:23,189
Let's get to the good stuff.

1596
02:08:25,781 --> 02:08:27,699
Reminds me of the time
on the first <i>Godfather</i> film

1597
02:08:27,783 --> 02:08:31,071
when they said they were
going to send in an action director,

1598
02:08:31,162 --> 02:08:34,325
because I was too
interested in the family parts.

1599
02:09:05,071 --> 02:09:09,986
You can just imagine. What if Michael
Corleone wasn't this type of man,

1600
02:09:10,076 --> 02:09:12,534
but still had his long
black hair, albeit older,

1601
02:09:12,662 --> 02:09:16,030
and he's sitting at his desk
and he's talking to Vincent

1602
02:09:16,165 --> 02:09:18,215
and you figure he's
got it all figured out

1603
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:20,085
and he just throws a few clues out there?

1604
02:09:20,169 --> 02:09:24,959
That's all I would have had to
do to be the old-style <i>Godfather,</i>

1605
02:09:25,091 --> 02:09:30,677
but, you know, it didn't seem like
that really was what this was about.

1606
02:10:00,751 --> 02:10:05,211
So we had gone back to New York
after we had a rough cut of the movie

1607
02:10:05,589 --> 02:10:07,966
and there's always little
things that are left out,

1608
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:09,968
a little shot of this or
a little piece of that.

1609
02:10:10,052 --> 02:10:15,547
I find in a day you can do 18, 20
pieces if you have just a little column

1610
02:10:15,641 --> 02:10:17,757
or a little piece of a door.

1611
02:10:17,893 --> 02:10:18,977
At this point, seeing the picture,

1612
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:21,974
I don't even notice those shots any more,

1613
02:10:22,106 --> 02:10:28,443
the illusion is so complete, given
with the nature of what film is like

1614
02:10:28,571 --> 02:10:31,279
and how a piece that
you do somewhere else,

1615
02:10:31,407 --> 02:10:34,149
thousands of miles away, totally fits in.

1616
02:10:43,919 --> 02:10:49,665
This scene signified, of course,
in a way, Connie's rise to power,

1617
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:52,963
because she is the sponsor of Vincent

1618
02:10:53,095 --> 02:10:56,633
and really very much
like the first <i>Godfather</i>

1619
02:10:56,766 --> 02:10:59,804
when I remember Marlon
Brando was feeding the fish

1620
02:10:59,935 --> 02:11:03,098
and Michael was sitting behind the desk.

1621
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:05,806
Michael was then the,
kind of, Vincent character

1622
02:11:06,275 --> 02:11:08,983
and Clemenza and Tessio were saying,

1623
02:11:09,111 --> 02:11:12,149
"Please, Godfather, are you
going to be involved in this?"

1624
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:14,522
And Marlon was saying,
"Well, you know, just,

1625
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:16,743
"I'm going to feed the fish
and you'll do what they say."

1626
02:11:16,827 --> 02:11:20,741
Well here we are,
several generations later,

1627
02:11:20,831 --> 02:11:24,995
and it's really Connie
who is taking power

1628
02:11:25,503 --> 02:11:29,497
with some of the Caporegimes

1629
02:11:30,049 --> 02:11:32,711
and the transfer of power is made.

1630
02:11:32,802 --> 02:11:37,171
The family will be saved by Vincent,

1631
02:11:37,306 --> 02:11:42,551
who assumes he has now
been adopted, he is a Corleone.

1632
02:11:43,145 --> 02:11:47,685
He is now clearly the new Godfather,

1633
02:11:47,817 --> 02:11:51,606
as this simple ritual has come to mean,

1634
02:11:51,695 --> 02:11:57,316
but most important to Al, he
has been given this new position

1635
02:11:57,868 --> 02:12:01,782
with the promise that he will reject Mary

1636
02:12:01,872 --> 02:12:04,910
and will not continue this love affair,

1637
02:12:05,167 --> 02:12:09,957
which Michael feels will
only lead to her demise,

1638
02:12:10,047 --> 02:12:12,835
just as it did to the demise of his wife.

1639
02:12:37,074 --> 02:12:42,945
We shot the opera sequence of this
film at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo,

1640
02:12:43,038 --> 02:12:46,906
a beautiful, beautiful opera
house which we are seeing,

1641
02:12:47,209 --> 02:12:51,248
and which was in fact under
renovation and reconstruction,

1642
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:55,590
so, although we could use the
exterior and certain interior portions,

1643
02:12:55,718 --> 02:13:01,088
we could not actually work on the stage.
It was all totally in reconstruction.

1644
02:13:01,223 --> 02:13:04,682
So we shot the family and the guests

1645
02:13:04,768 --> 02:13:09,478
and the night of the opening
of <i>Cavalleria Rusticana,</i>

1646
02:13:10,065 --> 02:13:14,605
with the son of Michael
Corleone singing the tenor role,

1647
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:16,435
elsewhere in Rome.

1648
02:13:16,572 --> 02:13:19,940
This, interestingly, was
a model of the theater

1649
02:13:20,075 --> 02:13:24,444
that we found in a room and
we featured it in the lobby.

1650
02:13:37,343 --> 02:13:42,679
So once again, in <i>Godfather</i>
style, all the principal characters,

1651
02:13:42,765 --> 02:13:47,680
all the players are coming
together to some big event,

1652
02:13:47,770 --> 02:13:50,262
enemy as well as friend,

1653
02:13:50,356 --> 02:13:55,522
but now we know that Vincent Mancini,
now Vincent Corleone, who is the…

1654
02:13:55,611 --> 02:13:59,400
He is the Michael
Corleone of the story now,

1655
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:05,827
is in charge, and so the attitude
is not so inattentive to business,

1656
02:14:06,539 --> 02:14:11,329
that Vincent is there to
protect Michael Corleone

1657
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:15,579
and to vanquish these
very formidable enemies.

1658
02:14:15,714 --> 02:14:20,959
We have the super-duper twin
bodyguards who can do no wrong.

1659
02:14:21,512 --> 02:14:25,221
We know that there is another
killer, Mosca, with his young apprentice

1660
02:14:25,307 --> 02:14:27,548
who does the donkey sound.

1661
02:14:27,643 --> 02:14:31,352
That's a real song, by the way,
but it was useful to remind you,

1662
02:14:31,897 --> 02:14:35,936
the audience, who he was in
the sea of so many characters.

1663
02:14:36,026 --> 02:14:38,814
And here is Constanza, my sister,

1664
02:14:38,904 --> 02:14:42,397
bringing a little box of
pastry to Eli Wallach,

1665
02:14:42,491 --> 02:14:44,653
which I'm sure he's going to enjoy.

1666
02:15:12,396 --> 02:15:17,061
This is sad to me, because you
know, she's without explanation.

1667
02:15:17,192 --> 02:15:21,607
All those stories always break my
heart, like in <i>La Traviata</i> or, you know,

1668
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:25,816
whenever there are lovers and
then one has to give up the other

1669
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:29,197
and make it look like they
don't like him anymore,

1670
02:15:29,288 --> 02:15:31,790
but they're doing it, really,
because they do love them.

1671
02:15:31,874 --> 02:15:35,208
In this case Vincent, in order to
become the head of the family,

1672
02:15:35,294 --> 02:15:40,039
has promised to give up any
encouragement to the daughter,

1673
02:15:40,132 --> 02:15:42,965
under the watchful eyes of…

1674
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:47,462
And she tries her little
18-year-old tricks with him,

1675
02:15:48,098 --> 02:15:50,308
you know, "Hey, you
still love me, don't you?"

1676
02:15:50,392 --> 02:15:52,178
But you know, it's not to be.

1677
02:15:52,269 --> 02:15:56,388
He knows that the
father has forbidden it.

1678
02:15:56,482 --> 02:15:59,315
Those kind of stories
are really sad to me.

1679
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:12,404
So Constanza has brought
the cannoli to Don Altobello.

1680
02:16:13,916 --> 02:16:17,750
You've got to watch out for
cannoli in these <i>Godfather</i> movies.

1681
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:24,294
Those are very, very good cannoli.
Those are real Sicilian cannoli.

1682
02:16:24,426 --> 02:16:26,588
What is notable about them is

1683
02:16:26,679 --> 02:16:29,180
they're not the little narrow
ones with the little cream,

1684
02:16:29,264 --> 02:16:32,006
these are the kinds…

1685
02:16:33,852 --> 02:16:36,810
It's hard for me to see my daughter cry.

1686
02:16:39,650 --> 02:16:43,109
The real issue with Sofia's
performance, I think, in this movie

1687
02:16:43,195 --> 02:16:47,154
was that she had that kind of
California-speak when she spoke,

1688
02:16:47,282 --> 02:16:51,992
and if you kind of just look at
the scene and look in her eyes,

1689
02:16:52,121 --> 02:16:56,160
you'll see that Sofia's
acting is extremely truthful.

1690
02:16:59,837 --> 02:17:03,171
It's what actors call, "She's full."
She's there.

1691
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:05,749
And that's worth more than anything.

1692
02:17:26,155 --> 02:17:29,898
You would never want your
daughter to look at you like that.

1693
02:17:41,545 --> 02:17:46,039
So we were inside the Teatro Massimo
facing the boxes and the audience.

1694
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:50,213
Of course, not in the stage.

1695
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:54,555
Interesting side note to
this was my Uncle Anton,

1696
02:17:54,641 --> 02:17:56,973
who conducted the orchestra.

1697
02:17:57,478 --> 02:18:00,061
I'll tell some stories out of school.

1698
02:18:00,147 --> 02:18:03,981
My Uncle Anton is a great
operatic conductor and composer

1699
02:18:04,651 --> 02:18:07,643
and my father's younger brother.

1700
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:13,776
And over the years, although as a
child I always remembered them so close

1701
02:18:13,869 --> 02:18:15,735
and staying up at night

1702
02:18:15,829 --> 02:18:19,948
and talking about Puccini
and talking about <i>Turandot</i>

1703
02:18:20,042 --> 02:18:23,125
and talking about music.

1704
02:18:23,212 --> 02:18:26,079
I always was very happy
with that relationship.

1705
02:18:26,173 --> 02:18:30,041
But over the years, for
reasons I don't understand,

1706
02:18:30,135 --> 02:18:31,296
they had a falling out.

1707
02:18:31,386 --> 02:18:34,094
So often the fallings-out come.

1708
02:18:34,223 --> 02:18:40,094
And it was my desire to really see
my uncle and my father work together,

1709
02:18:40,187 --> 02:18:43,725
and so I used my power,
perhaps erroneously.

1710
02:18:43,816 --> 02:18:47,730
And my father was totally
capable of conducting the opera,

1711
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:50,778
but because he was so
busy writing all the music,

1712
02:18:50,864 --> 02:18:54,653
I tried to get them to share a few things

1713
02:18:54,743 --> 02:18:58,281
and really, I say, selfishly,
just so I could sit once again

1714
02:18:58,372 --> 02:19:01,410
and have them have dinner
and see them work together.

1715
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:04,210
It didn't really work.
I mean, they were courteous to each other.

1716
02:19:04,294 --> 02:19:07,628
Their wives didn't
really get along so much.

1717
02:19:08,382 --> 02:19:12,125
And I think my uncle did a wonderful
job and it was a good association,

1718
02:19:12,219 --> 02:19:16,213
but my father really felt
that I had imposed this.

1719
02:19:17,349 --> 02:19:23,140
That level of old Italian, they're
very possessive about opportunities

1720
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:27,724
and who gets the plums or
whatever you want to call them.

1721
02:19:27,818 --> 02:19:31,652
So one could say that this
was a successful experiment,

1722
02:19:31,738 --> 02:19:35,982
but perhaps also it
was a very stressful one

1723
02:19:36,076 --> 02:19:40,240
and attests to sometimes
the fruitlessness

1724
02:19:40,330 --> 02:19:44,039
of trying to force relatives
to work and be together.

1725
02:19:53,051 --> 02:19:57,090
But I thought it was a
somewhat authentic production

1726
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:58,921
of <i>Cavalleria Rusticana.</i>

1727
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:01,758
I staged it in a traditional way.

1728
02:20:01,852 --> 02:20:05,140
I was anxious to show how
the roots of <i>The Godfather</i>

1729
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:10,521
go back to these simple village feuds

1730
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:15,731
and characters that I knew
as a child, Alfio and Lola…

1731
02:20:15,824 --> 02:20:19,863
And I always love that
Turiddu sang that opening aria

1732
02:20:19,953 --> 02:20:21,819
backstage next to the harp, you know,

1733
02:20:21,914 --> 02:20:24,872
watching the conductor
on a television monitor.

1734
02:20:24,958 --> 02:20:28,201
You know, it's the
Francis desire to show you

1735
02:20:28,337 --> 02:20:30,704
how things work in the background.

1736
02:20:30,797 --> 02:20:35,462
But I liked this production
of the resolution of the story

1737
02:20:36,053 --> 02:20:40,593
woven against the simple peasant
story of <i>Cavalleria Rusticana,</i>

1738
02:20:40,682 --> 02:20:45,893
which I feel is in some ways the
basis of so much of what we did

1739
02:20:45,979 --> 02:20:48,061
in the first two <i>Godfathers,</i>

1740
02:20:48,148 --> 02:20:50,480
musically, as well as the drama.

1741
02:21:40,450 --> 02:21:43,988
<i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>
deals with a young man

1742
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:46,662
who comes back from the army

1743
02:21:46,748 --> 02:21:51,709
and has a love who is now
married to the coachman, Alfio,

1744
02:21:51,837 --> 02:21:57,583
and it has to do with jealousy
and insult in that rustic setting

1745
02:21:57,676 --> 02:22:01,089
and it's all about you
resolve things with knives

1746
02:22:01,179 --> 02:22:05,673
and you follow the
rustic codes of behavior.

1747
02:22:09,813 --> 02:22:12,680
I was in a real pickle with
the two super-bodyguards

1748
02:22:12,774 --> 02:22:16,733
because on one hand, I had
the killer to end all killers, Mosca,

1749
02:22:16,903 --> 02:22:21,568
and then I had the great twin
bodyguards who were also the greats.

1750
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:27,537
So I had to come up and I must confess
that many, many, many, tough nights

1751
02:22:27,622 --> 02:22:30,535
of hitting my head
against the wall was used

1752
02:22:30,625 --> 02:22:34,960
and our stunt coordinator,
Buddy Joe Hooker,

1753
02:22:35,047 --> 02:22:39,006
came up with what I thought
was a very, very ingenious idea,

1754
02:22:39,092 --> 02:22:41,129
in which it would look as though

1755
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:45,008
the twins bodyguard had
subdued and killed Mosca.

1756
02:22:45,098 --> 02:22:48,511
But in fact it was Mosca who had done it

1757
02:22:48,602 --> 02:22:52,061
and lured the other one,
and so ultimately he wins.

1758
02:23:16,505 --> 02:23:21,716
I try little touches, like to have
Franc D'Ambrosio as Turiddu

1759
02:23:21,802 --> 02:23:25,966
show this type of
Sicilian, cocky young man

1760
02:23:26,056 --> 02:23:28,673
and pull on his pants
the way Sonny used to.

1761
02:23:28,809 --> 02:23:35,397
I tried as best I could to integrate
the little story of jealousy and revenge

1762
02:23:35,482 --> 02:23:37,189
set in a Sicilian setting,

1763
02:23:37,275 --> 02:23:40,563
to show how these people
really grew out of that.

1764
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:16,642
And like the other <i>Godfathers,</i> there
are many threads of possible murders

1765
02:24:16,731 --> 02:24:20,599
and resolution of the
forces that are arrayed,

1766
02:24:20,694 --> 02:24:23,777
and you have Neri coming in
and you have Mosca setting up,

1767
02:24:23,864 --> 02:24:26,322
obviously to assassinate Michael.

1768
02:24:26,408 --> 02:24:30,072
You have these various
bodyguards interacting,

1769
02:24:30,203 --> 02:24:35,539
and you have this ear bite,
by the way, just like Joey Zasa.

1770
02:24:36,293 --> 02:24:38,125
Vincent recognizes it.

1771
02:24:38,211 --> 02:24:40,953
That's how I saw it as a
kid in <i>Cavalleria Rusticana.</i>

1772
02:24:41,047 --> 02:24:45,166
I thought that was really weird,
that you would bite someone's ear.

1773
02:24:53,268 --> 02:24:56,260
So, now the bullet is almost…

1774
02:24:56,354 --> 02:24:58,220
There's my Uncle Anton.

1775
02:25:00,650 --> 02:25:04,985
Just as the bullet is about to
be really delivered to Michael,

1776
02:25:05,822 --> 02:25:11,909
the one bodyguard, his bodyguard,
has uncovered the assassin, Mosca,

1777
02:25:11,995 --> 02:25:15,408
just as you're in the most
dramatic part of the opera.

1778
02:25:29,179 --> 02:25:34,140
I think the young man
challenges the husband to a duel

1779
02:25:34,226 --> 02:25:37,719
and he sort of knows
he's going to be killed.

1780
02:25:37,854 --> 02:25:40,687
There are many…
You know, I hope for many levels here.

1781
02:25:40,774 --> 02:25:43,186
The satisfaction of the mother.

1782
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:47,103
You know, mothers love
their sons, as do fathers,

1783
02:25:47,239 --> 02:25:52,029
but in a different way, and want to see
the son go through this difficult moment

1784
02:25:52,118 --> 02:25:55,611
of resisting the strong
influence of the father,

1785
02:25:56,039 --> 02:25:58,280
and the coming into the light.

1786
02:26:00,585 --> 02:26:05,125
The knife-killing on stage is
echoed by the killing in the boxes.

1787
02:26:06,049 --> 02:26:08,290
Well, you all know
this, it's pretty evident,

1788
02:26:08,385 --> 02:26:11,719
but that was what I had
hoped, that it could all…

1789
02:26:15,642 --> 02:26:20,011
Here it looks as though Mosca
is dead and the twin is pleased

1790
02:26:20,105 --> 02:26:22,563
that his brother has done this,

1791
02:26:22,649 --> 02:26:24,856
but if you look carefully, of course…

1792
02:26:26,903 --> 02:26:29,691
Mosca is alive and just holding him up.

1793
02:26:29,781 --> 02:26:33,149
That was pretty clever.
That was Buddy Hooker's idea.

1794
02:26:38,665 --> 02:26:40,076
The famous Lupara.

1795
02:26:40,166 --> 02:26:44,410
All of the symbols that are throughout
<i>The Godfather,</i> even in the first ones,

1796
02:26:44,504 --> 02:26:46,791
all the seeds are in that opera.

1797
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:01,514
Now here the cast is on the
break and so they're in there

1798
02:27:01,604 --> 02:27:04,517
looking like shepherds with shotguns.

1799
02:27:04,649 --> 02:27:10,440
And therefore, my cousin, the one
who makes the song like the donkey,

1800
02:27:10,530 --> 02:27:13,067
just looks like one of
the actors from the play,

1801
02:27:13,158 --> 02:27:18,619
but indeed he has a loaded
Lupara, so he is more dangerous.

1802
02:27:20,123 --> 02:27:22,160
It's a kind of Pirandello idea,

1803
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:25,242
where the drama of <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>

1804
02:27:25,337 --> 02:27:27,499
is intermingled with the real story.

1805
02:27:28,548 --> 02:27:29,959
No big deal.

1806
02:28:01,122 --> 02:28:03,238
Clearly all of the adversaries,

1807
02:28:03,333 --> 02:28:06,826
the corrupt priest
played by Donal Donnelly,

1808
02:28:07,337 --> 02:28:10,204
the nervous banker…

1809
02:28:11,174 --> 02:28:13,381
More things are
happening at the same time

1810
02:28:13,468 --> 02:28:18,713
in the halls of the Vatican where
the good Pope John Paul is sleeping.

1811
02:28:19,933 --> 02:28:22,174
For his evening cup of tea.

1812
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:32,518
There were many threads
of the story to pull together

1813
02:28:32,612 --> 02:28:36,196
and of course the concept was
to try to pull them all together

1814
02:28:36,282 --> 02:28:38,774
interwoven with the opera.

1815
02:28:38,868 --> 02:28:44,489
The opera both as the root from
which all the <i>Godfather</i> sensibilities stem

1816
02:28:44,582 --> 02:28:47,700
as well as the modern
history that we were working in,

1817
02:28:47,794 --> 02:28:52,880
such as Vincent now
killing all of the conspirators

1818
02:28:52,966 --> 02:28:56,709
on the financial scam with the Vatican.

1819
02:28:58,471 --> 02:29:02,635
There are real people
who died in similar ways

1820
02:29:02,725 --> 02:29:08,141
as indeed this story is
based on, really, the truth.

1821
02:29:10,066 --> 02:29:15,152
Even, interestingly enough, you
have the procession in the opera

1822
02:29:15,238 --> 02:29:19,448
that very much looks like the
San Gennaro Festa in New York.

1823
02:29:19,534 --> 02:29:25,325
So we were recalling much imagery
hoping that it would remind you

1824
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:27,577
not only of this film, but other films.

1825
02:29:27,667 --> 02:29:30,750
The death of Fanucci
in the second <i>Godfather</i>

1826
02:29:30,837 --> 02:29:33,374
or the Festa in the first one.

1827
02:29:38,678 --> 02:29:42,922
Now some of the news of
these various occurrences

1828
02:29:43,016 --> 02:29:44,848
are coming to Michael,

1829
02:29:44,934 --> 02:29:48,723
and so Mosca is thwarted
just as he was about to…

1830
02:29:48,855 --> 02:29:52,189
Having killed the two best
bodyguards, the twin bodyguards,

1831
02:29:52,275 --> 02:29:54,937
now Michael is taken out of his scope

1832
02:29:55,487 --> 02:30:00,106
and he must think of another
way to conclude his task.

1833
02:30:01,117 --> 02:30:06,078
So everyone is trying to kill everyone,
which is typical for these kind of people.

1834
02:30:18,635 --> 02:30:21,798
I've always enjoyed
working with Italian actors.

1835
02:30:21,888 --> 02:30:25,381
As I have said before, they
always come prepared with ideas

1836
02:30:25,475 --> 02:30:27,560
and they show it to you
and then if you don't like it

1837
02:30:27,644 --> 02:30:28,686
they'll come up with something else.

1838
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:33,640
They never give you a hassle of having
to come up for them with what to do.

1839
02:31:13,690 --> 02:31:20,437
Clearly the imagery supporting the
very mysterious death of the Pope

1840
02:31:21,531 --> 02:31:25,570
with the Passion of Christ

1841
02:31:26,869 --> 02:31:30,578
as expressed by these simple
villagers, Sicilian villagers,

1842
02:31:32,333 --> 02:31:35,621
and the heartbreak

1843
02:31:35,712 --> 02:31:40,047
of Vincent's position with Mary,

1844
02:31:40,133 --> 02:31:43,501
that he knows he's breaking
her heart, but he must.

1845
02:31:45,013 --> 02:31:48,802
In order to protect the family
he must make that sacrifice.

1846
02:31:49,809 --> 02:31:53,427
Another plot line with Connie,

1847
02:31:53,521 --> 02:31:56,980
who was always the
favorite of Don Altobello,

1848
02:31:58,234 --> 02:32:01,693
as he just happily eats away
the cannoli she gave him.

1849
02:32:03,531 --> 02:32:07,695
The character Santuzza as the
specter of death is everywhere,

1850
02:32:07,785 --> 02:32:11,824
mingled with the ritual
of the Catholic Church.

1851
02:32:40,735 --> 02:32:45,730
This moment, it's sort of as though
Connie is killing her favorite uncle

1852
02:32:46,199 --> 02:32:49,567
and godfather, actually.
I think he was her godfather.

1853
02:32:59,003 --> 02:33:03,247
This was an interesting scene,
the idea that as all this is going on,

1854
02:33:03,508 --> 02:33:08,127
as you recall, Michael has
said to the Franco Citti character,

1855
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:10,713
"One day I'll ask you for a service,"

1856
02:33:10,807 --> 02:33:16,018
and he goes to the high
halls of power and authority

1857
02:33:16,104 --> 02:33:18,892
and is totally frisked

1858
02:33:19,148 --> 02:33:23,483
so that there is no chance
that he has a weapon on him.

1859
02:33:45,675 --> 02:33:47,134
Talia was very good in this film.

1860
02:33:47,218 --> 02:33:49,676
She was very strong and very…

1861
02:33:49,762 --> 02:33:52,880
Almost satanic, the creature she becomes.

1862
02:34:06,863 --> 02:34:13,405
These are real quotes from
leaders within the Italian government.

1863
02:34:15,413 --> 02:34:19,452
For Italian people, it
might lead them to guess

1864
02:34:19,584 --> 02:34:21,666
who this character is meant to be.

1865
02:35:33,825 --> 02:35:39,787
These events depict both historical facts

1866
02:35:39,914 --> 02:35:42,997
and, I guess you could
say, political fantasy.

1867
02:36:10,987 --> 02:36:15,606
As I look back on this film, there's
a hell of a lot packed into this opera.

1868
02:37:37,573 --> 02:37:41,862
I wanted the film to end as
a tragedy in a classic sense.

1869
02:37:41,953 --> 02:37:46,163
And in a tragedy, you know,
there's always a certain way it's done.

1870
02:37:46,290 --> 02:37:50,409
There's someone dead on the steps
and the five best friends carry them off,

1871
02:37:50,586 --> 02:37:53,169
and it's sort of like
<i>Hamlet</i> or something.

1872
02:37:53,255 --> 02:37:57,840
I thought those steps were so
wonderfully like a classic setting.

1873
02:38:50,479 --> 02:38:56,475
The Baroness di Carini. For me,
this is the nightmare of nightmares.

1874
02:39:16,839 --> 02:39:23,461
They say that art imitates life. It's so
unusual how it does. How I've seen it.

1875
02:39:25,347 --> 02:39:29,591
But when this film was
finished and came out,

1876
02:39:29,685 --> 02:39:33,519
it was Sofia that they went after.

1877
02:40:13,062 --> 02:40:19,399
Walter Murch took the scream out for
the beginning, making it so agonizing.

1878
02:40:30,788 --> 02:40:35,032
Reminds me of the ending sentiment
of <i>The Magnificent Ambersons,</i>

1879
02:40:35,126 --> 02:40:39,165
yes, finally, after all
of this, over three films

1880
02:40:39,255 --> 02:40:43,624
and generations of
people working on the film,

1881
02:40:44,051 --> 02:40:46,634
Michael Corleone got his comeuppance.

1882
02:42:09,595 --> 02:42:12,462
And this is why we felt
the film should be called

1883
02:42:12,556 --> 02:42:14,263
<i>The Death of Michael Corleone.</i>

1884
02:42:47,967 --> 02:42:52,882
Interestingly enough, he dies at
such an indeterminate time in the future,

1885
02:42:53,639 --> 02:42:58,975
that Mario and I thought, as we
discussed the possible fourth film,

1886
02:42:59,061 --> 02:43:04,306
that the fourth film would be
much more like the second film,

1887
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:07,392
in that it would be
told in two time periods.

1888
02:43:07,486 --> 02:43:11,730
That one time period would
be the period in New York,

1889
02:43:12,366 --> 02:43:15,700
sort of picking up from <i>Godfather II</i>

1890
02:43:15,786 --> 02:43:19,950
and taking you into the
time period of <i>Godfather I.</i>

1891
02:43:20,582 --> 02:43:24,325
You would see the Corleone
family in its rise to power,

1892
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:27,663
and the main character really
would be Sonny Corleone,

1893
02:43:27,756 --> 02:43:29,463
and he would be juxtaposed,

1894
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:32,963
very much in the way that
the second <i>Godfather</i> was,

1895
02:43:33,053 --> 02:43:37,923
with a modern story in which the main
character would be Vincent Mancini,

1896
02:43:38,017 --> 02:43:39,849
Sonny's son,

1897
02:43:39,935 --> 02:43:43,098
and his story would be Vincent,

1898
02:43:43,188 --> 02:43:48,024
of course, in a modern
period after this action,

1899
02:43:48,610 --> 02:43:52,569
in which he had really become
the head of the Corleone family

1900
02:43:52,656 --> 02:43:57,901
but it had gone into a realm of cocaine

1901
02:43:57,995 --> 02:44:04,116
and a dangerous relationship
with this tremendous drug trade.

1902
02:44:04,626 --> 02:44:08,119
But there would be two stories of
what Mario called "the happy years,"

1903
02:44:08,255 --> 02:44:12,419
which was the story of the
Corleone family coming into power

1904
02:44:12,509 --> 02:44:16,377
and indeed Don Corleone,
as played by Marlon Brando,

1905
02:44:16,472 --> 02:44:18,054
reaching his zenith,

1906
02:44:18,140 --> 02:44:21,223
and at the same time
the story of the rise.

1907
02:44:21,310 --> 02:44:26,271
It was the story of the fall of
the family in a modern context,

1908
02:44:26,357 --> 02:44:29,315
almost in a story
starring Vincent Mancini,

1909
02:44:29,401 --> 02:44:33,565
with the haunting he
had of this love that he lost

1910
02:44:33,655 --> 02:44:38,900
and his ultimate hunting down,
almost like a Pablo Escobar,

1911
02:44:38,994 --> 02:44:41,531
on the landscape of Colombia,

1912
02:44:41,622 --> 02:44:47,834
in which they are hunting
down this last gangster mogul.

1913
02:44:48,253 --> 02:44:50,335
And there would be one more scene

1914
02:44:50,422 --> 02:44:54,211
with Vincent and the
old Michael Corleone,

1915
02:44:54,301 --> 02:44:59,296
which ironically had happened, really,
earlier than his death scene at the end.

1916
02:44:59,390 --> 02:45:02,508
So it would be a movie
sort of like <i>Godfather II,</i>

1917
02:45:02,601 --> 02:45:07,186
that would interpose the rise
of the family before World War II

1918
02:45:07,523 --> 02:45:11,642
and the destruction of the family
in the person of Vincent Mancini,

1919
02:45:12,194 --> 02:45:18,031
but ultimately we never
really laid out the script,

1920
02:45:18,117 --> 02:45:20,358
although there are
parts of the old section,

1921
02:45:20,452 --> 02:45:23,319
the period before World War II,

1922
02:45:23,414 --> 02:45:25,530
but the new section was never worked on.

1923
02:45:25,624 --> 02:45:28,912
And Mario Puzo unfortunately died

1924
02:45:29,044 --> 02:45:34,380
before any opportunity was made to
have him work on the script with me.
