The cops just raided our garage in Baricola

48
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:21,762
they're really interested in you

49
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,907
pizza will send up a flare that will lead them right to us

50
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,380
I said we move out first thing in morning

51
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:32,979

52
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:35,647
and they catch me

00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,879
they fall in big numbers anybody with me

54
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:43,588
Han we had a good one

55
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,921

56
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:54,519

59
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:25,369
I here Rio is nice this time of year

60
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,812
the cops are getting hungry

61
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,068
I guess we are doing our job

62
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,362
i'm a walking target.

63
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,925
I don’t want you around when they catch up to me

64
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,616
ride or die remember?

65
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,797
Dom how long have we been doing this?

66
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,410
And now all of a sudden out of nowhere, it’s too dangerous

67
00:09:58,574 --> 00:09:59,621
come on

68
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,544
we'll figure it out, we always do.

69
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:26,299
Move

70
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,063
move out of my way

71
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,364
I got a gun.

72
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,290
-l don't know shit, I don't know shiit
-give me a name!

73
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,047
David park, David park is the guy you want.

74
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:33,918
Please

75
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:39,844
( someone is talking far away)

76
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:42,225
Oh thank god.

77
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:46,389
He's in the mood because yesterday was his cheap day
and today some geniuses bought him some doughnuts.

78
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,579
Oh great

79
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,211
sorry I’m late

80
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,117
the complaints keep rolling in
after your little down town Olympics, O'conner

81
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,108
tell me that reinstating you wasn't a mistake

82
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,915
I got a name

83
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,135
David park
is that it?

84
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,195
Is that all you got
David park?

85
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:07,570
I could throw a fortune cookie out of this window and get
50 David Parks right now?

86
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,576
-its korean not chinese
-what ever

87
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,881
Park is a scout who recruits street racers
to be mules for the Braga cartel

88
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,818
we find park,
and we bust the bad guys

89
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,994
( kid speaking Spanish)

90
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,178
(Speaking Spanish)

91
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:42,520
Whats up?

92
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,216
Mia I told you not to call me here

93
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,077
Dom its Letty

94
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,918
she's been murdered

95
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:09,906
We're gathered today to witness this soul...

96
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,966
facial recognition solves the match deride

97
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,472
about 2 minutes after you
crossed the border

98
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:48,465
I don't get it

99
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,309
thought he'd it show

100
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:46,853
I told you not to come, they are staking the place out
what if they find you?

101
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,088
They won't

102
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,278
come on

103
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,239
look at you

104
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:20,962
Letty wouldn't let them junk it

105
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,018
even though it is a god damn curse

106
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,604
when she came back,
she was always in here

107
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,293
working on it, day and night.

108
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,150
It was weird

109
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,089
it was like she knew you were coming back

110
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,941
I want to see the crash site

111
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,882
I just got off the phone with deputy director Lawson

112
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:02,869
if we don't make serious in roads
on La Braga case in next 72 hours

113
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,184
there are going to shut us down

114
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,652
I know I'm new-bie here but why the clock now?

115
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:10,353
Because it’s been two years

116
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:14,427
and the last
three agents We sent in to infiltrate this organization
have come back in body bags

117
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:19,019
he's moved more heroin across the border
than Escobar did in ten years

118
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:24,247
this guy is becoming one of our biggest national threats
and we don’t even have a picture of him

119
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:27,990
we don’t have prints not even a god damn DOB

120
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,492
what's the status on David Park?

121
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,152
Isn't he our ticket into La Braga organization?

122
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,768
Well, we are running the name through city
and county databases sorting the possibilities

123
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,962
we have got over 500 already

124
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,799
parks is an insignificant,
sounds like another jerk off to me.

125
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,793
He's not, without Park, Braga wouldn't have drivers to move a shipment

126
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,897
cross check traffic

127
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:53,772
illegal modifications, street racing
this guy will definitely have a record
We will find him

128
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:56,924
we better

129
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:02,322
oh what do you know, your boy Toretto
has been seen in his old neighbourhood

130
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,086
we could bring his ass in

131
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,906
not in your code you’re not.

132
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:16,691
Straight ahead

133
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:19,314
you found something back there

134
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,386
there were brown marks on the ground

135
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:33,826
the kind that could be only caused by natural methyl

136
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,537
there is only one guy
on all of L.A. who sells that

137
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,162
nothing you can do is
gonna bring her back, Dom

138
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,818
if I were Letty, I would ask you..

139
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:54,453
No, I would beg you, please let this go

140
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,049
before it’s too late

141
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:03,467
it’s already too late

142
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:10,387
I love you

143
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:04,989
(looking at paper work)

144
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:16,099
Miss Torretto

145
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,116
I am Michel Stasiak, FBl

146
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:21,497

147
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:45,697
Hey, this is Forsyth in evidence

148
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,835
I need Stasiak right away to sign some greens

149
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:50,011
thanks

150
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,657
I narrowed it down to 50 or so of David Park

151
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:57,531
and I like you make this one
to make a model for each one of them

152
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:11,103
you didn’t tell me, we got a transfer

153
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,848
you mind coming with me

154
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:37,280
what?

155
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:40,280
-Torretto, when did you get back in town?

156
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:42,706
I am looking for a car that you did an engine mod on

157
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:47,666
natural methane tank, fort full size, continental tires

158
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:52,232
what.. what you doing? coming here like this

159
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:54,855
this ain't your scene anymore boss

160
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,889
don’t you put your hands on me again.. okay?

161
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:00,208
Say hi to your sister for me

162
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:13,305
Korean kid brought it in

163
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:15,158
David Park

164
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:19,196
Green Ford Torino

165
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:20,897
don’t drop this on me

166
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:27,441
almost done

167
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,971
why don't you tell me why you dragged me here Brian?

168
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,628
You know they're gonna capture Dom

169
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:42,544
maybe worse

170
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:46,860
I don't want you get tangled up in this
stay away from him

171
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:51,900
that's what you have to say to me after 5 years

172
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:55,856
all of the sudden you care what happens to me

173
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,631
what I did to you was wrong

174
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:05,364
I am sorry
it was, it was hardest thing I ever had to do

175
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,321
I’m sorry too Brian

176
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:14,675
I’m so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me

177
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,351
I’m so sorry that you ripped my family apart

178
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:19,580
I’m very sorry that was hard for you

179
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,971
I lied to you

180
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:28,408
I lied to Dom, I lied to every body

181
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,407
that’s what I do best, that’s why the feds recruited me

182
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,600
maybe you're lying to yourself

183
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,057
you’re not the good guy pretending to be a bad guy

184
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,968
maybe you’re the bad guy pretending to be the good guy

185
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:46,555
you ever think about that

186
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:49,965
every day

187
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,591
You know I always wondered

188
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,701
why did you let my brother go that day?

189
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,093

190
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,374

the standard issue tracking device

252
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:29,668
the boss wants to know where you are all the time

253
00:33:18,952 --> 00:33:20,483

254
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,825

257
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:34,073
you gotta be fast
if you drive for Braga

258
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:35,586
is there a problem here?

259
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:37,385

Do you all know why you are here?

267
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:21,960
Good drivers

268
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:25,442
are a Dime a dozen

269
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:29,408
every corner's got a chinga lead a tuner....

270
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:33,070
that's not what Braga got me
to looking for

271
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,887
Braga wants someone that will sell
their vileta to be behind the wheel

272
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:42,721
someone that rides in a 10 sec cars but not in a straight line

273
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,591
but to push it, and make it through
places that no one else would take it

274
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:50,366
Real drivers, you getting this

275
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,759
so, what are we hauling?

276
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:57,493
You're here for the money which Braga's
paying, so you don't need to know

277
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:00,447
you just said you wanted real drivers

278
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,469
a real driver knows exactly whats in his car

279
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,738
YEAH, real driver...

280
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:16,069
nobody is forcing you to race?

281
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:17,671
You’re the boss?

282
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:22,380
Or I’m I talking to the boss?

283
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,767
Do I look like the boss?

284
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:31,923
Papi! my job is to find the best drivers... period

285
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:34,439
whoever wins the race gets the info

286
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:36,194
