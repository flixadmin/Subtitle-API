1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,528
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,251
To my family,
I am the brother and son...

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,644
...who just returned home
after being lost at sea five years ago.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,203
They don't know I came back with
a mission to bring justice to our city...

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,567
...and they never can.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,160
The men and women
I've targeted are dangerous, corrupt...

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,721
...a virulent cancer.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,123
Cancers like James Holder,
whose corporation...

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,604
...put defective smoke detectors
in low-income housing in the Glades.

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,090
There have been many fires
and too many funerals.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,928
But cancers can be fought
and conquered.

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,691
All it takes is a surgeon...

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,601
...and the right instrument.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,011
Other than the bill I got handed
by my legal team...

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,491
...I'm feeling pretty good.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,523
Now that this lawsuit's been settled...

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,326
...we can focus our attention
on Unidac Industries.

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,131
Okay. I'll see you in the office
first thing.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,603
I have armed security inside.
All I have to do is call out.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,764
Go ahead. They can't hear you.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,088
- What the hell do you want?
- How many people died in those fires?

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,480
How many?

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,083
The courts say you don't owe
your victims anything. I disagree.

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,527
James Holder, you--

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,407
It's no surprise a man as corrupt as
James Holder has more than one enemy.

26
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,967
The bullet. Poison.

27
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,770
Who are you?

28
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,922
Why did you shoot me?

29
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,041
Damn it.

30
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,404
What happened? Thea okay?

31
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,241
Cops brought her home.

32
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,371
She and some of her friends broke into
a store tried on some dresses last night.

33
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,087
Lit up the breathalyzer
like a Christmas tree.

34
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,165
So how was your evening, sir?

35
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,523
After I said I had to go bathroom
at dinner and never came back?

36
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,644
I guess from now on
I'll be watching you pee.

37
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,087
Thank you, officers.
My wife and I appreciate it.

38
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,201
- I'll see you out.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,482
Last time it was public intoxication.
This time breaking and entering.

40
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,849
My, how we are moving up
in the criminal world.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,085
When you pay off the store owner
you should check out the merchandise.

42
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,040
- They got some pretty killer outfits.
- Thea, go get ready for school.

43
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,966
Uh, you know, I was thinking
of taking a sick day.

44
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,201
Fine, then get some sleep.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,206
You look like crap.

46
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,645
You're letting her play hooky?

47
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,724
When your sister gets like this,
it's best to give her space.

48
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,325
She's testing you.

49
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,525
Yes. Who'd she learn that from?

50
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,050
Mom.

51
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,087
When I was her age, you let me
get away with murder. Looking back...

52
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,483
...I could have used less space
and more parenting.

53
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,326
It doesn't make sense.

54
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,320
Holder fits the profile. Wealthy dirtbag.
Red meat for the hood.

55
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,606
We recovered one arrow.

56
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,684
This time cause of death
is a double tap through the heart...

57
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,649
...and our perp doesn't use firearms.

58
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,805
He's figured out there's easier ways
to kill people than with a bow and arrow.

59
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,768
And it's like you said,
the guy's a whack job.

60
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,364
The bullets were laced with curare.

61
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,728
A rare and deadly poison.
The killer's unique MO.

62
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,007
He's killed all over the world.
Chicago, Markovia, Corto Maltese.

63
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,285
Interpol even has a codename for him.
Deadshot.

64
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,083
I was prepared to give James Holder
a chance to right his wrongs...

65
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,607
...but this Deadshot has no morality...

66
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,526
...no honor, no code.

67
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,050
He doesn't kill for justice, which makes
him as dangerous as anyone on my list.

68
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,041
In fact, it puts him right at the top.

69
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,649
What do you think?

70
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
- Great spot for a nightclub or what?
- Sweet.

71
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,887
If you're thinking calling it Queens,
I don't think you're gonna get...

72
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,844
...the clientele you were hoping for.

73
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,087
Private office?

74
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,811
For the private one-on-one meetings,
I would imagine.

75
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,923
Hopefully the occasional
two-on-one meeting.

76
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,004
Man, are you sure you wanna do this?

77
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,843
It's not like you really have
any experience in running a...

78
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,844
Well, running anything.

79
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,686
How about tomorrow night, the two of us
go and scope out the competition.

80
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,243
There's a new club opening downtown.
It's called Poison. Max Fuller owns it.

81
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,851
- Max Fuller.
Mm-hm.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,526
- I slept with his fiancée.
- Yeah, before the wedding.

83
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,091
It was at rehearsal dinner.

84
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,886
The rehearsal dinner
is technically before the wedding. Ha, ha.

85
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,121
- Right?
- Ha, ha.

86
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,641
And besides,
who stays mad at a castaway?

87
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,442
Aw, damn it, I gotta roll. Anyway,
I'll see you later, man. Good place.

88
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,090
See you.

89
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,365
So...

90
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,930
...what do you think?

91
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,321
I'm here to provide security,
not a commentary.

92
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,883
Oh, come on, Dig, do me a favor.
Speak freely, please.

93
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,967
Well, this is the Glades, right?

94
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,771
Your rich friends wouldn't
come to this neighborhood.

95
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,684
I am Oliver Queen, right?

96
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,484
People would stand in line
for three hours if I opened a club.

97
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,803
No one who lives in the Glades
would see a penny of those charges.

98
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,328
We make it a successful business,
we gentrify the neighborhood.

99
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,528
I was wondering
when we would get to that.

100
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,881
The white knight swooping in
to save the disenfranchised.

101
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,004
And all by his lonesome
with no help from anybody.

102
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,207
Wow.

103
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,851
You don't think very much of me,
do you?

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,528
No, actually, sir, I have a very
high regard for how perceptive you are.

105
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,007
Sir.

106
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,887
The nightclub will conceal
my base underneath...

107
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,125
...and provide an alibi for where
Oliver Queen spends his nights.

108
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,561
Hey, do you have the depos
on the Jergens case?

109
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,291
Yeah, they're around here somewhere.

110
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,443
- I was just surfing the net.
- Really?

111
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,408
Joanna, I'm over him.

112
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,650
And you don't believe me.

113
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,765
I would have if I wouldn't have just
caught you trolling for articles on him.

114
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,967
I wasn't trolling.

115
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,727
I don't wanna be the one to remind you
that he cheated on you, Laurel.

116
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,044
With your sister.

117
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,288
I appreciate your self-control.

118
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,042
You're stuck. The reason I know this
is the fact that only relationship...

119
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,680
...you've had since Oliver
is with his best friend.

120
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,931
It is time to move on. It is past time.

121
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,810
- I've been busy. I work a lot.
- Okay.

122
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,607
That's gotta stop.
So we are going out tonight.

123
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,003
And we are gonna have some shots
and we are gonna dance with men...

124
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,289
...that we don't know
and we are gonna stay out way too late.

125
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,408
Oh. Heh.

126
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,210
Jergens depos.

127
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,206
I really don't think
I can go out tonight.

128
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,762
It is adorable that you actually think
I'm giving you a choice.

129
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,728
I want you to come home
right after school.

130
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,326
Uh, can't. Margot and I
are gonna go to the mall.

131
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,891
What, more shopping?

132
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,450
Tell Margot you'll have to cancel.
You're grounded for two weeks.

133
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,083
Grounded? I've never been grounded.

134
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,402
Well, you've never committed
larceny before.

135
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,168
- Since when do you care?
- I've always cared. I'm your mother.

136
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,130
Look, we've had a good thing
going on the last five years.

137
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,406
Why mess with that now?

138
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,484
No, we are paying off store owners
to keep your record clean.

139
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,480
- So clearly, it hasn't been working.
- And you're gonna teach me.

140
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,930
It's Oliver, isn't it?

141
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,651
His judgmental hypocrisy
is rubbing off on you.

142
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,770
No, I don't need Oliver to teach me
how to parent you.

143
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,491
- You'll be home by 4.
- Or what?

144
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,961
You're gonna call the cops on me? Heh.

145
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,962
Tell them I say hi.

146
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,288
Got ballistics back
on the Holder murder.

147
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,770
They pulled two 7.62 millimeter
bullets out of him.

148
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,446
According to stippling and size
of the entry wound...

149
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,206
...they estimate shots were fired
from 100 yards away.

150
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,449
A hundred yards? So the hood
shoots him from another building...

151
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,491
...goes over to his place, he takes out
his security, then fires a few arrows?

152
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,282
And according to his tox screen,
his blood contained strychnos toxifera.

153
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,841
- What?
- Curare. It's a kind of poison.

154
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,483
Oh. Okay, so now we switch from arrows
to sniper bullets and poison.

155
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,321
- I'm not buying it.
- We still found arrows on the scene.

156
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,448
Solid evidence the hood was there.

157
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,531
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get my own evidence.

158
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,441
Seven-point-62 millimeter rounds.

159
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,080
The money trail
leads back to the Bratva.

160
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,969
The Russian mob.

161
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,329
Finally, some good luck.

162
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,846
Pleased to meet you.

163
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,084
I apologize.

164
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,041
We meant no disrespect to a captain.

165
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,561
Particularly an American one.

166
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,125
So how can I be of assistance?

167
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,129
I'm in the market for a hired gun.

168
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,243
Someone the organization's
used before.

169
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,200
His calling card is a 7.62
millimeter round laced with curare.

170
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,886
- I know no man who uses such tools.
- But you can find out who does.

171
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,004
First, we will drink
to each other's health...

172
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,528
...then I will look into the identity
of this man you seek.

173
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,603
I will also confirm
that you are really Bratva captain.

174
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,087
Should this not be the case,
I will send my mechanic here...

175
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,005
...to find you and kill you
and your family.

176
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,482
Carl Rasmussen was found
shot to death in his home earlier this evening.

177
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,486
The police will not comment if there's a
connection between Rasmussen's death...

178
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,324
...and the murder of James Holder.

179
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,041
Mr. Rasmussen leaves behind
a wife and three children.

180
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,404
It's a great loss. Carl was a titan.

181
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,610
A titan who was looking to buy out
a company called Unidac Industries?

182
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,604
Well, industries are something
of a misnomer.

183
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,481
Ul's recent activity was actually
looking into alternative energy.

184
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,565
The point my partner is trying to make is
that Rasmussen was the second bidder...

185
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,008
-...to lose his life.
- Are you implying something, detective?

186
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,731
Only that your husband's looking
into buying Unidac...

187
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,526
...and the competition
seems to be dropping like flies.

188
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,523
And I'm sure your veiled accusation...

189
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,524
...has nothing to do
with how you feel about my family.

190
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,328
Unidac's in receivership, detective.

191
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,361
Ownership is subject
to a liquidation auction...

192
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,006
...so that means
there are many prospective buyers.

193
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,447
And the auction's tomorrow...

194
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,967
...so if I was taking out
the competition...

195
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,886
...I have a lot of killing to do
in a very short amount of time.

196
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,887
We're just making rounds
with interested buyers.

197
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,361
- Let them know to be careful.
- Oh, yes.

198
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,931
And I'm overwhelmed...

199
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,964
...that Detective Lance
is concerned for our safety.

200
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,367
Well, thank you for your concern,
gentlemen.

201
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,761
Our security consultant, Mr. Diggle...

202
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,089
...is taking
all the necessary precautions.

203
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,767
Yeah. Right.

204
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,403
Well, if you need us...

205
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,765
...we're just a 911 call away.

206
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,444
Ha, ha. Oh, my, this is gonna be killer.

207
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,080
If Max Fuller sees me here, I agree.

208
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,170
Aw, if you wanna run a business,
you gotta take a few risks.

209
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,891
- I don't see your name on the list.
- Mr. Queen.

210
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,127
Oh.

211
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,768
I have never seen this guy before
in my life. Ever.

212
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,004
Oh, wow.

213
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,243
Doesn't you going out and having fun
violate some kind of law...

214
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,966
...like the ones
that are carved on a stone tablet.

215
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,884
- That's cute, Tommy.
- Thanks.

216
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,930
I can see you two
are up to your old hunting patterns.

217
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,686
Just seeing what passes for fun
in Starling City after five years.

218
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,209
Ah. I'm sure you'll find that it hasn't been
same without you.

219
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,805
Big brother.

220
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,766
Oh, I am so wasted right now.
There is...

221
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,564
There is two of you.

222
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,211
I thought you were grounded.

223
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,684
I am. And thank you.
Thank you for that, by the way.

224
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,606
You're done for the night.

225
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,091
Oh, what are you gonna do?

226
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,765
- Tell mom?
- Thea.

227
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,281
You are hanging
with the wrong people.

228
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,570
You're one to talk.

229
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,531
How much do you know about your
own so-called friends over here?

230
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,011
Thea, maybe you shouldn't--

231
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,488
Tommy, I think your BFF
has a right to know.

232
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,326
- Thea, let's go.
- Well, I guess they never told you...

233
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,847
...that they've been screwing
while you were gone.

234
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,367
- Look, man, I--
- Tommy.

235
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,485
It's okay.

236
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,886
You and me,
we're done for the night.

237
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,327
Take your hands off of me.

238
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,203
You're not my father.
And you're barely my brother.

239
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,446
Well, well, look at this.

240
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,921
Oliver Queen.

241
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,527
Max Fuller.

242
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,847
How you been?

243
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,121
Happy you drowned.

244
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,967
- Hey, Max--
- Ugh!

245
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,330
Get him up!

246
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,841
Hey, let him go, let him go.
Hey, I said let him go.

247
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,650
Told you he was gonna be pissed.

248
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,802
Back off, Merlyn.
This isn't your problem.

249
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,123
You wanna get to him?
You've gotta go through me.

250
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,081
Wow, they are probably gonna go
through me.

251
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,331
So is this over, Max?

252
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,484
Or are you gonna have your boys
pound on me next?

253
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,841
You three consider yourselves
banned for life.

254
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,602
Get the hell out of my place.

255
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,485
Your club sucks anyway.

256
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,447
- You guys okay?
- Where'd you learn to do that?

257
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,008
Cop dad, remember? He made me
take self-defense classes.

258
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,847
Laurel.

259
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,084
What Thea said...

260
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,769
Oliver, Tommy and I
don't need your blessing.

261
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,602
And I don't need your forgiveness.

262
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,561
Why don't you guys, uh, take a seat
and I will grab a couple of burgers...

263
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,484
...and some ice for those faces.

264
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,369
- Cute.
- That's my sister-in-law.

265
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,649
Who I will never speak to or look at.

266
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,605
Ever. Gonna grab a booth.

267
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,168
She's not wearing a wedding ring.
Brother out of the picture?

268
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, you could say that.

269
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,284
Hey, you.

270
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,767
So sweet of you
to adopt two white boys.

271
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,524
They need a good role model.

272
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,489
That's my client Oliver Queen.

273
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,325
Looks like you're doing
a bang up job protecting him.

274
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,569
Look, man...

275
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,529
...about Laurel.

276
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,525
I was gonna tell you.

277
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,889
I was just trying
to figure out the right way.

278
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,691
To tell somebody
that you slept with their girlfriend...

279
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,804
...after they went missing
and were then presumed dead.

280
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,608
What, there's no greeting card
for that?

281
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,803
Look, it was wrong.

282
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,011
- And I'm sorry.
- Tommy.

283
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,366
I was dead.

284
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,524
No, man, you were with Laurel.

285
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,411
And whether you were dead,
or as it turns out, alive...

286
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,406
...on a deserted island,
you are my friend.

287
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,246
And me being with Laurel
violated that friendship...

288
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,971
-...in about 50 different ways.
- Thank you.

289
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,491
But it's okay.

290
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,729
How dangerous is this gig, anyway?

291
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,366
It's a cakewalk, Carla, don't worry.

292
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,601
Too late.

293
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,411
Or have you forgotten
this job got your brother killed?

294
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,244
Because, Dig, I haven't. I can't.

295
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,171
You are being
really chill about this. I...

296
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,567
Hello?

297
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,240
It's a Russian model calling me.

298
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,643
Can we...
Can I have a minute, please?

299
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,491
I can see now
why you were able to be so chill.

300
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,688
EHjOY-

301
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,081
So I checked out?

302
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,608
You did. His name is Floyd Lawton.

303
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,407
I have address, where he stayed
last time he was in Starling City.

304
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,726
But that is all.

305
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,326
Let's hope he's a creature of habit. Go.

306
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,923
1700 Broadway, Pape Motel, Room 52.

307
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,606
You'll leave us out of this, yes?

308
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,129
Assuming Mr. Lawton
doesn't kill you first.

309
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,569
Felicity Smoak?

310
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,323
Hi. I'm Oliver Queen.

311
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,724
Of course.

312
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,962
I know who you are, you're Mr. Queen.

313
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,804
No, Mr. Queen was my father.

314
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,486
Right, but he's dead.
I mean, he drowned.

315
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,008
You didn't, which means you could
come down to the IT Department...

316
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,162
...and listen to me babble.

317
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,251
Which Will end.

318
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,051
In three, two, one.

319
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,244
Having trouble with my computer...

320
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,324
...and they told me that
you were the person to come and see.

321
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,484
I was at my coffee shop surfing the web
and I spilt a latte on it.

322
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,806
- Really?
- Yeah.

323
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,321
Because these look
like bullet holes.

324
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,522
My coffee shop
is in a bad neighborhood.

325
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,282
If there is anything
that you can salvage from it...

326
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,011
...I would really appreciate it.

327
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,727
Mm-hm.

328
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,001
Wow. Well, good, you're here.

329
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,481
I'm under house arrest, remember.

330
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,291
Do you wanna wear
the Calvin Klein or the Zac Posen?

331
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,807
To dinner?

332
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,966
- I was just gonna wear pajamas.
- To Walter's stock auction.

333
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,689
- I think I rather be grounded.
- No, it's important that you come.

334
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,126
Important to whom?

335
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,044
To me.

336
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,326
All right, listen to me.

337
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,883
When you were 4 years old,
you came home one day with a cat.

338
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,282
It was a stray, it was filthy
and it was mean.

339
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,691
But you stood there and you declared
that it was coming to live with us.

340
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,848
Your father came home
from the office...

341
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,843
...and he saw what was going on...

342
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,321
...and he sat you down
and he explained to you...

343
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,646
...that the cat was in fact a tiger
and that we needed to get it home.

344
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,087
And somehow...

345
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,965
...you understood.

346
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,924
Robert was always so good
at getting through to you.

347
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,084
I was always so jealous of that. I...

348
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,121
You never talk about him.

349
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,690
Dad.

350
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,886
That's the first time
you talked about him in years.

351
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,285
Well, I think you and I
have gotten into some bad habits.

352
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,360
There's been a lot
that has changed recently, Thea...

353
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,847
...and I think
that maybe this can change too.

354
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,043
- It looks like blueprints.
- Do you know what of?

355
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,567
- The Exchange Building.
- Never heard of it.

356
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,566
It's where the Unidac Industries
auction is scheduled to take place.

357
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,731
- I thought you said that was your laptop.
- Yes.

358
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,321
Look, I don't wanna get
in the middle...

359
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,847
...of some Shakespearean
family drama thing.

360
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,240
- What?
- Mr. Steele marrying your mom.

361
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,723
Claudius, Gertrude, Hamlet.

362
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,601
I didn't study Shakespeare at any of
the four schools that I dropped out of.

363
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,603
Mr. Steele is trying to buy
Unidac Industries.

364
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,444
And you've got a company laptop...

365
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,206
...associated with one of guys
he's competing against.

366
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,204
- Floyd Lawton.
- No.

367
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,368
Warren Patel.

368
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,046
Who's Floyd Lawton?

369
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,084
He is an employee of Mr. Patel,
evidently.

370
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,086
The Exchange Building is surrounded
by three towers...

371
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,447
...with eye lines into the building.

372
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,486
Lawton can get his kill shot off
from virtually anywhere.

373
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,365
But I can't cover the area.

374
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,291
I can't protect
all of Deadshofs targets.

375
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,562
I can't do this alone.

376
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,171
- You son of a bitch!
- Detective, quiet!

377
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,641
You've got a pair on you, pulling this.

378
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,929
Floyd Lawton's the one targeting
the buyers interested in Unidac.

379
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,124
Interpol calls him Deadshot
because he never misses.

380
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,250
You can look this up after I go.

381
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,687
Yeah, and stop chasing you,
I suppose?

382
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,564
Warren Patel hired Lawton.

383
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,684
I can't be sure who they're targeting,
might be the buyers...

384
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,367
...and I can't protect them
in a space that big.

385
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,764
- I need your help.
- Heh. Yeah? Professional help?

386
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,842
Lawton laces his bullets with curare.

387
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,527
- Tell your men to wear Kevlar.
- I'll them to shoot you--

388
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,011
Well, it's quite a turnout.

389
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,162
Well, it's quite an opportunity,
actually.

390
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,403
But regardless of the outcome
of the auction...

391
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,484
...I'm already a winner because I have
two beautiful women...

392
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,921
- ...at my side tonight.
- Two?

393
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,442
Thanks for coming, Thea.

394
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,842
It means a lot to your mother.
And me.

395
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,485
Mr. Steele, the auction
will be opening in five minutes.

396
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,405
- Please make sure your bid is ready.
- Thank you, Gina.

397
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,369
- Shall we?
Mm-hm.

398
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,891
I got him.

399
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,522
Warren Patel.
I need you to come with me, sir.

400
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,169
Unit one, all clear.
Unit two, you copy.

401
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,164
We have Patel
in custody. Still no sign of Lawton.

402
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,005
- Unit three?
- I'm at the northwest perimeter.

403
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,491
- All clear.
- Unit four?

404
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,125
MAN 1'.
Parking structure is secure.

405
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,806
- Unit five, what's your status?
- This is unit five.

406
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,606
All clear.

407
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,968
Oh, what a shock.

408
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,688
Heh. It is Friday night.
What are you doing here?

409
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,411
Well, I am an attorney
and this is a courthouse...

410
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,723
...so I think the better question is
what are you doing here?

411
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,527
I wanted to talk to you
about last night.

412
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,931
You mean how I saved your asses?
You're welcome.

413
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,210
Okay, first of all, we shall never,
ever speak of that ever again.

414
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,081
Secondly, I think you know
that I meant the other thing.

415
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,329
- I don't care to talk about that.
- I spoke to Oliver.

416
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,251
He was surprisingly cool.

417
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,606
That's because he knew.

418
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,367
Did you see his face
when Thea told him?

419
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,242
Tommy, he didn't even blink.
Trust me, he knew.

420
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,483
- Then why didn't he say anything?
- I don't know.

421
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,684
Maybe because he knows
he doesn't have any right to judge me.

422
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,003
You got a silver lining, though.

423
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,051
Now that the whole truth,
and nothing but, is out...

424
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,168
...is there a chance now
for you and me?

425
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,441
You said you didn't think
that I was a one girl type of guy.

426
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,728
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

427
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,044
- By dating me.
- By being better.

428
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,730
By being someone that you deserve
and that you want to be with.

429
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,411
Well, that's certainly a guy
I'd be interested in meeting.

430
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,091
Good.

431
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,130
Now how about we start, ahem,
by getting you the heck out of here.

432
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,089
Come on, it is Friday night.

433
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,647
Come on.

434
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,251
- Fine.
- Good.

435
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,290
- Don't you scrub up nice?
- Here to support my family.

436
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,761
Yeah, me too, God help me.

437
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,331
Thank you.

438
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,806
Dig- Got YOUF eyes open?

439
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,964
That's what I'm here for.
And answering patronizing questions.

440
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,321
This guy's out of time.

441
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,882
If he's gonna do something,
it's gonna happen before the auction.

442
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,525
Sir?

443
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,129
I heard the story on the radio.

444
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,930
Oliver.

445
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,569
So pleased you were able to attend. Heh.

446
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,361
Walter, the police said
that some of the Unidac bidders were murdered.

447
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,046
I think that we should be
a little bit more careful.

448
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,929
My mother's already lost a husband.

449
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,400
If Moira shared your concern,
she wouldn't have come.

450
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,763
And she definitely
wouldn't have brought your sister.

451
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,206
Hi.

452
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,647
Oliver, what a wonderful surprise.

453
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,451
I need you to get them out of here
right now.

454
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,367
- Down.
- Get down.

455
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,248
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

456
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,169
No, I'm fine. Where is Walter?

457
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,886
- Go, go, go!
- Walter's fine.

458
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,283
- I have to get you out of here.
- No, them! Them.

459
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,044
Go, I'll find him, I'll find him.

460
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,768
Drop your guns.

461
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,165
I admire your work.

462
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,444
Guess you won't be extending me
any professional courtesy.

463
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,810
We're not in the same line of work.
