1
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,325
(Thunder rumbling)

2
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,494
(Horse neighs)

3
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,165
Man: It's got to be the mountain.
He's the biggest.

4
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,584
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

5
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,461
Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

6
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,631
If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.

7
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,384
Right, the mountain or our man Jaime.

8
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,970
- If he ever gets out.
- (Thunderclap)

9
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,597
Loras Tyrell?

10
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,808
Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the queen.

11
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,645
I don't care about pretty.
He's better with a sword than any of them.

12
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,980
How good could he be?

13
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,234
He's been stabbing renly Baratheon
for years, and renly ain't dead.

14
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,778
(Laughing)

15
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,404
(Horse whinnying)

16
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,871
The horses seem a little spooked to you?

17
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,498
They're horses.

18
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,167
They get spooked by their own shadows.

19
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,002
- (Shushing)
- (Horse snorting)

20
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,839
Do you hear that?

21
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,804
There's something out there.

22
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,351
(Neighing)

23
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,243
- (Farts)
- (Gasps)

24
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,869
- (Laughing)
- Oh.

25
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,872
Oh, you're a right little prick.

26
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,499
You should see your face.

27
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,626
I swear you pissed yourself.

28
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,712
"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"

29
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,879
(Laughs)

30
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,107
There is something out there.

31
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,216
- Yeah, don't even try me.
- (Horse neighs)

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,802
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

33
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,471
Rennick!

34
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,850
- (Rennick screaming)
- (Horses neighing)

35
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,481
Commander: King in the north!
Men: The king in the north!

36
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,114
- (Water running)
- (Man groans)

37
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,241
- (Flies buzzing)
- (Man screaming)

38
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,702
(Horse neighing)

39
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,662
(Man screaming)

40
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,379
Bolton: Five lannisters dead
for every one of ours.

41
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,315
Man: They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

42
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,299
Bolton: We've nowhere to keep
all these prisoners.

43
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,927
Barely enough food to feed our own.

44
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,929
We're not executing prisoners, lord Bolton.

45
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,598
Of course, your grace.

46
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,184
The officers will be useful.

47
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,270
Some of them may be privy
to tywin Lannister's plans.

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,354
I doubt it.

49
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,982
Bolton: Well, we'll learn soon enough.

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,153
In my family, we say,
"a naked man has few secrets.

51
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,030
"A flayed man none."

52
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,115
My father outlawed flaying in the north.

53
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,327
- We're not in the north.
- We're not torturing them.

54
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,329
The high road's very pretty,

55
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,572
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

56
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,959
The lannisters hold prisoners of their own.

57
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,087
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

58
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,633
- Man: No, don't! Don't! Please!
- (Woman shushing)

59
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,718
(Flies buzzing)

60
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,431
The rot's set in.

61
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,391
No, don't! No, don't!

62
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,645
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

63
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,605
It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.

64
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,566
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now...

65
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,443
No, you can't!

66
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,740
Ser! Please, ser.

67
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,624
- I can't lose...
- You'll die if she doesn't.

68
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,327
I don't want to be a cripple, please.

69
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,247
Surely one of our men
needs your attention more than this cub.

70
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,707
Your men are not my men, my lord.

71
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,335
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

72
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,921
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

73
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,253
It's better than biting your own tongue,
believe me.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,008
(Muffled screaming)

75
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,593
(Sawing)

76
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,294
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

77
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,337
Your last name?

78
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,715
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

79
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,776
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,428
That boy lost his foot on your orders.

81
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,014
They killed my father.

82
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,933
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

83
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,769
Do you think he's
friends with king Joffrey?

84
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,689
He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near lannisport.

85
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,877
He probably never held a spear before they
shoved one in his hands a few months ago.

86
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,903
I have no hatred for the lad.

87
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,446
(Sighs)

88
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,470
That should help his foot grow back.

89
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,371
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

90
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,416
I understand. The country would be at peace

91
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,836
and life would bejust under
the righteous hand of good king Joffrey.

92
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,714
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the gods give me strength.

93
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,008
- And then what?
- I don't know.

94
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,261
We'll go back to winterfell.

95
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,065
I have no desire to sit on the iron throne.

96
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,682
So who will?

97
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,643
I don't know.

98
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,937
You're fighting to overthrow a king,

99
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,789
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

100
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,857
First we have to win the war.

101
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,657
You never told me where you're from.

102
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,701
- Volantis.
- Volantis? You're far from home.

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,789
The boy was lucky you were here.

104
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,083
He was unlucky that you were.

105
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,374
You're here to answer
for your brother's latest treasons.

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,888
Your grace,

107
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,141
whatever my traitor brother has done,
I had no part.

108
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,643
You know that. I beg you, please...

109
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,478
Ser lancel, tell her of this outrage.

110
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,230
Lancel: Using some vile sorcery,

111
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,274
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,277
- (Crowd murmuring)
- Thousands of good men were butchered.

113
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,532
After the slaughter, the northmen
feasted on the flesh of the slain.

114
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,616
(Crowd murmuring)

115
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,203
Killing you
would send your brother a message.

116
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,955
(Crying)

117
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,251
But my mother insists on keeping you alive.

118
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,919
Stand.

119
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,133
So we'll have to send
your brother a message some other way.

120
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,344
Meryn.

121
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,685
Leave her face. I like her pretty.

122
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,772
- (Blow lands)
- (Sansa gasps)

123
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,192
(Groans)

124
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,403
Meryn, my lady is overdressed.

125
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,780
Unburden her.

126
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,749
If you want robb stark to hear us,
we're going to have to speak louder.

127
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,542
(Sobbing)

128
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,544
Tyrion: What is the meaning of this?

129
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,847
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

130
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,058
The kind who serves his king, imp.

131
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,311
Careful, now. We don't want to get blood
all over your pretty white cloak.

132
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,230
Tyrion: Someone get the girl
something to cover herself with.

133
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,649
She is to be your queen.

134
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,401
Have you no regard for her honor?

135
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,737
Joffrey: I'm punishing her.
Tyrion: For what crimes?

136
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,989
She did not fight her brother's battle,
you half-wit.

137
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,825
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

138
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,661
The mad king did as he liked.

139
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,790
Has your uncle Jaime ever told you
what happened to him?

140
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,793
No one threatens his grace
in the presence of the kingsguard.

141
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,505
I'm not threatening the king, ser.
I am educating my nephew.

142
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,674
Bronn, the next time ser meryn speaks,
kill him.

143
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,054
That was a threat. See the difference?

144
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,074
(Crowd whispering)

145
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,037
I apologize for my nephew's behavior.

146
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,289
(Crowd murmuring)

147
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,584
Tell me the truth.
Do you want an end to this engagement?

148
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,879
I am onal to king
Joffrey, my one true love.

149
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,221
Lady stark, you may survive us yet.

150
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,727
The little king's backed up.

151
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,480
Clogged from balls to brains.

152
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,775
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

153
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,236
There's no cure for being a cunt.

154
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,989
But the boy's at that age.

155
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,659
And he's got nothing to do all day
but pick wings off flies.

156
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,412
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

157
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,880
What are you doing here, dog?

158
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:16,426
Your uncle left your nameday present
and asked me to see that you got it.

159
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,930
And?

160
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,183
What is it?

161
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,977
Look inside, your grace.

162
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,651
Your grace.

163
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,614
- Happy nameday, your grace.
- My nameday has passed.

164
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,116
We won't tell if you won't.

165
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,832
Her.

166
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,753
Touch her.

167
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,925
(Women giggling)

168
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,727
(Breathing heavily)

169
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,026
Could you hit her?

170
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,154
(Laughs)

171
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,166
My uncle sent you?

172
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,670
Yes, your grace. He chose us himself.

173
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,296
Hmm.

174
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,548
- (Slapping)
- (Women laughing)

175
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,182
Use this.

176
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,655
Harder.

177
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,367
(Whimpers)

178
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,538
I said harder.

179
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,002
He'd want me to get his money's worth.

180
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,015
(Crying)

181
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,935
(Screaming)

182
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,089
Your grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

183
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,677
(Woman whimpering)

184
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,767
Please, your grace.

185
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,520
Your grace, if your uncle finds out...

186
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,564
Oh, I want him to find out.

187
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,401
You will bring her
to his chambers when you're finished

188
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,236
and show him what you've done,

189
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,449
or the same thing will happen to you.

190
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,540
Begin.

191
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,216
- ({thuds)
- (Woman screams)

192
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,675
Harder!

193
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,981
Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.

194
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,777
Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

195
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,739
Your grace.

196
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,204
Now you do the lannisters' bidding,
is that it?

197
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:18,668
Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
before you secured your newest patron?

198
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,837
I'm a practical man.

199
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,507
Just not a loyal one.

200
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,259
And who would you have me be loyal to?

201
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,219
Your brother's corpse?

202
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,554
(Chuckles)

203
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,349
I don't like you, lord baelish.

204
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,394
I don't like your face.

205
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,230
I don't like the words
that come oozing out of your mouth.

206
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,151
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

207
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,653
So tell me, why are you here?

208
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,200
You can trust brienne.
Her onalty comes without charge.

209
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,998
You still have many friends
at court, your grace,

210
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,919
many who believe ned stark erred
by not supporting your claim.

211
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,548
Now I understand.

212
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:11,095
You know I have the numbers.
You know I'm marching on king's landing.

213
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,891
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

214
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,060
And your head.

215
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,104
I would give priority to my head.

216
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,860
I understand that you don't like me,
and while that saddens me greatly,

217
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,488
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

218
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,158
When you march on king's landing,

219
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,369
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

220
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,581
Open gates.

221
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,434
Your grace.

222
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,977
Lord baelish.

223
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,565
All of these tents look the same to me.

224
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,984
- Would you be so kind...
- It would be my pleasure.

225
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,445
It took me weeks
to learn my way around the camp.

226
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,949
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

227
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,078
And the moment I learn which tent is mine,
we're on the move again.

228
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,788
"Your tent"?

229
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,790
Not "our tent"?

230
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,962
The king snores, perhaps?
Or simply prefers solitude?

231
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,715
Pressures of command, no doubt.

232
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,134
Four kings vying for the throne.

233
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,387
I am not tutored in warfare,

234
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,307
but basic arithmetic
favors the side with the greater numbers.

235
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,311
If war were arithmetic,
the mathematicians would rule the world.

236
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,524
I did notice your brother
entering his grace's tentjust now.

237
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,734
The place of a kingsguard
is by the king's side.

238
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:53,114
And on the night of your wedding,
who was by the king's side then?

239
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,575
You seem quite interested in our marriage.

240
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,244
Your marriage is quite interesting.

241
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,122
Not only to me, but to the realm.

242
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:06,502
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest, if nothing else.

243
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,588
You've never married, have you?

244
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,009
I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

245
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,928
That is sad.

246
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,430
Though perhaps it's for the best.

247
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,515
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

248
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,517
so allow me to explain.

249
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,104
My husband is my king,
and my king is my husband.

250
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,692
Here is your tent, lord
baelish. Good night.

251
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,161
(Hoofbeats)

252
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,124
(Horse whinnies)

253
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,352
This isn't your horse.

254
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,315
It was given to me by the thirteen.

255
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,900
The elders of qarth.

256
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,276
Qarth?

257
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,863
Three days to the east, on the sea.

258
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,074
Will they let us in?

259
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,952
They said they would be honored
to receive the mother of dragons.

260
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,208
What do you know of this place?

261
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,337
Only that the desert around their walls
is called the garden of bones.

262
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,634
Every time the qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

263
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,260
the garden grows.

264
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,567
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

265
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,573
(Woman crying)

266
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,800
- (Woman screams)
- Man: Bring her about!

267
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,121
What kind of fire melts stone?

268
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,332
Dragon fire.

269
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,084
There's dragons here?

270
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,712
No, all the dragons are dead.

271
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,797
What's that smell?

272
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,467
Dead people.

273
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,511
Move.

274
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,106
Man: Please, please, no, no!

275
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,524
(Screaming)

276
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,823
(Sobbing) No.

277
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,245
(Screaming continues)

278
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,997
- (Screaming stops)
- (Chains rattle)

279
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,666
(Heavy thud)

280
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,877
Woman: He's dead.

281
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,881
He was my son.

282
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,677
My sister was three days ago.

283
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,514
My husband, the day before that.

284
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,101
They take someone every day?

285
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,022
Does anyone live?

286
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,832
(Thunder rumbling)

287
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,088
Arya: Joffrey.

288
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,508
Cersei.

289
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,760
Ilyn Payne.

290
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,553
The hound.

291
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,388
Joffrey.

292
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,933
Cersei.

293
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,602
Ilyn Payne.

294
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,437
The hound.

295
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,232
Joffrey. Cersei.

296
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,901
Ilyn Payne. The hound.

297
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,616
How dare you?

298
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,701
You may have heard false reports.

299
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,995
- You betrayed ned.
- Betrayed?

300
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,932
I wanted him to serve
as protector of the realm.

301
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,749
I begged him to seize the moment.

302
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,211
I trusted you. My husband trusted you.

303
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,090
And you repaid our faith with treachery.

304
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,299
- No, my lady.
- Get out!

305
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,801
Cat, I've...

306
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,137
I've loved you since I was a boy.

307
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,225
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance...

308
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,978
Have you lost your mind? Get out!

309
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,119
Do you want to see your girls again?

310
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,624
Sansa, more beautiful than ever?

311
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,753
And Arya, just as wild as ever?

312
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,464
You have Arya, too?

313
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,468
Both girls are healthy and safe.

314
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,054
For now.

315
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,933
But you know the queen
and you know Joffrey.

316
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,147
I fear for their longevity
if they remain in the capital.

317
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,122
(Knife clinks)

318
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,629
What do you want?

319
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,258
The lannisters will trade your daughters
for the kingslayer.

320
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,093
Of course they will.

321
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,554
Jaime Lannister for two girls?

322
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,890
Robb will never agree to those terms.

323
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,142
I'm not bringing these terms to him.

324
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,518
I'm bringing them to you.

325
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,271
You think I keep secrets from my son?

326
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,024
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

327
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,150
but he's not a mother.

328
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,028
Consider it, cat.

329
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,907
You may not get another chance.

330
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,830
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

331
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,708
A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.

332
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,046
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

333
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,298
is offered in good faith.

334
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,716
Good faith?

335
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,973
What's this?

336
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,796
Your husband was an honorable man.

337
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,300
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath winterfell.

338
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,433
- You may not believe...
- Get out.

339
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,040
(Groans)

340
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,424
(Men shouting)

341
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,134
Man: Get up, you dogs!

342
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,636
(Wood banging)

343
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,689
That's him, the one who picks.

344
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,650
The mountain.

345
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,405
What are you doing?

346
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,116
He told me he stares at him every day.

347
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,160
That's why he doesn't get picked.

348
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,853
You.

349
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,523
Man: Move, boy!

350
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,358
Move!

351
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,700
(Liquid trickling)

352
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,465
Tickler: Is there gold and silver
in the village?

353
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,465
- I don't know.
- Gems?

354
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,176
I didn't see any.

355
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,303
- Where is the brotherhood?
- I don't know.

356
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,979
(Rats squeaking)

357
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,114
- Tickler: Where is the brotherhood?
- I don't know. Please.

358
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,117
- Where is the brotherhood?
- I don't know.

359
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,287
- (Rat squeaking)
- (Whimpering)

360
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,791
Which of the villagers aided them?

361
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,585
- I don't know.
- Who?

362
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,467
- Who?
- I never saw.

363
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,261
- Who?
- I never saw.

364
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,681
Please. Please, stop.
Please, it's starting to...

365
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,017
- Who?
- I didn't see anyone help him.

366
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,226
(Rat shrieking)

367
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,270
Take it off! Take it off!

368
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,814
- Who helped him?
- Ganes, the butcher,

369
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,566
- and his son.
- That's better.

370
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,694
- You've been very helpful.
- No, stop, please!

371
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,280
What are you doing? Please, stop!

372
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,657
Please, stop! No! No!

373
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,118
I told you everything! No!

374
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,162
- No! (Screaming)
- (Rat clattering)

375
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,582
Arya: Joffrey.

376
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,335
Cersei.

377
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,338
Ilyn Payne. The hound.

378
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,007
Woman: Please, polliver. Some food.

379
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,551
Just a crust of bread.

380
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,180
(Woman crying)

381
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,265
Polliver.

382
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,643
The mountain.

383
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,413
Stannis: Lady stark, I had not thought
to find you in the stormlands.

384
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,500
I had not thought to be here, lord Stannis.

385
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,962
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

386
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,173
When I saw your
standard, I couldn't be sure.

387
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,759
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

388
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,764
I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.

389
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,350
Why is your stag on fire?

390
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,605
The king has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the lord of light.

391
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,693
Ah, you must be this fire priestess
we hear so much about.

392
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,903
Mmm, brother,

393
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,156
now I understand
why you found religion in your old age.

394
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,741
Watch yourself, renly.

395
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,868
Renly: No, no, I'm relieved.

396
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,205
I never really believed you were a fanatic.

397
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,166
Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,

398
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,043
but not a godly man.

399
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,838
You should kneel before your brother.

400
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,840
He's the lord's chosen,

401
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,217
born amidst salt and smoke.

402
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,136
Born amidst salt and smoke?

403
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,723
- Is he a ham?
- Stannis: That's twice I've warned you.

404
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,641
Listen to yourselves.

405
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,686
If you were sons of mine,
I would knock your heads together

406
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,398
and look you in a bedchamber until
you remembered that you were brothers.

407
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,109
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, lady stark.

408
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,820
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

409
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,905
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.

410
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,034
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

411
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,660
We share a common enemy.

412
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,580
The iron throne is mine by right.

413
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,750
All those that deny that are my foes.

414
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,338
The whole realm denies it,
from dorne to the wall.

415
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,173
Old men deny it with their death rattle

416
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,633
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

417
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,180
No one wants you for their king.

418
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,141
You never wanted any friends, brother.

419
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,560
But a man without friends
is a man without power.

420
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,775
For the sake of the mother who bore us, I
will give you this one night to reconsider.

421
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,363
Strike your banners,
come to me before dawn,

422
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,283
and I will Grant you
your old seat in the council.

423
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,286
I'll even name you my heir

424
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,622
until a son is born to me.

425
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,959
Othennise I shall destroy you.

426
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,673
Look across those fields, brother.

427
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,551
Can you see all those banners?

428
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,054
You think a few bolts of cloth
will make you king?

429
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,180
Renly: No.

430
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,393
The men holding those bolts of cloth
will make me king.

431
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,561
We shall see, renly.

432
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,814
Come the dawn, we shall see.

433
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,483
Look to your sins, lord renly.

434
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,652
The night is dark and full of terrors.

435
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,661
Would you believe I loved him once?

436
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,517
I thought we were welcome.

437
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,186
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

438
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,105
you might do the same, khaleesi.

439
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,859
Horde?

440
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,626
My name is Daenerys...

441
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,546
Daenerys stormborn of the house Targaryen.

442
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,756
You know me, my lord?

443
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,967
Only by reputation, khaleesi.

444
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,429
And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.

445
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,892
They call you the mother of dragons.

446
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,643
And what should I call you?

447
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,353
Oh, my name is quite long

448
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,106
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

449
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,193
I am simply a trader of spices.

450
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,613
But we are the thirteen,

451
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,617
charged with the governance
and protection of qarth,

452
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,828
the greatest city that ever was or will be.

453
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,750
- The beauty of quarth is legendary...
- Qarth.

454
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,795
Qarth.

455
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,423
Might we see the dragons?

456
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,348
My friend,

457
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,601
we have traveled very far.

458
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,895
We have no food, no water.

459
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,648
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored...

460
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,108
Forgive me, mother of dragons,

461
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,946
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

462
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,823
Some of my more skeptical friends

463
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,118
refuse to believe your children

464
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,204
even exist.

465
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,290
All we ask is the chance
to see for ourselves.

466
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,626
I am not a liar.

467
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,753
Oh, I don't think you are.

468
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,338
But as I've never met you before,

469
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,007
my opinion on the
matter is of limited value.

470
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,970
Where I come from,

471
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:20,976
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

472
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,354
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

473
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,064
We wish you well.

474
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,736
What are you doing?

475
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,155
You promised to receive me.

476
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,992
We have received you.

477
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,327
Here we are, and here you are.

478
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,540
If you do not let us
in, all of us will die.

479
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,001
Which we shall deeply regret.

480
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,588
But qarth did not become
the greatest city that ever was or will be

481
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,924
by letting Dothraki
savages through its gates.

482
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,434
Khaleesi, please be careful.

483
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,354
Thirteen!

484
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:13,528
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me

485
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,822
and destroy those who have wronged me.

486
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:20,493
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

487
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,914
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

488
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,211
You are a true Targaryen.

489
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,256
Only, as you said a moment ago,

490
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,759
if we don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

491
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,552
And so...

492
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:42,432
Retreating in fear from a little girl
is unbecoming of the greatest city

493
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,975
that ever was or will be.

494
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,646
The discussion is over, xaro xhoan daxos.

495
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,481
The thirteen have spoken.

496
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,733
I am one of the thirteen,

497
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,902
and I am still speaking.

498
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,238
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

499
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,241
and you would invite
her in for a cup of wine?

500
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,577
She is the mother of dragons.

501
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:07,916
Do you expect her to watch her
people starve without breathing fire?

502
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,710
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki

503
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,338
through our gates without dooming our city.

504
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,465
After all, here I am,

505
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,428
a savage from the summer isles,
and qarth still stands.

506
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,014
Our decision is final.

507
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,266
Very well.

508
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,854
I invoke soumai.

509
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:39,948
I will vouch for her, her people, and
her dragons, in accordance with the law.

510
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,289
Be it on your head.

511
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,460
Welcome to qarth, my lady.

512
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,428
Mountain: You.

513
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,648
Tickler: Is there gold or silver
in the village?

514
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,110
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the brotherhood?

515
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:00,904
I don't know what that is.

516
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,037
(Squeaking)

517
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,461
(Horses neigh)

518
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,395
Man: You two. Take lord
Lannister's things to his quarters.

519
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,272
What's this?

520
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,651
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, lord tywin.

521
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,736
(Chuckles) Evidently not.

522
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,549
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

523
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,909
Mountain: Cells are overflowing, my lord.

524
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,120
Polliver: This lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.

525
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,999
After we interrogate 'em, we usuallyjust...

526
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,838
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

527
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,006
able young bodies and skilled laborers?

528
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,269
You, do you have a trade?

529
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,105
Gendry: Smith, my lord.

530
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,942
What are you looking at? Kneel!

531
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,780
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

532
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,157
He'll do no such thing.

533
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,494
This one's a girl, you idiot,

534
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,621
dressed as a boy.

535
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,457
- Why?
- Safer to travel, my lord.

536
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,543
Smart.

537
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,587
More than I can say for this lot.

538
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,631
Get these prisoners to work.

539
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,966
Bring the girl.

540
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,427
I need a new cupbearer.

541
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,970
Mountain: My lord.

542
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,513
(Knocking on door)

543
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,479
Your visits are too few, cousin.

544
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,064
Her grace, the queen regent,

545
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,525
commands you to release
grand maester pycelle.

546
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,986
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

547
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,156
Will you take a cup with me?

548
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,159
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

549
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,495
I am here at her grace's behest,
not to drink with you, imp.

550
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,333
If my sister was so concerned for pycelle,

551
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,016
I would have thought she'd come herself.

552
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,588
Instead she sends you.
What am I to make of that?

553
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,423
I don't care what you make of it,

554
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,176
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

555
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,013
And you've received
these instructions directly from Cersei?

556
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,307
As I said several times.

557
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,185
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

558
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,819
When the queen regent gives me a command,
I carry it out without delay.

559
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,361
Cersei must have great trust in you,

560
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,032
allowing you into her chamber
during the hour of the wolf.

561
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,331
The queen regent has
a great many responsibilities.

562
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,916
She often works from dusk till dawn.

563
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,212
She must be very glad to have
you helping her from dusk till dawn.

564
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,174
Lavender oil.

565
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,677
She always loved
lavender oil, even as a girl.

566
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,261
I am a knight!

567
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,931
An anointed knight, yes.

568
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,894
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

569
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,564
What? Nothing to say?

570
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,775
No more warnings for me, ser?

571
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,578
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

572
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,239
Have you ever given any thought
to what king Joffrey will have to say

573
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,409
when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?

574
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,998
It's not my fault!

575
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,667
Did she take you against your will?

576
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,752
Can you not defend yourself, knight?

577
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,089
Your own father, lord tywin,
when I was named the king's squire,

578
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,216
he told me to obey her in everything.

579
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,176
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

580
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,263
I only meant I did as I was bid.

581
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,015
Hated every moment of it,

582
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,850
is that what you'll have me believe?

583
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,185
A high place in court, a knighthood,

584
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,521
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

585
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,773
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.

586
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,867
Wait here. His grace
will want to hear this.

587
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,904
- Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
- Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

588
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,574
My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
the queen.

589
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,367
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

590
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,620
- No, I think not.
- My lord?

591
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,497
You heard me.

592
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,629
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.

593
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,382
Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.

594
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,968
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

595
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,514
No one ever need know,
as long as you keep faith with me.

596
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,727
I want to know what Cersei is doing,

597
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:47,732
where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.

598
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,151
And you will tell me.

599
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,653
Yes, my lord, I will.

600
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,739
I swear it, as you command.

601
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,161
Oh, rise, rise.

602
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,623
Let us drink to our understanding.

603
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,250
Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.

604
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:11,047
Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful
woman, and it's all for the good of the realm.

605
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,633
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

606
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,760
that I want no more conflict between us

607
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,472
and that, henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.

608
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,807
But her demands?

609
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,476
Oh, I'll give her pycelle.

610
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,227
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

611
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,816
Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but I will not have him on the council.

612
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,735
I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

613
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,030
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

614
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,871
(Wood creaking)

615
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,128
Man: Stay within one table length.

616
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,717
Your grace.

617
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,559
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

618
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,731
Well, life's been good
since you hacked them off, your grace.

619
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,942
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

620
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,944
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

621
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,197
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

622
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,868
Never understood why you had to wear them.

623
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,746
It reminds me of where I come from
and where I am now.

624
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,790
It reminds me of yourjustice.

625
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,543
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

626
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,920
You were a hero and a smuggler.

627
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,593
A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad the good.

628
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,471
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

629
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,640
- Does he listen?
- To me?

630
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,975
Gods, no.

631
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,042
But if your red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest...

632
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,731
She has a name.

633
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,987
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

634
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,158
I've lived within the law for 17...

635
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,452
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

636
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,038
Any shore, any night.

637
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,998
What am I bringing ashore?

638
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,583
The red woman.

639
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,297
No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.

640
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,467
I am true to your grace and always will be,

641
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,678
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

642
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,473
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

643
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,505
Are you afraid, onion knight?

644
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,095
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

645
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,557
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

646
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,564
Are you a good man, ser davos seaworth?

647
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,026
I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.

648
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,822
If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

649
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,200
A man is good or he is evil.

650
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,160
- And which are you?
- Oh, good.

651
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,375
I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.

652
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,170
Well, that must be very nice for you.

653
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,440
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

654
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,359
Yet you have known other women.

655
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,194
Don't talk about my wife.

656
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,947
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.

657
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,367
Like me, ser davos.

658
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,498
You want me.

659
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,501
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

660
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,714
And you will.

661
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:31,057
Strange that this lord of light
asks you to work in the shadows.

662
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,436
Shadows cannot live in the dark, ser davos.

663
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,607
They are servants of
light, the children of fire.

664
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,944
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

665
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,572
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

666
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,409
They can't bar our passage.

667
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,166
Gods protect us.

668
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,877
There's only one god, ser davos,

669
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,547
and he only protects those who serve him.

670
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,715
(Gasps)

671
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,224
(Laughs)

672
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,350
(Gasps)

673
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,018
(Moaning)

674
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,230
(Groans)

675
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,121
(Screaming)

676
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,889
(Shrieking)

677
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,829
(Growls)
