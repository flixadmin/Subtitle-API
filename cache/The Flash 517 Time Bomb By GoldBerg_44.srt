160

How about now?

164

Well, if this new Cicada

165
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,980
even has traceable dark matter.

166
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980

numéro deux do things

167
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,320
that we've not seen before, right?

168
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,940
Yeah, I mean, he can dampen powers,

169
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,110
he can control the
dagger just like Dwyer,

170
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,520
but it's... I don't
know, it's also like...

171

Joe traced the file

There was a meta attack
here two years ago.

Two people died, and
the meta was never ID'd.

"Hey, sorry, Mommy has powers."

468

We all have to leave our lives behind.

469

They don't know about your powers?

Of course not. No one does.

You think I'm proud of this?

Okay. Listen to me very carefully.

484
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,850
I took a break from serial
killer kidnapper madness

485
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,110
to do something awesome.

486
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,030
So I decided on a new career path.

487
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,680
Photography was always my passion,

488
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,270
and I figured why not make it my job?

489
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,730
These are great, Kamilla.

490
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,550
I Peter Parker'd her.

491
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,840
Dibs, sidebar.

492
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,030
Sidebar?

493
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,790
Sidebar, now!

495
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,040
You have, uh... Peter Parker'd her.

496
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,580
Yeah, I mean, Kamilla
is a great photographer

497
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,140
and I thought she could start
taking some pictures for Iris,

498
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,230
and then maybe she'd start
to come around S.T.A.R. Labs.

499
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,760
I don't know, if we're lucky, get bitten

500
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,130
by something radioactive.

501

502
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,550
So, while you thought,
did it occur to you

503
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,150
that no one asked you to do this?

You don't think she'd
make a good Spider-Person?

506
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,890
You listen to me and you listen good,

510
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,920
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, you two!

511
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
You guys are getting

What's going on?

513
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,050
Your friend Iris was actually

514
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,760
just giving me a photography gig.

515
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,960
Well, it's small, but
Kamilla has agreed to shoot

the Fairway parade for
the "Citizen" this weekend.

I mean, they might get hurt or worse.

573

She's just trying to protect them.

I get that, I do, but...

575
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,310
I-I used to think that
keeping secrets from people

576
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,100
for their own good was a noble decision,

577
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,780
that it would protect them.

578
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,060
But when you do that,
you just rob those people

579

that little girl in there

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,350
grows up to be a

Why can't we just wake her up right now?

We tried before. It didn't work.

What about the meta
cure y'all cooked up?

We'd need Grace's consent.

642
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,530
Besides, Caitlin says that her condition

the time-traveling hamster ball,

646

that messes up the timeline?

Yeah, it would probably
just make things even worse.

Her mind.

650
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,360
It's exactly the same as the Cicada

651

Oh, my God, it's filled

Nora found out when she
went into Grace's mind

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,880
that Grace could hear
Dwyer, even in her coma...

656

She was listening.

657
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,510
She can carry out his words.

Her dark matter has some
sort of binding quality.

I think what makes her
powers different from Dwyer's

931
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,700
is that they came from
a wound in her head.

That's why she's so much stronger.

933
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,620
How was Nora able to see
what Grace was seeing?

934
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,690
Nora and Grace seem to
be psychically connected.

935
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,070
I think it's because of
the time that Nora spent

936
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,530
in Grace's brain.

937
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,950
- Is there any sign of her?
- No.

938
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,530
She definitely ghosted.

939
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,480
What about Vickie and her family?

940
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,300
Uh, federal protection.
They're gonna be fine.

941
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,970
They're getting new
identities as we speak.

942
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,210
I don't know about anyone else,

943
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,000
but I could use a drink.

944
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,900
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah, I'm in.

945
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,970
- You want me to call a sitter?
- Yeah.

946
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,300
Cisco, you want to bring Kamilla?

Nora.

Right?

957
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,640
She doesn't know where to start.

958
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,280
Difficult to know where to begin

959

everyone around you.

Sherloque, stop it.

962
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,020
Maybe start at the beginning.

963
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,510
It's a very good place to start.

964
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,430
When you first time-traveled.

as it crashed to Earth.

969
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,610
I think to myself, "Nope, nope.

970
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:00,650
This excessive action
doesn't make sense."

971
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,970
Until you understand that...
