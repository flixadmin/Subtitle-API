You were only born 10 minutes before me

19
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,841
and you think you'll be my older brother

you didn't even read my text.

161
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,748
-I'm here now, aren't I? Man.
-(laughs)

162
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,626
But isn't this place
overcrowded with people?

163
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,838
I don't really know,
but the three of you should figure it out.

164
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,590
-Sorry. Thank you and sorry!
-Hey, hey!

165
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,675
-Hey, hey, wait!
-Sooheon!

166
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,552
Oh, he's just going to leave?

167
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,345
-(laughs)
-(sighs)

168
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,390
(light music)

169
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,116
-Hmm?
-(laughs lightly)

170
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,660
-Hi, how are you?
-Sooheon, you're here. How are you?

171
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,704
This is for you.

172
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,165
I thought I told you
not to bring me anything.

173
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,917
Is everything okay with my mom?

174
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,502
Of course. She's doing well.

175
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,256
I'm sorry to bring this up,

176
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,841
but your account balance
is starting to add up quite a bit.

177
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,885
I'm so sorry.
I'll make a deposit as soon as possible.

178
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:55,845
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,181
The management is even
talking about discharging your mom, so...

180
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,434
I'm sorry.
I'll wire the money as soon as I can.

181
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,810
-I'll go get your mother then.
-(laughs lightly)

182
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,741
My boy!

183
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,034
Mom!

184
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,166
You came.

185
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,835
-How have you been?
-Good.

186
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,253
(laughs lightly)

187
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,006
-Mom, you look pretty today.
-(scoffs)

188
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,884
-You look handsome too.
-(soft chuckle)

189
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,762
-I've always been handsome, Mom.
-(laughs lightly)

190
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,222
Are you doing well in school?

191
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,767
Of course. I'm doing well in school.

192
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,728
Mom, do you sleep well at night?

193
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,104
Mm-hmm.

194
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,900
You don't have to visit me
so often anymore. Focus on your studies.

195
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,360
(inhales deeply)

196
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,196
I can't focus on my studies
unless I see that you're doing okay.

197
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,656
(laughs lightly)

198
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,368
Do you think you can get
into a good university next year?

199
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,577
Next year?

200
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,412
(inhales deeply)

201
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,248
Of course, of course.
I'll attend a good university next year.

202
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,501
Don't worry, Mom.

203
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,378
(both chuckle lightly)

204
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,854
(inhales deeply)

205
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,534

207
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,011
-WOMAN 1: Babe! Call the ambulance!
-MAN 1: What should we do? Oh, my god!

208
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,346
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!
Hurry up and call the ambulance!

209
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,473
-MAN 2: Are you okay?
-WOMAN 2: Are you okay? What should I do?

210
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,725
-MAN 3: What happened?
-WOMAN 2: Hey, are you okay?

211
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,643
WOMAN 1: Hey, hey!

-(Yoonji laughs)

214
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,909
Ta-da!

215
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,752
(laughs)
It's so pretty!

216
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,670
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

217
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,838
(quietly) Ah

218
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,301
-Chanmi, Thank you so much.
-Chanmi, Thank you so much.

219
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,595
Girls, I'm giving one to each of you
so that you don't fight.

220
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,888
-Okay.
-Okay.

221
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,640
-It's late, so hurry and get to bed.
-Good night.

222
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,517
-Good night.
-Yep. Good night.

223
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,733
(breathes deeply)

224
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,322

(Wonseok groans)

226
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,375
What's this?

227
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,511
(children shouting in distance)

228
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,637
Ah...

229
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,514
Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder,
put your hands on...

230
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,973
On each other's shoulders. There you go.

231
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,100
-(laughs lightly)
-I'm gonna take the picture, now smile.

232
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,478
-One, two, three.
-(camera shutter clicks)

233
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,022
Oh, and tilt your head a little...
There you go, nice.

234
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,316
-(laughs)
-Smile, oh wow, so pretty today!

235
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,693
-One, two, three.
-(camera shutter clicks)

236
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,403
Now, can you smile a little wider?

237
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,906
Yes, yes, now put your heads together.
Oh yeah, that's it.

238
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,784
Smile a little wider. One, two, three!

239
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,286
(sighs)
Chanmi, Chankyu.

240
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,956
Shoulders, put your arms
around each other, right, smile.

241
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,374
Here goes the last shot.

242
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,043
Can you smile a bit wider?
One, two, three.

243
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,587
(laughs)
Good.

244
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,756
(sighs in relief)

245
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,592
Should we say bye now?

246
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,594
Hey, Chankyu.

247
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,555
Bye-bye.

248
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,723
Goodbye, Chanmi.

249
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,853
Why do you have so little energy?
Aren't you supposed to be a guy?

250
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,314
Didn't we agree not to be sad?

251
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,650
(sobs)
I'm not sad.

252
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,860
(laughs lightly)

253
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,113
I'll see you in the army when we grow up.

254
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,783
Yeah, see you in the army.

255
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,663
Chankyu, let's go now.

256
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,459
(dramatic music)

257
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,800
Thank you.

258
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,303
Jiwon.

259
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,727
(sobbing)

260
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,569
Let's go, Wonseok.

261
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,280
(sobbing continues)

262
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,118
(breathes carefully)

263
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,205
-Hey Chanmi.
-Yes?

264
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,249
Can you pick one for me?

265
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,500
Ah...

266
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,170
CHANMI: Umm...

267
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,214
-I think this one's the best.
-Oh, this one?

268
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,507
What do you girls think?

269
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,176
-I like it.
-Me too.

270
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,013
All right, then I'll put this
in a frame that is pretty as Chanmi.

271
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,140
-Thank you.
-Oh yeah!

272
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,558
(all laugh)

273
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,518
They are an interesting bunch,
aren't they?

274
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,145
Chanmi, isn't it crazy how much
they're just like you and your brother?

275
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,022
Asking for the same photo and everything?

276
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,691
Do you guys share
a twin connection or something?

277
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,151
(laughs)

278
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,321
Oh, Jiwon,
I'm planning to go to Seoul tomorrow.

279
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,573
Are you going to meet Chankyu there
for your break?

280
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,450
-Yes.
-Okay then.

281
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,743
(laughs lightly)

282
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,801
YONGTAN HIGH SCHOOL

283
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,723
Oh, excuse me.

284
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,893
Do you happen to know Ok Chankyu?
He's a junior here.

285
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,061
Ok Chankyu?

286
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,521
Do we have someone
by that name in our grade?

287
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,814
Ok Chankyu?

288
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,233
(breathes cluelessly)
I'm not sure.

289
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,943
Oh, okay.

290
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,532
Oh, oh, wait, hold on.

291
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,992
I meant Park Wonseok.

292
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,119
Do you know Park Wonseok?

293
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,997
Park Wonseok? You must know him, right?

294
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,040
Why do you ask?

295
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,001
It's just that I can't seem to reach him.

296
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,169
I was thinking
that if he had any close friends,

297
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,546
I could contact him through them.

298
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,965
I'm not a stalker or anything.

299
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,302
I really can't get ahold of him.

300
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,804
Park Wonseok

301
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,932
is dead.

302
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,602
What?

303
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,605
(dramatic music)

304
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,610
Why is Chankyu

305
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,574
de... dead?

306
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,886

Hello? This is Hanseong Orphanage.

310
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,986
Oh, Ok Chankyu?
Yes, of course. I know him well.

311
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,863
Chankyu used to live with us here.

312
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,740
Why do you ask?

313
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,285
What?

314
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,622
What, what did you just say?

315
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,459
Chankyu is...

316
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,128
dead?

00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,682
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

321
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,477
Give us this day our daily bread.

322
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,730
And forgive us our trespasses

323
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,857
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

324
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,068
-Lead us not into temptation
-(sobs)

325
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,737
-(sniffles)
-But deliver us from evil

326
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:38,534
For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, forever and ever, amen.

327
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,119
Amen."

328
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,372
(sniffles)
Yes.

329
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,833
(sniffles)

330
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,851
(dramatic music)

331
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,522
(sobbing)

332
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,832
(sobbing continues)

333
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,012
SOONA: Thank you.

334
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,267
(Chanmi breathes heavily)

335
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,520
(sobs)

336
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,731
Are you his twin?

337
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,816
(sobs)
Yes?

338
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,193
(sighs)

339
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,779
Why are you only
just reaching out to me now?

340
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,451
(cries)
Why did my brother die?

341
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,454
Why did he commit suicide?

342
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,041
Young lady,
are you picking a fight with us?

343
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,209
Honey.

344
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,960
-(sniffles)
-Oh, Lord.

345
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,003
(sighs)

346
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,714
I had no idea you and Wonseok
were in touch.

347
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,382
While I was organizing Wonseok's things,

348
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,218
I saw the photo
that was taken of you guys in Busan.

349
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,427
So I called the nursery.

350
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,347
Yeah, Wonseok has never told us

351
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,308
that he kept in touch
with his twin sister, not even once.

352
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,769
(sighs)
That wasn't the only thing he was hiding.

353
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,980
He was seduced by the devil.
so he lived in sin.

354
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,110
Weren't you his parents?

355
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,697
How could you say about your dead son?

356
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,700
Don't you feel remorseful?

357
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,160
Do you not have any guilt?

358
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,788
If you have a bone to pick,
it should be directed at Wonseok.

359
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,165
-(sighs)
-Young lady.

360
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,251
Young lady.

361
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,836
Suicide

362
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,922
cannot be forgiven.

363
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,132
It's the worst sin.

364
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,135
We can't even pray to the saints
out of embarrassment!

365
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,597
(sniffles)
Are you even grieving at all?

366
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,057
How dare you!

367
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,475
(shaking)

368
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,353
(scoffs)
You ungrateful little...

369
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,688
-(clicks tongue)
-Let's go.

370
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,233
(sniffles)

371
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,484
(sighs)

372
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,820
Give me my brother's phone.

373
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,238
What?

374
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,032
-Give me the phone my brother was using.
-I don't have it.

375
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,701
-Ma'am!
-(grunts)

376
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,911
Give me the cellphone, give it to me!

377
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,579
(sobs)
Give me the cellphone now!

378
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,164
Hey, young lady!

379
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,208
How would we have the cell phone
if even the cops couldn't find it?

380
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,085
This brat has the nerve to show
no gratitude and cause a scene.

381
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,420
(sobbing)
Please, ma'am!

382
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,462
(breathes with incredulity)

383
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,589
Give me his cellphone, please.

384
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,174
-Father!
-I said give me the phone!

385
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,677
The cops couldn't even find it
at the scene!

386
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,138
(sighs)

387
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,432
(sniffles)

388
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,058
(sighs)

389
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,691
SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT 1

390
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:09,202
END SCHOOL VIOLENCE NOW

391
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,583
(sighs)

392
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,294
Uh, excuse me.

393
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,963
This case has been closed.

394
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,715
Two days
before you were transferred, ma'am.

395
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,967
I know. I'm just watching it.

396
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,011
Ah, so I guess being transferred
to the Special Victims Unit

397
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,179
after having been
in the Gang Intelligence Unit

398
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,972
has you bored already. Yeah, I guess so.

399
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,307
Aren't you going out for lunch?

400
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,227
Ms. Jin.

401
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,979
Do vegetarians really hate meat?

402
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,773
I want to eat it, but I'm resisting.

403
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,192
I totally get people who love meat.

404
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,526
Ah, I see.

405
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,987
In that case, I'll go out for a kill
and come right back.

406
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:44,988
(sighs)

407
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,115
(breathes curiously)

408
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,661
Who is she?

409
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,413
Oh. She insisted on meeting
the case manager.

410
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,374
She said she is the younger sister
of the student involved

411
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,668
in the Yongtan High School suicide case.

412
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,130
Yongtan High School? Younger sister?

413
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,715
Yes, that's right.

414
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,676
(inhales deeply)

415
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,096
Shall we take a seat here and talk?

416
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,311
I'm the case manager. What's the matter?

417
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,356
It wasn't...

418
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,192
a suicide.

419
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,403
He didn't commit suicide.

420
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,363
He would never.

421
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,989
He would never commit suicide.

422
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,409
What? What's this?

423
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,535
Hey, Park Wonseok was an only child
who attended Yongtan High School

424
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,953
and committed suicide.

425
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,038
What do you mean
you're his younger sister? Who are you?

426
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,582
I'm his twin.

427
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,336
He was adopted
by his family when we were 8 years old.

428
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,256
My name is Ok Chanmi.

429
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,925
I'm currently living
in Hansung Orphanage in Busan.

430
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,511
His name was Ok Chankyu
before he was adopted.

431
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,930
If it wasn't a suicide,

432
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,474
are you saying
that someone killed your brother?

433
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,310
On that day,

434
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,900
we had a normal video call
and even had plans to meet.

435
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,278
It's common for someone's
final conversation to go that way.

436
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,571
Detective,

437
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,197
my brother...

438
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,492
He's not the type to decide
something like that by himself

439
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,161
and not say anything to me.
Definitely not.

440
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,287
He's not that type of person.

441
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,123
Suicide cases are often impulsive

442
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,208
rather than planned.

443
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,334
No.

444
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,670
My brother is not that type of person.

445
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,880
(inhales deeply)

446
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,924
Ah...

447
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,134
What is it?

448
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,679
Hey, hold on a second.

449
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,556
Someone else was there that day.

450
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,851
Then soon after,
the video chat suddenly ended.

451
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,144
It's that person who ended the call.

452
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,605
Anyone can come in and out of a classroom.

453
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,941
Just because the call ended
doesn't mean someone killed your brother.

454
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,236
Young lady, even his parents accepted
the results of the police investigation

455
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,322
and the case was determined
to be a suicide.

456
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,950
Then where is my brother's cell phone?

457
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,204
That other person took it.

458
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,332
The person that was there. They took it.

459
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,709
I can understand you're frustrated
by this situation.

460
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,668
Detective.

461
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,462
I know

462
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,548
my brother.
(sobbing)

463
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,133
He's not the type of person
who would commit suicide.

464
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,426
We have to catch the suspect.

465
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,762
What are the police doing about this?

466
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,305
You sit there and you say you know
what people are like,

467
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,517
and that you know how it all turned out.
Don't be like that.

468
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,188
A dead person can't do anything
about this...

469
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,648
Go find the murderer.

470
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,359
You need to find the murderer!

471
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,281
(machine beeping)

472
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,421
NEUROSURGEON JEON INSEON

473
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,589
(breathes deeply)

474
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,632
(knocking)

475
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,217
(door opens)

476
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,718
Hello.

477
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,928
INSEON: Have a seat.

478
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,225
How are you feeling?

479
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,686
Are you in any pain
or feeling any discomfort anywhere?

480
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,396
No, I'm fine.

481
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,897
Why did I faint?

482
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,316
Please come back in a week
with your guardian.

483
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,819
I don't have anyone who can come with me.

484
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,655
My mother is in a nursing home right now.

485
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,118
You said you're a senior
in high school, right?

486
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,911
Your teacher can come with you.

487
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,996
Okay.

488
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,082
(gulps)

489
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,460
(dramatic music)

490
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,648
Ok Chankyu.

491
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,068
There's no way you would have jumped
from this high up.

492
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,612

Hello.

496
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,388
CUSTOMER: Hi.

497
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,349
Just a second.

498
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,602
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

THIS IS WOOSUNG HOSPITAL

502
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,196
WE ARE CONTACTING YOU
BECAUSE YOU DID NOT ATTEND

503
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,280
YOUR SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT.
PLEASE GIVE US A CALL.

504
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,953
(breathes tired)

505
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,206
I don't feel anything wrong though.

Huh?

508
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,889
It's not like I'm late.

509
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,392
Why isn't anyone here?

510
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,312
Good morning.

511
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,564
Chanmi, weren't you supposed
to go to Changwon?

512
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,482
Where?

513
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,860
The shooting team headed there at eight.
They already left on the bus.

514
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,029
-They said they were going to practice.
-I see...

515
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,990
-Have a good day.
-Oh, yes. You too.

516
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,076
(indistinct chatter)

517
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,960

519
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,231
Ahrim.

520
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,026
Don't feel bad for leaving me.

521
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,405
You have nothing to feel sorry about.

522
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:06,619
Why the hell did you suddenly say
you're moving to Seoul?

523
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,705
Hey, if you transfer now...

524
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,248
It'll be hard to get the score
in the group competition,

525
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,917
which will make it even harder
to get into college or get a job.

526
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,085
I get it.

527
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,963
I'm a traitor, right?

528
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,508
Why are you transferring as a senior,
you crazy fool?

529
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,178
Are you out of your mind?

530
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,597
Why are you doing this?

531
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,683
Come on. Get a grip!

so worked up? Huh?

00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,317
(grunts)

550
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,862

I'm sorry.

553
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,914
-Sooheon.
-Yes?

554
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,207
Why are you hitting him so hard

555
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,917
when he has a competition
the day after tomorrow?

556
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,377
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,171
-(breathes heavily)
-Hey, Sooheon, let's have a serious talk.

558
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,632
You should become one of my players.

559
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,678
-I'll make you a champion.
-Oh. No, it's okay. I'm good.

560
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,514
I just want to focus on my studies.
How many times do I have to tell you?

561
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,850
You suck at studying,
but you're always rejecting me anyway.

562
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,019
-So arrogant.
-(laughs)

563
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,607
Come on, dammit. Just give it
some thought while you're showering, okay?

564
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,692
What? You think I'm only asking
'cause I have nothing better to do?

565
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,902
Damn.

566
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,195

-(gasps)

570
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,125
Oh, hey, coach.

571
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,501
(sighs)

572
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,337
Do you really think the thief is going to
put a stolen scooter

573
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,588
on the second-hand market?

574
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,174
-It seems like he did?
-What?

575
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,929
See, this is mine. Look at this dent
and the scratch. They're the same as mine.

576
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,307
Wow, how ballsy. He actually put it up
for sale in this neighborhood.

577
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,433
(scoffs)

578
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,393
Co... Coach...

579
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,396
Can I borrow your bike?

580
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,565
Oh, uh, um, okay.

581
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,751
I sold the bike I was riding in Busan
for 300.000 won.

582
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,169
Could you give me a discount?

583
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,631
No negotiating.
I have a lot of buyers right now.

Hello.

592
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,032
Hello, is this the dorm?
I called you earlier today.

593
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,246
It's going to take me around 20 minutes.

594
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,373
Yes, I know.

595
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,582
(sighs)
What?

596
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,835
-Sounds good, I will see you there.
-Is this the thief?

597
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,628
Yeah, thanks.

598
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,135
Hey, hey, stop right there.

599
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,553
Where do you think you're going?

600
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,555
Get off.

601
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,223
Get off.

602
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,642
-What? Are you crazy?
-(scoffs)

603
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:44,022
Are you crazy? Get out of my way!

604
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,149
-I'll call the cops.
-Wow, this is my scooter.

605
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,985
Go ahead and open the storage box.
There's a skull sticker on it.

606
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,289
I just bought this with cash,
so now it's mine.

607
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,750
It's a stolen object so it's stolen goods.

608
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,293
You're a middleman for stolen goods.

609
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,879
-I mean, a middle woman.
-(scoffs)

610
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,006
That's some bullshit.

611
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,759
Hey, I just bought this with my money,
so it's mine.

612
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,344
If you feel like it's unfair,
go catch the thief.

613
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,721
If you bring me the money,
I'll give this back to you.

614
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,014
Words are not going to work with you.

615
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,224
Hey, let's call the cops then.

616

Why is it not working?

623
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,120
Crap.

00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,267
Is this your only luggage?

628
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,144
The rest is being sent from Busan.

629
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,145
You're from Busan?

630
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,605
Yes, I'm transferring.

631
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,815
Transferring?

632
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,359
I thought you were a college student.

633
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,277
-I don't accept high school students.
-Oh...

634
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,031
Um... I'm a transfer,
college transfer student.

635
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,366
(sheepish laugh)

636
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,952
Yes.

637
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,662
I am a high school student.

638
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,708
I promise I'll be super quiet.
No one will know I'm here.

639
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,210
I won't make a peep
and all I'll do is sleep.

(scoffs)

645
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,657
Selling the stolen item
and then stealing the same sold item?

646
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,409
Very creative, you conniving bastards.

647
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,246
Dammit!

648
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,585
(panting)

649
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,422

(groans)

656
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,035
Hey. Give me back the money
you made from selling my scooter.

657
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,161
(sneering)
I don't have it.

658
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,996
(groans)

659
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,081
I said I don't have it!

660
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,374
(groans)

661
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,001
-Now.
-Okay, okay. I'll give it to you.

662
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,044
Ugh.

663
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,296

672
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,310
Have you ever heard
of the term "lifesaver"?

673
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,104
I'm the saver and you're the life.

674
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,566
Let's just call it even.

675
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,487
I bought the scooter with my own money
and you just got your life saved.

676
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,697
(sighs)

677
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,784
-Thank you for saving me from that but...
-You got the better end of the deal.

678
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,869
Hey, wipe that water off. It's cold.

You again?

Hey, don't you...
you just knocked over someone.

Uh...

00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,768
It smells terrible. What should I do?

708
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,355
I'm not hurt, so you should go.

709
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,982
Don't be surprised
if you see me at school.

710

Hey, what are you doing?

726
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,606
This isn't a parking lot.

727
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,233
Excuse me? But...

728
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,736
He... I mean... he also parked here...

729
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,072
Oh!

730
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,032
-You're Sooheon's girlfriend, right?
-What?

731
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,201
You two must be very close,
wearing each other's jackets.

732
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,036
-Ah...
-Okay!

Hey, look at that.

737
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,640
What's that? She's wearing a male uniform.

738
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,643
I think she's new. She's crazy.

739
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,316
-Hey, look! It's Ji Sooheon's name tag.
-(Narin gasps)

740
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,775
Isn't this big news?

741
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,152
What's gonna happen to Kook Jihyun?

742
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,486
(scoffs)
I know, right?

743
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,198
Excuse me, do you know
how can I get to the shooting range?

744
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,036
Huh?

745
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,997
You can go this way.

746
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,165
Or you can go that way.

747
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,347
What? Some brat's
wearing Sooheon's uniform?

748
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,557
I think she just transferred.

749
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,893
She transferred during senior year?

750
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,604
That's not the problem right now.

751
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,190
The problem is
that she's wearing Ji Sooheon's uniform.

752
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,984
What's that brat's name?

753
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,447
It was Sooheon's name tag,
so I couldn't tell what her name was.

754
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,908
I mean...

755
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,745
if she just transferred,
how can she already be...

756
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,748
so close to Sooheon?

757
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,257
Chanmi.

758
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,176
It was tough to get you on the team

759
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,886
so make sure you work hard
and devote yourself to school

760
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,347
-and athletics until you graduate.
-Yes, coach.

761
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,640
-Captain?
-Yes.

762
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,642
-Make sure you help her adjust.
-(laughs lightly)

763
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,769
-Take her to the office first.
-Yes.

764
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,770
Let's go.

765
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,107
PROCEED WITHOUT HESITATION
TOWARD THE WORLD, YONGTAN HIGH...

766
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,281
Chanmi, are you good at shooting?

767
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,908
Oh, yes, somewhat...

768
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,785
Aw, come on.
You must be good if you're an athlete.

769
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,786
(inhales deeply)

770
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,705
When I was in the army,
I was an artilleryman.

771
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,666
Ever heard of K9?
155mm Self-propelled artillery.

00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,630
Well, I guess that wasn't so funny.
(breathes silently)

00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,174
(indistinct chatter)

775
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,552
Be quiet, quiet.

776
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,430
-(inhales deeply)
-Hey, that's her.

777
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,556
(whispering)
That's her! That's her!

778
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,016
All rise. Bow.

779
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,727
-Good morning.
-ALL: Good morning.

780
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,311
Let me introduce our transfer student.

781
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,605
As you can see,
Chanmi is a transfer student.

782
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,816
-Let's be good to her.
-Yes, sir.

783
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,901
-Chanmi, say hello.
-Ah...

784
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,613
I'm Ok Chanmi.
I am on the shooting team...

785
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,577
and I'm from Busan.

786
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,330
I don't know much about Seoul life
but I hope you'll be patient with me.

787
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,957
I look forward to getting to know you.

788
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,584
(applause)

789
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,545
Okay, Chanmi,
take a seat at the empty seat.

790
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,214
Good news.

791
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,468
Over the break, our very own Kook Jihyun
won the national essay contest.

792
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,510
A round of applause.

793
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,763
(applauds and exclaims)

794
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,765
Hey, Sooheon.

795
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,558
What happened to your uniform?
Did you sell it?

796
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,602
Do you like shaking things up in class?

797
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,937
I expect you to be on your best behavior
since you're a senior.

798
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,773
-What happened to your uniform?
-Uh, well...

799
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,609
-Here is Sooheon's uniform.
-Oh?

800
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,194
(all groan)

801
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,612
-STUDENT: What?
-NAKJUN: Why...

802
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,865
What the... why is... what is...

803
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,784
(all cheer)

804
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,456
-It's not true.
-STUDENT 2: They're dating!

805
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,832
What are you talking about?

806
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,375
Let's go!

807
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,627
What's going on?

808
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,046
(sighs)

809
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,714
JATAEK: Quiet, quiet, quiet!

810
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,341
Settle down now.

811
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,449
PRINCIPAL: Hello, welcome.

812
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,784
Hello, Principal.

813
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,079
Welcome, Jaebum.
I'm glad to see you again.

814
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,330
Ah.

815
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,790
-Hello.
-Hello.

816
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,083
Now, let's head in.

817
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,210
I'm Jaebum's teacher.

818
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,554
Jaebum said he's going to be
a senior again.

819
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,347
Since he made such a hard decision,

820
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,683
we'll do our best to assist him.

821
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,520
I had hoped he'd go straight to a college
in the United States

822
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,230
but this is what the doctors ordered,
so what else could we do?

823
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,690
Before the accident,

824
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,483
they said that going back to school
can bring back his memory.

825
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,152
So I guess we'll just have to trust them.

826
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,738
Jaebum also agreed.

827
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,408
-Osung will have to help him.
-Yes.

828
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,495
I've been close with Jaebum
for a long time, so no need to worry.

829
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,163
I'll help Jaebum with school,

830
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,583
and look after him
so that he doesn't have any difficulties.

831
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,960
(soft chuckle)
All right, Osung, I'll be counting on you.

832
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,754
Jaebum, if there's anything
Osung couldn't help you with

833
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,132
just let me know, okay?

834
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,175
(Principal laughs)

835
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,511
(sighing)
Oh, um...

836
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,054
I was supposed to graduate last year,

837
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,308
but I'm back as a senior.
Just think of me as one of your peers.

838
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,893
No need to treat me like an elder.

839
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,978
I would appreciate it if you just
treated me as a friendly classmate.

840
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,646
Nice to meet you all.

841
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,940
(applause, cheer)

842
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,113
All right. Shall we take attendance?

843
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,865
-Kang Younghun.
-Here.

844
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,366
-Gi Osung.
-Here.

845
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,535
Okay, Kim Seojun.

846
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,330
-Kim Seojun?
-Here.

847
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,665
-Kim Eunyoung.
-Here.

848
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,334
-Uh, Park Eunhye.
-Here.

849
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,085
Okay, Park Jimin.

850
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,879
I can see that you're here.

851
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,839
Jiwon is here.

852
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,507
-Bang Jinwon.
-Here.

853
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,800
Good.

854
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,304
(indistinct chatter)

855
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,525
CHANMI: <i>Chankyu couldn't make it
to his senior year.</i>

856
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,986
<i>If he were alive,</i>

857
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:13,241
<i>he would still be walking down
this hallway with the name Park Wonseok.</i>

858
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,080
(light music)

859
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,844
-Didn't mean to scare you.
-Didn't mean to get scared.

860
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,137
Let's go.

861
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,058
So you're not going to go to college?

862
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,685
I'm going to take
a marine officer test in the fall.

863
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,520
Oh, a soldier, I see.

864
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,562
If you get in, I guess that's
one less person to compete

865
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,772
against in terms of getting into college.

866
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,775
Hey, by any chance...

867
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,818
Yeah?

868
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,529
Did you know Park Wonseok?

869
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,364
Did you already hear
about Wonseok's death?

870
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,368
It must have been so shocking
for the people who were close to Wonseok.

871
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,620
If anyone were close to Wonseok,
it would be Hong Ajung.

872
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,998
She was his girlfriend.

873
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,925
Wow, she looks like a celebrity.

874
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,011
She's so pretty.

875
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,179
You happy?

876
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,389
What's her name?

877
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,433
Hong Ajung.

878
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,436
She's in my class this year,

879
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,812
but she didn't attend the first day
of school.

880
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,731
Can I have her number?

881
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,649
Phone number? You don't even know her.

882
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,026
Ah...

883
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,736
I heard she's a trainee
at an entertainment agency, right?

884
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,988
-I just want to ask her some questions.
-Yeah?

885
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,824
Okay, then.
I'll send you Hong Ajung's number.

886
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,341
Ah, sorry.

887
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,635
Where are you going?
The class is about start.

888
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,596
Shooting practice starts
during the 5th period.

889
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,475
-I'm off.
-Okay, then.

890
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,686
-Sooheon, where are you going?
-I got permission to leave early.

891
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,410
CAREER EXPLORATION CAMP

892
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,661
SEARCH

893
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,121
HONG AJUNG

894
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,586
Hello?

895
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,672
Hello?

896
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,007
Hello?

897
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,385
Why do people call then not say anything?

898
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,762
CALL

899
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,434
HONG AJUNG

900
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,231
What's wrong with this person?

901
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,900
What the...

902
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,903
Why does he have Hong Ajung's cellphone?

903
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,754
(light music)

904
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,688
(breathes quickly)

905
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,523

WOOSUNG HOSPITAL

907
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,922
The hospital?

908
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,842
Huh?

909
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,160
(breathes seriously)

910
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,297
INSEON: Mr. Ji.

911
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,382
Good afternoon.

912
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,383
You're finally here after I told you

913
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,635
I'll be calling your school
if you refuse to visit me.

914
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,345
(sighs)

915
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,181
Is it okay for us to talk here
rather than in the treatment room?

916
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,682
Okay, then. Take a seat.

917
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,568
Were you in any pain
while you were away from the hospital?

918
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,736
(inhales deeply)

919
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,946
I've been fine.

920
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,114
Though I did feel
a little bit of pain once.

921
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,366
You didn't come to the hospital

922
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,825
because you didn't want to hear
about your results, right?

923
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,161
(inhales deeply)

924
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,038
Mr. Ji.
(sighs)

925
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,790
Since you said you don't have a guardian,

926
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,917
I have no other option
but to tell you directly.

927
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,669
(inhales deeply)

928
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,129
Mr. Ji, the reason
why you suddenly fainted is

929
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,467
because you have a brain tumor.

930
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,679
(breathes nervously)

931
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,808
Brain...

932
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,727
tumor?

933
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,605
Yes, and it's a very dangerous one.

934
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,316
(gasps)

935
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,609
So...

936
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,196
do I need surgery?

937
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,698
You can't have surgery.

938
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,993
The location of the tumor
makes the surgery very dangerous.

939
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,371
So...

940
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,124
(shaking)

941
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,042
...what's going to happen to me?

942
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,420
We can't do anything right now.

943
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:01,631
We just have to hope
the tumor doesn't grow.

944
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,341
Will I...

945
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,595
die early?

946
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:11,683
-(sighs deeply)
-Doctor.

947
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,810
Please tell me the truth.

948
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,564
How much longer do I have to live?

949
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,358
Six months.

950
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,986
Or up to a year.

951
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,406
It is possible that you can live longer
with this condition.

952
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,704
(sighs)

953
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,004

00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,045
(engine rumbles)

957
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,677
-Hey, Chanmi.
-Yes?

958
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,139
Is something up with Sooheon these days?
I haven't seen him around.

959
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,598
Uh...

960
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,392
I...

961
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,185
I have no idea.

962
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,272
-I'm going to go now.
-Oh, okay.

963
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,737
(light music)

964
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,174
(sighs)

965
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,804

(clears throat)

971
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,351
<i>My older brother.</i>

972
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,686
<i>Older brother.</i>

973
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,981
<i>Older bro, older bro,
older bro, older bro!</i>

974
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,524
<i>-There. Are you satisfied?</i>
-(scoffs)

975
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,860
Tomorrow I start winter vacation,
so I'll come down to Busan on Sunday.

976
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,070
I have something I need to tell you.

977
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,905
Something you need to tell me?

978
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,032
What is it?

979
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,493
Uh... I'll tell you when we meet.

980
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,620
What is it?

981
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,497
Are you really going to leave me hanging?

982
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,332
Just give me a little clue.

983
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,334
-Oh, come on.
-Huh?

984
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,633
Hey, hold on a second.

985
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,928
(grunts)

986
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,471
Oh.

987
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,016
Did I scare you?

988
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,894
I didn't mean to.

989
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:07,979
Sorry.

990
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,064
Oh. No, it's okay. I'm good.

991
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,608
What are you doing here anyway?

992
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,444
You know, just...

993
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,239
-What about you?
-Oh.

994
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,452
I was reminded of this place
all of a sudden so I stopped by.

995
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,330
You know, before the break...

996
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,791
There was a kid
that committed suicide here.

997
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,794
He jumped off.

998
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,922
I was in the same class as him.

999
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,052
What...

1000
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,348
do you mean you were reminded
of this place?

1001
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,433
I thought of him today.

1002
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,561
I wasn't close to him.

1003
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,314
Park Wonseok.

1004
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,819
But I saw him fall off

1005
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,989
and I called the cops.

1006
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,085
(closing theme music)
