1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,160
Stop talking or I will break you.

2
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
-Bhumi, don't take him so seriously.
-He'll do something.

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,880
-He wants revenge...
-Relax.

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,480
What can he do to you in there?

5
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,160
Look at me.

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,040
Look at me.

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,280
I chose you.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,880
You were on traffic duty
and we were passing by.

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,560
I saw you...

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,560
I knew you had the caliber in you.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,240
You could do something big.

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,480
And I'm proud of what you have done.

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,040
But Bhumi, this is just the beginning.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You have a long way to go.
I have a feeling.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,680
Sir, it's good to hear all this,
but I know...

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,600
I never say anything for the sake of it.

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,680
There will be nonsensical talk
during the interrogation.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,040
So, what are we going to do?

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,040
Run away each time?

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,920
What did the lady constable tell you?
Just ignore these things.

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,760
You have got to be strong.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,880
And confident too.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,240
You can't let him scare you.
Rather you scare him.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,560
Control him.

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
Look him in the fucking eye!

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,000
Then we'll see
how he speaks all that rubbish.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,600
I'll go in first,
you follow after a minute

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,080
and start again with confidence.

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000
Come.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,680
Stay in your limits, you bastard.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,360
Where is the base of this operation?

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,560
-Your question is too weak...
-Hey! You better answer me now!

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,640
Since you asked me
the question so strongly,

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
I'll answer you with equal strength.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,320
Listen up now, cocaine and heroin...

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,240
Cocaine is imported from South America
and heroin from Central Asia.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Both enter India through different paths.

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,240
However, currently this business
is not well established.

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
We have a plan to set it up.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
After five years of research,
we discovered that

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,440
in India, Mumbai is the best
possible city for this business.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,640
We have not one but 12 warehouses here.

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
I will give you all the addresses.

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,480
And this is because
you asked me a question, darling.

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,960
You give all those addresses
to Fernandez Sir.

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,320
Ask him to go and check.

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,680
First check them, then I'll tell you more.

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,720
Tell Fernandez Sir...

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,440
Tell him that Sasya is his friend.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Tell him, Sasya said this.

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,360
What?

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
What are you staring at?

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
No one has ever looked at you
the way I do.

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,040
Hey, this is a police station.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,920
You are under police custody.
Think before you talk.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,320
Your looks are quite ordinary.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,960
You don't look very special.
I have better looking girls than you.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,160
You are no match in front of them.

59
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,560
But yet, there's some inside you.

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
I can't take my eyes off you.

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,080
Must be that scorpion inside you.

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
I can feel the heat of its venom.

63
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,040
-Shut your mouth.
-I definitely feel it.

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,320
Shut your mouth, understand?

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
I don't know about other men.
Don't they feel it?

66
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,440
Look, don't get personal with me.

67
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
Personal?

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Being a cop, you came disguised
as a slut the other day.

69
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,920
But what happened between us was personal.

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
Do you remember?

71
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
I do.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,080
Nothing of it was personal.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
It was my duty.

74
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,760
I was right there.

75
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
You too were there.

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,880
I know everything.

77
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,560
Come on, interrogate me.
Why aren't you interrogating me?

78
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,400
Fernandez Sir is here too.

79
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,600
Ask me questions, I'm waiting since long.

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,200
<i>I have lots to say today.</i>

81
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
<i>Let's continue.</i>

82
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
<i>Now, I'll just give you a name.</i>

83
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,120
Nayak.

84
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,760
We call him Nayakudu in our language,
which means a leader.

85
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,560
Cops assume that it's just a name.

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,120
A myth.

87
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,680
People wonder whether he is for real.

88
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,440
Because cops have never seen his face.

89
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,760
But trust me...

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,920
Nayak does exist.

91
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
We all follow him.

92
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,080
He doesn't meet many people.

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
Many don't even have a clue

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
that they work for Nayak.

95
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,360
The entire plan is in his mind. He doesn't
tell anyone the complete plan, for safety.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,880
He tells us only on a need-to-know basis.

97
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
I'm special to him, so he tells me a lot.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,360
Now you're special to me,
so I'm telling you.

99
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,560
<i>Sweetheart, do you remember Karwar,
five years ago?</i>

100
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,240
<i>Corpses, murders, arms smuggling...</i>

101
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,080
<i>That was all a part of Nayak's plan.</i>

102
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,960
{\an8}<i>Since then he has been spreading
his web of narcotics.</i>

103
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
{\an8}<i>He has been fooling the cops
for a long time.</i>

104
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,080
{\an8}<i>Who is Nayak?</i>

105
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,320
We've come across the name - Nayak,
but have no specific proofs.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,640
{\an8}<i>The entire police unit
got their hands on a few explosives,</i>

107
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,440
<i>got happy, clicked photographs,
selfies, praised each other.</i>

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,600
<i>And he fled right under your noses.</i>

109
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,160
Besides...

110
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,840
I don't work for Nayak anymore.

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,240
I work for you now.

112
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,440
If you plan well...

113
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,320
Maybe, you will get Nayak.

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,800
Deep, check whether the entire
conversation is recorded clearly.

115
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,280
-Sir, he is the same Nayak...
-What?

116
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,200
-Nothing, sir.
-I'll have to inform Mathur sir.

117
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,480
Double check the recording.

118
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,560
Leena, I want the transcript
in ten minutes. I'm coming back.

119
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,560
Bhumi, good job!

120
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,440
Even you want to finish
what we started right?

121
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,600
What nonsense.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,840
What to finish?

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
Darling, don't be so furious.

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,600
-Quiet!
-Your nerves are tense.

125
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,040
Your blood is boiling,
but you've been cold for a long time.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,320
-Has it been too long since you had sex?
-If you say one more word...

127
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,520
You don't recognize yourself.

128
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,760
You don't even know
of the scorpion inside you.

129
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,280
Ask me about it.

130
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,280
I have touched it...

131
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,520
Since long
I am trying to woo you like a lover.

132
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
But you don't seem to budge.

133
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,360
At first, I was alone in this story.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,800
Then you entered.

135
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
Now it's you and me.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
So, we will meet someday.

137
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,200
Then I will give you...

138
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,560
what you actually need.

139
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,160
What you desperately need.

140
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,280
REAY ROAD POLICE STATION

141
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,360
-Bhumi.
-Yes, sir.

142
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
There are orders from the headquarters.

143
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,000
They have asked us
to relieve you from duty.

144
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,560
What do you mean?

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,120
It means,
you have to leave the police station.

146
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,640
Why?

147
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,480
These are orders from headquarters.
I don't know anything.

148
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,160
Sir, I have some work pending...

149
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,960
I suggest... go and apologize.

150
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,040
And continue the interrogation.

151
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
You are also blaming me,
as if it's my mistake.

152
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,800
Don't you understand this world yet?

153
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,760
Besides, what did Sasya say
that made you forget you're on duty?

154
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,280
He was saying the wrong things.

155
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,320
I am a woman, right?

156
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,480
-So, he was trying to overpower me.
-Woman!

157
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,600
These days the woman in you
is coming out very strongly.

158
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
What on earth is wrong with you?

159
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,680
What is wrong with me?

160
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,680
I am the same.

161
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,240
All this new planning
has ruined everything.

162
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,160
Disguise as an escort, wear revealing
clothes, go in front of perverts...

163
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,000
Everything was smooth earlier.

164
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,120
Maintaining the police register,
keeping record of our refreshments,

165
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,160
standing under the hot sun
for traffic duty...

166
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,960
Do you call this smooth?

167
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,560
Everything is going good now,
just like in a film.

168
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,840
Going in a disguise,
tricking a criminal...

169
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,160
That too, an international criminal.
It's so thrilling.

170
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,600
And, you were looking so gorgeous.
I couldn't recognize you.

171
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
Now the film is over,

172
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,960
Now what?

173
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,800
Quell your pride and apologize.

174
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,240
Didn't you see how they threw you
out of the police station?

175
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,920
What will you do without a job?

176
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,200
Excuse me!
You aren't allowed to go inside.

177
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,120
Bhumika Pardeshi, senior constable,
Reay Road Police station.

178
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,680
I need to go for the interrogation.

179
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,320
Your name isn't there on the list.

180
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,040
I am with Fernandez Sir.

181
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,680
He is the one to cut your name.

182
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,960
Sorry.

183
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,120
I want to meet him.

184
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,800
He is busy.

185
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,440
Fine, I will wait for him.

186
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,080
He will stay busy for a long time.

187
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
Then I will wait for a long time.

188
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,720
Yes, sir.

189
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Wait! You can't just barge inside!

190
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
I'll call you back.

191
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
What are you doing?

192
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,120
Sir, I want to come back on this case.

193
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,560
For the interrogation.
I will do properly now.

194
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,400
No need now.

195
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,960
You may leave.

196
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,880
Sir, I am sorry. Please.

197
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,640
All this happened quite suddenly,

198
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I was shaken a bit.
But I won't make mistakes anymore.

199
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,960
Bhumi, I am looking at you, but my mind
is occupied with something else.

200
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,800
Do you understand?

201
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,400
Are you worked up?

202
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,760
-No.
-You should be.

203
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,720
Hemant told me what you did.

204
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,480
You have a problem with me
then talk to me.

205
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,400
You'll raid my boyfriend's hotel
and scare him?

206
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,880
You will use your uniform
to your advantage?

207
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,320
You're worried that he'd complain, right?

208
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,960
No, I'm not worried about that.

209
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,360
Then what is it?

210
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,440
I don't know whether I have a job or not.

211
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,440
What do you mean?

212
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,200
I guess they are firing me.

213
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,720
Oh, gosh! How can they do that?

214
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,080
Bhumi, what's the matter?
Did you do something?

215
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,440
-Nothing...
-So how can they fire you?

216
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,840
It's a government job.

217
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,920
No, I mean, I'm just afraid.

218
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,000
They aren't firing me.

219
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,440
You just said that.

220
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,680
Just for the heck of it...
you forget about it.

221
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,560
If you're fired, how will we pay the rent?

222
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,240
Hey...

223
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,640
that won't happen.

224
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,040
-Don't worry.
-What will we do?

225
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,040
Rupa...

226
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
since you were asking,
I just told you what I was thinking

227
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,560
without giving it a thought.

228
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,600
Don't say such things. Just don't.

229
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,160
I won't ask you anything.

230
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,280
Firstly, we need to get you
divorced from that rascal Lokhande.

231
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,040
Darn it!
Your husband has turned us homeless.

232
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,560
You go back to sleep.

233
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,280
Go to sleep.

234
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Sir, Bhumi is calling.

235
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Just cut it.

236
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,680
I know.

237
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,240
Just tell her we are busy.

238
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
Just look at her, Fernandez.

239
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,600
Do you think
she's capable of facing Nayak?

240
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,040
Sir, that's all she has to do.

241
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
We will support her.
We'll be her brains and hands.

242
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,120
You can't be with her at all times,
Fernandez!

243
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,080
There will be a time when
she will be all alone with those guys.

244
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,320
With Nayak.

245
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
That's the hope, sir.

246
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,920
If this hope turns into reality,
what will she do?

247
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,280
Sir, I'm sorry, but we're not
just risking Bhumi's life here,

248
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,520
all the lives in India are at risk
if their plan is successful

249
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
and Mumbai becomes the new drug capital.

250
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
How will their plan be successful?

251
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,480
You have Sasya's information with you.
Just use it.

252
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,760
Sir, all the information
is in Nayak's head.

253
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
He doesn't tell Sasya everything.

254
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Sasya is telling us everything he knows,

255
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,560
but that's not all. There's much more.

256
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,560
Sir, Sasya trusts her completely.

257
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,080
He is quite certain
that Nayak will like her.

258
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,440
She is his type.

259
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,360
Why this covert operation with a spy?

260
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,160
Sir, to begin with, how will we
find out whether he's Nayak or not?

261
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,880
-Sasya will tell you.
-No, sir.

262
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,280
We can't blindly trust Sasya.

263
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,120
And we have no report
on Nayak's appearance.

264
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,520
That is why the way we verified
Sasya's identity with her help,

265
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,960
the same way
we will identify Nayak's identity.

266
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,160
Secondly...

267
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,600
if we arrest Nayak,
all his operations will stop.

268
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,560
All the activities and people
that are related to this operation

269
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,080
will remain hidden.

270
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,680
So, what I suggest is,

271
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
let's locate Nayak first,

272
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,600
then track all his activities with the
help of high caliber secret surveillance.

273
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,760
That means,
the girl's task is to identify Nayak...

274
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,680
No, sir.

275
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,520
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay. Carry on.

276
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,240
Sir, if Bhumi invades
Nayak's personal space...

277
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,680
Only if Nayak trusts this girl...

278
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,720
Then Bhumi will bring us that information
from Nayak that none of his men know.

279
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,600
Personally, I feel this plan is too weak.

280
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,240
And we cannot afford to have
a repeat of Karwar here.

281
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,160
Exactly, sir.

282
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,120
There was no covert operation

283
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
or information breakthrough
in the Karwar case.

284
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,240
And in Sasya's case as well,
we weren't very hopeful Sir.

285
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
But because of Bhumi,
he is in our custody today.

286
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,920
We were lucky in Sasya's operation.

287
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,880
But we can't rely on luck all the time.

288
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,280
{\an8}BHARATI GAWDE

289
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,200
Sorry.

290
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
I will come back tomorrow.

291
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,320
So don't apologize now, do it tomorrow.

292
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,120
You've been coming here since three days.
It's of no use.

293
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
We've received orders from seniors,

294
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,480
You won't get the permission to go inside.

295
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,680
But I have nothing else to do, right?

296
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,760
And I can't stay at home.

297
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
They get worried when I don't go to work.

298
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So, coming here and sitting is my work.

299
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,200
Actually, I'm the one who is sorry.

300
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,120
Sorry.

301
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
What else do I say now?

302
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
Even then you did...

303
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,040
You spoke to me. Thank you.

304
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
I'm sitting here since the past six hours.
Nobody spoke to me.

305
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,280
Come on, hurry up.

306
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,560
FAMILY COURT, MUMBAI

307
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
Hey, Rupa...

308
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
are you taking some medicines?

309
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,600
From where did you get this glow on you?

310
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,840
You should be the one to take medicine,
for control.

311
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,560
And...

312
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,800
you're not yet divorced and
you're flirting with your sister-in-law?

313
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,560
That too, inside the court.

314
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,440
So, will the police arrest me for that?

315
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
Greetings, sir!

316
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,160
Sir please explain it to her

317
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,840
that praising someone is not illegal.

318
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,720
Lokhande, let's end this right now.

319
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,000
We are getting divorced.

320
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,120
So don't talk rubbish before the judge.

321
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,600
Else he'll ask even more questions,
the case will continue for long.

322
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,960
The lawyer will fill his pockets.

323
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,440
It won't help us in anyway.

324
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,120
Do you understand?

325
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,520
Come on.

326
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,600
Ajay Khanna, Binita Khanna.

327
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,400
Ritesh Kerkar, Mansi Kerkar.

328
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,080
Why wasn't your client present for the
previous hearing? We kept waiting for him.

329
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,760
I was confused back then.

330
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,280
I am clear now.

331
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,280
And I don't want to pay any alimony.

332
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,560
What is he saying?

333
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
It was already decided,
written in the agreement.

334
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,000
-What is the problem now?
-She has a problem.

335
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,800
I've been betrayed.

336
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,240
-Look...
-She's not worthy of being a wife!

337
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,560
-Why?
-Why?

338
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,120
Sir, what do you say? Should we tell them?

339
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,480
-One minute...
-Don't touch me!

340
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,240
Listen to me.

341
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,200
-Come out for a minute. Please.
-Why?

342
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,320
Whatever you want to say,
say it right here.

343
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,480
Karman Sheikh, Laila Sheikh.

344
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
Anil Dalve, Sunita Dalve.

345
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,360
Listen, let's talk in private
for two minutes.

346
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Anything for you.

347
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,480
Come on.

348
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,120
What is the use of saying
all this now, Lokhande?

349
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,560
What do you want?

350
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,760
And why do you keep blabbering
she's not fit to be a wife?

351
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,120
-How is she not fit?
-The way you are perfect.

352
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,000
Lokhande, I'm ready
to reduce the alimony amount...

353
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,040
No more alimony!

354
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,880
Okay, let's make it half
of the original amount.

355
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,840
I will open the agreement on my phone

356
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,000
and make it official right now.

357
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,960
-If you give me your sister, then maybe.
-I don't believe this!

358
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,200
-I have to leave!
-What?

359
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,120
I got a call from work.

360
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,600
He's already here, the judge
will summon us in ten minutes.

361
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,840
-I got a call from work.
-Tell them you're busy.

362
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,960
It's urgent. I will have to leave now.

363
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,480
-How can you... Bhumi?
-I'll be back.

364
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,600
It must be a high profile case,
that's why they want the best cop!

365
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,240
-Fernandez...
-Fifth floor.

366
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,280
Thank you.

367
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,520
-Sir, this...
-Sit!

368
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,920
You have to take this psychometric test.

369
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,680
Tick the right answers

370
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,680
and explain in detail
wherever it's needed.

371
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,000
Sir, what is this test for?

372
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,440
I don't know anything.

373
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,200
Don't ask me any questions.

374
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm doing what I've been told.

375
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,440
You have...
one hour to complete this test.

376
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,640
Your time starts... now!

377
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,920

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,920
I had no idea what it was. Some...

398
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,800
psychometric test...

399
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,880
I've not even heard about it.

400
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Come here.

401
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,160
Mhatre, just hold on.

402
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,200
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,760
Were you staring at me?

404
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,120
I'm a waiter. That's my job.

405
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,560
If someone wants something.

406
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm not asking about others,
I'm talking about myself.

407
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,840
Mhatre, I'll call you later.

408

Were you staring or not?

409

Stare all you want.

410
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,480
Excuse me.

411
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,520
Where's the toilet?

412
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,800
It's there.

413
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,400
Come on.

414
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,760

Now?

416
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,160
Anything?

417
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Touch it.

418
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,840
Touch it.
