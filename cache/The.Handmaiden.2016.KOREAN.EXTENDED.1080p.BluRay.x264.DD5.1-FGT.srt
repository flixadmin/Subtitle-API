1
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:37,155
You little brats, beat it!

2
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,305
Hey!

3
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,472
It should have been me!

4
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:26,386
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

5
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:30,146
You'll miss the train.

6
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,345
Hurry.

7
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:45,071
PART ONE

8
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,072
Kouzuki Noriaki

9
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,947
Go back to sleep.

10
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,191
We're still far from the house.

11
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,185
Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.

12
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:08,227
This property has three buildings.

13
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:10,392
A Western-style wing by
an English architect

14
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,468
and a Japanese wing form the main house.

15
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:17,550
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining two styles.

16
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:24,194
It reflects Master's
admiration for Japan and England.

17
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,109
Next is the annex

18
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:30,109
which Master had furnished as a library.

19
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,669
Last, the servants' quarters.

20
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:34,390
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

21
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:37,066
You may eat her leftover food,

22
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,426
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

23
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,105
Used soap is for the steward.

24
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,950
Anyone caught pilfering
is expelled that day.

25
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,266
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

26
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:48,945
Huh.

27
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:53,708
"Tamako" is you.
Your name Okju in Japanese.

28
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:56,469
We live in the Japanese style here.

29
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:00,385
Speak Japanese to the Master and Lady.

30
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,744
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

31
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:10,666
I don't trust new servants.

32
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:12,832
Even if they make a good impression,

33
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:17,148
if the house burns down, they'll
run away with a manuscript.

34
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:23,073
The Lady's routine is simple.

35
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:27,348
Taking a walk, or reading for Master.

36
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:32,589
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

37
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,548
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

38
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:38,833
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

39
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,070
In such a home,

40
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:45,033
you know what's expected
of a maid like you?

41
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:51,151
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

42
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,545
I sleep in here?

43
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:22,348
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

44
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:24,275
She's behind this door?

45
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:25,345
Shh!

46
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:25,870
Mother!

47
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:27,469
Ah!

48
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:32,349
Mother!

49
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:34,549
Mother!

50
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,745
Miss!

51
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:39,912
Miss, are you all right?

52
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,268
Junko! Is that you?

53
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:46,625
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

54
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:49,270
Seems you had a bad dream.

55
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,749
You see that big cherry tree?

56
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:57,224
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

57
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:00,712
Sometimes on moonless nights,

58
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,548
my aunt's ghost

59
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:06,231
dangles from that branch.

60
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,593
Here, drink up.

61
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:29,748
When babies cry, my auntie
feeds them a spoonful of sake.

62
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:38,389
<i>Sweet bird, sweet bird</i>

63
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:42,108
<i>My sweet bluebird</i>

64
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:52,191
<i>What scent is this that fills my nose?</i>

65
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,427
- What?
- Coming back from the toilet,

66
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,428
I saw a light going down the hallway.

67
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:00,908
That's it! They're meeting in her room.

68
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:05,515
Or else it's the ghost
of the cherry tree?

69
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:23,025
Those fuckers.

70
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:27,234
This is Tamako.

71
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:30,115
I am at your service. Miss...

72
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:46,393
A reference letter
from Lady Minami, my last mistress.

73
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:53,035
So is this place to your liking?

74
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:58,029
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

75
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:00,152
Uncle won't permit it.

76
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:03,835
Sunlight causes books to fade.

77
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:07,475
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

78
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:15,151
Not a good liar, are you?

79
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:20,187
We look a bit alike.

80
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:22,628
Are you also an orphan?

81
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,235
- Uh...
- I'll take my leave.

82
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:32,074
Whereas in my case,
my aunt and Mrs. Sasaki

83
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:35,751
showed me how the love
of a mother...

84
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:38,904
isn't worth a thing.

85
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:52,312
My head aches
before every reading practice.

86
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:56,589
Would you read it to me?

87
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,711
Pardon?

88
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:09,835
Oh, how kind of her.

89
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:13,625
Lady Minami said such
nice things about me!

90
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:15,274
Is that so?

91
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:23,105
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

92
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,665
I'm sick of it.

93
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:28,033
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

94
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,311
So read that for me.

95
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:45,550
"Dear Miss lzumi Hideko,

96
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:50,468
"Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

97
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:53,025
"Maids are like

98
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:55,033
"a spoon..." No...

99
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:58,668
"Are like chopsticks..."

100
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:05,111
Is it a spoon?

101
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,671
I don't know how to read, Miss.

102
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,989
Not at all? What about Korean?

103
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,828
This is your name.

104
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,628
Can't you read it?

105
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,786
Reading can be learned,

106
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,585
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

107
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:11,344
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

108
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,074
Yes, Miss.

109
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:21,115
My mom.

110
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:26,149
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

111
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:29,349
And me? Am I "quite the charmer"?

112
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,185
Everyone says I can't compare to my mother.

113
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:41,065
Count Fujiwara said...

114
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,667
So you've met the Count?

115
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:45,106
Pardon?

116
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:47,346
No, I never met him...

117
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:50,873
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

118
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,345
She was his nanny.

119
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,025
What did the Count say about me?

120
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,911
He said your face...

121
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:02,912
Every night in bed he
thinks of your assets...

122
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:04,549
Your face.

123
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,795
Why in bed, I wonder?

124
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,073
What's with your foot?

125
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:23,994
I've nowhere to go.

126
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:28,108
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea at age five.

127
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:34,224
But in new shoes,
even well-trodden paths feel fresh.

128
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:36,391
The ones from here

129
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,785
up to here should fit you.

130
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:45,830
Why not the prettiest ones?
Like these?

131
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:50,472
Time for reading practice.

132
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,635
I'll go alone.

133
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,706
Miss? But rain is falling.

134
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:14,427
At noon, come knock on the door.

135
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:15,945
Promise?

136
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:20,589
See you at...

137
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,110
What's this?

138
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:45,149
My new handmaiden.

139
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:47,984
The snake, the snake!

140
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:56,189
You mustn't pass that point.

141
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:58,868
Be warned!

142
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:02,434
The snake marks the bounds of knowledge.

143
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:20,751
He has the habit of licking his plume
when he thinks,

144
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,946
otherwise he's someone clean.

145
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:27,747
What kind of servant would
hog the umbrella like you?

146
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:28,826
Pardon?

147
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,385
Miss!

148
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:39,111
Miss!

149
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:47,626
<i>These books make me sink.</i>

150
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:51,866
They bore me to death.

151
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:54,946
Do you read so many books?

152
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:57,954
You'll become a professor
in no time then.

153
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:10,347
I'm sorry.

154
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:12,394
I won't do it again.

155
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,145
Pardon.

156
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,349
The Count?

157
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:41,150
Today?

158
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:47,195
That's why you insisted on a bath.

159
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:49,915
My aunt, when she heard
a guest was coming,

160
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,227
dropped everything
and bathed her baby, Miss.

161
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:58,266
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised her baby's scent.

162
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:02,672
You are my baby, Miss.

163
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:06,874
Auntie gave the babies candy during baths.

164
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,595
To teach them that bath time is sweet.

165
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,394
What's wrong?

166
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,430
One of my teeth is sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

167
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,032
<i>So this was the scent.</i>

168
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:03,988
All smooth.

169
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:20,993
Welcome, sir!

170
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:34,314
You are too kind to greet me
this way upon my arrival,

171
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:37,752
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

172
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,464
Now your tedium is over.

173
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:43,948
I'll ensure your painting lessons
are stimulating.

174
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:48,310
This must be Okju.

175
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:50,905
At your service, milord.

176
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:56,029
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

177
00:22:57,824 --> 00:23:00,828
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

178
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:05,430
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

179
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,110
Thank you for your recommendation.

180
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:12,952
You chose a perfect servant for me.

181
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:19,031
You wouldn't want one who's too stupid.
I did my best.

182
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:23,187
Take good care of our dear Lady.

183
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:25,545
Take this.

184
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:48,954
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

185
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:52,625
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

186
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:04,353
- Did you call for me, milord?
- You may enter.

187
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:46,392
Do you think you can fool me with this?

188
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:48,034
Who do you take me for?

189
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:58,185
<i>You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.</i>

190
00:24:58,224 --> 00:25:01,592
<i>But my real name's Nam Sookee.</i>

191
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:07,990
<i>Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.</i>

192
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:12,194
<i>I was able at age five
to tell a real coin from a fake.</i>

193
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:15,434
<i>Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,</i>

194
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:19,230
<i>and studied pickpocketing from Kutan,</i>

195
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:23,431
<i>but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.</i>

196
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:26,311
<i>Abandoned as newborns,</i>

197
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:29,752
<i>we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.</i>

198
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:31,993
<i>Such meaningful work.</i>

199
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:36,586
<i>Instead of starving, they grow up
gentlemen and ladies.</i>

200
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:42,475
<i>Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.</i>

201
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:47,431
<i>I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.</i>

202
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:58,314
Milord!

203
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:31,746
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

204
00:26:32,664 --> 00:26:37,875
who bribed his way into
translating for high officials.

205
00:26:38,224 --> 00:26:42,354
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

206
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:46,428
Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.

207
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:49,392
So he gets naturalized,

208
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:53,706
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

209
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:58,029
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

210
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:02,350
Ba... Bas...

211
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:08,145
Bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

212
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:13,830
He invites Japanese
collectors to his library,

213
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:18,188
holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.

214
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:21,154
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

215
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,113
but he can't help parting with a few.

216
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:26,751
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

217
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:28,713
He sells a fake.

218
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:36,994
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

219
00:27:37,064 --> 00:27:39,066
Unlike him, this specialist

220
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:41,948
is a real Japanese, of noble birth!

221
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,953
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

222
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:51,546
So, who is this?

223
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:55,794
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

224
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:59,709
- You'll seduce her...
- Is she pretty?

225
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,748
The Jap wife died ages
ago with no children.

226
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:07,832
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

227
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:09,354
performs those book readings.

228
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:10,550
But is she pretty?

229
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:13,875
An orphan. Her father was rich.

230
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:17,835
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

231
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:20,027
After marrying her there,

232
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:24,348
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

233
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:26,512
and lock her up in a madhouse.

234
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:27,825
Right!

235
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:35,833
Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid, eavesdrop on her,

236
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:42,075
stay by her side and gently
persuade her to fall in love.

237
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:43,511
<i>Love?</i>

238
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,585
<i>What does a crook know about love?</i>

239
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:55,193
What of her fortune? She's rich?

240
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:59,675
Each night in bed
I think of her assets.

241
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:03,074
1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.

242
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,546
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

243
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:13,384
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

244
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,391
To his wife's niece?

245
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:17,710
What a sick...

246
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:19,269
Right, a sick fuck.

247
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,231
So what's our share?

248
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:26,628
I'll share 50,000.

249
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,712
Sookee gets the dresses and jewelry.

250
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,586
I'll do it! Take me!

251
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:35,066
My Japanese is better,
and I worked as a maid!

252
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:50,308
On top of the fifty,

253
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:56,309
I get dresses, jewelry and my own 100,000.

254
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,593
B- b-beautiful!

255
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:04,668
I'm flummoxed in your presence!

256
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:09,228
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

257
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:12,105
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

258
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:14,073
and then they'll open up to you, all right?

259
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:16,835
Watch how to make your face blush:

260
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:20,830
Breathe in deep and
squeeze your stomach tight,

261
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:23,988
lower your chin
and contract your asshole,

262
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,545
don't breath, and swallow
your saliva ten times.

263
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:27,991
Got it?

264
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:29,826
Go ahead.

265
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,227
The blue kimono
with the white peonies,

266
00:30:48,384 --> 00:30:50,785
or the black one with
the drawings of cranes?

267
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,864
The shit-colored one with caterpillars,

268
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:57,311
or the caterpillar-colored one
with drawings of shit?

269
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:58,545
Don't ask her opinion!

270
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:01,264
Questions make her think.

271
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:04,225
You're the one who should be
thinking for her!

272
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:07,274
That's how you dominate your mistress,
got it?

273
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:08,825
Yes.

274
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,744
This is the letter. Listen closely.

275
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,667
"Dear Miss lzumi Hideko,

276
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:25,785
"Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

277
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,427
"Maids are like chopsticks."

278
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:33,748
"You hardly notice them, but their
absence plunges you into disarray."

279
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:39,949
Did my morn cry before they hanged her?

280
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:41,908
Women who steal once

281
00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:47,071
and are hanged always cry.

282
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:49,113
They even cry a lot.

283
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:54,795
Your mother stole a thousand times,

284
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:58,949
was caught just once, and died once.

285
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:01,955
Did she cry?

286
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:08,153
She laughed.

287
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:11,190
Said she was lucky to
have you before dying.

288
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:14,315
That she had no regrets.

289
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:19,988
Imagine what a good
thief you'll become!

290
00:32:31,864 --> 00:32:34,151
It should have been me!

291
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:38,751
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

292
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:41,346
What a pity...

293
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:54,466
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo.

294
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:57,988
How you'll be an even
greater thief than your mom. Hmm?

295
00:32:58,464 --> 00:33:00,910
Who believes the talk of a swindler?

296
00:33:02,824 --> 00:33:06,226
When I give the signal,
"fully ripe",

297
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,386
arrange for her and I to be alone.

298
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:10,387
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

299
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:14,708
She's so naive,
even if a man pulls on her nipples

300
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,115
she won't know what he wants.

301
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:22,506
So it's your job to tell her
that everything is because of me.

302
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:26,115
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

303
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:28,909
your toenails are growing much faster!"

304
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:32,351
That sort of thing, all right?

305
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:35,074
Here, a gift.

306
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,475
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

307
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:53,873
<i>That'll be mine when
she goes to the madhouse.</i>

308
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:58,026
<i>It pains my heart to see this poor girl.</i>

309
00:33:58,064 --> 00:34:01,068
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

310
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:06,708
Let's take a look...

311
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:12,144
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

312
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:17,748
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive, too.

313
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:19,989
How do you know...

314
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:25,267
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

315
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,514
But it's fine!

316
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:29,148
No need to be ashamed at all.

317
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:31,750
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

318
00:34:31,824 --> 00:34:33,394
Is that so?

319
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:50,588
<i>Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,</i>

320
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,591
<i>has anything been this pretty?</i>

321
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:58,275
<i>I'd like to show her to the people at home.</i>

322
00:34:59,424 --> 00:35:00,505
<i>What would they say?</i>

323
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:04,834
<i>Probably this?</i>

324
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:08,985
Mesmerizing!

325
00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:13,035
Spellbindingly beautiful!

326
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,710
<i>He's shameless.</i>

327
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:29,589
The Count kept pushing wine on me.

328
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:37,505
<i>Does it feel okay?</i>

329
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:42,026
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

330
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,235
You think this is suffocating?

331
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,152
Miss, you're killing me!

332
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:54,434
Dressed up,
you look like a lady, too.

333
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,873
I think I know

334
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,346
what the Count meant.

335
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,828
Your face...

336
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:11,033
Each night in bed,

337
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:14,192
I think of your face.

338
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:19,228
Don't be silly, Miss.

339
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:30,195
<i>Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.</i>

340
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:35,227
<i>All these buttons are for my amusement.</i>

341
00:36:36,104 --> 00:36:38,869
<i>If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,</i>

342
00:36:40,224 --> 00:36:43,512
<i>then, the sweet things within,</i>

343
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,035
<i>those sweet and soft things...</i>

344
00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:53,672
<i>if I were still a pickpocket,
I'd slip my hand inside...</i>

345
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,226
Miss, are you truly
going to marry your uncle?

346
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:38,473
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

347
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:41,431
There's a famous collector in France.

348
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,832
He'll be putting his entire library
up for auction.

349
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:47,868
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

350
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:54,110
If it were me, I'd sell books
to buy gold, not the opposite.

351
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:59,313
Did you ever think of
marrying someone else?

352
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:01,785
- Count Fujiwara for example...
- You!

353
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,788
You're quite curious for a servant.

354
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:33,471
<i>For now,</i>

355
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:38,786
<i>the Lady needn't go read to the sick fuck
who wants to marry his wife's niece.</i>

356
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:45,551
<i>Instead the fake Count goes
to the library to make fake books.</i>

357
00:38:48,904 --> 00:38:52,750
<i>The Lady waits for her 2:00 art class,</i>

358
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:54,229
<i>and waits...</i>

359
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,791
<i>Poor girl,</i>

360
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:01,674
<i>losing her heart to a fake.</i>

361
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:37,395
<i>Please, Count!</i>

362
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,035
Sorry to be late.

363
00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:33,871
It's no matter.

364
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:46,468
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality?

365
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,070
Dimensionality, perhaps.

366
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:53,115
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

367
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:56,944
As if you see directly
into an object's essence.

368
00:40:57,384 --> 00:41:02,515
For example, the fact that this
peach contains a lot of water.

369
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:05,070
I hesitate to stand before you,

370
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:07,755
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

371
00:41:22,544 --> 00:41:24,467
That's enough for today.

372
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,269
Almost fully ripe.

373
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:34,705
<i>Already?</i>

374
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,345
<i>Damn...</i>

375
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:45,630
Do you know what?

376
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:49,345
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown ï¬‚ushed.

377
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:50,431
Have they?

378
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:59,635
How did your mom die?

379
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:05,950
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

380
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:09,955
- I mean, she hanged...
- Hanged herself? Like my aunt.

381
00:42:10,504 --> 00:42:12,472
Well, pretty much.

382
00:42:20,064 --> 00:42:24,513
Still, while alive she hugged you a lot?

383
00:42:28,824 --> 00:42:32,795
My mother died giving birth to me.

384
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:40,788
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

385
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:45,474
I wish I'd never been born.

386
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:52,633
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

387
00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:55,551
If your mother thought
you could understand,

388
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:58,150
this is what she'd have said.

389
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:03,115
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

390
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:05,352
That she had no regrets.

391
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:14,191
Wait here a moment, Miss.

392
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:16,191
I'll go pick mushrooms.

393
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:21,514
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

394
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:23,308
I'll go with you.

395
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,634
I'll be quick.

396
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:27,994
Before it rains.

397
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:38,231
Good girl...

398
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:45,435
What a coincidence.

399
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:46,991
Indeed.

400
00:43:47,464 --> 00:43:49,068
May I sit by you?

401
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:19,074
<i>The lady sits, shy and trembling.</i>

402
00:44:19,104 --> 00:44:21,789
<i>The gentleman is persistent.</i>

403
00:44:22,464 --> 00:44:26,469
<i>The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.</i>

404
00:44:27,544 --> 00:44:29,512
<i>All is well, Sookee.</i>

405
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:33,667
<i>Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.</i>

406
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:36,510
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

407
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:44,755
You know servants can't use this entrance!

408
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:54,265
Hey!

409
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:02,235
<i>I wish I'd never come here.</i>

410
00:45:05,104 --> 00:45:07,106
<i>It was wrong to come.</i>

411
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:11,908
Tamako,
you brought watercolors, right?

412
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:14,427
Of course, milord!

413
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:15,954
Watercolor paints and brushes...

414
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:18,066
Go and get the oils.

415
00:45:18,184 --> 00:45:21,711
A day like this demands oils, yes!

416
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:45,825
Shit!

417
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,234
Lady.

418
00:45:54,144 --> 00:45:55,794
Milord.

419
00:46:09,744 --> 00:46:11,189
Lady.

420
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:34,785
A blackout! Bring a lantern.

421
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:56,389
<i>I need to think.</i>

422
00:46:57,184 --> 00:46:59,391
<i>I need to become rich,</i>

423
00:46:59,424 --> 00:47:03,986
<i>sail off to a distant harbor,
eat food I scarcely recognize,</i>

424
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:07,107
<i>buy my fill of glittering baubles,</i>

425
00:47:07,184 --> 00:47:09,186
<i>and not think of Hideko.</i>

426
00:47:10,384 --> 00:47:12,512
<i>Never think of Hideko...</i>

427
00:47:40,184 --> 00:47:42,710
I returned
and you didn't even come to me?

428
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:46,388
It was late, I must have slept.
My apologies.

429
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:50,834
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

430
00:47:51,624 --> 00:47:55,026
Must I remove makeup
and change clothes all by myself?

431
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:58,470
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

432
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:25,952
He proposed to me.

433
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:30,788
Next full moon,

434
00:48:31,904 --> 00:48:36,626
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

435
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:40,946
What did you say?

436
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:45,467
I said I wasn't sure.

437
00:48:45,504 --> 00:48:46,551
Why?

438
00:48:47,144 --> 00:48:48,634
I'm scared.

439
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,267
Of your uncle's anger?

440
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:55,032
Of the Count.

441
00:48:56,624 --> 00:48:59,628
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

442
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:04,828
I don't know, I just feel it.

443
00:49:08,224 --> 00:49:11,273
Like the reflex of pulling
your hand from a flame.

444
00:49:14,664 --> 00:49:16,666
Tell me...

445
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,785
What is it that men want?

446
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:31,185
Pardon?

447
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:36,224
I mean, after getting married,
at night...

448
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,714
How would I know?
I'm practically a child.

449
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:46,789
With no mother. No one here to...

450
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:53,705
First,

451
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:57,788
I guess they'd kiss?

452
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:01,990
And then?

453
00:50:04,024 --> 00:50:05,788
They hug each other.

454
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:07,709
Standing up?

455
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:11,793
When there's no bed or
they have to be quick.

456
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:14,788
Normally one does it on a bed.

457
00:50:15,704 --> 00:50:19,629
Let yourself go without thinking.
It'll work itself out.

458
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:21,024
Without thinking?

459
00:50:24,704 --> 00:50:29,585
Are there girls who feel nothing

460
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,994
like how blind people don't see?

461
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:37,673
<i>What the hell.</i>

462
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:40,145
<i>I'll show her one thing,
then put her to bed.</i>

463
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:43,545
<i>Poor thing,</i>

464
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:50,433
<i>alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,</i>

465
00:50:50,944 --> 00:50:53,675
<i>without learning a single useful skill.</i>

466
00:51:11,224 --> 00:51:13,704
<i>Why does the candy taste different?</i>

467
00:51:14,944 --> 00:51:18,153
<i>The bitter turned sour,</i>

468
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:21,706
<i>the sour turned sweet,</i>

469
00:51:21,784 --> 00:51:25,266
<i>the sweet turned savory...</i>

470
00:51:25,384 --> 00:51:27,352
How do you know all this?

471
00:51:28,384 --> 00:51:30,432
You must have experience?

472
00:51:32,704 --> 00:51:35,469
My friend Kutan taught me.

473
00:51:36,424 --> 00:51:38,472
Taught you? In words?

474
00:51:39,064 --> 00:51:41,112
Yes, only in words.

475
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,586
So this is how it feels.

476
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:05,275
That's what you will feel for the Count.

477
00:52:06,504 --> 00:52:07,505
Really?

478
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,788
The Count, truly...

479
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:15,554
He won't think he's
making love to a corpse?

480
00:52:17,664 --> 00:52:19,826
You know about my cold hands and feet.

481
00:52:20,664 --> 00:52:21,665
Really?

482
00:52:22,584 --> 00:52:23,631
Here.

483
00:52:32,144 --> 00:52:33,873
Feels just fine.

484
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:35,505
You like it?

485
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:40,427
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

486
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:48,755
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

487
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:50,585
And then...

488
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:59,547
It's so cute.

489
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:04,306
If the Count sees this...

490
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:17,348
Will he really be so tender as this?

491
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:19,464
Of course.

492
00:53:19,504 --> 00:53:22,553
And he'll touch you like this.

493
00:53:22,584 --> 00:53:24,586
And like this...

494
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:30,554
Keep doing it like the Count would.

495
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:36,034
And this is what he'll say.

496
00:53:38,784 --> 00:53:41,788
It's so soft, warm,

497
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:45,786
wet, and

498
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:50,747
spellbindingly beautiful!

499
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:13,025
<i>Okju.</i>

500
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,588
<i>Hideko.</i>

501
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:22,944
<i>Mommy.</i>

502
00:54:24,624 --> 00:54:26,786
<i>Daddy.</i>

503
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:31,155
Now, the model must stay still.

504
00:54:31,984 --> 00:54:35,511
Okju.

505
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:42,913
- Hideko...
- Wait.

506
00:54:43,304 --> 00:54:44,590
Stop!

507
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:49,464
<i>Leave Hideko alone.</i>

508
00:54:51,144 --> 00:54:52,270
Stop it!

509
00:54:52,304 --> 00:54:53,385
I can't do this.

510
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,148
Come here, Tamako.

511
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:04,514
Find some other job to do.

512
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:06,268
You catch my meaning?

513
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:17,912
I've no other job to do.

514
00:55:17,944 --> 00:55:21,232
My job is to look after the Lady.

515
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:35,793
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

516
00:55:35,824 --> 00:55:37,826
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

517
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:39,514
If I miss this fortnight, I'm finished!

518
00:55:41,064 --> 00:55:43,385
Can you feel it? How much I want it?

519
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:48,072
After fighting so hard to escape
my garbage heap of a life,

520
00:55:48,504 --> 00:55:51,713
you think I'll let you
fuck it up, you bitch?

521
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:57,230
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

522
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:00,911
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

523
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:05,308
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman...

524
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:06,391
Sookee.

525
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:08,671
Think of your family at home.

526
00:56:08,944 --> 00:56:12,790
Boksun raising babies with her bad back,
and those two halfwits.

527
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:15,435
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

528
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:17,427
Want to shit on your mother's legend?

529
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:19,705
You should go home in glory.

530
00:56:24,784 --> 00:56:28,470
So don't push Hideko too hard.

531
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:29,830
She's got no one on this earth.

532
00:56:29,904 --> 00:56:33,625
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

533
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:37,595
And please...

534
00:56:39,304 --> 00:56:44,708
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

535
00:56:53,184 --> 00:56:54,265
Oh, my.

536
00:56:54,824 --> 00:56:58,112
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

537
00:56:58,184 --> 00:56:59,993
How curious.

538
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:04,955
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

539
00:57:05,984 --> 00:57:09,227
How many ships sail on the wide sea...

540
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:12,310
People leaving, people returning,

541
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:15,355
those saying "Farewell" or "Welcome back."

542
00:57:15,424 --> 00:57:17,870
What's the farthest you've traveled?

543
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:19,514
The hill beyond the manor?

544
00:57:25,784 --> 00:57:30,187
My uncle would follow me
to the ends of the Earth.

545
00:57:32,584 --> 00:57:35,064
I've always lived like this.

546
00:57:37,304 --> 00:57:41,514
I could be content here,
if you were with me.

547
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:49,388
We go for walks
wearing new shoes,

548
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:51,393
you tell me stories,

549
00:57:53,464 --> 00:57:57,469
and you massage my feet like that.

550
00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:01,752
You're fortunate, Miss.

551
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:06,115
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

552
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:08,112
That's rare.

553
00:58:08,744 --> 00:58:12,749
But I'm not sure if I love him.

554
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:15,834
You do love him.

555
00:58:19,144 --> 00:58:20,669
How do you know?

556
00:58:22,384 --> 00:58:24,751
You stare out the window all day.

557
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:27,746
Turn in your sleep and sigh.

558
00:58:30,464 --> 00:58:31,829
And your toenails.

559
00:58:31,864 --> 00:58:33,946
Even if I say I don't love him,

560
00:58:34,824 --> 00:58:37,828
if I say that I love someone else...

561
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:43,429
Me, who has no one on this earth...

562
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:46,909
Do you still want me to marry him?

563
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:52,466
You will love him.

564
00:59:07,464 --> 00:59:08,795
Miss!

565
00:59:56,104 --> 00:59:57,105
<i>In the end,</i>

566
00:59:57,144 --> 01:00:01,354
<i>Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I come to Japan, too.</i>

567
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:04,235
<i>The Count, after feigning
annoyance for a bit,</i>

568
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:06,068
<i>nodded his head.</i>

569
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:09,632
<i>On the day her uncle
left to visit his mine,</i>

570
01:00:09,744 --> 01:00:14,193
<i>the Count pretended to go back
to Japan and hid nearby.</i>

571
01:00:27,384 --> 01:00:30,388
You'll have a week of freedom,

572
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:35,552
but always remember the basement.

573
01:01:21,504 --> 01:01:23,108
Miss!

574
01:02:23,984 --> 01:02:30,435
<i>Thank you for traveling on our ferry today.</i>

575
01:02:30,824 --> 01:02:36,274
<i>We will arrive at Shimonoseki at 7:30 p.m.</i>

576
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:45,034
Finally we're going home.

577
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:46,829
It's been three years...

578
01:04:09,264 --> 01:04:11,312
To not steal...

579
01:04:11,864 --> 01:04:13,354
To not steal...

580
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:15,315
To not commit adultery...

581
01:04:15,664 --> 01:04:17,746
To not commit adultery...

582
01:04:18,504 --> 01:04:20,313
To not lie...

583
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:22,706
To not lie...

584
01:05:59,424 --> 01:06:04,464
<i>Spider web around in my waist</i>

585
01:06:04,784 --> 01:06:09,233
<i>Strumming makes a zither sing</i>

586
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:12,668
<i>Thousand woes</i>

587
01:06:19,744 --> 01:06:26,389
<i>Under the blue sky
Only the crows cry</i>

588
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:35,307
<i>How sorrowful my zither
My beloved zither</i>

589
01:06:46,144 --> 01:06:48,226
Did you sleep well?

590
01:06:58,424 --> 01:06:59,471
Excuse me.

591
01:07:00,064 --> 01:07:01,111
Sorry.

592
01:07:06,424 --> 01:07:09,587
<i>The Count paid the innkeeper to spy on us,</i>

593
01:07:09,704 --> 01:07:11,547
<i>afraid we might run off.</i>

594
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:14,874
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

595
01:07:17,384 --> 01:07:19,068
<i>Things are moving too slowly.</i>

596
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:22,313
<i>I fear Hideko might truly go mad.</i>

597
01:07:23,384 --> 01:07:25,591
Shall we play maid, like before?

598
01:07:29,064 --> 01:07:33,274
<i>From morning to night
we see no sign of the Count.</i>

599
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:37,229
<i>Certifying the marriage
and converting the inheritance to cash</i>

600
01:07:37,264 --> 01:07:39,266
<i>require much work, he says.</i>

601
01:08:17,984 --> 01:08:19,873
How cruel can you be?

602
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:23,226
You plucked the ï¬‚ower, now re-plant it.

603
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:25,266
What do you want?

604
01:08:25,424 --> 01:08:29,349
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

605
01:09:03,304 --> 01:09:05,272
<i>A week here...</i>

606
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:17,073
<i>Then finally...</i>

607
01:10:03,744 --> 01:10:05,155
This way.

608
01:10:11,464 --> 01:10:14,035
There are the doctors,
you know what to say!

609
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:30,469
Who is that person?

610
01:10:31,304 --> 01:10:33,193
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

611
01:10:33,264 --> 01:10:36,268
Her maiden name was lzumi Hideko.

612
01:10:37,624 --> 01:10:39,194
And who might you be?

613
01:10:39,584 --> 01:10:41,154
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

614
01:10:41,744 --> 01:10:43,906
- Your name?
- My name is Tamako.

615
01:10:45,144 --> 01:10:48,512
Then, what kind of treatment

616
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:51,150
do you believe your Lady requires?

617
01:11:05,744 --> 01:11:08,987
She should be confined in a place

618
01:11:09,024 --> 01:11:14,986
where no one can harm her,
and where she can do no harm.

619
01:11:19,584 --> 01:11:24,511
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

620
01:11:41,104 --> 01:11:43,072
Almost there. Good work.

621
01:11:45,304 --> 01:11:47,193
Don't be frightened.

622
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:24,626
Good day, Countess.

623
01:12:25,264 --> 01:12:26,789
Do you remember me?

624
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:31,710
Countess?

625
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,071
What is this?

626
01:12:42,464 --> 01:12:45,308
We mean you no harm, Countess.

627
01:12:45,744 --> 01:12:47,826
We're going to look after you.

628
01:12:49,024 --> 01:12:52,949
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

629
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:55,791
Tell them, Your Lordship!

630
01:12:57,024 --> 01:13:01,074
She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.

631
01:13:02,464 --> 01:13:05,946
It's because her nanny was Korean.

632
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:09,429
You scoundrel!

633
01:13:09,944 --> 01:13:12,185
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

634
01:13:12,224 --> 01:13:15,671
We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.

635
01:13:15,744 --> 01:13:16,791
Miss!

636
01:13:21,544 --> 01:13:25,549
My poor Lady, she's gone nutty.

637
01:13:26,864 --> 01:13:29,185
If it's any help,

638
01:13:29,224 --> 01:13:34,071
this is from her mother,
and she used to cherish it

639
01:13:35,584 --> 01:13:37,791
before going mad.

640
01:13:41,864 --> 01:13:44,549
Such a considerate maid.

641
01:13:46,584 --> 01:13:49,633
<i>You thought Hideko a lamb.</i>

642
01:13:50,584 --> 01:13:52,473
<i>Lamb, my arse.</i>

643
01:13:53,904 --> 01:13:57,590
<i>I tell you, right from the start,
Miss lzumi Hideko</i>

644
01:14:00,264 --> 01:14:02,585
<i>had always been...</i>

645
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:03,991
Miss!

646
01:14:04,864 --> 01:14:06,354
<i>...a rotten bitch.</i>

647
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:14,303
PART TWO

648
01:14:14,304 --> 01:14:15,465
PART TWO I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

649
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:18,035
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

650
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:27,746
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

651
01:14:30,784 --> 01:14:32,673
Hold out your hand.

652
01:14:51,104 --> 01:14:53,914
Next time you feel like talking back,

653
01:14:54,384 --> 01:14:57,866
remember the taste of this metal bead.

654
01:15:04,104 --> 01:15:07,233
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

655
01:15:17,224 --> 01:15:18,271
All right?

656
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:19,505
Please give me a light.

657
01:15:19,944 --> 01:15:23,187
We've been ordered to save oil.

658
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:25,548
You little brat.

659
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:27,268
Speak Japanese!

660
01:15:29,784 --> 01:15:33,231
In there is a man the size of an ogre

661
01:15:33,824 --> 01:15:37,909
who can't stand the sound
of girls screaming.

662
01:15:38,424 --> 01:15:41,985
If he hears you, he'll burst in
through that door after you.

663
01:15:43,224 --> 01:15:44,953
And then?

664
01:15:47,984 --> 01:15:52,467
He'll smother you with his giant body.

665
01:15:52,984 --> 01:15:54,986
So you can't make a sound.

666
01:16:09,544 --> 01:16:10,830
Aunt.

667
01:16:11,304 --> 01:16:13,113
My, my...

668
01:16:14,424 --> 01:16:17,667
Scaring a little girl like that.

669
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:09,034
And me?

670
01:17:10,184 --> 01:17:11,834
Am I pretty too?

671
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,593
Look closely.

672
01:17:22,464 --> 01:17:25,991
Everyone says I can't compare

673
01:17:26,784 --> 01:17:29,151
to my big sister.

674
01:17:31,904 --> 01:17:32,905

Penis.

699

Vagina.

700
01:19:02,984 --> 01:19:06,955
You think if you speak Korean,
I won't understand?

701
01:19:09,104 --> 01:19:10,868
<i>I was going a bit crazy,</i>

702
01:19:10,944 --> 01:19:14,107
<i>so I made them crazy too.</i>

703
01:19:18,424 --> 01:19:21,746
<i>When Mrs. Sasaki looked as crazy as me,</i>

704
01:19:21,784 --> 01:19:23,832
<i>life was more bearable.</i>

705
01:19:42,104 --> 01:19:46,109
I know you are a bit insane.

706
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:50,510
It runs in your mother's family.

707
01:19:51,024 --> 01:19:53,470
That's why I'm training you.

708
01:19:53,504 --> 01:19:54,835
To set your mind right.

709
01:19:55,224 --> 01:20:00,310
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

710
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:02,465
Um...

711
01:20:03,824 --> 01:20:06,794
Established by the rational Germans,

712
01:20:06,824 --> 01:20:10,271
it's very effective in treating lunacy.

713
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:14,751
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

714
01:20:14,864 --> 01:20:16,434
and put lids on top.

715
01:20:16,464 --> 01:20:20,833
If patients improve, they get a leash,

716
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:23,595
so they can crawl around like dogs.

717
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:54,025
<i>The cherry tree that came with me

Don't read like a dog lapping at his plate!

I wish to lick her and lick her,

It's Sade-esque.

Believed to be the same Japanese
man who wrote The Lizard Skin.

788

Acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

789
01:28:42,024 --> 01:28:45,107
Poorly printed, on low-quality paper...

790
01:28:46,064 --> 01:28:48,351
used and torn,

791
01:28:48,544 --> 01:28:51,912
stained from food
and human secretions...

792
01:28:53,744 --> 01:28:58,432
I have a predilection
for this kind of little cherub.

793
01:28:59,624 --> 01:29:03,549
Can you imagine my joy when,

794
01:29:03,624 --> 01:29:07,993
after such a journey,
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?

795
01:29:08,104 --> 01:29:12,553
An untouched 1st edition of Milton
wouldn't satisfy me more.

796
01:29:14,544 --> 01:29:15,830
Yes.

797
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:20,872
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

798
01:29:22,304 --> 01:29:28,232
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

799
01:29:30,584 --> 01:29:31,995
but as you can see...

800
01:29:32,104 --> 01:29:34,152
So unfortunate.

801
01:29:35,624 --> 01:29:40,346
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

802
01:29:41,504 --> 01:29:45,828
The author felt words alone could
not fully describe the positions,

803
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,591
and so included an illustration.

804
01:29:50,904 --> 01:29:54,545
In that regard, before
we start the bidding...

805
01:29:55,104 --> 01:29:56,105
Hideko!

806
01:29:56,544 --> 01:29:59,309
Can you perform this scene?

807
01:30:37,104 --> 01:30:40,028
Pain is a Garment

808
01:32:02,704 --> 01:32:04,069

810
01:32:13,304 --> 01:32:14,351
Yes, thank you.

811
01:32:15,504 --> 01:32:18,872
Today's reading was outstanding.

812
01:32:19,104 --> 01:32:20,515
Yes, thank you.

813
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:24,113
Especially the puppet!

814
01:32:52,144 --> 01:32:54,146
You are of noble birth,

815
01:32:54,224 --> 01:32:58,627
yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.

816
01:32:58,944 --> 01:33:02,153
There was a time when

817
01:33:02,224 --> 01:33:05,831
I dissipated my wit and skills on gambling.

818
01:33:05,904 --> 01:33:09,511
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

819
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,552
make advances on me,

820
01:33:11,584 --> 01:33:14,906
when I couldn't afford to
buy them a glass of Burgundy.

821
01:33:15,504 --> 01:33:19,953
Do the women here advance on you?

822
01:33:20,464 --> 01:33:22,512
I look at women's eyes.

823
01:33:22,544 --> 01:33:24,273
Only the eyes.

824
01:33:24,424 --> 01:33:28,031
They turn their gaze away,

825
01:33:28,184 --> 01:33:30,425
but then they always look back.

826
01:33:31,024 --> 01:33:34,267
It's a kind of silent dialogue.

827
01:33:34,784 --> 01:33:39,665
If I were to slide under
someone's covers tonight,

828
01:33:39,944 --> 01:33:43,915
only one woman here would refuse me.

829
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,665
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

830
01:33:48,384 --> 01:33:50,546
Mrs. Sasaki...

831
01:33:51,944 --> 01:33:54,424
Is she not your former wife?

832
01:33:54,784 --> 01:33:57,788
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

833
01:33:58,184 --> 01:34:02,394
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

834
01:34:04,184 --> 01:34:06,949
Can I ask you a question?

835
01:34:09,864 --> 01:34:11,434
Go ahead.

836
01:34:12,424 --> 01:34:14,791
You went so far as to abandon your wife,

837
01:34:14,824 --> 01:34:17,430
why this urge to become Japanese?

838
01:34:19,824 --> 01:34:21,428
Because Korea is ugly,

839
01:34:21,944 --> 01:34:24,834
and Japan is beautiful.

840
01:34:26,104 --> 01:34:29,153
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly

841
01:34:29,224 --> 01:34:31,272
and Korea is beautiful.

842
01:34:31,344 --> 01:34:33,790
Beauty is cruel by nature.

843
01:34:33,824 --> 01:34:37,749
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

844
01:34:39,144 --> 01:34:43,672
Tell me about this woman
who would resist you.

845
01:34:46,984 --> 01:34:50,909
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

846
01:34:51,024 --> 01:34:52,833
Mrs. Sasaki...

847
01:34:55,304 --> 01:34:56,954
If I gave her the right signal,

848
01:34:56,984 --> 01:35:01,387
she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.

849
01:35:08,984 --> 01:35:11,066
My thoughts exactly.

850
01:35:13,184 --> 01:35:14,993
Then who is it?

851
01:35:15,104 --> 01:35:17,994
The one who would deny you?

852
01:35:19,824 --> 01:35:22,828
I heard you own the highest quality

853
01:35:22,864 --> 01:35:26,789
antique bookmaking tools of East and West,

854
01:35:27,384 --> 01:35:29,113
but I don't see them here.

855
01:35:29,184 --> 01:35:31,630
<i>I'll show them to you later.</i>

856
01:35:32,704 --> 01:35:35,275
This woman...

857
01:35:37,184 --> 01:35:39,186
who is she then?

858
01:35:41,264 --> 01:35:45,986
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

859
01:35:46,064 --> 01:35:49,511
Indeed it was I who shifted my gaze.

860
01:35:49,544 --> 01:35:56,632
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

861
01:35:58,824 --> 01:36:01,873
Even if honored with such a visit,

862
01:36:02,344 --> 01:36:04,711
I don't think I could consummate.

863
01:36:05,304 --> 01:36:09,468
I would regret it as soon as I began.

864
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:13,590
Because her body
would be as cold as waterfowl.

865
01:36:18,184 --> 01:36:21,347
The result of long training.

866
01:36:22,344 --> 01:36:25,348
I heard you are engaged to her.

867
01:36:29,864 --> 01:36:35,712
If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?

868
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,514
Her eyes have no desire.

869
01:36:39,824 --> 01:36:42,794
It means her soul is dead inside.

870
01:36:44,224 --> 01:36:46,625
You should go easy on her training,

871
01:36:46,744 --> 01:36:50,385
unless you enjoy making love to a corpse.

872
01:37:13,664 --> 01:37:15,553
Would you like a cigarette?

873
01:37:23,824 --> 01:37:27,715
How could a man with such refined tastes

874
01:37:27,784 --> 01:37:31,914
indulge in a pleasure
as vulgar as a cigarette?

875
01:38:25,584 --> 01:38:29,430
My particular way of possessing beauty.

876
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:34,311
Hideko, too, must have
received painting lessons?

877
01:38:35,264 --> 01:38:41,874
In fact, I was too occupied teaching
her to read with correct diction.

878
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:44,265
Dear me!

879
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:46,785
In England, where I studied,

880
01:38:46,864 --> 01:38:52,746
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant color and graceful lines,

881
01:38:54,224 --> 01:38:56,147
even in the less noble families.

882
01:39:15,424 --> 01:39:17,472
A phone call, sir.

883
01:39:18,304 --> 01:39:20,227
At this hour?

884
01:39:20,304 --> 01:39:22,352
It's the lwamura Bookstore.

885
01:39:22,984 --> 01:39:23,985
Is that so?

886
01:39:24,344 --> 01:39:26,346
Excuse me a moment.

887
01:39:36,344 --> 01:39:38,267
You are mesmerizing.

888
01:39:39,744 --> 01:39:41,428
Men use the word "mesmerizing"

889
01:39:41,464 --> 01:39:45,788
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

890
01:39:46,624 --> 01:39:50,674
I'm familiar with
Western conversational etiquette.

891
01:39:52,384 --> 01:39:55,467
I do a bit of reading, you know.

892
01:39:55,944 --> 01:39:58,311
There was no calculation in what I said.

893
01:39:58,344 --> 01:40:03,475
It was a reflex, like pulling
one's hand from a ï¬‚ame.

894
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:05,595
I'm no flame.

895
01:40:06,104 --> 01:40:09,506
I'm cold as waterfowl, your Lordship.

896
01:40:15,504 --> 01:40:17,472
He will return soon.

897
01:40:17,504 --> 01:40:20,508
Mr. lwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

898
01:40:20,584 --> 01:40:22,473
at my request.

899
01:40:22,504 --> 01:40:25,872
There's an issue regarding your future
you should know.

900
01:40:26,224 --> 01:40:29,512
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

901
01:40:31,184 --> 01:40:34,666
That lwamura is a real fool.

902
01:40:40,504 --> 01:40:42,745
Good night, Miss.

903
01:41:53,744 --> 01:41:55,826
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

904
01:41:55,904 --> 01:41:58,430
I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumors with you.

905
01:41:58,504 --> 01:42:01,792
I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.

906
01:42:01,864 --> 01:42:04,265
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

907
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:06,633
I'm no nobleman.

908
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:08,229
I'm not even Japanese.

909
01:42:08,464 --> 01:42:11,388
Think it was easy for a Korean
farmhand's son to reach here?

910
01:42:11,944 --> 01:42:15,915
Fifteen hard years in Japan
before hearing about you.

911
01:42:15,944 --> 01:42:17,992
Another three years to prepare.

912
01:42:18,664 --> 01:42:21,952
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

913
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,546
All so that I could meet you.

914
01:42:24,984 --> 01:42:26,509
To seduce and marry you,

915
01:42:26,544 --> 01:42:28,945
to possess your father's inheritance,

916
01:42:29,624 --> 01:42:31,672
and then probably to get rid of you.

917
01:42:33,424 --> 01:42:35,188
But I knew as soon as I met you.

918
01:42:35,424 --> 01:42:37,791
For a man to seduce you would be...

919
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:41,394
Impossible.

920
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:46,112
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

921
01:42:47,544 --> 01:42:51,071
Most marriages are prison,
but this one will free you.

922
01:42:51,784 --> 01:42:53,752
I'll rescue you from here,

923
01:42:53,784 --> 01:42:57,345
take you far away,
and give you freedom.

924
01:42:58,784 --> 01:43:00,991
Of course, we'll split the money.

925
01:43:02,104 --> 01:43:03,833
Nonsense.

926
01:43:04,464 --> 01:43:09,026
Marrying an old man with a black tongue
at your tender age makes sense?

927
01:43:09,104 --> 01:43:11,106
I won't marry anyone.

928
01:43:11,344 --> 01:43:12,948
What have you in mind?

929
01:43:16,824 --> 01:43:17,825
Mmm.

930
01:43:18,624 --> 01:43:20,149
That's not proper.

931
01:43:20,464 --> 01:43:21,875
There's no beauty in that.

932
01:43:22,424 --> 01:43:24,665
If you kill yourself, what of your fortune?

933
01:43:25,304 --> 01:43:30,026
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to a pervert?

934
01:43:30,104 --> 01:43:34,234
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

935
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:37,871
My uncle will find us somehow.

936
01:43:38,104 --> 01:43:39,629
Then he'll take us to the basement.

937
01:43:40,664 --> 01:43:41,790
Uncle.

938
01:43:42,664 --> 01:43:43,665
The basement?

939
01:43:43,904 --> 01:43:47,147
<i>It says here when people are hanged,</i>

940
01:43:47,424 --> 01:43:52,305
their tongues stick out
and feces is expelled.

941
01:43:53,184 --> 01:43:57,030
But that day, Aunt's mouth was shut,

942
01:43:58,024 --> 01:44:00,072
and her bottom was clean.

943
01:44:01,504 --> 01:44:03,472
Want to go somewhere nice?

944
01:44:21,384 --> 01:44:25,309
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

945
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:27,307
after I caught her running away.

946
01:44:27,584 --> 01:44:32,272
So don't you ever think of running,
understood?

947
01:44:50,104 --> 01:44:52,311
That day I just watched and listened.

948
01:44:52,424 --> 01:44:56,031
But if I ever end up there again...

949
01:45:00,864 --> 01:45:02,548
Highly concentrated opium.

950
01:45:02,584 --> 01:45:04,871
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

951
01:45:04,904 --> 01:45:07,794
Five drops will knock down a horse.

952
01:45:07,864 --> 01:45:10,470
If you crave death within five minutes,

953
01:45:10,784 --> 01:45:12,548
drink it all.

954
01:45:12,584 --> 01:45:15,986
If you carry this, he can never
take you to the basement.

955
01:45:16,024 --> 01:45:17,514
At least not alive.

956
01:45:18,304 --> 01:45:20,147
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

957
01:45:20,664 --> 01:45:22,507
It's more expensive than jewels.

958
01:45:34,104 --> 01:45:39,474
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

959
01:45:39,504 --> 01:45:41,154
If a bit dense, all the better.

960
01:45:41,264 --> 01:45:45,349
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

961
01:45:47,664 --> 01:45:52,306
They say that the sick are
buried alive in pits.

962
01:45:53,424 --> 01:45:56,268
I want my name to be buried there.

963
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:59,471
I can find you a new maid,

964
01:45:59,544 --> 01:46:01,512
but what do we do about Junko?

965
01:46:07,424 --> 01:46:12,146
You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

966
01:46:13,704 --> 01:46:17,550
Sure, Hideko's pretty,
and you're pretty.

967
01:46:17,864 --> 01:46:19,673
What? You speak Korean?

968
01:46:21,184 --> 01:46:22,595
You know...

969
01:46:23,624 --> 01:46:25,069
I learned it.

970
01:46:25,464 --> 01:46:28,229
To speak more easily with you.

971
01:46:29,384 --> 01:46:32,433
I really wanted to say this to you.

972
01:46:33,584 --> 01:46:35,074
You are just mesmerizing.

973
01:46:35,104 --> 01:46:36,390
Oh, my gosh!

974
01:46:38,584 --> 01:46:40,348
You little tart!

975
01:46:45,344 --> 01:46:47,346
I can't!

976
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:50,348
If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!

977
01:46:51,504 --> 01:46:55,589
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

978
01:47:42,704 --> 01:47:44,069
Oh, fucking hell!

979
01:47:44,984 --> 01:47:46,065
Fucking hell?

980
01:47:46,144 --> 01:47:47,384
Fucking hell...

981
01:48:38,424 --> 01:48:41,189
<i>The Count sent exactly what I ordered.</i>

982
01:48:41,224 --> 01:48:43,670
<i>Naive and a bit foolish.</i>

983
01:48:47,504 --> 01:48:49,313
We look a bit alike.

984
01:48:50,264 --> 01:48:52,028
Are you also an orphan?

985
01:48:55,864 --> 01:48:57,434
Mother!

986
01:49:08,424 --> 01:49:11,428
<i>Show Sookee your old clothes</i>

987
01:49:11,464 --> 01:49:13,546
<i>or jewelry at every opportunity.</i>

988
01:49:13,624 --> 01:49:17,948
<i>The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.</i>

989
01:49:17,984 --> 01:49:23,832
<i>P.S. Don't worry if she reads this
letter, she's totally illiterate.</i>

990
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:25,635
Would you read it to me?

991
01:49:26,264 --> 01:49:27,186
Pardon?

992
01:49:28,384 --> 01:49:30,227
"...said you're looking for a maid.

993
01:49:30,304 --> 01:49:32,750
"Maids are like

994
01:49:33,264 --> 01:49:35,153
"a spoon..." No...

995
01:49:37,064 --> 01:49:39,431
"Are like chopsticks..."

996
01:49:43,384 --> 01:49:45,307
Is it a spoon?

997
01:49:45,584 --> 01:49:46,426
Countess Fujiwara Hideko

998
01:49:46,504 --> 01:49:50,429
This is your name.
Can't you read it?

999
01:49:54,704 --> 01:49:56,468
What's with your foot?

1000
01:50:00,664 --> 01:50:01,870
Who did it?

1001
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:04,875
Who took Tamako's shoe?

1002
01:50:11,664 --> 01:50:13,951
Apologize before all the servants!

1003
01:50:17,184 --> 01:50:20,188
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

1004
01:50:20,224 --> 01:50:22,591
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

1005
01:50:23,784 --> 01:50:24,785
Fucking hell.

1006
01:50:29,624 --> 01:50:30,910
All smooth.

1007
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:39,468
You like the scent?

1008
01:50:40,264 --> 01:50:41,675
Want to come in?

1009
01:50:41,864 --> 01:50:42,865
Pardon?

1010
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,789
This must be Okju.

1011
01:51:05,024 --> 01:51:07,834
At your service, milord.

1012
01:51:08,784 --> 01:51:12,584
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

1013
01:51:17,464 --> 01:51:21,105
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

1014
01:51:24,624 --> 01:51:29,073
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

1015
01:51:33,144 --> 01:51:35,909
Thank you for your recommendation.

1016
01:51:36,064 --> 01:51:40,706
You chose the perfect servant for me.

1017
01:51:41,624 --> 01:51:45,345
You wouldn't want one who's too stupid.
I did my best.

1018
01:51:46,184 --> 01:51:49,631
Take good care of our dear Lady.

1019
01:51:49,944 --> 01:51:50,866
Take this.

1020
01:51:53,904 --> 01:51:56,669
There's no shame
in being rewarded

1021
01:51:56,824 --> 01:52:00,749
for being a good companion
to the Lady.

1022
01:52:03,304 --> 01:52:05,466
Isn't that right Ms. Hideko?

1023
01:52:07,264 --> 01:52:09,028
No need to be ashamed at all.

1024
01:52:09,064 --> 01:52:11,385
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

1025
01:52:11,504 --> 01:52:13,586
Is that so?

1026
01:52:19,064 --> 01:52:21,226
<i>Returning the earrings you loaned me.</i>

1027
01:52:21,744 --> 01:52:24,793
<i>A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.</i>

1028
01:52:25,824 --> 01:52:28,395
<i>I'm sure that Sookee will try her very best</i>

1029
01:52:28,504 --> 01:52:33,192
<i>in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.</i>

1030
01:52:33,704 --> 01:52:36,992
I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

1031
01:52:37,184 --> 01:52:40,393
Keep her busy until the
day of the wedding.

1032
01:52:40,904 --> 01:52:43,032
Make her spend all her energy

1033
01:52:43,064 --> 01:52:45,635
on making you fall in love with me.

1034
01:52:47,304 --> 01:52:51,150
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

1035
01:53:01,384 --> 01:53:02,874
Mesmerizing!

1036
01:53:05,504 --> 01:53:06,585
Me?

1037
01:53:15,504 --> 01:53:17,905
Dressed up, you look like a lady, too.

1038
01:53:26,384 --> 01:53:28,193
Almost fully ripe.

1039
01:53:37,824 --> 01:53:40,065
How did your mom die?

1040
01:53:40,784 --> 01:53:44,231
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

1041
01:53:45,064 --> 01:53:47,112
That she had no regrets.

1042
01:53:48,344 --> 01:53:52,394
<i>Is this the companionship
they write about in books?</i>

1043
01:53:55,504 --> 01:53:57,154
I'll go pick mushrooms.

1044
01:53:57,184 --> 01:54:00,188
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

1045
01:54:00,424 --> 01:54:01,630
I'll go with you.

1046
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:04,706
I'll be quick.

1047
01:54:18,624 --> 01:54:20,911
What's wrong with her?
Is it her period?

1048
01:54:29,264 --> 01:54:30,834
Men are disgusting.

1049
01:54:31,344 --> 01:54:34,109
How can they be so single-minded?

1050
01:54:34,704 --> 01:54:36,274
What's on my mind?

1051
01:54:37,144 --> 01:54:40,785
You don't really believe
that I crave your body?

1052
01:54:42,504 --> 01:54:43,665
You do!

1053
01:54:43,744 --> 01:54:45,428
You read too many of those books.

1054
01:54:45,504 --> 01:54:47,632
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

1055
01:54:48,424 --> 01:54:53,510
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

1056
01:54:53,864 --> 01:54:56,344
it's your money, only that.

1057
01:54:57,024 --> 01:54:59,709
Of all that you have, money is the best.

1058
01:55:01,344 --> 01:55:04,553
Feels great being so rude to a noble lady.

1059
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,153
<i>What's with her?</i>

1060
01:55:07,864 --> 01:55:12,028
<i>Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,</i>

1061
01:55:12,104 --> 01:55:14,835
<i>sit up in the middle of the night
and sigh?</i>

1062
01:55:16,184 --> 01:55:20,633
<i>Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say...</i>

1063
01:55:21,144 --> 01:55:22,828
I despise you.

1064
01:55:23,704 --> 01:55:29,188
Try to bear it. Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

1065
01:55:48,144 --> 01:55:51,865
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

1066
01:55:52,464 --> 01:55:54,148
What woman?

1067
01:55:57,144 --> 01:55:59,146
The duchess Juliette.

1068
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:02,705
Lady!

1069
01:56:03,984 --> 01:56:05,952
Milord!

1070
01:56:11,104 --> 01:56:12,390
Ladyâ€œ.

1071
01:56:17,864 --> 01:56:21,755
<i>"The lady's emotions lay deep inside.</i>

1072
01:56:22,104 --> 01:56:24,948
<i>"Jinlian could not fathom their depths.</i>

1073
01:56:26,704 --> 01:56:28,752
"Knowing this, Lady Sun

1074
01:56:28,784 --> 01:56:32,869
"gave Jinlian four small silver balls.

1075
01:56:32,944 --> 01:56:37,552
"'These are minling, or bells of passion.

1076
01:56:37,584 --> 01:56:41,225
"'Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,

1077
01:56:41,264 --> 01:56:44,427
"'and the other two in yours.

01:56:46,984 --> 01:56:49,066
"'Spread your legs apart

'"trying to cut each
other, put them together.

1081

"'When the lips below

"'you'll hear a clear ringing sound."'

1083
01:56:59,184 --> 01:57:01,027
<i>A blackout! Bring a lantern!</i>

1084
01:57:01,384 --> 01:57:02,954
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1085
01:57:03,184 --> 01:57:06,233
The Sound of Bells on a Windless Night

1086
01:57:08,104 --> 01:57:12,109
"'When do I put this in?' Asked Jinlian.

1087
01:57:13,184 --> 01:57:17,667
"'Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

1088
01:57:19,144 --> 01:57:22,114
"'Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,

1089

01:57:29,064 --> 01:57:31,146
"'Does she embrace you tightly

01:57:35,544 --> 01:57:37,831
"'Does her secret part become slippery

01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:45,429
Does she press her legs between yours?

1095
01:57:45,624 --> 01:57:48,355
And curl her toes?

1096
01:57:49,504 --> 01:57:52,667
"'Then, put in the bells."'

1097
01:57:57,504 --> 01:58:01,429
- Amazing!
- Indeed!

1098
01:58:19,264 --> 01:58:21,505
It's so cute.

1099
01:58:26,824 --> 01:58:28,747
If the Count sees this...

1100
01:58:35,864 --> 01:58:38,754
Will he really be so tender as this?

1101
01:58:39,864 --> 01:58:40,945
Of course.

1102
01:58:41,024 --> 01:58:44,312
And he'll touch you like this...

1103
01:58:45,264 --> 01:58:46,754
And like this...

1104
01:58:54,864 --> 01:58:56,673
Tamako, keep doing it.

1105
01:58:57,864 --> 01:58:59,628
Like the Count would.

1106
01:59:02,224 --> 01:59:03,555
The Count...

1107
01:59:03,864 --> 01:59:05,025
The Count...

1108
01:59:05,664 --> 01:59:08,110
He'll go crazy over this.

1109
01:59:10,584 --> 01:59:14,350
And this is what he'll say.

1110
01:59:16,104 --> 01:59:22,032
It's so soft, warm, wet, and

1111
01:59:26,064 --> 01:59:30,388
spellbindingly beautiful!

1112
02:00:02,024 --> 02:00:05,028
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

1113
02:00:05,224 --> 02:00:07,192
Yes...

1114
02:00:08,184 --> 02:00:10,186
Teach me everything.

1115
02:00:54,264 --> 02:00:59,304
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

1116
02:01:13,904 --> 02:01:16,032
Do you like it when I do this?

1117
02:01:17,144 --> 02:01:18,634
Do you like me?

1118
02:01:20,504 --> 02:01:23,189
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

1119
02:01:24,904 --> 02:01:26,190
I'll never,

1120
02:01:26,624 --> 02:01:27,625
never,

1121
02:01:29,144 --> 02:01:31,112
ever...

1122
02:01:44,464 --> 02:01:50,824
Miss, how could such an innocent...

1123
02:01:51,144 --> 02:01:53,067
You must be a natural.

1124
02:02:48,984 --> 02:02:50,315
Stop!

1125
02:02:52,064 --> 02:02:54,988
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1126
02:02:55,864 --> 02:02:57,229
She's got no one on this earth.

1127
02:02:57,544 --> 02:03:00,787
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

1128
02:03:01,064 --> 02:03:02,589
And please...

1129
02:03:03,024 --> 02:03:07,791
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

1130
02:03:15,144 --> 02:03:16,634
You see?

1131
02:03:17,624 --> 02:03:20,355
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1132
02:03:20,384 --> 02:03:23,706
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1133
02:03:23,784 --> 02:03:27,027
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1134
02:03:27,064 --> 02:03:28,350
I can't do it.

1135
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,465
What?

1136
02:03:30,104 --> 02:03:31,549
I want to quit.

1137
02:03:32,904 --> 02:03:35,111
What's with you all today?

1138
02:03:36,384 --> 02:03:37,795
Why then?

1139
02:03:38,544 --> 02:03:42,515
I hate all of you. My mother, my aunt,
my uncle, you, and...

1140
02:03:45,264 --> 02:03:46,595
And?

1141
02:03:47,824 --> 02:03:49,235
I can't stand Sookee anymore either.

1142
02:03:49,304 --> 02:03:51,193
You feel sorry for her?

1143
02:03:54,344 --> 02:03:56,426
What is it with women?

1144
02:03:59,504 --> 02:04:03,475
You know what that poor
Sookee said about your Ladyship?

1145
02:04:03,664 --> 02:04:07,271
That you're too dense to get it
if someone pulls on your nipples.

1146
02:04:07,304 --> 02:04:10,274
That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.

1147
02:04:10,304 --> 02:04:11,988
That you were so gullible!

1148
02:04:12,224 --> 02:04:15,592
That naive servant's face...

1149
02:04:15,864 --> 02:04:18,151
Yes, you will love him.

1150
02:04:18,344 --> 02:04:21,712
If I say that I love someone else...

1151
02:04:22,704 --> 02:04:27,073
Me, who has no one on this earth...

1152
02:04:27,704 --> 02:04:30,105
Do you still want me to marry him?

1153
02:04:30,704 --> 02:04:31,705
Yes.

1154
02:04:43,264 --> 02:04:44,390
Miss!

1155
02:05:07,144 --> 02:05:10,034
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1156
02:05:41,784 --> 02:05:45,186
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1157
02:06:04,944 --> 02:06:06,025
Let go.

1158
02:06:08,664 --> 02:06:11,713
Miss, I'm sorry!

1159
02:06:14,304 --> 02:06:15,305
Let go!

1160
02:06:15,744 --> 02:06:17,712
I'm sorry, Miss!

1161
02:06:17,944 --> 02:06:19,708
Don't die.

1162
02:06:20,024 --> 02:06:21,708
I'm sorry.

1163
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,633
What are you sorry about?

1164
02:06:26,744 --> 02:06:31,705
I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

1165
02:06:31,744 --> 02:06:35,749
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1166
02:06:36,464 --> 02:06:40,469
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1167
02:06:42,624 --> 02:06:46,265
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1168
02:06:51,624 --> 02:06:53,308
I'm worried about you.

1169
02:06:58,784 --> 02:07:01,913
How do you know my name?

1170
02:07:02,784 --> 02:07:05,185
You think you're tricking me?

1171
02:07:07,584 --> 02:07:09,313
You're the one being tricked.

1172
02:07:10,584 --> 02:07:13,394
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1173
02:07:15,144 --> 02:07:18,068
I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,

1174
02:07:18,104 --> 02:07:21,631
then I'd become you
and run far away, with him.

1175
02:07:26,304 --> 02:07:29,911
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me, too.

1176
02:07:37,224 --> 02:07:40,751
That fucking son of a bitch!

1177
02:07:41,864 --> 02:07:44,834
Oh, sorry, Miss!

1178
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:50,067
<i>"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.</i>

1179
02:07:50,544 --> 02:07:54,594
<i>"I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.</i>

1180
02:07:55,144 --> 02:08:00,105
<i>"I decided to team up with the Lady Hideko.</i>

1181
02:08:00,424 --> 02:08:03,587
<i>"As such, I'm now in need of all your help.</i>

1182
02:08:03,664 --> 02:08:06,747
<i>"I'm enclosing an item as advance payment."</i>

1183
02:08:06,784 --> 02:08:11,346
Always remember the basement.

1184
02:08:25,704 --> 02:08:27,911
You want to go somewhere nice?

1185
02:09:11,304 --> 02:09:13,875
You didn't teach me to read Japanese.

1186
02:09:36,184 --> 02:09:38,073
Did that bastard draw this?

1187
02:09:40,664 --> 02:09:45,625
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

1188
02:09:46,184 --> 02:09:47,470
and those gentlemen?

1189
02:10:41,864 --> 02:10:42,865
Ah!

1190
02:11:54,304 --> 02:11:56,545
<i>The daughter of a legendary thief,</i>

1191
02:11:56,624 --> 02:11:59,514
<i>who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses.</i>

1192
02:11:59,984 --> 02:12:03,193
<i>Herself a thief, pickpocket, swindler.</i>

1193
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:06,989
<i>The savior who came to tear my life apart.</i>

1194
02:12:07,344 --> 02:12:09,028
<i>My Tamako.</i>

1195
02:12:09,744 --> 02:12:11,348
<i>My Sookee.</i>

1196
02:13:32,464 --> 02:13:34,148
How cruel can you be?

1197
02:13:34,344 --> 02:13:37,632
You plucked the ï¬‚ower, now re-plant it.

1198
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:39,632
What do you want?

1199
02:13:39,864 --> 02:13:43,186
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

1200
02:13:48,384 --> 02:13:50,148
You scoundrel!

1201
02:13:50,184 --> 02:13:52,630
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

1202
02:13:54,104 --> 02:13:55,185
Miss!

1203
02:13:56,104 --> 02:13:57,390
Let go!

1204
02:13:59,344 --> 02:14:01,028
Miss!

1205
02:14:15,864 --> 02:14:17,070
I'm hungry-

1206
02:14:21,544 --> 02:14:26,072
The first month, I ordered
a slim herringbone suit.

1207
02:14:26,744 --> 02:14:27,347
The next month, I wore it to
dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1208
02:14:27,348 --> 02:14:30,543
PART THREE The next month, I wore
it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1209
02:14:30,544 --> 02:14:30,635
PART THREE

1210
02:14:30,704 --> 02:14:33,787
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1211
02:14:33,864 --> 02:14:37,027
Some Englishmen who frequented
the brothel recognized me.

1212
02:14:37,064 --> 02:14:40,705
I thought they'd call
the maitre d' and kick me out,

1213
02:14:41,224 --> 02:14:42,635
but what do you know?

1214
02:14:43,224 --> 02:14:47,786
They were amused I'd
spend a month's pay

1215
02:14:47,864 --> 02:14:49,389
on one dignified meal.

1216
02:14:50,224 --> 02:14:52,625
They started calling me Count

1217
02:14:52,704 --> 02:14:54,627
and taught me manners
to go with the name.

1218
02:14:54,664 --> 02:14:57,031
Frankly, I'm not that interested
in money itself.

1219
02:14:57,064 --> 02:14:59,715
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1220
02:15:00,704 --> 02:15:03,435
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1221
02:15:03,464 --> 02:15:04,829
Something like that.

1222
02:15:16,784 --> 02:15:19,310
Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok

1223
02:15:19,384 --> 02:15:21,625
is the summer home of
a genuine Russian noble family.

1224
02:15:21,626 --> 02:15:23,467
The villa is entirely furnished.

1225
02:15:23,468 --> 02:15:25,990
The carpets are very soft.

1226
02:15:33,304 --> 02:15:35,068
Shall we marry there?

1227
02:15:40,224 --> 02:15:42,431
<i>In a few days I'll hear from the hospital.</i>

1228
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:46,910
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko has died.

1229
02:15:49,104 --> 02:15:53,587
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1230
02:15:54,584 --> 02:15:57,986
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1231
02:16:06,584 --> 02:16:08,473
Fuck!

1232
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,909
<i>Motherfucker.</i>

1233
02:16:14,184 --> 02:16:17,984
I never pretended to be
anything but a crook, my dear!

1234
02:16:19,304 --> 02:16:23,229
You will soon become
the Korean servant Nam Sookee.

1235
02:16:23,704 --> 02:16:25,706
I'm a talented counterfeiter.

1236
02:16:25,824 --> 02:16:28,031
I arranged it
with a photography studio.

1237
02:16:28,864 --> 02:16:32,346
From tomorrow, we'll
give Sookee a new life.

1238
02:16:32,464 --> 02:16:33,954
I'm glad.

1239
02:16:34,144 --> 02:16:36,067
Marry me once again.

1240
02:16:36,824 --> 02:16:38,349
This time as Nam Sookee.

1241
02:16:40,264 --> 02:16:42,710
You want another wedding night?

1242
02:16:48,784 --> 02:16:51,947
I think I like you, slightly.

1243
02:16:55,264 --> 02:16:57,790
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1244
02:16:58,904 --> 02:17:00,952
all by herself...

1245
02:17:02,944 --> 02:17:05,754
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1246
02:17:06,344 --> 02:17:08,870
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1247
02:17:08,944 --> 02:17:12,027
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1248
02:17:12,264 --> 02:17:15,905
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1249
02:17:15,944 --> 02:17:17,946
Of course. It's illegal.

1250
02:17:18,424 --> 02:17:21,951
So even if my love for
you leads me to ruin,

1251
02:17:22,384 --> 02:17:23,988
don't pity me.

1252
02:17:24,704 --> 02:17:25,910
Love?

1253
02:17:27,944 --> 02:17:29,992
What does a crook know about love?

1254
02:17:51,384 --> 02:17:53,148
What's that?

1255
02:17:53,944 --> 02:17:55,150
Fire!

1256
02:18:03,864 --> 02:18:07,835
Come this way!

1257
02:18:07,864 --> 02:18:08,911
This way!

1258
02:19:18,664 --> 02:19:21,554
Because you desired me

1259
02:19:21,704 --> 02:19:23,706
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1260
02:19:23,784 --> 02:19:26,264
I have been born anew, it's true.

1261
02:19:27,544 --> 02:19:29,353
I'm grateful for that.

1262
02:19:31,384 --> 02:19:33,546
I'll allow a kiss.

1263
02:19:38,584 --> 02:19:39,745
No.

1264
02:19:39,784 --> 02:19:40,831
Why not?

1265
02:19:43,944 --> 02:19:45,946
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1266
02:19:46,144 --> 02:19:49,034
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1267
02:19:50,944 --> 02:19:56,155
After this I'll thrust
in deep, to your navel.

1268
02:19:57,464 --> 02:19:59,148
Please do that.

1269
02:20:02,584 --> 02:20:04,666
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1270
02:20:04,784 --> 02:20:07,788
You know you can't
deceive me in such matters.

1271
02:20:12,504 --> 02:20:16,668
If I could be yours
for ten minutes,

1272
02:20:16,744 --> 02:20:18,746
what would you give in exchange?

1273
02:20:19,344 --> 02:20:21,711
Whatever your heart desires.

1274
02:20:21,744 --> 02:20:24,748
Anything in this whole wide world.

1275
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:51,311
There's much
I want to teach you.

1276
02:20:52,464 --> 02:20:55,627
You'll become a completely new woman.

1277
02:22:47,144 --> 02:22:49,829
It won't hurt.
You know from those books?

1278
02:22:49,904 --> 02:22:53,829
In truth, women feel the
greatest pleasure

1279
02:22:53,864 --> 02:22:55,832
when taken by force.

1280
02:22:56,144 --> 02:22:59,148
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1281
02:25:16,824 --> 02:25:19,589
Would you fetch those for me?

1282
02:25:29,024 --> 02:25:31,994
OK, look here.

1283
02:25:32,104 --> 02:25:34,027
One, two, three!

1284
02:26:15,504 --> 02:26:17,506
<i>Respected Uncle,</i>

1285
02:26:18,624 --> 02:26:23,425
<i>it always pained me to see you straining</i>

1286
02:26:23,504 --> 02:26:28,385
<i>to speak flawless Japanese
before the Count from Nagoya,</i>

1287
02:26:28,464 --> 02:26:31,593
<i>and even to quiver your voice
like a nobleman.</i>

1288
02:26:33,784 --> 02:26:40,190
<i>So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.</i>

1289
02:26:41,144 --> 02:26:45,547
<i>That man is the son of a Korean farmhand.</i>

1290
02:26:46,544 --> 02:26:51,505
<i>Oh, did my gift arrive safely?</i>

1291
02:26:51,944 --> 02:26:55,391
<i>Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.</i>

1292
02:26:56,424 --> 02:26:58,233
<i>I'm afraid that in real life,</i>

1293
02:26:59,304 --> 02:27:02,831
<i>no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.</i>

1294
02:27:02,904 --> 02:27:08,468
<i>But, for sending me Sookee
out of all the girls in the world,</i>

1295
02:27:08,544 --> 02:27:10,990
<i>I feel "slightly" grateful.</i>

1296
02:27:24,304 --> 02:27:27,911
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1297
02:27:27,944 --> 02:27:31,949
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1298
02:27:32,584 --> 02:27:34,905
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1299
02:27:34,984 --> 02:27:37,988
That I used to cherish more than anything.

1300
02:27:40,064 --> 02:27:41,065
Let's see...

1301
02:27:41,144 --> 02:27:42,111
First...

1302
02:27:45,304 --> 02:27:47,033
<i>First of all.</i>

1303
02:27:56,264 --> 02:27:58,153
<i>The Lizard Skin.</i>

1304
02:28:09,824 --> 02:28:12,828
<i>Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie.</i>

1305
02:28:23,104 --> 02:28:25,948
May I please
smoke a cigarette, sir?

1306
02:28:26,824 --> 02:28:27,825
Sir.

1307
02:28:30,584 --> 02:28:32,871
<i>Bells and Balls.</i>

1308
02:28:36,304 --> 02:28:38,227
<i>The Mortician's Bedroom.</i>

1309
02:28:50,464 --> 02:28:53,308
How could you
let a little girl fool you?

1310
02:28:56,504 --> 02:29:00,509
<i>But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.</i>

1311
02:29:06,264 --> 02:29:09,154
I'll bind two books with the skin
of these bitches.

1312
02:29:09,304 --> 02:29:13,104
And you, you'll be the third volume.

1313
02:29:14,504 --> 02:29:19,954
I arranged so that no two girls
traveling together can leave Kobe.

1314
02:29:22,664 --> 02:29:24,985
Please change the destination
to Shanghai.

1315
02:29:25,024 --> 02:29:28,187
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1316
02:29:28,224 --> 02:29:30,033
Yes, that's correct.

1317
02:29:30,784 --> 02:29:32,468
Show me your passports.

1318
02:29:39,504 --> 02:29:41,427
Miss Nam Sookee?

1319
02:29:44,224 --> 02:29:46,113
Mr. Go Pan-dol?

1320
02:29:54,384 --> 02:29:56,910
You need to pay an additional three yen.

1321
02:29:57,304 --> 02:29:58,305
All right.

1322
02:30:02,824 --> 02:30:03,871
Hideko was

1323
02:30:05,184 --> 02:30:08,393
like a peach that I looked at
on its branch.

1324
02:30:08,704 --> 02:30:11,310
I was content just
imagining its flavor.

1325
02:30:11,824 --> 02:30:14,634
Should I have bitten into it?

1326
02:30:15,424 --> 02:30:16,471
No, no.

1327
02:30:17,424 --> 02:30:22,225
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1328
02:30:23,864 --> 02:30:28,108
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1329
02:30:28,144 --> 02:30:31,466
Peering into each of those fantasies

1330
02:30:31,504 --> 02:30:34,553
was this old man's humble recreation.

1331
02:30:35,104 --> 02:30:38,153
What to do, now that it's all over?

1332
02:30:38,824 --> 02:30:41,145
You should at least tell me your story.

1333
02:30:43,064 --> 02:30:46,546
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1334
02:30:47,264 --> 02:30:50,552
Was she fully ripe? Tell me.

1335
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:56,074
A cigarette might help my memory.

1336
02:30:56,584 --> 02:30:58,552
Right, right...

1337
02:30:59,744 --> 02:31:03,544
You have that silly
penchant for cigarettes?

1338
02:31:20,584 --> 02:31:24,555
So how was Hideko?

1339
02:31:30,584 --> 02:31:34,589
You have no windows here?

1340
02:31:38,184 --> 02:31:41,427
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1341
02:31:53,184 --> 02:31:54,993
<i>That's it, good.</i>

1342
02:32:06,944 --> 02:32:08,355
<i>Why aren't you talking?</i>

1343
02:32:08,624 --> 02:32:10,831
You can't stop there,
dear fellow.

1344
02:32:11,064 --> 02:32:13,192
So, where did you touch first?

1345
02:32:13,984 --> 02:32:15,349
<i>Her face?</i>

1346
02:32:17,744 --> 02:32:19,030
Her breasts?

1347
02:32:20,584 --> 02:32:23,030
Or straight for her cunt?

1348
02:32:25,064 --> 02:32:26,589
Was it soft?

1349
02:32:27,424 --> 02:32:29,108
Did it tighten up?

1350
02:32:30,544 --> 02:32:32,626
Did it have many wrinkles?

1351
02:32:33,664 --> 02:32:35,587
Was it sufficiently wet?

1352
02:32:35,624 --> 02:32:38,992
The viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1353
02:32:40,664 --> 02:32:43,315
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1354
02:33:09,784 --> 02:33:15,109
<i>Spider thread pulled into strings...</i>

1355
02:33:17,024 --> 02:33:22,349
<i>I dare say
no book has ever described</i>

1356
02:33:22,504 --> 02:33:24,506
<i>such a ferocious wedding night.</i>

1357
02:33:28,264 --> 02:33:32,553
<i>I thought I heard a nightingale sing.</i>

1358
02:34:06,744 --> 02:34:11,432
<i>And the clear,
bright crimson blood!</i>

1359
02:34:20,904 --> 02:34:23,271
<i>Thus the Lady became my wife.</i>

1360
02:34:23,704 --> 02:34:27,390
<i>Coy one moment, bold the next...</i>

1361
02:34:31,344 --> 02:34:36,032
But how was she coy,

1362
02:34:36,104 --> 02:34:40,234
how was she bold, tell it to me in detail!

1363
02:34:40,904 --> 02:34:43,714
A story is all about the journey.

1364
02:34:44,184 --> 02:34:46,585
You should know.

1365
02:34:48,104 --> 02:34:49,833
Did she resist?

1366
02:34:50,944 --> 02:34:53,550
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1367
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:57,749
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1368
02:34:58,184 --> 02:34:59,834
Or else...

1369
02:35:00,544 --> 02:35:02,865
Did she beg you to do it?

1370
02:35:03,784 --> 02:35:07,186
<i>Like the lady in
The Widow's Lapdog?</i>

1371
02:35:10,784 --> 02:35:12,115
How dare you!

1372
02:35:12,144 --> 02:35:14,146
Hideko is my wife.

1373
02:35:14,584 --> 02:35:19,146
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1374
02:36:55,224 --> 02:36:56,271
It's odd...

1375
02:36:58,184 --> 02:36:59,788
Your smoke.

1376
02:37:02,504 --> 02:37:05,667
It's cold, blue,

1377
02:37:07,184 --> 02:37:13,191
and strangely beautiful.

1378
02:37:14,424 --> 02:37:21,353
You too have become soft,
slow and dull.

1379
02:37:22,944 --> 02:37:26,107
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1380
02:37:26,904 --> 02:37:29,225
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1381
02:37:32,944 --> 02:37:37,313
At least I will die with my cock intact.

1382
02:44:19,944 --> 02:44:24,154
<i>I hear a sound in the distance</i>

1383
02:44:24,224 --> 02:44:28,434
<i>that sounds like the steps of my love</i>

1384
02:44:28,504 --> 02:44:32,714
<i>An echo that makes my heart</i>

1385
02:44:32,744 --> 02:44:36,066
<i>Skip a beat</i>

1386
02:44:36,904 --> 02:44:41,387
<i>But I wait all through the night</i>

1387
02:44:41,424 --> 02:44:45,031
<i>And my love never comes to me</i>

1388
02:44:45,664 --> 02:44:49,908
<i>There is no end to the heartache</i>

1389
02:44:49,944 --> 02:44:53,630
<i>That grips me in this hour</i>

1390
02:44:54,224 --> 02:44:57,990
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1391
02:44:58,424 --> 02:45:01,667
<i>My dear love</i>

1392
02:45:02,784 --> 02:45:06,584
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1393
02:45:06,984 --> 02:45:10,830
<i>My dear love</i>

1394
02:45:28,464 --> 02:45:32,674
<i>But then in my waiting heart</i>

1395
02:45:32,704 --> 02:45:36,993
<i>Suddenly happiness overflows</i>

1396
02:45:37,064 --> 02:45:41,274
<i>There you are in the distance</i>

1397
02:45:41,304 --> 02:45:45,104
<i>Coming to me</i>

1398
02:45:45,584 --> 02:45:49,828
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1399
02:45:49,864 --> 02:45:53,710
<i>Filled with happiness</i>

1400
02:45:54,184 --> 02:45:58,030
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1401
02:45:58,464 --> 02:46:02,185
<i>Flowers start to bloom</i>

1402
02:46:02,744 --> 02:46:06,544
<i>Come my lover, come to me</i>

1403
02:46:06,984 --> 02:46:10,511
<i>I missed you so</i>

1404
02:46:11,304 --> 02:46:14,865
<i>Let's dream of happy times</i>

1405
02:46:15,544 --> 02:46:19,674
<i>Like long ago</i>

1406
02:46:36,984 --> 02:46:41,194
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1407
02:46:41,224 --> 02:46:45,070
<i>Filled with happiness</i>

1408
02:46:45,584 --> 02:46:49,384
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1409
02:46:49,824 --> 02:46:53,590
<i>Flowers start to bloom</i>

1410
02:46:54,104 --> 02:46:57,904
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1411
02:46:58,384 --> 02:47:01,866
<i>My dear love</i>

1412
02:47:02,704 --> 02:47:06,345
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1413
02:47:06,984 --> 02:47:11,069
<i>My dear love</i>
