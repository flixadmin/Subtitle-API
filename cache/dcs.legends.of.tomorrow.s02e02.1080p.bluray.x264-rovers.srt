1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,421
SARA: <i>My name is Sara Lance.</i>

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,931
<i>Last year, a former Time Master
named Rip Hunter</i>

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,717
<i>recruited a team of heroes and villains
to save the world.</i>

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:12,479
<i>And we did. But in the process
we destroyed the Time Masters.</i>

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,436
<i>Now we've taken up their mantle</i>

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,976
<i>of protecting the timeline
from time criminals.</i>

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,688
<i>We are no longer saving the world,
we are saving history.</i>

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,482
<i>But don't call us heroes,</i>

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,408
<i>we are Legends.</i>

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,612
RORY: <i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,821
Heywood. Dr. Nate Heywood.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,458
<i>I need to talk to you about Sara Lance,
Ray Palmer, and the rest of the Legends.</i>

13
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,790
I think they're all in trouble.

14
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,042
I am piloting us on a collision course
with the torpedo.

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,423
- Gideon?
- GIDEON: <i>I'm here, Captain.</i>

16
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,963
Where is Captain Hunter?

17
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,890
<i>I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.</i>

18
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,475
<i>Together you are the best crew,</i>

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,140
<i>the best team a captain
could ever hope for.</i>

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,680
<i>Good luck.</i>

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,024
What do you guys say we get out of 1942?

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,650
Not until you answer a few questions.

23
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,190
We're the Justice Society of America.

24
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,574
And you're coming with us.

25
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,028
Oh my, God. You're Commander Steel.

26
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,782
Who the hell are you?

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,827
Woah! Just relax. We're all friends here.

28
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,747
Rex Tyler told us about the JSA.
You guys are awesome.

29
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,540
Hey. My name is Jax.

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,800
Rex never mentioned any of you.

31
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,595
Mind telling us what you were doing
impersonating OSS agents?

32
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,845
It's quite simple, actually.

33
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,804
We were protecting Albert Einstein
from Nazi agents

34
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,937
who were attempting to kidnap him
and force him to build an atomic bomb.

35
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,187
In the future.

36
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,558
Time travel. It's hard to explain.

37
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,193
- You can take all the time you need.
- In custody.

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,438
Woah! Take it easy.
Let's talk for a minute.

39
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,697
I mean, after all, your my...

40
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,031
Obsidian! Shut off the lights!

41
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,795
That's pretty neat.

42
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,890
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>She's trying to kill us.</i>
JAX: No, she's just flirting.

43
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,489
We don't wanna fight!

44
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,260
You win!

45
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,672
You just had to mention time travel,
didn't you?

46
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,338
Yeah, well, at least
he didn't throw the first punch.

47
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,969
I'm perfectly capable
of defending myself, Raymond.

48
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,306
I'm pretty sure that you got knocked out
by a teenager in a star-spangled leotard.

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,636
Her name's Stargirl.

50
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,643
Did anybody catch her regular-person name?

51
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,478
I'm surprised
you didn't ask for her number.

52
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,397
So, it's my fault
that we got our asses handed to us?

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,153
Look, they're just better coordinated
than us.

54
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,821
- Hey, guys, just listen to me...
- RORY: <i>Pretty, shut up!</i>

55
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,320
If I recall, you were late
coming to the party.

56
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,734
<i>Is that right? How did you see that?</i>

57
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,902
Never laid eyes on them before in my life.

58
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,663
They seemed quite adamant
that they knew you.

59
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,324
Believe me, if I'd met this bunch,

60
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,542
<i>I'm pretty sure I'd remember.</i>

61
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,837
- What do you propose we do with them?
- If I may be so bold, sir,

62
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,044
I say we find the darkest hole
in Leavenworth

63
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,503
and throw away the key.

64
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,545
I say we ship them to the boys
in Bellevue Mental Hospital.

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,890
I suppose, before we do anything,
we ought to question them.

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,342
RORY: <i>so far up Mr. Goggles' ass?</i>

67
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,392
If we can even manage to get a word in.

68
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,065
I don't understand why
they were tracking us in the first place.

69
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,225
Because they're
the Justice Society of America,

70
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,111
the single greatest secret force
this country has ever known.

71
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,739
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

72
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,401
Because his Nazi handlers
have briefed him, no doubt.

73
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,616
Look, I'm not a Nazi. I'm a historian.

74
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,872
Here we go with
the time travel nonsense again.

75
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,204
0-7-0-2-3-3.

76
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,375
- What?
- Those are the numbers on your dog tags.

77
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,962
They're not disclosed on any documents,
military or otherwise.

78
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,385
How do you know that?

79
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,431
You gave these to your wife
after the birth of your son in 1955.

80
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,398
The dent on the front
was from an assassin's bullet

81
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,060
when you saved
President Roosevelt in 1939.

82
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,067
<i>Your son passed them down to his son...</i>

83
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,611
Me.

84
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,744
You're late, <i>Herr</i> Thawne.

85
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:32,257
You'll find that I have an entirely
different concept of time than most.

86
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,759
Did you locate the item?

87
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,760
It's in Berlin.
The Führer refuses to part with it.

88
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,926
I have something much more valuable
to offer him.

89
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,604
The JSA are basically
a group of super-soldiers.

90
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,440
To win, the Reich will need their own.

91
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,443
This is just a taste.

92
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,815
Enough to dose one person.
Proof of concept.

93
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,109
Give me what I want,

94
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,825
and your Führer will be planting his flag

95
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,207
on the White House lawn
within a matter of months.

96
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,539
Do we have an accord?

97
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,836
PROFESSOR STEIN: Mr. Tyler.

98
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,471
See? Rex Tyler. Told you we knew the guy.

99
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,304
I don't know you. Any of you.

100
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,683
Tell me what the heck is going on here.

101
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,016
- Well, we tried explaining...
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

102
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,889
I was addressing the team leader.

103
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,564
Uh... Oh...

104
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,356
Well, simply put,
we've come here as time travelers

105
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,193
to identify aberrations in history
and correct them.

106
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,149
We're superheroes like you guys.

107
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,739
You think you're just like us?

108
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,327
What are your qualifications?

109
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,664
Well, I used my personal fortune
to create an advanced exo-skeleton

110
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,575
which is powered by a dwarf star alloy.

111
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,332
And I'm nothing like you. I'm a criminal.

112
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,792
Are there any other felons on your team?

113
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,754
- No. No...
- Yes, she's an assassin.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,752
But never convicted, right?

115
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,513
RAY: <i>We're protecting history.
It's pretty important.</i>

116
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,926
In the future, you risk your own life
to save us, Mr. Tyler.

117
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,512
How do you know my name?

118
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,023
Because you told us your name in 2016.

119
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,147
REX: <i>My name is Rex Tyler.</i>

120
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,695
And I'm a member
of the Justice Society of America.

121
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,151
Never heard of 'em, pal.

122
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,533
That's because I'm from 1942.

123
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,615
- The same year in which all of you will...
- Bite the bullet?

124
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,615
So if we don't go back to 1942,
we're safe, right?

125
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,002
Not to be rude, but how do we know
you are who you say you are?

126
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,625
You all have no idea
what you're up against.

127
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:40,127
If you return to 1942,
the consequences will be catastrophic!

128
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,679
That was weird.

129
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,555
So I crashed your ship,

130
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,191
told you some bunk
about not staying in 1942,

131
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,899
and then I just disappeared?

132
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,234
It was more like... Fritzing out.

133
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,195
You might've been on to something
with that Bellevue idea.

134
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,247
Yes, Mr. President, sir?

135
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,580
FDR? Oh!
Tell him I'm a big fan of the New Deal.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,084
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier. I just...

137
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,417
I never imagined meeting you like this.

138
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,928
I actually never imagined meeting you
at all because you're dead.

139
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,717
I mean, where I come from you're dead.

140
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,430
My dad used to tell me bedtime stories
about you.

141
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,232
All the battles you fought.

142
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,269
You're a hero to me.

143
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,398
I'm a hero to a lot of people.
That's the job.

144
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,068
REX: <i>Of course. All right.
You can count on us, sir.</i>

145
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,031
All right, we have to move out.
Baron Krieger's been spotted in Paris.

146
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,289
If it's permissible, sir,

147
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,417
I'll fly ahead
and record Krieger's movements.

148
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,419
Sensible, as always.

149
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,460
RAY: <i>We could help you out with that.</i>

150
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,421
Fighting Nazis is kind of our thing.

151
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,255
Yeah. Last time we tried,

152
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,841
we ended up at the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean.

153
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,089
We can handle Adolf's buddies.

154
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,721
I think it's best
for the 20th century if...

155
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,594
For us to leave it?

156
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,767
And that's why you're team leader.

157
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,809
Well, I guess we'll be on our way, then.

158
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,734
Can you believe what we just saw
with our own eyes?

159
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,240
The actual JSA.

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,363
And Hourman, that guy is amazing.

161
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,411
Aw... Haircut's in love.

162
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,448
Come on.

163
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,909
Those guys were precise, professional,
in constant agreement.

164
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,078
We can't even agree
on whose turn it is to make dinner.

165
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,589
- Not it!
- JAX: I can't argue with you, man.

166
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,625
- They've got some serious skills.
- Big deal.

167
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,591
Apart from
the fancy headquarters, discipline,

168
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,596
and calls from the White House,

169
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,725
- what do they have that we don't?
- An actual leader.

170
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,011
Rip's gone.

171
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,271
And who knows when
or if we'll ever find him?

172
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,442
In the meantime, we need someone
who can make the tough calls.

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,728
Let me guess, you're volunteering?

174
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,237
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>With all due respect, Raymond,</i>

175
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:09,151
I think there's a reason Mr. Tyler
just naturally assumed I was in charge.

176
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,078
Yeah, because Mr. Tyler is from 1942
and you're some old white dude.

177
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,619
"Old" meaning "experienced."

178
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,662
- What about...
- Martin's right.

179
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,127
With Rip gone,
we could use some adult supervision.

180
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,876
Congratulations, Captain.

181
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,259
Well, then.
Thank you all for your support.

182
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:35,727
Now, I believe our first order of business
concerns Dr. Heywood.

183
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,027
- Is that Grandpa?
- Yeah.

184
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,819
Pictures of him are hard to find.
You just got to know where to look.

185
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,906
Well, that must've been something,
getting the chance to meet him.

186
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,159
You would think so, right? But...

187
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,660
I don't know. It felt empty somehow.

188
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,879
Well, meeting your idols usually does.

189
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:04,998
Think of it this way,

190
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,011
you are gonna have one hell of a story to
tell your friends when you get back home.

191
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,678
Back home? 2016 back home?

192
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,766
- You can't cut me from the team.
- <i>You're right.</i>

193
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,676
Because you're not a member of it.

194
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:21,098
And even if you were,
history can be dangerous,

195
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,434
- and it's no place for...
- A historian?

196
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,352
I'm more...

197
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,147
- That's weird.
- It's really not so weird.

198
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,408
You don't have any superpowers.
You don't even have training...

199
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,194
Not that. My grandfather's dog tags,

200
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,038
- they aren't around my neck.
- So?

201
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,744
So, I haven't taken them off
since I was a kid.

202
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,621
They were just here a minute ago,
and now they've...

203
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,997
Vanished.

204
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,041
What does that mean?

205
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,002
That history has changed.

206
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,798
<i>What're you doing?</i>

207
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,471
DR. HEYWOOD:
Reviewing my notes on the JSA.

208
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,093
We have to go back to 1942.

209
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:03,352
Nate, the JSA was pretty explicit
on us not going back to 1942.

210
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,189
That mission the JSA went on
to track down Baron Krieger in Paris...

211
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,442
They're all going to die there tomorrow.

212
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,110
My grandfather, too.

213
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,035
JAX: This is where the JSA's gonna die?

214
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,918
Not unless we save them.
Including my grandfather.

215
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,878
Well, first we got to find them.

216
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,594
Fortunately, we know they're looking for
a Nazi named Krieger.

217
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,963
A Nazi named Krieger...

218
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,756
Can someone please help me
operate this thing?

219
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,929
- Oh, God.
- Thank you.

220
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,595
Krieger and his men
frequent Folies Bergére.

221
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,351
We find Krieger, we find the JSA.

222
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,191
So how do we sneak into a Nazi nightclub?

223
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,318
I have a plan.

224
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,855
Are any of you familiar with
Max Sulzenfuss,

225
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,279
better known by his stage name,
Max Lorenz?

226
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,074
He was Hitler's favorite singer
and, fortunately,

227
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,578
bears a passing resemblance to <i>moi.</i>

228
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,042
- That was French.
- Hmm.

229
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,962
Grey. You sure about this?

230
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,625
'Cause bluffing at a card game
isn't exactly the same as bluffing Nazis.

231
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,168
You disapprove of my plan?

232
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,883
I'm just saying, we're dropping
into the middle of World War II here,

233
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,341
and you're not exactly
a wartime <i>consigliere.</i>

234
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,513
Let me guess, you are?

235
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,020
Or perhaps you would prefer
the arsonist, the assassin,

236
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,022
or the incredible shrinking man?

237
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,942
I'm just saying, you're smart

238
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,650
and analytical and stuff,
and real deliberate.

239
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,782
But when bullets start flying,
"analytical" is not gonna cut it.

240
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,817
Well, thank you for pointing out
my inadequacies.

241
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,988
- Come on, Grey...
- It's "Captain Grey" now.

242
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,990
Well, I'm glad
it hasn't gone to your head.

243
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,202
SARA: Ouch.

244
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,041
Where'd you get that?

245
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,127
It must've happened when I fell
after my grandfather decked me.

246
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,299
Hey, that fabrication room's pretty cool.

247
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,510
Can it really make clothes from any era?

248
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,017
Yeah, you know, we may not have trophies
or framed letters from former presidents,

249
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,645
but we've got a few cool toys.

250
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,431
Including ingestible translator.

251
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,066
You swallow this, you'll be able to speak
and understand any language spoken to you.

252
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,240
That's cool. But I already speak German,
French, Japanese, Italian and Latin.

253
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,616
What?

254
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,028
You speak six different languages,

255
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,946
you have a tendency to run towards danger,

256
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,240
and you're related to a member of the JSA.

257
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,828
Why did you become a historian?

258
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,414
It's a long story.

259
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,378
Hey, where do I go to get a gun?

260
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,423
You ever shoot someone before?

261
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,051
I mean, I may not be trained
by the League of Assassins,

262
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,712
but I can take care of myself.

263
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,551
Not out here you can't.

264
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,013
Out here, even the strongest
and the bravest of us die.

265
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,094
Like Captain Hunter?

266
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,856
I'm just trying to make sure
you get home safe and sound.

267
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,777
So the lady does have a heart.

268
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,063
SARA: Don't tell anyone.

269
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,621
Excuse me...

270
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,874
The club is closed tonight
for a private function.

271
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,079
Do you have any idea who I am?

272
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,122
I am Max Lorenz.

273
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,003
- Did you say Max Lorenz?
- PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Yes.</i>

274
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,128
And I have never been treated
with such rudeness.

275
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,218
Of course not.
You're more than welcome here, <i>Herr</i> Max.

276
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,425
Thank you.

277
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,303
Humph.

278
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,447
SARA: <i>No sign of Krieger or the JSA.</i>

279
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,786
<i>Canvas the area and stay on the comms.</i>

280
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,463
I think I've got something.
The lady with the animal powers.

281
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,007
But she looks different.

282
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,876
You mean "hot."

283
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,556
May I?

284
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,016
What are you doing?
I'm on a covert mission.

285
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,388
Not for long.

286
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,183
You and your team are all
24 hours away from being killed.

287
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,061
What are you talking about?

288
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,820
I'm a time traveler, remember?

289
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,987
Something changed in the future
and you all die.

290
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,121
And if we do, how do you know
it's not because of your team?

291
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,116
Hadn't thought of that.

292
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,036
Look who I found.
And she's thrilled we've offered our help.

293
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,455
<i>Herr</i> Lorenz!

294
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,916
I must introduce you
to General Gerd von Rundstedt.

295
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,299
He's a huge fan.

296
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,086
Oh, lovely to meet you, General.

297
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,754
You are Max Lorenz?

298
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,390
Lorenz is well over six feet tall.

299
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:54,522
My towering voice often causes people
to overestimate my height.

300
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,315
Perhaps you would treat us to a song,
Mr. Lorenz?

301
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:03,857
Maxie has a concert tomorrow night
and needs to rest his pipes.

302
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,071
I insist, <i>Fraulein.</i>

303
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,702
<i>Und</i> please,

304
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,076
no negro music.

305
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,953
I swear...

306
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,918
- Not worth it.
- It'd be a little worth it.

307
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,423
Heads up. Baron Krieger just arrived.

308
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,960
<i>Is this on?</i>

309
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,259
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

310
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,220
<i>My name is Max Lorenz</i>

311
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,933
<i>and this little waltz
I am about to sing for you</i>

312
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,513
<i>is an original song.</i>

313
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,149
<i>Very popular in Austria.</i>

314
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:43,317
<i>Where the hills are alive
with the sound of music.</i>

315
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,325
Watch me for the changes
and try to keep up.

316
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,661
<i>One, two, three. One, two, three.</i>

324
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,905
The Askaran Amulet
is not degenerate artwork.

325
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,778
It is a masterpiece.

326
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,199
Which you will help my men transport
to the exchange tomorrow at 10:00.

327
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,003
Refusing would meet
with the Führer's disapproval.

328
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,461
- I know the Baron's plan.
- Let's get out of here.

329
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,625

ALL: <i>Heil</i> Hitler!

334
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,906
You did not salute the Führer.

335
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,913
Yeah. Sure, I did.
I'm all about saluting the Führer.

336
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,915
You're lying.

337
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,917
I was watching you the entire time.

338
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,249
You know, I have a little crick in my neck

339
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,913
and it's really hard for me
to straighten my arm.

340
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,841
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

341
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,091
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

342
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,840
He...

343
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,762
Oh, hell.

344
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,265
Why do you get to punch him?

345
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,524
MAN: <i>Protect Max Lorenz!</i>

346
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,796
What the hell are you doing here?

347
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,804
We came back to...

348
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,472
To rescue you.

349
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,861
If we're meant to be impressed
by all this technology,

350
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,525
it has the opposite effect.

351
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,660
It only makes you
that much more dangerous.

352
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,488
And there is evidence to support that.

353
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,248
But I think what's important now
is for all of us to stop arguing.

354
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,834
- Does your team ever stop arguing?
- Fair point.

355
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,919
SARA: <i>I think what Martin is trying to say</i>

356
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,046
is we're going to help you
whether you like it or not.

357
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,174
You're going after Krieger?
We know where he's going next.

358
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,094
And given the laws of temporal mechanics,

359
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,556
<i>if you die, your grandson ceases to exist.</i>

360
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,389
I don't pretend to understand
any of this "time travel" bunk.

361
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,517
But these fellas do have a Timeship.
Might come in handy.

362
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,183
And having them as our backup might be
the only way to keep them out of trouble.

363
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,855
Let's put it to a vote, then.

364
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,364
The "ayes" have it.

365
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,869
Did your reconnaissance at the club
yield any usable intel?

366
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,531
- I'll need a map of the area.
- GIDEON: <i>Bringing one online now.</i>

367
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,699
- What was that?
- AI.

368
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,038
Talking computer.

369
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,703
- What's a computer?
- There.

370
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:27,916
The Fontainebleau Forest.

371
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,126
Now, I saw a few of Krieger's men
studying a map of it.

372
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,750
That must be where Krieger's planning
on making the exchange.

373
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,131
Nate overheard Krieger talking about

374
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,221
making a trade for something
called an "Askaran Amulet."

375
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,096
GIDEON: <i>Hitler has long-amassed
ancient artifacts such as this one.</i>

376
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,228
<i>He may want the Amulet because
it conveys some sort of occult power.</i>

377
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,930
Our objective should be
to take out the Baron

378
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,643
and stop this exchange at all costs.

379
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,564
I propose we survey
all military activity in the area

380
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,319
to learn what we're up against.

381
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,446
- We don't have time for that.
- I concur.

382
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,652
We should have both teams gear up

383
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,488
while Dr. Stein and I
finalize the details.

384
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,742
Be ready to go at first light.

385
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,330
How are things with your grandfather?

386
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,418
You know, I think he's avoiding me
for some reason.

387
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,913
It's hard for people
to look at their future.

388
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,081
Maybe.

389
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,337
One of the Nazis at the club had a knife.

390
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,638
Well, that should have
stopped bleeding by now.

391
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,924
I'm just gonna get a new bandage.

392
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,347
To go with your bruise?

393
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,264
Well, you know how fragile
we historians can be.

394
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,775
This isn't fragility.
I know my cuts and bruises.

395
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,149
You're a hemophiliac.

396
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,523
Your blood doesn't clot.
Wounds can't heal.

397
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,616
And if it's bad, you can bleed to death.

398
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,493
Yeah, well,
you don't have to worry about that.

399
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,620
Too late. You could've died tonight.

400
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,497
But I didn't.
In fact, it was the opposite.

401
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,283
I never felt more alive.

402
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,119
Look, when I was five years old,
I cut my knee

403
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,960
and my mother wouldn't let me
out of the house till I was 16.

404
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,625
I'm a grown man.
I can make my own decisions.

405
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,631
- Not on this ship, you can't.
- Sara...

406
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,795
Look, I cannot let you
go out there tomorrow,

407
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,555
knowing that you could get killed.

408
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,467
I have enough deaths
on my conscience as it is.

409
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,809
Look, I know you don't think
I can add anything to this team.

410
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,814
But out there, out there is history,

411
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,142
and nobody knows more about it than me.

412
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,237
But we've been managing
just fine without you.

413
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,324
Mostly fine.

414
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,910
Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.

415
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,201
Oh. Actually, I made it
to fit me perfectly.

416
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,836
It's constructed out of
a proprietary alloy,

417
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,872
and it's been battle-tested quite a bit.

418
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,505
I even wore it in space once.
Personal highlight.

419
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,925
So your superpower is wearing the suit?

420
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,474
Yeah. I guess so.
It's a little more complicated than that.

421
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:46,763
But, yeah.

422
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,229
You're still mad at me for punching out
that Nazi in the club, huh?

423
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,686
I'm mad because you blew my cover.

424
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,024
I'll never be able to go undercover
in Paris ever again.

425
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,739
Yeah. Sorry. I didn't think about that.

426
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,446
I imagine that's a pattern with you
and your group.

427
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,369
But I can't dwell on it.

428
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,073
Getting stuck on past mistakes only
takes focus off the primary goal at hand.

429
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,783
Well, I got to admit.

430
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,078
Watching your team work
like a well-oiled machine

431
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,871
kind of makes me feel like
I'm doing this whole hero thing all wrong.

432
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,384
If it's any consolation, Dr. Palmer,
you're not really a hero.

433
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,220
We better get ready.

434
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,733
We've spotted the Baron's caravan.
ETA five minutes.

435
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,351
I've got eyes on the Baron.

436
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,569
What the hell is going on down there?

437
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,108
Animal Girl and I are going after Krieger.

438
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,194
In the field, I'm called "Vixen."

439
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,450
Negative, Raymond.
Our target is the convoy.

440
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,287
COMMANDER STEEL: <i>We've got
the convoy covered. Pursue the Baron.</i>

441
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,211
- The mission is the Amulet.
- COMMANDER STEEL: <i>Our mission is Krieger.</i>

442
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,871
We don't have time for this.

443
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,291
Give me a moment.
I need to assess the situation.

444
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,837
Krieger's getting away, man.

445
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,488
What the hell was that?

446
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,651
We're under attack.

447
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,655
RAY: <i>It's Krieger, he's turned into a...</i>
VIXEN: <i>We need backup.</i>

448
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,867
Dr. Palmer? Vixen? Do you read?

449
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,206
Their comms are down.

450
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,703
Oh, my God.

451
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,854
- COMMANDER STEEL: <i>I've got the Amulet.</i>
- Good work.

452
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,013
Dr. Mid-Nite, Stargirl.

453
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,691
<i>Vixen and Dr. Palmer need assistance.</i>

454
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,523
Copy that.
But I think we have a new problem.

455
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,205
Grey, you've got to get them out of there.

456
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,411
I just need a minute.

457
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,922
Come on, Grey! Do something!

458
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,717
Fall back. Get Obsidian.

459
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,421
Mick, lay down fire to cover our retreat.

460
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,964
Now you're talking.

461
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,723
SARA: <i>Mick, come on!</i>

462
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,890
Commander Steel,
do you still have the Amulet?

463
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,603
COMMANDER STEEL:
<i>Yes, sir. En route to your position.</i>

464
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,810
- What about Ray and Amaya?
- You just can't leave them there.

465
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,437
Nor can we engage this super-Nazi.

466
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,571
Not without compiling
more information first.

467
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,319
This is not a science debate, Grey.

468
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,984
Damn it, Jefferson. I know that.

469
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,404
<i>But for now, they're on their own.</i>

470
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,590
I must admit, it's a feat of engineering.

471
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,092
<i>Far beyond anything I have ever seen</i>

472
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,516
or expected from you Americans.

473
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,682
Well, maybe you Germans
should just stick to your luxury cars.

474
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:04,646
Why should I fear a robot-suit
when I have become the <i>Ubermensch?</i>

475
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,611
You really think a single case
of 'roid rage is gonna win you the war?

476
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,314
Yeah.

477
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,698
Once I have replicated the super-serum
for the entire <i>Wehrmacht.</i>

478
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,613
But you haven't replicated the...

479
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,448
What did you call it? "Super-serum"?

480
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,116
Kind of on the nose.

481
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,331
If all this is just a preamble
to you killing us,

482
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,374
get it over with.

483
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,507
I was hoping to torture you
a little bit first.

484
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,381
But since you're in such a rush,

485
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,512
I will be glad to accommodate you
with your schedule.

486
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,133
<i>Wait, wait. I'm a scientist.</i>

487
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,635
That exo-suit? I invented it.

488
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,346
I can help you with your little
supply and demand problem.

489
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,981
I'll even improve it.

490
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,229
Just don't shoot her.

491
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,522
I hope you are as smart
as you say you are.

492
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,567
For her sake.

493
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,165
You know he's going to kill us both
even if you help him.

494
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,587
I have a plan.

495
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,840
That's what I'm afraid of.

496
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,381
DR. MID-NITE:
We have the Amulet. Now what?

497
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,013
First priority is making sure
Ray and Amaya are alive,

498
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,765
and then getting them out of the bunker
where the Nazis are holding them.

499
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,177
Actually, our first priority
is destroying the Baron

500
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,228
and whatever serum
is making him indestructible.

501
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,231
Perhaps we could propose a trade?
Their lives for the Amulet.

502
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,392
Unfortunately, the Amulet's
not ours to barter with.

503
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,022
We need an extraction plan.

504
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,192
No. We need to eliminate the threat.

505
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,948
Now, Professor Stein, please
tell us what is your plan of action?

506
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,570
How am I supposed to come up with a plan
when I can't even hear myself think?

507
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,699
Would you please all just leave?

508
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,376
I need a moment to collect my thoughts.

509
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,087
What the hell, Grey?

510
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,426
I can practically feel you going crazy
inside my head.

511
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,722
I'm fine, Jefferson.

512
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,767
I'm trying to determine
the best course of action.

513
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,224
I wouldn't believe that even
if we didn't have a psychic connection.

514
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,889
Which, hold on, we do.

515
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,900
I just don't know how
Rip was able to do all this.

516
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,398
So many decisions to make,

517
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,527
consequences to manage,
opinions to consider.

518
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,862
Trying to reach a consensus with
this team is...

519
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,701
Is like something akin to Chaos theory!

520
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,907
JAX: <i>That's the thing, Grey.</i>

521
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,037
We don't need someone to
reach a consensus,

522
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,948
we just need someone
who can call the shots.

523
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,117
Then you should have put a tactician,

524
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,752
not a theoretician, in charge.

525
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,916
<i>You were right, Jefferson.</i>

526
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,709
I'm not a wartime <i>consigliere.</i>

527
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,891
Are they gonna be okay?

528
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,142
They'll live to fight another day.
It's what we do.

529
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,603
I used to fantasize about meeting you.

530
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,774
Trading stories or having a beer.

531
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,073
Or just making eye contact.

532
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,243
I'm sorry. I...

533
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,281
I guess, back at headquarters,

534
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,827
- I was afraid to get too close to you.
- Why?

535
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,996
You're my grandfather.
You're more than that.

536
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,459
You're a hero to me.

537
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,249
I don't want to be anyone's hero.

538
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,960
<i>That look you gave me when we first met,</i>

539
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,840
I've seen it before.

540
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,840
When people look up to me,

541
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,849
decide that they have to
act a certain way,

542
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,976
a way that's likely to get them killed...

543
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,143
I do what I do
so that others don't have to.

544
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,187
So you wouldn't have to.

545
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,818
My whole life, people have been trying to
shield me from the world.

546
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,323
Your son included.

547
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,322
Meanwhile, all I ever wanted to be
was a soldier like you.

548
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,959
It's a parent's job
to protect their child.

549
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,047
But it's a child's obligation to
themselves to live their own life.

550
00:31:55,789 --> 00:32:00,545
You can and should do
whatever you set your mind to.

551
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,182
But you should know,

552
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,636
you don't have to be a soldier
to be a hero.

553
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,023
REX: And we approach from the southwest,

554
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,529
destroy the weapons lab
and the Baron in one move.

555
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,157
Except that the last time we faced him,
he took out both of our teams.

556
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,989
The last time we weren't being
backed by a squadron of B-17s.

557
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,996
Then how do we get Ray and Amaya out
before the bombs start falling?

558
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,531
We don't.

559
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,868
This conflict is bigger
than any one of us.

560
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,044
If it means ending the war one day sooner,

561
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,205
Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.

562
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,874
But she doesn't have to.

563
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,382
Look, I know you and your team think
we're a group of irresponsible losers,

564
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,546
but I know Ray Palmer.

565
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,556
And he has a plan to
get out of that bunker.

566
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,390
- We just need to give him time...
- Which means giving the Nazis time.

567
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,183
I'm calling in the strike.

568
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,847
I can't let you do that.

569
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,860
- You don't have the authority.
- Yes, she does.

570
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,562
Miss Lance speaks for all of us.

571
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:05,067
I've watched her become the beating heart
and steady hand of this team.

572
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,528
She is the proper person to lead us.

573
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,744
And if she says that
we are going to rescue our people,

574
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,747
that is what we are going to do.

575
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,931
This would go a lot faster
if I wasn't handcuffed.

576
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,930
I mean, what do you think?
I'm gonna escape using a microscope?

577
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,391
Are you going to make more serum,

578
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,607
or is your friend going to die?

579
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,734
First off, it's not a serum.

580
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,937
It's a bio-molecular enhancer.

581
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,438
By the way, who gave you this?

582
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,484
Because, from an engineering standpoint,
it's really rather...

583
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,448
Yes, I can make more.

584
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,739
Ray, don't do it.

585
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,741
Don't help him.

586
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,124
Back to work.

587
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,010
Watch them.

588
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,102
How can you do this?

589
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,439
No member of the JSA
would ever help the Nazis.

590
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,812
Neither would a Legend.

591
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,325
Damn, I really wanted to do it
with just the microscope.

592
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,281
Get the handcuff keys.

593
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,831
Half the stabilizer's damaged.

594
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,333
Suit's not gonna work.

595
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,207
They took my Amulet.

596
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,838
And without it, I'm guessing you're just...

597
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,671
A fifth-degree black belt with
training in edged weapons combat.

598
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,428
Nice, but I think we'll need more
than that to get past super-Krieger.

599
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,714
What are you doing?

600
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,474
Told you I had a plan.

601
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,802
Just to get my hands on this
and enhance it.

602
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,185
But not for them.

603
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,893
I'm not "only a man in a metal suit."

604
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,023
At least, not after this.

605
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,148
Stay back!

606
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,984
We are under attack.

607
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,366
Baron Krieger has ordered us to
transport you to a more secure location.

608
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,318
Who's attacking you?

609
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:15,490
Sir. The sentries are reporting a man
made of fire flying through the forest.

610
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,080
Lock down the base. Now.

611
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,861
REX: <i>Firestorm is drawing the troops away
from the bunker.</i>

612
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,772
Copy that.
We still need to find Ray and Amaya.

613
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,784
Mick, look out!

614
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,123
RORY: Thanks, Haircut.

615
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,579
I believe this belongs to you.

616
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,086
Steel, Mid-Nite,
we've recovered the rest of the team.

617
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,428
I suggest you save the teary reunion
for later.

618
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,213
Hourman ordered the bombers to strike.

619
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,595
<i>They're five minutes out.</i>

620
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,100
But <i>Herr</i> Krieger is here right now!

621
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,899
Come on, you Nazi bastard.

622
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,261
- Get on!
- What are you doing here?

623
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,298
Saving you! Get on!

624
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,982
REX: <i>Bombing run about to commence.
All points, get clear.</i>

625
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,526
Working on it!

626
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,049
What was that?

627
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,381
He's dead.

628
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,512
You did it. You saved us.

629
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,904
GIDEON: <i>I'm afraid Mr. Heywood's vitals
are dropping.</i>

630
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,322
There's got to be something
on board this tub

631
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,527
to get him back on his feet.

632
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,866
You people are from the future,
for God's sake.

633
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,952
The bomb blast caused massive
internal bleeding.

634
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,542
And because his body
lacks the normal clotting factor,

635
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,331
there's only so much Gideon can do.

636
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,961
Were you two close?

637
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,504
No, not really.

638
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,047
But if it wasn't for Nate,

639
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,803
I'd still be trapped
in the Cretaceous Period,

640
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,679
being chased by a T. Rex.

641
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,220
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,552
This is our fight, not yours.

643
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,187
- The Nazis are not...
- "Nazis."

644
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,643
Nazis.

645
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,145
You kept the serum?

646
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,525
There may be enough.

647
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,404
I think I can save him. With this.

648
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,863
Is that the Nazi serum that created
that hideous berserker?

649
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,572
- Are you mad?
- I did a little tinkering

650
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,737
- to the formula, so...
- So what will it do now?

651
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,906
With any luck, save his life.

652
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,495
How do we know if it's working?

653
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,536
He's not dead yet, so that's a good sign.

654
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,750
And he's not turning into
a Nazi berserker.

655
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,545
His vitals are improving.

656
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,383
He's stabilizing.

657
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,060
RORY: What'd the Nazis want with
a piece of jewelry, anyway?

658
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,719
No idea.

659
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,606
Hitler is known to be obsessed
with the strange.

660
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,892
We'll keep it safe, in any case.

661
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,732
I guess that's your way of
saying "thanks."

662
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,782
Right. Well, I think it's time
we got out of 1942.

663
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,529
This was fun.

664
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,286
It was unusual.

665
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:28,621
Hey, I wanted to apologize for
what I said.

666
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,460
About me not being a hero?

667
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,121
You're not a superhero.

668
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,711
But what you did for Nate,

669
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,090
giving him the serum,
giving up your chance at real powers,

670
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,630
that was heroic.

671
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,143
It's about time, Sleeping Beauty.

672
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,232
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up in time
for me to say goodbye.

673
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,945
Here I was afraid
I wasn't going to wake up at all.

674
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,152
I was afraid of that, too.

675
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,415
I'm sorry if I didn't live up

676
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,748
to the version of Commander Steel
you dreamt of meeting.

677
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,248
Nah. I like the real version better.

678
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,836
Well, I'll be damned.

679
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,226
I guess this means
we're both gonna make it.

680
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,187
Not bad for a historian.

681
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,769
Not bad for a hero.

682
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,370
Hello, Rex.

683
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,660
- Who are you?
- We've met before.

684
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,998
Quite a number of times, actually.

685
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,290
In fact, after our last go,
you discovered my plan.

686
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,881
And then traveled through time yourself
to stop the Legends from coming here.

687
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,007
They said I disappeared.

688
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,055
Not "disappeared." No.

689
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,391
Erased from the timeline.

690
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,182
- Like this.
- No!

691
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:22,689
AMAYA: <i>Rex?</i>

692
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,986
Rex?

693
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,487
Rex. Rex.

694
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,413
Time...

695
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,201
Time traveler.

696
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,497
Rex!
