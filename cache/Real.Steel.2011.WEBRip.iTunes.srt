1
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,530
Hang on, hang on. Come on.

2
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,951
Where are you, Charlie?
More importantly, where is my money?

3
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,246
- You're into me for 30 grand.
-                 Jack, I'm going to pay you.

4
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,832
This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.

5
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,377
You owe Jack money, too?
You pay me first!

6
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:35,215
Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your
money. It's right here in my hand.

7
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,217
Why don't we meet up on the...?

8
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,892
- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello?
-                 I'm losing you.

9
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,394
I can't hear what you're say...

10
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,691
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

11
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,570
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?

12
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,240
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

13
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,701
Give me a minute.

14
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,083
This...

15
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,421
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

16
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,778
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually he's going to fight...

17
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,363
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

18
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,864
Can we get a picture with him?

19
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,574
Sure. For five dollars.

20
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,826
You want five dollars? Seriously?

21
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,496
No, I want five dollars immediately.

22
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,248
Come on, guys.

23
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,211
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks.
- Whatever.

24
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,130
- How about $2.50?
- You suck!

25
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,678
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

26
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,475
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

27
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:12,187
Please take your seats. We're almost
ready to get this thing started.

28
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,859
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

29
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,653
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

30
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:24,741
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time
has not been good to you, my friend.

31
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,413
- Ricky, we got a big problem here.
- Slow down there, hoss.

32
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:34,168
Last time I saw you, you were staring
at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

33
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,670
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

34
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,591
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,553
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

36
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,346
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

37
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,515
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

38
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,267
I'll tell you something.

39
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,646
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid! How about that?

40
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,192
Get the hell out of here.

41
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,782
Why don't we make this more interesting.
My bot against your bull, straight up.

42
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,993
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

43
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,704
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand?
- In a safe in my truck.

44
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,667
All right, Charlie.

45
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,963
Twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

46
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,466
I'll come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

47
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,801
You know that I can do that
because I already done done it!

48
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,722
In life you get too close, in the ring
you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

49
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:33,977
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that
once again. You want to dance again?

50
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,439
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.

51
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,567
Don't touch that bull.

52
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,820
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

53
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,406
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

54
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,245
Now, listen, friends, I understand

55
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:55,123
we can't all afford to go
all the way over there to Dallas

56
00:06:55,332 --> 00:07:00,170
and pay $300 for one of those
World Robot Boxing League fights.

57
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,423
So, I decided that I would bring
a robot boxing match

58
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,010
right here to our little fair
here in San Leandro.

59
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,428
How about that?

60
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,686
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

61
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,397
Ambush!

62
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,898
Let's do it!

63
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,902
All right, big fella.

64
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,285
He's a big fella, ain't he?

65
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,955
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

66
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,794
Show them some power.

67
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,756
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

68
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,301
Yeah, big fella.

69
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,512
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

70
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,723
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

71
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,642
ladies and gentlemen,

72
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,478
Black Thunder!

73
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,649
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.

74
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,905
Is that all you got?

75
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,867
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

76
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,295
Take him, take him.

77
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,217
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

78
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,140
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

79
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,104
OK. Jump, now!

80
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,697
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

81
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,201
but when you mess with the bull,
you're going to get the horns.

82
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,373
You like that. I can tell.
You like that.

83
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,417
Turn around!

84
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,715
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

85
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,770
Come on. We're still in this thing.
Just hop. Hop.

86
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,314
That's it. Come on.

87
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,904
Ricky, enough! Enough!

88
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,241
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

89
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,744
Kill! Kill! Kill!

90
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,414
Come on, get up.

91
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,708
Get up! Come on!

92
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,421
No!

93
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,219
Come on, no. No, no, no!

94
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,979
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our warriors out here today

95
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,732
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

96
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,775
Thank you for coming out,

97
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,571
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

98
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,656
Give me that leg.

99
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,658
Sure. For five dollars.

100
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,535
Boo-yah!

101
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:25,125
All right! That was ridonculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

102
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,630
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

103
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,840
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!

104
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,719
- Everybody say "ho!"
- Ho!

105
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:39,097
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

106
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,491
My keys, damn it.

107
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,369
One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

108
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,662
Charlie, relax.

109
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,748
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus
fight. It cost me my last robot.

110
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:05,749
Just listen to us.

111
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,709
Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

112
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:11,421
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen
her in ten years. What does she want?

113
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,215
Nothing. She died.

114
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,509
Do you recall Max Kenton?

115
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,054
He's my son. He's got to be nine.

116
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,848
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

117
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,851
Is he dead, too?

118
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,770
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

119
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,758
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

120
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,219
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

121
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:03,891
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.
Father, Charles Kenton.

122
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,059
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

123
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:11,565
Yes. As I've already told you,
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

124
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,152
and we can more than provide for Max.

125
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,697
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

126
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,741
next of kin retains custody.

127
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,077
Charles Kenton,
who is aware of this custody hearing,

128
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,579
and we are expecting him...

129
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,248
I need a new robot now.

130
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,751
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

131
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,252
I got to show up with something.

132
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:37,257
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

133
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,010
How much? That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

134
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,471
I can live with that.

135
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,224
I don't have it.

136
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,436
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights
to custody right after the boy was born.

137
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,105
I can more than provide for Max.

138
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,651
Please be Charles Kenton.

139
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,197
Charlie, yeah.

140
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,867
I'm here to sign some paper
that releases my rights

141
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,953
to the custody of my son.

142
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,996
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

143
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,456
Charlie.

144
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,875
Do you even remember me?

145
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,254
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, Debra. How are you?

146
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,297
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.

147
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,804
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

148
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:24,972
Yes, you may.

149
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,849
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

150
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,518
You can spend some time
with him, if you'd like.

151
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,311
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

152
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,313
- Max. Your son?
- All right.

153
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,191
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

154
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,903
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

155
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,531
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

156
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,039
Your Honor, I'd like to,
at this juncture,

157
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,792
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

158
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:54,960
Please.

159
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,926
Come on. Come on. There you are.

160
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,722
He'll be in a foster home.

161
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,976
No, they find good families.
Young. Energetic. Yeah.

162
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,772
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

163
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,987
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

164
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,073
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

165
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,537
- I'm up for it. But...
- Seventy-five grand.

166
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,791
$75,000? You're serious?

167
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:38,962
The thing is...

168
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,216
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

169
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,051
with my oldest friend and his wife.

170
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,261
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

171
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,804
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

172
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,224
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

173
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,186
In August. A hundred.

174
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,230
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

175
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,649
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

176
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:02,152
if you tell her I just signed over
that kid to the state of Texas.

177
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,864
There's a real way everyone gets
what they want here.

178
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,158
So here's what you're going to do.

179
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,370
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

180
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,664
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

181
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,250
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

182
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,627
for being such
a terrible absentee dad,

183
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:22,881
how I want to make good with junior,
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

184
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,927
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero
and everybody wins.

185
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,725
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

186
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,270
I understand.

187
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,647
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

188
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,108
and the other 50
when we get back in August

189
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,110
and you deliver him to us in New York.

190
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,445
Pleasure doing business with you.

191
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,576
Your Honor,
I'm happy we all took the time

192
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,244
to make the best decision for everyone.

193
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,291
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

194
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,711
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

195
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,422
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

196
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,730
Hello?

197
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,232
Bailey?

198
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,026
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

199
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,486
and it smells like disaster to me.

200
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,988
Nice to see you, too.

201
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,991
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up.

202
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,661
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower? Come on.

203
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,580
Let me make something clear.

204
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,583
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

205
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,002
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

206
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,004
Putting aside the fact
that you're doing

207
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,924
what I'm guessing is
a black market deal on my doorstep,

208
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,009
how will you pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

209
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,011
The money is on its way.
Just distract him.

210
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,554
I have been. It's exhausting.

211
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,598
- You're the best.
- Yeah? Really?

212
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,768
Is that why you're buying a $45,000
robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

213
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,269
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

214
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:04,691
Six. There is a guy with real money
who wants to buy this place.

215
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,027
Come on. Like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

216
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,239
If you don't make rent, I can't make
payments and I won't have a choice.

217
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,907
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass if you sold this place.

218
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,201
My father would climb out of his grave

219
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,702
and kick your ass.

220
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,373
Bailey?

221
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:26,505
- Don't.
- Don't what?

222
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,089
Don't do that.

223
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,219
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

224
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,682
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

225
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,934
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

226
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,021
I used to. Once. Briefly.
Now I like money more.

227
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,900
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

228
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,362
Marvin.

229
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,448
Your money has arrived.

230
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,869
Marv.

231
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,500
Fifty grand, as promised.

232
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:09,590
Here are all our numbers
and contact info over in Europe.

233
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,383
So that's everything there.

234
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,097
So Marvin tells me
you want this time with Max.

235
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,474
- Yeah.
- You did the right thing,

236
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,767
giving me custody.

237
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,269
Caroline would have wanted that.

238
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,190
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

239
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,775
That's a deal.

240
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:33,405
OK, let's go get Max.
OK? Let's get Max.

241
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,370
It's OK. You want to go around
the other side here and I'll get Max?

242
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,292
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

243
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,921
Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

244
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,182
I'm Charlie.

245
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,813
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

246
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,024
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

247
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,234
Do you know where they're going?

248
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,277
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

249
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,779
So how did I get stuck here with you?

250
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,782
Relax, kid. You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

251
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,950
Charlie!

252
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,577
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

253
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,831
- Did Marvin give you that money?
- Here, just close the deal.

254
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,500
I'll be right there, OK?

255
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,632
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

256
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,718
Max Kenton.

257
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,055
- So this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

258
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,557
Don't worry about it, OK?

259
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,184
I'm looking at you two and...

260
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,645
Just go and put Noisy
in the shop, please? Thank you.

261
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,529
You're going to stay here with her
while I'm on the road.

262
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,490
- How much did he give you?
- You're coming at this the wrong way.

263
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,325
No, tell me. I want to know.

264
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,704
Fifty thousand, OK?

265
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,206
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

266
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,833
Will you shut up now?

267
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,626
You sold me?

268
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,379
Sounds worse than it is.

269
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,215
- Really.
- It's to take care of you.

270
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,758
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

271
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,595
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

272
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,055
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

273
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,724
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

274
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,060
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

275
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,523
I don't have it! I spent the money
on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

276
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,025
I'm through here.

277
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,660
What do we got?

278
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,495
Noisy Boy has arrived.

279
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,082
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

280
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,753
- He's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

281
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,422
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

282
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,716
Maybe that's why you got
such a good price, genius.

283
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,304
Decided to stay?

284
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,099
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

285
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,936
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks.

286
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,813
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

287
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,526
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

288
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,277
Noisy Boy's in there.
You ever heard of him?

289
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:21,031
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

290
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,289
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

291
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,128
His composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.

292
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,924
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

293
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,801
He should have had him
in the third round,

294
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,637
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

295
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,653
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

296
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,697
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

297
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,407
You know he has voice recognition,
right?

298
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:05,284
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

299
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,327
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

300
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:10,080
Brazilians are crazy
about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

301
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,668
Right, left, uppercut!

302
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:21,842
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

303
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,219
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

304
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,889
- Let me see if I can fix it.
- Look how good he looks, too.

305
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,016
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

306
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,351
- Why didn't you ask to look at it?
- Relax!

307
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,358
Was that Japanese?

308
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,115
Let me see if I can reset him
to English.

309
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,742
How do you know Japanese?

310
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,368
Video games.

311
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,121
You play video games in Japanese?

312
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,915
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

313
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,172
Give me that.

314
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,550
He's reset to English,
and I found his command matrix.

315
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,969
They have pre-loaded
a bunch of combinations.

316
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,472
They should be listed here.

317
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:11,892
Top salvo!

318
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,188
What did I tell you?

319
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,066
Gravity One Downtown!

320
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,405
I was due for some good luck!

321
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,115
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

322
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:30,160
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

323
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,009
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

324
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,803
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

325
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,763
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

326
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:53,725
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

327
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,645
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

328
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,440
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

329
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,945
- Don't do that again.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

330
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,697
Don't do this again?

331
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:09,658
Get in. Just get in.
Give me the keys first.

332
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,411
Wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.

333
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,335
Sweet ride.

334
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,172
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.

335
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,737
I'm taking all bets!

336
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,014
Keep up. Stay close.

337
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,145
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

338
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,689
- All right, all right.
- Come on, man!

339
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,818
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

340
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,946
That's Noisy Boy!

341
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,827
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

342
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,205
- Sure you want to fight him tonight?
- What do you got?

343
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,541
He can take any bot in this place.
You know it.

344
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,710
You can have any undercard you want.

345
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,212
Five thousand guaranteed.

346
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,257
A thousand every round
your bot survives.

347
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,259
Fight till the death!

348
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:55,389
No. Give me the main event.

349
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,724
- Come on.
- This is Noisy Boy.

350
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,393
An original Tak Mashido bot.

351
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,229
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

352
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,859
You want to fight Midas?

353
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,153
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

354
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,616
Fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.

355
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,618
Listen, listen. No, look.

356
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,412
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

357
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,790
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash and get out of here!

358
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,250
First, there is no "we."

359
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,587
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

360
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,423
We'll take Midas!

361
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,605
Tonight, our main event

362
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:49,735
features the gold-blooded killer!

363
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,655
This pimped-out punk

364
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:57,534
is programmed for pain!

365
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:03,332
I give to you the mighty Midas!

366
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,084
Against a bot

367
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:52,005
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

368
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:58,011
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home,

369
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,514
and he's ready to make some noise!

370
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:04,351
Take your first look in a long time

371
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,189
at Noisy Boy!

372
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,896
Crash Palace,

373
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:53,901
who's ready for some destruction?!

374
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,655
Let's make some money! Come on!

375
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:01,575
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

376
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,744
Noisy Boy against Midas.

377
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:07,164
You've been waiting all night
for this matchup, Crash Palace!

378
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:14,713
Scimitar right!

379
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:19,510
Did you see that?

380
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,763
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

381
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,099
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

382
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,268
Skull salvo! Firefight!

383
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,982
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

384
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:37,778
Shockfist!

385
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,824
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

386
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,703
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

387
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,708
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

388
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,380
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

389
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,635
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

390
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,179
I got something for you.

391
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:08,475
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

392
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:11,687
Get up!

393
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:15,941
That's illegal!

394
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,193
This is the underworld.
There are no rules!

395
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,654
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

396
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,030
No. Hands up!

397
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,242
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

398
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:30,831
He's getting killed in there!

399
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:37,629
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

400
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:39,089
Panic Shield!

401
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:42,092
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

402
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:48,849
No, no. Shatter Punch!

403
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:54,855
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

404
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,070
Jab, jab!

405
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,621
Right roundhouse!

406
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:14,124
Did he just spit his juice
in Midas's face?

407
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,835
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

408
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,379
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

409
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:20,631
Use your left!

410
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,383
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

411
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:26,720
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

412
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,436
No, no! Get up!

413
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,189
Get some!

414
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,943
Move! Get out of the corner!

415
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,530
Midas! Midas! Midas!

416
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:49,826
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

417
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,995
I got something for you! You ready?

418
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:57,417
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

419
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,337
And so long to Noisy Boy.

420
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,162
That sucked. You hungry?

421
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,000
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

422
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,961
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

423
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,881
I need to find a mainframe. What?

424
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,300
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

425
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,218
Fine. More for me.

426
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:49,803
Here, drink this.

427
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:51,638
You never should have taken that fight.

428
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:53,974
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

429
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:57,477
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

430
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,855
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

431
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:03,358
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

432
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:06,153
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

433
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,822
- You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.

434
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:10,490
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

435
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,368
Was. Was a great robot
back in the League, back in the day.

436
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:17,497
But look around you. This place is
where once great robots go to die.

437
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,082
So throw him away.

438
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,336
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you throw away.

439
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:25,589
Wow.

440
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,343
It's been a long night.

441
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,720
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

442
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,681
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

443
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,003
They gave me 400 for his head.

444
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,232
You stay put.
I'm going to look for parts.

445
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,402
I'm coming with you.
That drink has my heart pounding.

446
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,696
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

447
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,322
Whatever. Just keep up.

448
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,335
Crap.

449
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:46,837
Stay back.

450
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,225
All right, keep up.

451
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,396
These searchlights are automated,
but you got to time them right,

452
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:05,606
so stay close.

453
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,444
It's all right.

454
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,946
Come on, come on.

455
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,325
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

456
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,120
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

457
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,498
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

458
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:29,296
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

459
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,635
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

460
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,445
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

461
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:56,114
Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

462
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,283
- Hey, look.
- What?

463
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,454
It's so small.

464
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,248
Yeah. That's before your time.

465
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:07,501
That's a Generation One,
the very first fighting bot.

466
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,879
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.

467
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:13,757
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Put that in the cart.

468
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:17,052
- What changed?
- A good question. Human boxing.

469
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,137
- It just faded.
- Why?

470
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:24,560
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.

471
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,813
You had the whole Brazilian underground,
the Gracies, the Machados,

472
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:31,149
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,
and a thousand styles in between.

473
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,693
Full-on ground-and-pound.

474
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,111
- Look at this.
- What's that?

475
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:35,445
I don't know.

476
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:36,905
Not bad. Good spot.

477
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,075
You still had human fighters,
human bodies,

478
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:42,494
so you couldn't give the people
what they really wanted:

479
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,955
true, no-holds-barred violence.

480
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,751
The next logical step,

481
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,046
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

482
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,424
Do you miss it?

483
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,429
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

484
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,014
What? I want to know.

485
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,932
Careful, you're on a cliff.

486
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,565
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

487
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,285
Charlie, help me!

488
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,019
Charlie!

489
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,106
- Charlie!
- Max! Max!

490
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,068
Max!

491
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,491
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

492
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:06,662
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

493
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,208
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.

494
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:15,212
That's it! I've got you!
You don't have to be scared. I got you!

495
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,714
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

496
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,217
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

497
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:25,806
Just give me your other hand very
slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

498
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,475
Look at me.
We're going to do this together.

499
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:31,854
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

500
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:36,316
One... two... three!

501
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:43,699
That's it. I got you!
I got you. I got you. I got you.

502
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,583
You're safe. You're safe.

503
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:57,838
All right, I got you.

504
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:59,423
- You all right?
- Yeah.

505
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,967
Come here. Easy. Easy.

506
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,220
You all right?

507
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:06,763
- You all right?
- Yeah.

508
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,807
I told you it was dangerous.

509
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,226
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

510
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:27,242
Charlie, I think
there's a whole robot in there.

511
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,702
So what? Let's go. Come on.

512
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,371
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.

513
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,917
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

514
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,045
Just bring the cart to the edge.
I'll use the winch to get him out.

515
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,590
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

516
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,322
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

517
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,489
That's it.

518
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:32,326
His head does make a nice addition
to the front of the Crash Palace.

519
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:36,538
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

520
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,833
Good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

521
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,794
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

522
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,213
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

523
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,507
- There's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

524
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:49,593
All your junk is... it's junk.

525
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:53,847
You're not even in the game anymore.

526
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,891
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

527
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,726
Don't get loud with me.

528
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:59,728
- You're your problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?

529
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,731
I have been here for you a long time.

530
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,568
In the ring, out of the ring, and the
whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

531
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:10,781
My father invested everything he had
in your fight career. We loved...

532
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:17,204
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

533
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:20,541
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

534
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,252
What's yours?

535
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,682
You're done, right?

536
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,603
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

537
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:44,273
I got nothing left.

538
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,359
All right.

539
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,530
Maybe there's something here.

540
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:56,702
This robot the kid brought in last
night. Would you look at it for me?

541
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,412
Please?

542
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:11,925
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.

543
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:16,638
I found a power cell that fits him, and
I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

544
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:18,932
You can move him around, but he's crap.

545
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,977
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

546
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:23,353
Stop.

547
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,105
It's my robot!

548
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:28,859
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there. He's mine.

549
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:32,571
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts
we're putting in him are mine!

550
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:37,284
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him.

551
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,744
What happened to you?

552
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,181
Watch out. Stay back.

553
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:20,661
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

554
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,872
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory.

555
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,834
- Is there anything here we could use?
- Not much.

556
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,043
There's a bucket...

557
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:31,505
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck.

558
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,508
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

559
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:37,511
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

560
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,848
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

561
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:43,350
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

562
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:46,854
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

563
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,773
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

564
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:51,483
Cool.

565
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:27,227
"Atom."

566
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:37,905
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

567
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:39,406
I don't think he was
ever a boxing robot.

568
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:43,577
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

569
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,037
They must have built robots
like this one

570
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,247
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

571
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,583
OK, so can we get him a fight?

572
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,336
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

573
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:55,088
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

574
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:56,798
You could always sell him off for parts.

575
00:45:57,007 --> 00:46:00,385
- Can't you get him a fight?
- "Why can't you get him a fight?"

576
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,262
God, you don't quit, do you?

577
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:05,307
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

578
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:08,352
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

579
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,689
The places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants.

580
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:15,150
Excellent. Get him a fight.

581
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:22,324
Stubborn kid.

582
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,326
Surprise, surprise.

583
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:06,994
Let's take a walk.

584
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,106
Can you understand me?

585
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:29,243
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

586
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:56,061
You've known Charlie a long time.

587
00:48:57,187 --> 00:49:00,482
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

588
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:03,777
My dad, he trained him.

589
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:07,614
That's them. That's Charlie.

590
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:12,077
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

591
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,453
As anything.

592
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:18,250
He was something.
He was lean, tough.

593
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,252
No quit, no fear.

594
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,800
Come here. I want to show you something.

595
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,639
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

596
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:36,476
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

597
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,020
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

598
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:42,149
I was. Charlie was supposed to be
a warm-up fight, an easy win.

599
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:45,652
Nico wasn't even supposed
to break a sweat, but...

600
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:51,200
...nobody told Charlie that, so he
just kept coming and coming at him.

601
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,701
Check this out.

602
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:56,914
That's Charlie.

603
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:00,334
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls

604
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:06,173
on this nobody. But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

605
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,091
- Really?
- Really.

606
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,927
He was toying with Nico.

607
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:12,679
The top contender,
number two in the world,

608
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:14,890
and Charlie was dancing with him.

609
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:19,686
Charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night.

610
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:22,689
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

611
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:25,442
I could.

612
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,446
He was beautiful.

613
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:31,907
He was beautiful.

614
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:37,538
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

615
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:41,375
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

616
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,335
Second time for good. Lights out.

617
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:44,837
You were ahead on the scorecards

618
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,130
- going into the 12th round.
- Nico Tandy rung my bell

619
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,133
and went on to be the undefeated
world champ for the next three years.

620
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,302
- He knocked you out?
- Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

621
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:53,804
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

622
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:58,267
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career.
- But every fight a knockout.

623
00:50:58,475 --> 00:50:59,893
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

624
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:01,520
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

625
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:04,147
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

626
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:06,441
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

627
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,485
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

628
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:12,072
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

629
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,907
Wow. Here.

630
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,244
Keep it.

631
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:21,039
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

632
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:27,421
I like that kid.

633
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,673
He likes you.

634
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:38,098
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

635
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,393
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

636
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:44,771
to see if I can get a partner
or raise money to get a new bot.

637
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:49,818
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

638
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:56,325
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

639
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:05,834
OK.

640
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:43,038
Look.

641
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:52,923
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

642
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:54,591
Yeah.

643
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:02,099
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds
with this monster. Two rounds!

644
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:05,394
The champ puts his Real Steel world
championship belt on the line tonight.

645
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,521
He just may have a real fight
on his hands.

646
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:13,026
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time.
Ever. End of story. Good night!

647
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,363
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

648
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:20,534
Come on.

649
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:25,497
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

650
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:27,374
I want you to stay in this area.

651
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,545
Out of the way. Champ coming through.
Zeus coming through.

652
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:33,213
Move, move. Champ coming through.

653
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,604
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father/daughter Zeus team.

654
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:52,316
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

655
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,318
You're very kind,

656
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:58,363
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

657
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:03,118
What did it take to lure
the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

658
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:06,455
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport

659
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:08,123
out of retirement?

660
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,418
Why don't you ask him yourself?

661
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,926
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

662
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:24,556
Zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight.

663
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:26,725
With his adaptive operating system,

664
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:31,813
he recognizes patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously.

665
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:36,443
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...?

666
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:40,906
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring...

667
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:45,160
...the result of any fight is inevitable.

668
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,913
What Zeus sees...

669
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:50,749
...he kills.

670
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:53,961
Sweet.

671
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:24,408
I'm never going into business with you.

672
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:25,826
I just need a break here.

673
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:28,662
You got that old bot truck out there.
You always got something in there.

674
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:31,290
I got an old sparring bot,
ain't worth the paint left on it.

675
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,000
What am I supposed to do with that?

676
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,836
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

677
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:38,005
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

678
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,007
I just need a little loan.

679
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:42,593
What?

680
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,429
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

681
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:47,764
Couple hundred. Few hundred.
Whatever you got.

682
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:50,309
You know I'm good for it.

683
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:54,229
I know you, and as much
as I like you, dude...

684
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,065
...you're a bad bet, brother.

685
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:01,987
Right, yeah.

686
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:24,551
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

687
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,512
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

688
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,931
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

689
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:31,058
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

690
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:35,354
He was just peppering Axelrod with
punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

691
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:39,066
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.

692
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,317
Is that what you think boxing is?

693
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:42,486
Zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him?

694
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:45,489
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

695
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:48,200
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

696
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:51,370
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

697
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:54,915
He's more than that.
If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

698
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:58,085
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

699
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,920
Tomorrow afternoon,
you'll get your fight.

700
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,381
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

701
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,801
I told you I hate hamburgers!

702
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,806
It's a burrito!

703
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,400
Right uppercut.

704
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:25,863
Left uppercut.

705
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:32,411
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

706
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:38,709
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

707
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,128
You been up all night?

708
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:42,671
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

709
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,175
I'm using shadow mode to program some
fight moves and sync them to the remote.

710
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:49,595
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

711
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,972
That's lethal stuff.

712
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:53,307
Let's do this.

713
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:56,435
Let's do breakfast first.

714
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,682
You know you're bringing him
home in pieces, right?

715
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,061
We'll see.

716
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:50,197
- Let me deal with this.
- Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

717
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:52,115
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

718
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:54,743
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

719
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:56,495
We on a field trip?

720
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:01,124
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

721
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,085
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for one two-minute round.

722
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,503
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

723
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:08,257
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

724
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:10,968
How about 500 for two rounds?

725
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:15,556
Two rounds. Son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

726
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:18,225
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

727
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:20,894
Let's just say he does.

728
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:26,108
If he's still standing after one round...

729
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,735
...I'll give you a thousand bucks.

730
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:29,987
Shut it!

731
00:59:34,116 --> 00:59:37,411
But if he dies in there,
which he will, junior...

732
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:41,623
...I get to keep what's left.

733
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,626
Take the hundred.

734
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:46,336
Deal.

735
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:49,923
We're on. We on!

736
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:54,303
Let's go!

737
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:56,638
- You should have taken the hundred.
- I got us a thousand.

738
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,140
Yeah, if he wins.

739
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,459
You want me to drive?

740
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:27,127
He's my bot. I got this!

741
01:00:27,336 --> 01:00:30,506
This ain't a video game.
This is for real. Right here.

742
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:33,842
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

743
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:35,177
All right.

744
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:38,263
I got this.

745
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,641
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

746
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:44,478
Let's get it on like
Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

747
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:47,314
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

748
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:01,703
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

749
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:04,206
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

750
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,168
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

751
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,630
Here comes the sledgehammer.

752
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,886
Did you see that?

753
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:21,348
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.

754
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:23,350
Slip right. Back step.

755
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:25,227
Duck.

756
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:27,688
- You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!

757
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:28,856
Actually, I think I am.

758
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:35,153
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.

759
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:43,704
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!

760
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:47,875
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

761
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,096
He can take a hit. I'll give you this.
Your bot can take a hit.

762
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,059
You better slip that headlock.
This ain't gonna end well for you.

763
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:07,227
I'm trying!

764
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:16,153
Thirty seconds!

765
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:19,323
Thirty... Half a minute.

766
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,993
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

767
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:27,873
You've got 20 seconds!

768
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,919
That's a thousand bucks.
Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

769
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:33,754
Move, then. Move!

770
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:42,262
Come on.

771
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:44,306
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

772
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,894
Count with me! Count with me! One!

773
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:52,272
- Get up!
- You know you're talking to a machine?

774
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:54,816
Four! Five! Six!

775
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:56,443
Get up, Atom!

776
01:02:56,652 --> 01:02:58,987
All the way up! All the way up!

777
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:03,534
Yes! Yes!

778
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,790
I'm going to fix it!

779
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,794
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

780
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:15,420
- This thousand bucks...
- Yeah, thousand.

781
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:17,339
...double or nothing
he can't make another round.

782
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,091
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

783
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:21,635
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

784
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:24,137
Are you crazy?
You threw away a thousand bucks!

785
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:26,306
He can barely stand up in there.

786
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:29,059
Look. I really need the money.

787
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,479
I know. Let's work.

788
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:35,190
Jesus.

789
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:42,906
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

790
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,714
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!

791
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,009
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

792
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:08,765
- Yes!
- No!

793
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:12,477
Start the count!

794
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:13,854
Start the count!

795
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:17,524
One! Two! Three!

796
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:21,695
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

797
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,697
Eight! Nine!

798
01:04:23,906 --> 01:04:24,865
Ten!

799
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:29,286
You did it! We did it! Wow!

800
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,169
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

801
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:41,882
I know, I know! I know! I know!

802
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,675
Kingpin, pay up.

803
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:46,887
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

804
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,473
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

805
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:52,559
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

806
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:57,189
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.

807
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:59,233
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

808
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:11,828
Bailey, it's me. He won.

809
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:15,082
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

810
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,210
I know.

811
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:22,881
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

812
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:25,467
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

813
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:30,264
Anyway...

814
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:34,268
I just wanted you to know.

815
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,095
Jab, jab, hook.

816
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,350
Jab, jab, hook.

817
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:19,980
I think you have to move your feet.

818
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:26,653
Your feet. Feet.

819
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:47,985
Nice moves, kid.

820
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:51,572
How long you been out here?

821
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:54,032
Check it out.

822
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:56,535
I just spent the night
doing something I think is amazing.

823
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:58,579
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

824
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:01,582
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

825
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,958
I killed it. Got rid of it.

826
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,918
We don't need it anymore.

827
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:06,253
How did you...?

828
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:08,714
I had to start over.

829
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:11,466
But I was able to use
the spin frame from Ambush

830
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:14,178
and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy,

831
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:15,387
and it works.

832
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:18,640
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

833
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:19,892
What works?

834
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:22,769
I got to turn it on.

835
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,899
Left jab, right uppercut!

836
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:30,027
Japan!

837
01:08:30,234 --> 01:08:32,738
You put Noisy's voice recognition
into Atom?

838
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:34,990
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart?

839
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,450
It could be genius!

840
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:39,286
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

841
01:08:39,493 --> 01:08:42,456
Easy there, chief.
Did you drink all these sodas?

842
01:08:42,663 --> 01:08:45,667
I might have had a few.
I need you to teach him to box.

843
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:49,837
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced
enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

844
01:08:50,046 --> 01:08:52,090
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

845
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:54,760
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it.

846
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:56,636
You were a boxer.

847
01:08:56,845 --> 01:09:01,183
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see
things happen before they even happened.

848
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,685
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.

849
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:06,270
- Who's going to teach him to fight?
- You're doing fine.

850
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,273
You don't need me. Sorry.

851
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:14,654
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

852
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,783
You should do that on Saturday night.

853
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:20,661
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.

854
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:23,580
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

855
01:09:23,788 --> 01:09:27,000
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

856
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:30,379
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

857
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,714
People want to see something
they've never seen.

858
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:35,466
Look. You think of all the greats.

859
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:38,345
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

860
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:40,221
they all had their nicknames.

861
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,392
They had their personas.
They all had flair.

862
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,020
Now you? You might not have much robot,
but with that dance, you got flair.

863
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:51,483
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

864
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:54,361
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.

865
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,196
Are you sure you're 11?

866
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,491
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

867
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:03,871
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

868
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:09,376
You're really not messing with me?

869
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:11,920
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

870
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:16,925
- Cool.
- But...

871
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:20,095
- What?
- I won't do it unless you help me.

872
01:10:22,472 --> 01:10:24,183
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

873
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,059
No. Boxing.

874
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:27,561
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

875
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:29,897
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

876
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,398
And you dance.

877
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:34,902
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

878
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:36,069
Deal.

879
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:39,239
Deal.

880
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:43,785
It's going to be cool.

881
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:40,092
Nice.

882
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,763
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.

883
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:46,640
That's it.

884
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:48,767
Nice.

885
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:55,816
You, too, old man?

886
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:58,819
Come on. Let's get to work.

887
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,657
Nice! Let's do that again.

888
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,494
Nice. Three-punch combo.

889
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:09,997
Combo.

890
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:12,749
Again. Again.

891
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:17,296
Faster. Faster. Nice.

892
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:21,049
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

893
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:23,135
Let's see how you move.

894
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:31,185
That's good.

895
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:09,515
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

896
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:27,908
That's it. Every time.

897
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,377
Upper cut!

898
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,344
Great fight, fellas.

899
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:58,814
105.5, WRUT,
the satellite home of robot boxing.

900
01:13:59,022 --> 01:14:00,649
Caller two, what do you got for me?

901
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:02,943
Have you heard about this little bot
out there, his name is Atom?

902
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:04,111
Oh, yeah.

903
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,780
My buddies and I saw him
the other night, and he dances.

904
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:08,866
- Did you say "dances"?
- You heard me.

905
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:11,159
He dances pre-fight
with this little kid,

906
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:12,744
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

907
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:15,664
You put the gimmick aside
for a second,

908
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:18,375
and I'm holding here a list
of the bots he's beaten.

909
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:23,130
Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack.
No slouches on that list, right?

910
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:25,048
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

911
01:14:25,257 --> 01:14:29,344
This bot is fast! He escapes shots
from these bigger bots, it's insane!

912
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:32,472
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners,
remember this name:

913
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:37,436
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.
This bot is one to watch.

914
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:45,110
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

915
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:46,987
Great fight.

916
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:48,655
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

917
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:50,699
We'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

918
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:52,910
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

919
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:56,496
Right. That's a WRB...
That's a League fight.

920
01:14:56,705 --> 01:15:00,709
Damn right it is. What do you say,
fellas? You ready for the show?

921
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:03,712
Heck, yeah.

922
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:15,349
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

923
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:19,353
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed.

924
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:22,356
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

925
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:24,733
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

926
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:28,695
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?

927
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:32,866
We've come too far to get out there
and freak out and blow this whole thing.

928
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:36,370
We're going to have fun,
and we're going to not freak out!

929
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:39,915
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

930
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:43,377
I've spent my whole life waiting
to get here. We're going to...

931
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:47,965
I tell you what. Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

932
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:50,884
- I got it.
- Good.

933
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:55,848
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

934
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:58,517
What was that? One more time.

935
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:01,103
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

936
01:16:01,812 --> 01:16:04,690
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up
to the champ's suite. Sure.

937
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:35,387
Wow.

938
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:39,516
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
- Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

939
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:41,643
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

940
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:44,104
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

941
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:48,400
I know you have a very important fight
tonight, so I'll get right to it.

942
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:52,070
It's a little far from the action for
my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

943
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:56,116
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

944
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:58,452
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...?

945
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,495
I'd like to buy your robot.

946
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:07,044
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.

947
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:11,215
$200,000.

948
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:12,799
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

949
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:15,594
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

950
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:21,350
You are 15 minutes away from getting
in the ring with Twin Cities,

951
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:23,393
a vicious League bot.

952
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:28,815
So, to be clear, my offer stands
until the starting bell.

953
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:33,153
OK. And just to be clear,
he's not for sale!

954
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:35,447
Not now, not ever.

955
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:38,825
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

956
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:41,828
Tak, how are you? Max!

957
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:46,375
Be smart. I know you love him,

958
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,002
but in 20 minutes
there may be nothing left to love.

959
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:52,256
- Think about it. Take the offer.
- You think about it.

960
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:56,552
Why does she want Atom?
Because he's different from other bots!

961
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,637
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller, weaker,

962
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,931
- and he's going to get his ass kicked.
- He's a boxer.

963
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:03,433
We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

964
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,061
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

965
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:09,773
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

966
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:12,860
We can go round and round this
all night long.

967
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,361
Look at me.

968
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:16,989
But it's not going to happen.

969
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,533
I got a fight to get to.

970
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:37,968
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

971
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:42,806
the march towards
the Real Steel Championship

972
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:46,018
makes its way through Detroit's

973
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:50,230
Virgin America Spectrum!

974
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:58,614
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

975
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:01,575
the two-headed tyrant,

976
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:06,079
Twin Cities!

977
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:41,740
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

978
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:45,452
hailing from parts unknown,

979
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:47,287
Atom!

980
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,428
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

981
01:20:44,636 --> 01:20:46,388
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

982
01:20:46,597 --> 01:20:49,224
- This bot is tough to put down.
- Atom can do it.

983
01:20:50,267 --> 01:20:53,228
Look over there. You see those geeks
with the joysticks and consoles?

984
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:55,105
They're controlling
everything their bot does.

985
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:56,440
They're monitoring his systems,

986
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:59,067
seeing what he sees,
stadium feeds of the fights.

987
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:01,195
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

988
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:03,280
we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

989
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,365
So what do we do?

990
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:09,703
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

991
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,915
Seriously, pray.

992
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:16,543
Ready!

993
01:21:17,794 --> 01:21:19,546
- Ready!
- Hands up.

994
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:21,965
Fighters ready! Fight!

995
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:26,887
Engage.

996
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:33,352
Slip! Right! Lean back.
Right, left! Cover up!

997
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:37,898
Duck! Left roundhouse!

998
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:42,027
Damn it.

999
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:53,038
Lean left! Lean right!
Cover up! Cover up!

1000
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:56,083
- What's going on in there?
- He's taking too many hits.

1001
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:03,257
Get your hands up!

1002
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:07,928
Get out of that corner! Move!

1003
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:13,433
He's getting killed in there!
Tell him what to do!

1004
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:16,353
That guy's got two heads, a foot
of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1005
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:18,313
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1006
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:25,571
Wait, wait, wait.

1007
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:29,116
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1008
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:31,785
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

1009
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:34,121
We got him!
See? Here it comes again!

1010
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:36,957
Duck! Spin!
Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

1011
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:40,335
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

1012
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:42,504
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1013
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:45,132
Got to get in close where
he can't use that size and reach on us!

1014
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:48,468
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!

1015
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:49,970
Yeah, it's working!

1016
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:51,972
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

1017
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,351
- These program modes aren't working.
- Left! Right hook, slip!

1018
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,063
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!
Duck left. Counter right!

1019
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:02,900
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

1020
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,986
Three-punch combo to the body!
Out! In! Counter!

1021
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:07,988
- Two-one-two!
- Two-one-two.

1022
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:09,656
Stay on him! Lunging right!

1023
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:15,162
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!

1024
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:21,710
We got a systems crash!

1025
01:23:21,919 --> 01:23:23,253
Get him, Atom!

1026
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:27,841
This is not happening, man.

1027
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,219
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!

1028
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:32,554
Spin right!

1029
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:35,849
Finish him!

1030
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:38,018
- Do it!
- Right uppercut!

1031
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:49,404
He's down!

1032
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,742
One! Two! Three!

1033
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:56,745
Four! Five! Six!

1034
01:23:56,954 --> 01:23:58,872
We got him. Stay down!

1035
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,751
He's out! He's out!

1036
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:09,842
Yeah!

1037
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:14,596
Corner!

1038
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:17,724
Corner! Corner.

1039
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:20,602
Victory!

1040
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:26,024
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds

1041
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:28,610
of the first round,

1042
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:30,404
Atom has defeat...

1043
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:34,283
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

1044
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:41,081
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

1045
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,583
How about that?

1046
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:48,422
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

1047
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,424
Farra Lemkova.

1048
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:58,515
That instead of buying my robot, using
your money to control this sport...

1049
01:24:58,724 --> 01:25:00,434
- That's it!
- I'm not done.

1050
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,103
Why not give the littlest guy
the biggest shot?

1051
01:25:03,812 --> 01:25:07,608
Because I bet if you give him a shot,
he'll surprise you!

1052
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,234
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1053
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:11,403
get a shot at the
Real Steel Championship?

1054
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,952
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1055
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:25,000
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1056
01:25:25,209 --> 01:25:28,128
You name it! We will be there!

1057
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,888
I'm going to get us that fight!

1058
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,811
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1059
01:25:57,741 --> 01:25:59,993
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

1060
01:26:00,202 --> 01:26:01,495
That's one thing to call it.

1061
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,038
A lot of people would like to see that.

1062
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:06,041
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1063
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,043
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

1064
01:26:08,252 --> 01:26:10,003
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

1065
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:13,298
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1066
01:26:13,507 --> 01:26:15,050
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

1067
01:26:15,259 --> 01:26:19,263
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
- OK. No, no, no.

1068
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:23,600
I remember now. Who's right?
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1069
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:25,686
All right, all right. All right.

1070
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:29,314
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

1071
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,984
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

1072
01:26:34,403 --> 01:26:35,863
- We set?
- Yeah.

1073
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:38,198
- Let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

1074
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:42,536
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

1075
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:45,497
I actually really was going to call you.

1076
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:47,416
Don't worry about that.

1077
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:49,585
That was a heck of a fight.

1078
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:52,045
Congratulations to both of you.
That was good.

1079
01:26:52,254 --> 01:26:55,048
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

1080
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:57,384
- Come on, man.
- What?

1081
01:26:57,593 --> 01:27:01,597
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

1082
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,557
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

1083
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:06,810
He thought that was a joke.
It wasn't a joke.

1084
01:27:07,019 --> 01:27:11,148
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

1085
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:13,942
I'm sure you do,

1086
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:17,112
but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

1087
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:22,451
All right. What do you want?
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1088
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:24,286
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

1089
01:27:24,494 --> 01:27:27,581
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1090
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:31,084
- Run! Come on. Keep up, keep up!
- Get him now!

1091
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:32,544
Run! Come on!

1092
01:27:34,463 --> 01:27:36,173
Get off him! Get off him!

1093
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:40,511
Come here!

1094
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:46,016
Hey, Ricky.

1095
01:27:46,225 --> 01:27:47,726
That's his money!
Leave him out of this!

1096
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:02,115
Stop!

1097
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:05,827
Stop!

1098
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:09,498
Take all his money. Take it all.

1099
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:14,586
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

1100
01:28:14,795 --> 01:28:16,296
He's my father!

1101
01:28:18,549 --> 01:28:23,262
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

1102
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:26,223
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1103
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:34,690
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1104
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:36,149
Let's go, boys.

1105
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:06,221
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1106
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:48,555
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

1107
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:51,808
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?
We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1108
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:56,146
It's not the Zeus people. I've been
thinking about all this, and...

1109
01:29:58,273 --> 01:29:59,316
Max!

1110
01:30:09,034 --> 01:30:10,744
It's so good to see you.

1111
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:13,372
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

1112
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,582
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

1113
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:17,584
He's been beat up. I told you
he couldn't take care of him!

1114
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:20,462
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

1115
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:22,631
We're fine. She can leave!

1116
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,801
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

1117
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:28,428
Charlie, please.

1118
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:30,597
Just...

1119
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:36,061
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1120
01:30:38,063 --> 01:30:39,940
Charlie, please, no.

1121
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:43,861
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1122
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:47,781
Please. Please.

1123
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:55,497
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

1124
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:59,126
I know you think you know
what's right, but you don't.

1125
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:00,836
You're too young. You don't know.

1126
01:31:01,044 --> 01:31:02,546
Look at me, trust me.

1127
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:05,966
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

1128
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:08,719
What can I do?

1129
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:25,652
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1130
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:28,906
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1131
01:31:29,114 --> 01:31:33,660
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

1132
01:31:33,869 --> 01:31:36,496
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

1133
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:38,749
What's going on?

1134
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:41,585
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

1135
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:44,171
I'm going to wait in the car.

1136
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:49,384
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1137
01:31:49,593 --> 01:31:51,470
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1138
01:31:51,678 --> 01:31:54,681
You knew from day one what this was.

1139
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:56,642
You decided to take the ride.

1140
01:31:57,351 --> 01:32:01,104
You thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

1141
01:32:01,313 --> 01:32:03,690
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1142
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:08,237
No, you forgot who I was!

1143
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:15,702
You deserve better...

1144
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:18,330
...than me.

1145
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:24,545
Will you say something, please?

1146
01:32:24,753 --> 01:32:27,214
I tried. What do you want from me?

1147
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:29,049
I want you to fight for me.

1148
01:32:30,384 --> 01:32:32,135
That's all I ever wanted.

1149
01:34:37,386 --> 01:34:38,679
Don't ask.

1150
01:34:40,889 --> 01:34:42,349
So no Max.

1151
01:34:43,684 --> 01:34:47,354
It's better this way.
Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1152
01:34:47,563 --> 01:34:49,273
Did you not see the way
he looked at you?

1153
01:34:50,566 --> 01:34:52,651
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1154
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,028
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1155
01:34:55,237 --> 01:34:59,241
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1156
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:01,869
Me, come on. I blew it.

1157
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:05,289
I blew it.

1158
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:08,083
When Max was born I just...

1159
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:10,210
...freaked out.

1160
01:35:10,419 --> 01:35:12,588
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1161
01:35:12,796 --> 01:35:14,047
I wouldn't know where to start.

1162
01:35:14,256 --> 01:35:15,215
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1163
01:35:15,424 --> 01:35:16,884
- You do.
- No.

1164
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:18,969
You do.

1165
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,003
I got to go.

1166
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:57,633
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1167
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:01,553
Worth it. Worth it.

1168
01:36:13,023 --> 01:36:14,566
Go get him, Charlie.

1169
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:19,363
You sound like your dad.

1170
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:51,436
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1171
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:54,398
and I guess I did originally.

1172
01:36:54,606 --> 01:36:55,566
Then you sold me.

1173
01:36:56,275 --> 01:36:57,359
Charlie.

1174
01:36:58,527 --> 01:37:00,404
You have no business being here.

1175
01:37:00,612 --> 01:37:02,990
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

1176
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:07,035
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong
by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1177
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:11,164
...I'd just like to do one thing right.

1178
01:37:14,209 --> 01:37:15,210
Right.

1179
01:37:16,879 --> 01:37:18,589
- Where were we?
- You sold me.

1180
01:37:18,797 --> 01:37:20,841
Right, yeah, that happened.

1181
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:23,218
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.

1182
01:37:23,427 --> 01:37:24,636
And you slept on a shelf in a truck,

1183
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:26,346
- and it was awful.
- And dangerous.

1184
01:37:26,722 --> 01:37:31,310
Really dangerous.
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1185
01:37:32,477 --> 01:37:35,397
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1186
01:37:35,606 --> 01:37:37,900
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1187
01:37:40,986 --> 01:37:44,615
But no. No, I came to tell you
that I heard you.

1188
01:37:45,657 --> 01:37:48,952
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1189
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:53,999
I know you had a bum ride, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1190
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,376
I should have been.

1191
01:37:57,711 --> 01:37:59,046
Your mom was...

1192
01:37:59,755 --> 01:38:01,423
She was cool, wasn't she?

1193
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:04,051
She was.

1194
01:38:04,968 --> 01:38:06,261
She was the coolest.

1195
01:38:07,137 --> 01:38:09,723
Yeah, she was.

1196
01:38:12,643 --> 01:38:17,564
And I'm sorry about...
what happened with her.

1197
01:38:20,901 --> 01:38:23,612
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1198
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,865
but I'm here right now...

1199
01:38:28,408 --> 01:38:31,662
...and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

1200
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:47,261
We got the Zeus fight.

1201
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:48,554
What?

1202
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:50,597
No, no, we didn't.

1203
01:38:51,557 --> 01:38:53,517
You got the Zeus fight.

1204
01:38:57,479 --> 01:38:59,314
So what do you say, Debra?

1205
01:38:59,523 --> 01:39:00,899
Can we do this one last thing?

1206
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:06,905
- One night.
- It's all we need. Thank you.

1207
01:39:12,035 --> 01:39:15,747
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

1208
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:18,750
Yeah? What do you say?

1209
01:39:20,961 --> 01:39:25,299
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1210
01:39:25,507 --> 01:39:27,801
Tim, it's the fight
we never thought we'd see.

1211
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:30,179
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,

1212
01:39:30,387 --> 01:39:33,640
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1213
01:39:33,849 --> 01:39:35,642
The champ's handlers
have agreed to fight

1214
01:39:35,851 --> 01:39:38,353
outside the circle
of well-known League bots,

1215
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:42,649
and have decided to give the people
a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1216
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:46,195
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1217
01:39:46,403 --> 01:39:48,030
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1218
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:51,158
gives a shot at the belt
to a G-2 named Atom?

1219
01:39:51,366 --> 01:39:55,204
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1220
01:39:55,412 --> 01:39:57,664
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena,

1221
01:39:57,873 --> 01:40:00,834
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this matchup.

1222
01:40:01,043 --> 01:40:03,754
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1223
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:06,882
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't
even stop to talk to the press,

1224
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:10,219
referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation.

1225
01:40:10,427 --> 01:40:14,181
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer,
did more than just challenge Zeus.

1226
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:15,599
He did so publicly.

1227
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:19,353
The challenge went viral and created
a PR nightmare for the champ.

1228
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:23,065
No argument there. And I think the Zeus
camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1229
01:40:23,273 --> 01:40:24,733
That they do. Come on.

1230
01:40:24,942 --> 01:40:27,903
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1231
01:40:28,111 --> 01:40:31,156
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1232
01:40:31,365 --> 01:40:34,034
And judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1233
01:40:48,423 --> 01:40:49,800
We can't win, can we?

1234
01:40:50,926 --> 01:40:51,969
We'll see.

1235
01:40:56,265 --> 01:40:58,433
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1236
01:40:58,642 --> 01:41:00,811
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1237
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:15,576
Atom has arrived
onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1238
01:41:15,784 --> 01:41:18,453
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1239
01:41:18,662 --> 01:41:21,081
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1240
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:23,458
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1241
01:41:23,667 --> 01:41:26,420
and the look on
Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1242
01:41:26,628 --> 01:41:28,755
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1243
01:41:28,964 --> 01:41:31,675
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1244
01:41:31,884 --> 01:41:33,177
Who wants some?

1245
01:41:34,052 --> 01:41:35,596
I'll take some of that action.

1246
01:41:35,804 --> 01:41:38,932
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

1247
01:41:40,184 --> 01:41:43,187
How's it going... partner?

1248
01:41:43,395 --> 01:41:44,771
Partner?

1249
01:41:45,314 --> 01:41:48,442
That's great. How about a hundred K?
Is that funny?

1250
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:51,153
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1251
01:41:51,361 --> 01:41:53,071
You carrying around
that kind of scratch?

1252
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:56,700
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1253
01:41:57,409 --> 01:42:01,538
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C,

1254
01:42:01,747 --> 01:42:04,374
and you can bring me
my money right to my seat.

1255
01:42:04,583 --> 01:42:07,961
101, row C? Hundred K?

1256
01:42:08,754 --> 01:42:10,005
You heard me, homey.

1257
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:11,965
- Homey?
- Right?

1258
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:13,300
Homeboy!

1259
01:42:14,593 --> 01:42:16,929
All right. Peace out, posse.

1260
01:42:17,137 --> 01:42:18,430
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1261
01:42:42,246 --> 01:42:44,957
- Never beaten.
- It's showtime!

1262
01:42:45,165 --> 01:42:47,209
Never threatened.

1263
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:50,546
The king of the ring,

1264
01:42:50,754 --> 01:42:52,840
the ruler of robots!

1265
01:42:54,132 --> 01:42:59,221
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1266
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,039
Oh, shit!

1267
01:43:32,588 --> 01:43:33,881
That was awesome.

1268
01:43:40,554 --> 01:43:41,680
Come on, let's go.

1269
01:43:48,478 --> 01:43:51,106
Ladies and gentlemen,

1270
01:43:51,315 --> 01:43:53,901
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1271
01:43:54,109 --> 01:43:57,321
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

1272
01:43:57,529 --> 01:44:02,034
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom!

1273
01:44:02,242 --> 01:44:03,327
Showboat!

1274
01:44:07,331 --> 01:44:09,750
And in the corner to my left,

1275
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:12,920
the undeniable champion
of this universe

1276
01:44:13,128 --> 01:44:16,548
and any other universe known
or unknown,

1277
01:44:16,757 --> 01:44:20,969
the mighty Zeus!

1278
01:44:25,516 --> 01:44:29,686
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready

1279
01:44:29,895 --> 01:44:34,816
for Real Steel!

1280
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:38,946
This is what it's all about!

1281
01:44:39,154 --> 01:44:43,075
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

1282
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:45,118
The bots emerge from their corners.

1283
01:44:46,078 --> 01:44:49,081
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1284
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:50,374
On your feet!

1285
01:44:50,582 --> 01:44:53,085
Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

1286
01:44:55,504 --> 01:44:57,923
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

1287
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:00,092
Get up!

1288
01:45:01,677 --> 01:45:03,887
Push up! Stand up!

1289
01:45:05,013 --> 01:45:07,432
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1290
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:10,143
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

1291
01:45:10,352 --> 01:45:13,272
Atom is down for the second time
in less than ten seconds.

1292
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:17,359
- He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!

1293
01:45:19,444 --> 01:45:21,029
Get up and get in the game!

1294
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:24,199
Come on! No, please Atom, get up!
Please!

1295
01:45:24,408 --> 01:45:26,994
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1296
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:32,040
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

1297
01:45:32,624 --> 01:45:33,584
Lean back!

1298
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:36,086
Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!

1299
01:45:36,295 --> 01:45:38,422
- Get out of there!
- Move!

1300
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:42,843
A demolishing inside shot.

1301
01:45:43,051 --> 01:45:44,136
Get your hands up!

1302
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:47,598
Hands up!

1303
01:45:48,599 --> 01:45:50,058
Crush that little can!

1304
01:45:50,267 --> 01:45:51,560
Get out of the corner!

1305
01:45:51,768 --> 01:45:55,063
Kenton desperately trying to command
his robot out of that suicide corner.

1306
01:46:00,068 --> 01:46:01,069
Get your feet under you!

1307
01:46:02,738 --> 01:46:04,740
Good night, sparring bot!

1308
01:46:04,948 --> 01:46:07,534
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

1309
01:46:07,743 --> 01:46:11,079
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1310
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:13,415
- Stand up!
- Two!

1311
01:46:13,624 --> 01:46:15,042
Three!

1312
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,376
Atom, get up!

1313
01:46:16,585 --> 01:46:18,587
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1314
01:46:19,296 --> 01:46:22,049
- Six! Seven!
- Get up!

1315
01:46:22,257 --> 01:46:24,051
Eight! Nine!

1316
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:29,515
I don't believe this! Against all odds,
this little bot is on his feet again.

1317
01:46:30,807 --> 01:46:31,850
Come on, Atom!

1318
01:46:35,103 --> 01:46:36,230
He can't survive this!

1319
01:46:40,067 --> 01:46:42,236
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

1320
01:46:43,612 --> 01:46:46,281
Atom has landed a punch!

1321
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:51,453
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from
an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1322
01:46:51,662 --> 01:46:53,121
Advance!

1323
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:54,623
Fade back, counter right!

1324
01:46:55,457 --> 01:46:56,583
Fade back, counter right!

1325
01:46:57,459 --> 01:47:00,587
Right cross! Right cross! Right cross!

1326
01:47:00,963 --> 01:47:01,839
Left hook!

1327
01:47:02,047 --> 01:47:04,883
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

1328
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:07,553
For the first time in his dominant run,

1329
01:47:07,761 --> 01:47:11,515
Zeus has met a bot
who simply won't back down!

1330
01:47:13,392 --> 01:47:16,103
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1331
01:47:16,311 --> 01:47:19,189
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

1332
01:47:19,398 --> 01:47:23,277
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

1333
01:47:23,485 --> 01:47:26,405
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

1334
01:47:26,613 --> 01:47:29,616
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

1335
01:47:33,328 --> 01:47:38,333
Only five seconds left, as here comes
that piston-packed right of the champ!

1336
01:47:39,835 --> 01:47:43,964
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1337
01:47:44,173 --> 01:47:49,178
We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1338
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:55,475
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1339
01:47:57,144 --> 01:48:00,856
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now!

1340
01:48:03,692 --> 01:48:05,986
We got to go this way. Come on!

1341
01:48:11,533 --> 01:48:12,826
OK, you sit down.

1342
01:48:16,121 --> 01:48:18,665
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1343
01:48:18,874 --> 01:48:20,334
I'll be back for you, baby.

1344
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,462
Get your hands off me!

1345
01:48:26,048 --> 01:48:28,884
Both corners furiously working
on their bots.

1346
01:48:29,092 --> 01:48:32,429
This crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre,

1347
01:48:32,638 --> 01:48:34,556
but instead they're getting a war!

1348
01:48:34,765 --> 01:48:36,099
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1349
01:48:36,308 --> 01:48:37,267
All right. Here we go.

1350
01:48:37,476 --> 01:48:39,520
What is happening?

1351
01:48:39,728 --> 01:48:44,650
He is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies. He will be fine.

1352
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:46,151
What next?

1353
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:48,362
Round two.

1354
01:48:56,578 --> 01:48:59,873
Round two kicks off,
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1355
01:49:00,082 --> 01:49:02,042
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1356
01:49:03,794 --> 01:49:07,464
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

1357
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:16,181
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1358
01:49:21,311 --> 01:49:25,232
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

1359
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:32,030
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

1360
01:49:34,908 --> 01:49:38,245
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1361
01:49:38,453 --> 01:49:40,622
This is a brawl!

1362
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:48,255
The crowd is on their feet, watching two
machines driven to kill each other!

1363
01:49:48,463 --> 01:49:51,008
Something has to give, and it does!

1364
01:49:51,216 --> 01:49:52,926
Atom goes down again!

1365
01:49:53,135 --> 01:49:57,222
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight!

1366
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:01,935
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1367
01:50:02,144 --> 01:50:06,565
Kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on!

1368
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:17,993
Midway through round four, and Zeus
is looking to end this thing right now.

1369
01:50:18,202 --> 01:50:22,539
The champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1370
01:50:32,716 --> 01:50:36,512
Atom is stumbling around the ring,
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1371
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,138
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

1372
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:41,183
I think the voice recog is shot!
He's not responding!

1373
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:49,191
Zeus has found yet another gear of
violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1374
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:52,569
No! Stop! Do something!

1375
01:50:52,778 --> 01:50:53,737
He can't hear me!

1376
01:50:55,239 --> 01:51:00,702
But the bell sounds, and once again
this little robot has stunned the world!

1377
01:51:02,913 --> 01:51:07,334
We're done, Max! He can't hear me.
This is murder. We've had enough.

1378
01:51:07,543 --> 01:51:09,920
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- He can't hear me!

1379
01:51:10,128 --> 01:51:12,464
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

1380
01:51:13,882 --> 01:51:16,677
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1381
01:51:16,885 --> 01:51:19,263
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

1382
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:20,597
No way. No way!

1383
01:51:20,806 --> 01:51:22,683
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1384
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:25,394
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

1385
01:51:25,602 --> 01:51:27,563
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1386
01:51:27,771 --> 01:51:29,898
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1387
01:51:30,107 --> 01:51:31,859
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

1388
01:51:32,067 --> 01:51:34,736
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1389
01:51:35,988 --> 01:51:39,491
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1390
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:41,076
Don't ask me. Don't.

1391
01:51:41,285 --> 01:51:45,706
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1392
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:55,883
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1393
01:51:57,801 --> 01:51:59,303
Damn it!

1394
01:51:59,511 --> 01:52:00,512
Yes!

1395
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:02,764
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1396
01:52:03,932 --> 01:52:06,310
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1397
01:52:06,518 --> 01:52:07,728
but I know you're in there!

1398
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:10,189
- Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1399
01:52:13,775 --> 01:52:18,405
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

1400
01:52:18,614 --> 01:52:21,116
Watch... me.

1401
01:52:21,325 --> 01:52:24,828
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1402
01:52:26,038 --> 01:52:27,664
Watch me.

1403
01:52:28,081 --> 01:52:30,000
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1404
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:32,252
as the fifth and final round
gets underway.

1405
01:52:32,461 --> 01:52:33,921
Come on, Atom!

1406
01:52:43,639 --> 01:52:45,807
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1407
01:52:46,016 --> 01:52:49,102
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring!

1408
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:51,480
It looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1409
01:52:51,688 --> 01:52:54,441
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1410
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:57,402
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1411
01:52:57,611 --> 01:53:02,032
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom
is backed up against the ropes again.

1412
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,953
Help him! Fight back!

1413
01:53:06,161 --> 01:53:07,204
Not yet.

1414
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:14,628
Tak Mashido supervising personally
as Zeus hammers down,

1415
01:53:14,837 --> 01:53:17,673
furiously trying to end this thing
once and for all.

1416
01:53:18,757 --> 01:53:21,718
I got to tell you, folks,
the champ looks tired.

1417
01:53:21,927 --> 01:53:24,137
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1418
01:53:28,016 --> 01:53:30,352
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1419
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:34,022
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.

1420
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:37,651
Please do something!

1421
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:40,070
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1422
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:44,241
Nitrous pistons, now!

1423
01:53:47,494 --> 01:53:49,371
He's not going to last much longer!

1424
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,415
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

1425
01:53:52,207 --> 01:53:53,458
Hang in there!

1426
01:53:53,667 --> 01:53:58,922
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1427
01:54:00,215 --> 01:54:03,927
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1428
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:09,474
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1429
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:14,104
Zeus is slowing down!

1430
01:54:14,313 --> 01:54:17,065
The champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1431
01:54:17,274 --> 01:54:18,275
Charlie, please!

1432
01:54:20,652 --> 01:54:21,695
Hey, kid.

1433
01:54:22,613 --> 01:54:24,031
- Now.
- Now!

1434
01:54:29,453 --> 01:54:30,454
Get in there!

1435
01:54:32,998 --> 01:54:35,250
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1436
01:54:44,259 --> 01:54:45,636
Yeah! That's right!

1437
01:54:47,179 --> 01:54:48,388
Do something!

1438
01:54:49,306 --> 01:54:50,307
Move!

1439
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:54,144
Override. Switching to manual.

1440
01:54:56,271 --> 01:55:00,984
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is
manually operating his robot personally!

1441
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:14,164
- Work the body! Get inside him!
- Get him, Atom!

1442
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:20,504
Look at this! The champ is trying
desperately to stay on his feet,

1443
01:55:20,712 --> 01:55:25,843
but Kenton is relentless, landing
blow after blow after blow to the body!

1444
01:56:08,177 --> 01:56:10,304
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1445
01:56:10,512 --> 01:56:15,642
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1446
01:56:20,355 --> 01:56:23,483
This little bot has
dug deep here tonight

1447
01:56:23,692 --> 01:56:26,278
and shown something damn near heart!

1448
01:56:26,486 --> 01:56:30,657
One, two, three,

1449
01:56:30,866 --> 01:56:35,704
four, five, six, seven...

1450
01:56:35,913 --> 01:56:36,872
He's good!

1451
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:40,417
Zeus gets to his feet,
but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1452
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:42,252
landing punch after punch!

1453
01:56:42,461 --> 01:56:44,838
Tak Mashido and his super bot
have no answer.

1454
01:56:45,047 --> 01:56:48,091
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

1455
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:51,178
It all comes down to this, folks!

1456
01:56:51,386 --> 01:56:53,180
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1457
01:56:53,388 --> 01:56:56,308
- Kenton is about to drop the champ...
- No! There's the bell!

1458
01:56:57,434 --> 01:56:59,603
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1459
01:57:06,568 --> 01:57:09,363
Amazingly, we will go
to the judges' cards!

1460
01:57:23,043 --> 01:57:26,922
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1461
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:29,758
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1462
01:57:33,762 --> 01:57:38,141
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

1463
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:43,230
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.

1464
01:57:43,438 --> 01:57:48,026
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46,

1465
01:57:48,235 --> 01:57:53,407
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1466
01:57:53,615 --> 01:57:55,909
Zeus!

1467
01:58:03,292 --> 01:58:05,419
Farra Lemkova,

1468
01:58:05,627 --> 01:58:07,921
you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1469
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:11,508
Some would say that your bot
won the decision but lost the fight.

1470
01:58:12,301 --> 01:58:13,552
She looks pissed.

1471
01:58:14,261 --> 01:58:16,471
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1472
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:19,850
but the result is as expected.

1473
01:58:21,226 --> 01:58:25,606
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1474
01:58:31,028 --> 01:58:34,114
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1475
01:58:34,323 --> 01:58:35,574
your bot suffered tonight?

1476
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:41,121
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1477
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:42,664
Max. Where's Max?

1478
01:58:46,335 --> 01:58:47,461
There he is. Max.

1479
01:58:49,254 --> 01:58:52,674
They're already calling your bot
"the people's champion."

1480
01:58:56,178 --> 01:58:58,055
What do you say to that?

1481
01:58:59,097 --> 01:59:00,390
People's champion?

1482
01:59:03,018 --> 01:59:04,353
Sounds pretty good to me.

1483
01:59:10,317 --> 01:59:12,319
Dad? Dad!

1484
01:59:16,365 --> 01:59:17,491
Dad!

1485
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:30,045
I really want you to know...

1486
01:59:30,254 --> 01:59:32,256
No, I need you to know.

1487
01:59:34,466 --> 01:59:35,676
Don't worry.

1488
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,387
Your secret's safe with me.

1489
01:59:45,519 --> 01:59:47,145
Wait here. Wait here.

1490
02:00:32,065 --> 02:00:33,609
Yes!
