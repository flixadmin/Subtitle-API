Okay, here's serious. My

"Peace means having a

A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

would call that being a hero.

And a lot of people would
also call that war profiteering.

Jesus. That's Jarvis.
He runs the house.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
I've got your clothes here. They've
been dry-cleaned and pressed,

164
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
and there's a car
waiting for you outside

165
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,880
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

166
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
You must be the
famous Pepper Potts.

167
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
Indeed I am.

168
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,200
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

169
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,640
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

170
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,520
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

171

Sometimes I try to do things

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,320
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to,

175
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,600
and I get real frustrated

176
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
and then, like,
I try hard to do it

177
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,040
and I, like, take my time

178
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,896
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to.

179
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,080
It's like I concentrate
on it real hard

180
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
but it just doesn't work out.

Why are you trying to
hustle me out of here?

192
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,896
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.

193
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,080
That's funny, I thought with
it being my plane and all,

194
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,736
that it would just wait
for me to get there.

195
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,576
Tony, I need to speak to
you about a couple things

196
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,736
before I get you
out of the door.

197
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,056
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

198
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,360
if it departs before you arrive?

199
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,760
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

Do you want it?
Yes or no.

201
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,640
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

202
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,920
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,280
where he lived and worked,

204
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
not "spring" like the season.
So?

205
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,040
I think it's a fair example.

206
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,320
I think it's
incredibly overpriced.

207
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,760
I need it.
Buy it. Store it.

208
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Okay. The MIT
commencement speech...

209
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,056
Is in June. Please, don't harangue
me about stuff that's way, way, down...

210
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,480
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

211

Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

212
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,576
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

213
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,576
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
As a matter of fact, I do.

215
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,136
I don't like it
when you have plans.

216

I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

217

It's your birthday?
Yes.

218
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,400
I knew that. Already?

219
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

220
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,296
Get yourself
something nice from me.

221
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
I already did.

222
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
And?

223
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,160
Oh, it was very nice.

224
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah. Very tasteful.

You're good. Oh, I thought
I lost you back there.

228
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,080

cut across Mulholland.

I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

239
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,736
I said I was sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Stark.

240

You don't need to apologize
to me. I'm your man.

I was sorry, but he...

I'm just indifferent
right now. Hot towel?

You don't respect yourself,

respect me. I respect you.

00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,720
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers. We make weapons.

635
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,016
It's my name on the
side of the building.

636
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,640
And what we do keeps the
world from falling into chaos.

637
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,680
Not based on what I saw.

638
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,976
We're not doing
a good enough job.

639
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,296
We can do better. We're
gonna do something else.

640
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,520
Like what?

641
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,000
You want us to
make baby bottles?

642
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,480
I think we should take another
look into arc reactor technology.

643
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,920
Ah, come on. The arc
reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

644
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,400
Tony, come on. We built that
thing to shut the hippies up!

645
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,600
It works.
Yeah, as a science project.

646
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,560
The arc was
never cost effective.

647
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,360
We knew that before we built it.

648
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,600
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

649
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,800
Maybe.

650
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,840
Huh? Am I right? We haven't
had a breakthrough in that in what?

651

30 years.
That's what they say.

652

Could you have a lousier poker
face? Just tell me, who told you?

653
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,640
Never mind who told me.
Show me. It's Rhodey or Pepper.

654
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,040
I want to see it.
Okay, Rhodey.

655
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,960
Okay.
Okay?

656
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,520
It works.

657
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,720
Listen to me, Tony. We're
a team. Do you understand?

658
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,080
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

659
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,560
like your father and I.

660
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,440
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

661
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,120
But if I had...
Tony.

662
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

663
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,040
You understand me?
That was Dad's line.

664
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,800
You gotta let me handle this.

whole different kind of ball now.

We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

What?
How big are your hands?

679

Get down here. I need you.

Hey.

Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

684

I just need your help for a sec.

685

Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

686
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,920
It was.
It is now an antique.

687
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,560
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

Speed bump, what does that mean?

691
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,336
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

692
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,720
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

693
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,960
And it's contacting the socket
wall and causing a little bit of a short.

694
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,680
It's fine.

695
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,536
What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over there.

696
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,360
That is irrelevant.
Oh, my God!

697
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,760

just gonna gently lift the wire out.

Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.

699

It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

or it goes "beep."

Okay? Great. Okay.

You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

1555
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,680
Crazy about me.

1556
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,440
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1557
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,400
What night?
You know.

1558
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:34,040
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1559
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,320
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1560
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,640
and you left me there,
by myself?

1561
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,400
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1562
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,480
Mmm-hmm.

1563
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,680
Thought so.

1564
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:58,120
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1565
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,760
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1566
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,880
He will not be taking
any questions. Thank you.

1567
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,440
Been a while since
I was in front of you.

1568
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:13,096
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.

(CLEARS THROAT)

1571
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:19,200
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1572
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,560
on the freeway
and the rooftop...

1573
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1574
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:27,280
that was a bodyguard in a
suit that conveniently appeared,

1575
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:30,440
despite the fact that you...
I know that it's confusing.

1576
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:34,160
It is one thing to question the
official story, and another thing entirely

1577
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:37,480
to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1578
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:39,200
I never said
you were a superhero.

1579
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,280
Didn't?
Mmm-mmm.

1580
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,640
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and fantastic.

(TONY SIGHS)

1582
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,880
I'm just not the
hero type. Clearly.

1583
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:53,480
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1584
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,920
all the mistakes I've made,

1585
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,600
largely public.

1586
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,360
(SOFTLY) Just stick to
the cards, man.

1587
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:00,080
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1588
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,720
The truth is.

1589
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,360
I am Iron Man.

Welcome home, sir.

1594
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:26,640
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1595
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,240
Mr. Stark, you've become
part of a bigger universe.

1596
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:32,120
You just don't know it yet.

1597
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,360
Who the hell are you?

1598

Nick Fury,
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1599
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:39,160
Ah.

1600

I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
