1
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:06,158
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:08,517
Ready or not, here I come.

3
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:24,408
Hey, Dad?

4
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:27,587
Dad!

5
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,108
You'll stay with Aunt May and Uncle Ben
for a little while.

6
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,194
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

7
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:45,737
Doesn't like crust on his sandwiches and
he likes to sleep with a little light on.

8
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,647
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

9
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,100
Dad.

10
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,655
Be good.

11
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:15,028
Sorry.

12
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:16,536
Morning, Flash.

13
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:21,606
Good morning, Parker.

14
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:29,864
Hey. It's Peter, right?

15
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,262
I really like your photos.

16
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,950
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

17
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,614
Listen, are you busy Friday night?

18
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,075
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

19
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:49,742
You know, I really wanna
frame a good one for his birthday.

20
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,559
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

21
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,356
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

22
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:57,440
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

23
00:04:58,396 --> 00:04:59,523
Parker.

24
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,856
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

25
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,575
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

26
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,090
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

27
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:06,169
Like that?

28
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:07,904
<i>- That's it.
- Okay.</i>

29
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:35,783
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

30
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:37,299
Eat it! Eat it!

31
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:39,901
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

32
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:42,135
Eat your vegetables, Gordon. Come on!

33
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,557
Come on!

34
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:45,588
Hey, Parker, come on.

35
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:46,989
Get a picture of this.

36
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,184
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

37
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,080
Gordon, don't eat it.

38
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:53,518
Take the picture, Parker.

39
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,003
Put him down, Flash.

40
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,060
Take the picture.

41
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:59,596
Put him down, Eugene!

42
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:03,830
Hey, man.

43
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:07,653
Come on! Get up, Parker!

44
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,705
Get up! Come on!

45
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:12,867
Come on!

46
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:13,807
Get up!

47
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:18,322
Still not taking the picture.

48
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:19,838
Stay down, Parker!

49
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,685
Who wants one more?

50
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,143
- One more!
- Flash!

51
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,941
Flash, we still on for after school today?
My house, 3:30?

52
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,713
I hope you've been doing your homework.
Last time, I was...

53
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,780
...very disappointed in you.

54
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:35,953
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

55
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,383
How about it?

56
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,250
Whatever.

57
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,711
I thought that was great what you did.

58
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:10,727
It was stupid,

59
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:12,352
but it was great.

60
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,926
You should probably go to the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

61
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,148
What's your name?

62
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,850
You don't know my name?

63
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,710
No, I know your name.

64
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,109
I just want to know if you know your name.

65
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:27,859
Peter.

66
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:31,056
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

67
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:40,568
I'd still go to the nurse though.

68
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:41,951
You're Gwen, right?

69
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,369
Gwen Stacy.

70
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,177
All right.

71
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:47,576
Hey.

72
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:51,068
I'm making spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

73
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,693
You're serious? Spaghetti and meatballs.

74
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:57,513
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

75
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,201
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

76
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,693
What happened to your face?

77
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:04,505
I'm all right. Just... I fell, skating.

78
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:05,896
It's all right.

79
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:12,031
Ben Parker, don't you even think about
leaving that filthy box in my kitchen.

80
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,546
These are my bowling trophies.

81
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:16,857
Oh, well, then, by all means
leave that filthy box in my kitchen.

82
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:18,419
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

83
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:21,449
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

84
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,264
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

85
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,052
Remember when we were stupid and dangerous?

86
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:25,880
No.

87
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,033
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

88
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,746
Where's the flood?

89
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,272
Follow me. I'll show you.

90
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:32,638
- You serious?
- Yes.

91
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,104
All right.

92
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,341
Think it's the condenser tray.

93
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,779
No, too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

94
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,722
This has got to be the fill line.

95
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:45,410
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

96
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,013
Can you fix it?

97
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:50,471
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

98
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,412
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

99
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,428
How's the other guy look?

100
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,928
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

101
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:05,069
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

102
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,725
- No, no.
- All right.

103
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,194
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

104
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:13,475
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

105
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,570
Before you come up, see if
there's anything else worth saving.

106
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:19,623
All right.

107
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:38,405
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

108
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,405
- They fix pipes and pump things.
- If you ask them to-

109
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,061
I forgot all about that thing.

110
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:51,104
- It was your dad's.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,842
He asked us to keep it safe for him.

112
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,753
He saw it in the window of
that leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

113
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,959
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

114
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,733
And guess who sold it to him.

115
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,674
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

116
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,053
That's how they met.

117
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,014
He asked you to keep this safe. Why?
There's nothing in here.

118
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,791
Have you looked in here?
There's nothing here.

119
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:17,005
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

120
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:19,528
Yeah, I know.

121
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,857
Who's that?

122
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:28,425
Do you know who that is?

123
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:31,099
Some guy who worked with your dad, I guess.

124
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:40,251
Just take this off the table, all right?
We're gonna eat. Off.

125
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:42,739
- And wash your hands now.
- All right.

126
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:44,622
Go on.

127
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,306
I need you to be a good boy.

128
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,277
Where are you going?

129
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:24,470
There's something...

130
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,560
There's something
your mom and I have to do.

131
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,950
What is this?

132
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,833
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

133
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,294
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

134
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:43,776
Come in.

135
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:45,917
You okay?

136
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:47,312
Yeah. What's up?

137
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,440
Oh, my God.

138
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:49,893
You look just like him.

139
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,511
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

140
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,128
Listen...

141
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,081
...I don't have much education.
You know that, Peter.

142
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:06,207
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

143
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,581
What I'm trying to say is...

144
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,995
...I know it's been rough for you
without your dad.

145
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:14,245
And I know we don't talk much about them.

146
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,202
Yeah, it's all right.

147
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,253
No, it is not all right.

148
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:21,287
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

149
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,651
Curt Connors.

150
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:28,039
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

151
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,706
They worked together for years
and they were close.

152
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:33,109
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

153
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,440
He never even called. Not once.

154
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,487
Go figure.

155
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:45,831
She's pretty.

156
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:52,831
- Uncle Ben.
- What?

157
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:55,455
You're a pretty great dad.

158
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:52,702
Excuse me.

159
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:53,763
What?

160
00:14:53,788 --> 00:14:55,373
Can I help you?

161
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,020
I don't know. I'm here to see Dr. Connors.

162
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,704
Right. You'll find yourself to the left.

163
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,411
You are here for the internship?

164
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,812
Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:10,094
Okay. You'll find your badge to the left.

166
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,383
Are you having trouble finding yourself?

167
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:18,597
No.

168
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:19,907
Yeah, I got it.

169
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,085
Okay... Mr. Guevara.

170
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,149
- Gracias.
- De nada.

171
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:29,042
Welcome to Oscorp.

172
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,903
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn,

173
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:36,055
the Oscorp Tower
houses 108 floors of innovation.

174
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,494
Our scientific minds are pushing
the boundaries of defence, biomedical

175
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,125
and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.

176
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:45,727
Welcome to Oscorp.

177
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior at Midtown Science
and I'm also head intern to Dr. Connors.

178
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:52,219
So I'll be with you for
the duration of your visit.

179
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:55,222
Where I go, you go. That's the basic rule.

180
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,574
If you remember that, all will be fine.

181
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,975
- If you forget that-
- Listen!

182
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,164
Look, listen.

183
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,056
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is down here.

184
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:04,517
Please, just tell them
Rodrigo Guevara is down here!

185
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:05,852
My name's Rodrigo!

186
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,797
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

187
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,381
Shall we?

188
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,523
Come around this way.

189
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,576
- Good afternoon, Gwen.
- Dr. Connors.

190
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,303
Welcome.

191
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:30,881
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

192
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,420
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,840
I'm not a cripple, I'm a scientist,

194
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:38,482
and the world's foremost authority
on herpetology.

195
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:41,467
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

196
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,101
But like the Parkinson's patient

197
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:46,772
who watches on in horror
as her body slowly betrays her,

198
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:51,978
or the man with macular degeneration
whose eyes grow dimmer each day,

199
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:53,877
I long to fix myself.

200
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:57,575
I want to create a world without weakness.

201
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,161
Anyone care to venture a guess just how?

202
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,033
Yes.

203
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:03,208
Stem cells?

204
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:07,980
Promising. But the solution
I'm thinking of is more... radical.

205
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,224
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

206
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:23,614
Person gets Parkinson's
when the brain cells that produce dopamine

207
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,482
start to disappear.

208
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:30,372
But a zebra fish has the ability
to regenerate cells on command.

209
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:32,232
If you could give this ability

210
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:34,599
to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

211
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:37,646
She's curing herself.

212
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,388
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

213
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:45,521
And you are...

214
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,151
He's one of Midtown Science's
best and brightest.

215
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,174
Really?

216
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,432
Second in his class.

217
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:55,142
- Second?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,493
You sure about that?

219
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:57,807
I'm pretty sure.

220
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:01,853
I'm afraid duty calls.

221
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:04,956
I'll leave you in
the more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

222
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:06,909
Nice meeting you all.

223
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:11,963
If you'd like to gather round.

224
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,292
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

225
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:17,823
Our planet's tree of life is immense.

226
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,538
At Oscorp's Cross-Species Division...

227
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,495
Hi.

228
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,620
...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...

229
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,081
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

230
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,418
Oh, yeah.

231
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,864
What are you doing here?

232
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,863
I work here. I don't.
I was gonna say I work here,

233
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:39,174
but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

234
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,406
You following me?

235
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:43,667
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

236
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,057
Why would you be here?

237
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,876
I just snuck in because...

238
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:48,410
I love science.

239
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,549
- You love science.
- I'm passionate about it.

240
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:52,200
So you snuck in...

241
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:54,707
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

242
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,777
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

243
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,902
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

244
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:04,082
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

245
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:09,225
Sorry. Yo.

246
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:12,188
Sorry.

247
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:38,843
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

248
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:41,804
They were... disappointing.

249
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,240
Define "disappointing".

250
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:52,290
Another dead end.
It's the decay rate algorithm.

251
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:54,952
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

252
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:56,311
You said you were close.

253
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,866
We are close, but it's gonna take time.

254
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:02,304
He doesn't have time.
Norman Osborn is dying, Dr. Connors.

255
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,342
Save him.

256
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,599
Or we'll both lose our heads.

257
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:28,420
All right, give me the badge.

258
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:32,192
Give it to me.

259
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:36,999
Sorry.

260
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:40,370
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

261
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,226
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

262
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:44,468
I didn't mean to...

263
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,421
I didn't... I didn't...

264
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,241
Get your hand off her!

265
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:50,296
I'm trying to get my...

266
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:56,015
- Are you kidding?
- I'm sorry.

267
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,866
Are you freaking kidding me?

268
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,827
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

269
00:24:03,296 --> 00:24:04,632
Man, I'm sorry!

270
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:06,070
Old man, are you all right?

271
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:10,273
- Take him down!
- Come on.

272
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:14,460
Get him, man! Get him!

273
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,429
No, man, no. Not my board.

274
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:19,499
Please, dude, don't-

275
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:23,249
Sorry!

276
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:26,327
Sorry.

277
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:27,557
Sorry.

278
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:29,447
I'm so sorry.

279
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:35,452
Coney Island, next stop.

280
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:38,179
Next and final stop, Coney Island.

281
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,109
Hey.

282
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:53,413
Hey. Hey.

283
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:55,167
Sorry. I'm late. I got-

284
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:56,758
We've been so worried.

285
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,051
I know. I'm sorry.

286
00:24:58,076 --> 00:24:59,288
Watch out!

287
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:07,429
That's a fly, Peter.

288
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:12,866
Yeah.

289
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,124
I'm so sorry I kept you guys up.

290
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:24,031
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

291
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:25,671
...and I'm hungry.

292
00:25:31,124 --> 00:25:32,507
Meatloaf.

293
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:36,512
Drinking?

294
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:37,702
What's this?

295
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:38,866
I don't think so.

296
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:40,327
This is your meatloaf.

297
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,273
This beats all other meat loafs.

298
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,382
Something is very wrong.

299
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,005
Yeah.

300
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,302
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

301
00:25:58,506 --> 00:25:59,791
I got it.

302
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,822
He took the frozen macaroni and cheese.

303
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,924
I noticed that.

304
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,307
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meatloaf?

305
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:14,236
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

306
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:16,713
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

307
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:09,231
Peter.

308
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,587
What are you doing up there?

309
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,825
I'm...

310
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,433
Homework.

311
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,724
Be careful.

312
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:18,294
Sure.

313
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:29,107
Dr. Connors.

314
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,564
You don't remember me. I-

315
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:34,114
The intern from the other day.

316
00:29:34,894 --> 00:29:36,562
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

317
00:29:36,587 --> 00:29:39,161
I'm sure you're a very nice young man,
but this is a home.

318
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,526
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

319
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:42,997
I'm Richard Parker's son.

320
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:51,379
Peter?

321
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:55,884
I'm afraid I can't help you much, Peter.

322
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:58,724
I don't know why they left
or where they were going.

323
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:03,426
Good reflexes.

324
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:04,583
Thank you.

325
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:11,839
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

326
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:13,239
Yeah.

327
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,190
It's something, you know.

328
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:18,673
So you really think it's possible,
cross-species genetics?

329
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:19,849
Yes, of course.

330
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:22,335
For years, your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

331
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,364
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

332
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:27,645
They called us mad scientists.

333
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:32,609
And then your father bred the spiders
and everything changed.

334
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,974
The results were beyond encouraging.
They were spectacular.

335
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:41,612
We were gonna change the lives of millions.

336
00:30:41,864 --> 00:30:43,615
Including my own.

337
00:30:44,255 --> 00:30:45,840
Then it was over.

338
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,552
He... He was gone.

339
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,375
Took his research with him.

340
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,794
And I knew without him, I...

341
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,701
I...

342
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,685
I was angry.

343
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,810
So I stayed away from you and your family.

344
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,466
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

345
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,175
Say...

346
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:31,255
Say it worked. Say you got it to work.

347
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:36,068
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

348
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:39,060
What could the side effects be?

349
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:45,826
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

350
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,741
The problem was always-

351
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,184
The decay rate algorithm?

352
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,825
- Right.
- Right.

353
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,500
Can I...

354
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:57,708
Of course.

355
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:21,722
Extraordinary.

356
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:23,933
How did you come up with this?

357
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:35,093
Peter, how would you feel about coming to
see me at the Tower one day after school?

358
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:36,105
Yeah.

359
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:39,456
Thank you.

360
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,452
Number one, Reggie. Run it, buddy.

361
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,105
Let's go. Reggie.

362
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,483
Rejected!

363
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,933
You did that on purpose, Flash!

364
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,043
No, but I should've.
You better watch your back.

365
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,136
Hey.

366
00:33:22,323 --> 00:33:23,503
All right?

367
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:31,130
Give it up, Parker.

368
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:37,619
Come on, man.

369
00:33:39,498 --> 00:33:40,499
One sec.

370
00:33:43,757 --> 00:33:45,017
Come on, man.

371
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:46,463
Why don't you take it from me?

372
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:51,900
That's right. Take it.

373
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:53,674
Go ahead. Take it.

374
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,627
Just take it.

375
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:19,603
All right, how about this?

376
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,766
All right?

377
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:22,932
How about that?

378
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:29,313
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

379
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:31,465
Come on, Flash. Take it.

380
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,986
Yo, Flash, let's go.

381
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:34,777
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

382
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:36,609
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

383
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:38,531
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

384
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:41,290
What you doing, man?

385
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:45,986
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

386
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:02,246
Peter's behaviour is just unacceptable.

387
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:04,078
They're not gonna make us
pay for the backboard.

388
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,222
I don't care about the backboard.

389
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:07,957
- Was that true?
- What?

390
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:12,746
What I heard in there just now.
Did you humiliate that boy?

391
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,511
Yeah, I did.

392
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,492
- But...
- But what?

393
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:19,176
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

394
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,980
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

395
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:24,575
Is he?

396
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,222
Yeah, yeah, but...

397
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:28,333
So all this is about getting even.

398
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:32,574
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

399
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:33,972
Am I right or wrong?

400
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,322
Yeah, I thought so.

401
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:40,441
Well, thanks to
this little escapade of yours,

402
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,908
I had to change shifts at work so you
have to pick up Aunt May tonight at 9:00.

403
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:46,215
Understood?

404
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,480
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

405
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:49,996
Okay, good.

406
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:53,932
She looks familiar.

407
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,745
She's the girl on your computer.

408
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,159
Yeah.

409
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:02,792
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

410
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:05,049
Don't forget Aunt May.

411
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,354
Okay.

412
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:17,547
He's a character. That's my uncle.

413
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,807
He's a pathological liar.

414
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,598
He thought you were someone else.

415
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,101
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

416
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:27,265
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

417
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,162
Right.

418
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:31,776
So he must have seen-
I was touching up stuff.

419
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:33,932
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

420
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,003
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

421
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,187
Did you get expelled?

422
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:43,159
No, no. I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

423
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,542
So you want to... I don't know...

424
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:52,495
Want to what?

425
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:55,581
I don't know. Just...

426
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:03,432
I don't know... We could...

427
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:06,651
We could do something else, or we could...

428
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:08,108
If you don't feel like, we could-

429
00:37:08,132 --> 00:37:09,198
Yeah.

430
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:10,927
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

431
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:14,143
- Really?
- Sure.

432
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:17,757
Okay. All right, good. Sounds good.

433
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:18,983
Cool.

434
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:20,628
Okay.

435
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,612
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

436
00:37:23,637 --> 00:37:25,806
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

437
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:29,698
But maybe...

438
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:33,193
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

439
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,129
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

440
00:37:35,258 --> 00:37:36,362
- Bye.
- All right.

441
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,974
We have protein structure, rDNA,
chromatography, transgenics testing,

442
00:39:08,986 --> 00:39:10,648
that's X-ray video.

443
00:39:10,673 --> 00:39:14,367
That's the only one on the planet.
We have... human line testing over-

444
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:15,831
I remember that.

445
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:17,948
I've seen that before.

446
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:19,266
The Ganali device.

447
00:39:19,497 --> 00:39:22,066
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

448
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,847
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

449
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:28,777
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even an entire city.

450
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:32,277
Theoretically,
you could cure polio in an afternoon.

451
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:33,761
That's incredible.

452
00:39:33,786 --> 00:39:37,581
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

453
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:39,024
What if you wanted to opt out?

454
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:43,566
You can't run away from a cloud
after all, so here it lies, gathering dust.

455
00:39:44,434 --> 00:39:47,061
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

456
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:50,298
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted

457
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:53,042
that they can regenerate entire limbs
at will.

458
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:55,048
You can imagine my envy.

459
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:59,686
We're trying to harness this capability
and transfer it into our host subject:

460
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:02,066
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

461
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:05,073
Enter the algorithm now.

462
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:09,597
You need to take that?

463
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,037
System ready for gene insertion.

464
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,316
Okay.

465
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,292
Check.

466
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,878
See what I'm trying to do?

467
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:26,816
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

468
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,120
Beginning trials.

469
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:30,731

Peptide algorithm accepted.

477
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,316
Regrowth complete.

478
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,933
- Hey.
- Vitals normal.

479
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:48,659
Blood pressure normal.

480
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,802
Limb regeneration successful.

481
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:53,589
Extraordinary.

482
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,441
And thank you.

483
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,230
Meet Fred and Wilma, our three-legged mice.

484
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:08,772
Here you go.

485
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:12,175
Hey, buddy. I got you.

486
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,800
Okay.

487
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:17,113
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

488
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:19,144
Human trials aren't until next week.

489
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:23,066
There.

490
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,864
Hey.

491
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:34,463
Hey, I thought you...

492
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:36,571
Didn't you forget something?

493
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,420
What?

494
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,212
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

495
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:47,251
You owe your aunt an apology bigtime.

496
00:41:49,563 --> 00:41:52,040
Be a man. Get in there and apologize.

497
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:57,576
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

498
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,579
Honestly, you don't have to
apologize to me. It's your-

499
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,579
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

500
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:05,258
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

501
00:42:05,283 --> 00:42:07,391
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

502
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,156
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone

503
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:14,376
in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station

504
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,652
because you got distracted.

505
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:19,829
Ben, sweetheart, honestly,
I am completely capable of walking home-

506
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:21,758
You will not defend this boy!

507
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,544
- I'm not defending-
- You are defending him!

508
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:25,899
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

509
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:27,923
You're a lot like your father.

510
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,634
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing,

511
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:33,804
but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

512
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:37,274
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people,

513
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:39,860
you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

514
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:41,470
That's what's at stake here.

515
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:42,782
Not choice.

516
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:44,610
Responsibility.

517
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:49,399
That is nice. That's great.

518
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:52,423
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

519
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:55,376
- What?
- Where is he?

520
00:42:56,088 --> 00:42:57,882
Where's my dad?

521
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:01,411
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

522
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,930
Oh, come on, how dare you?

523
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,665
How dare I? How dare you?

524
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:10,710
Where are you going?

525
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:12,251
Peter, come back here, please.

526
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:25,068
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

527
00:43:38,112 --> 00:43:39,238
Peter!

528
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,144
Peter?

529
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:50,019
Peter!

530
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:56,832
It's $2.07.

531
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,135
That's $2.07.

532
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,628
Yeah. No, I know.

533
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:04,656
Yeah, you're holding up the line.

534
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,535
No.

535
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,896
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

536
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:09,562
What?

537
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:13,918
You can leave a penny anytime, you
have to spend 10 dollars to take a penny.

538
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,199
Store policy.

539
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:16,586
You gotta pay? You're holding up my line.

540
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,785
I don't have 2 cents.

541
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,035
You can't afford milk, just step aside.

542
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,292
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

543
00:44:22,317 --> 00:44:23,667
We're talking about 2 cents.

544
00:44:23,692 --> 00:44:24,925
Just step aside, kid.

545
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:32,662
Really?

546
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:47,519
Yo, not cool, bro.

547
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:51,577
Hey, man, stop!

548
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:53,104
Somebody stop that guy!

549
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:54,747
Hey, kid, little help?

550
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:56,190
Not my policy.

551
00:44:56,489 --> 00:44:57,858
Somebody stop that dude!

552
00:44:58,818 --> 00:44:59,627
Hey!

553
00:44:59,652 --> 00:45:00,945
Hey, stop!

554
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:03,741
Somebody stop that dude!

555
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,965
Hey!

556
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:45,353
Oh, God, oh, God.

557
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:46,921
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

558
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:49,465
Call an ambulance!

559
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,654
Someone call an ambulance!

560
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:52,001
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

561
00:45:52,755 --> 00:45:54,423
Oh, God, oh, my God.

562
00:45:57,976 --> 00:45:59,439
On, God.

563
00:46:03,157 --> 00:46:04,439
No.

564
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,212
Oh, Jesus.

565
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:16,540
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

566
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,535
No, I don't know him.

567
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:27,339
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives are on it.

568
00:46:27,363 --> 00:46:28,883
We'll see what they turn up.

569
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:30,061
Okay.

570
00:46:35,937 --> 00:46:37,355
Can I have that?

571
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,639
Sure.

572
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:41,986
There's one other thing.

573
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,186
He has a star tattooed on his left hand.

574
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:17,546
Peter, I know
things have been difficult lately...

575
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:19,899
...and I'm sorry about that.

576
00:47:20,452 --> 00:47:22,662
I think I know what you're feeling.

577
00:47:38,678 --> 00:47:40,156
Hey, Parker.

578
00:47:41,363 --> 00:47:43,477
- Not today, Flash.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

579
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:50,398
It feels better, right?

580
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:53,177
Look, your uncle died.

581
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:55,148
I'm sorry.

582
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,711
I get it.

583
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,328
I'm sorry. Okay?

584
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,291
Peter.

585
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,222
Stay away from him. You understand me?

586
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:55,972
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

587
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,636
You like beating on girls?

588
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:01,369
You like beating on old men?

589
00:49:01,394 --> 00:49:03,021
Hey, pal, just keep on walking.

590
00:49:03,046 --> 00:49:04,257
You're in the wrong place.

591
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:05,956
When was the last time you were in Queens?

592
00:49:06,232 --> 00:49:07,442
I asked you a question.

593
00:49:07,526 --> 00:49:08,526
Nicky, no!

594
00:49:08,551 --> 00:49:10,653
That the gun? You gonna kill me too?

595
00:49:12,058 --> 00:49:13,781
Hey! Stop it!

596
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:15,526
Hey. get off!

597
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:18,151
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

598
00:49:18,176 --> 00:49:19,386
Back up!

599
00:49:20,361 --> 00:49:21,886
This guy is crazy!

600
00:49:23,115 --> 00:49:24,104
Get him!

601
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:30,183
Get back here, man! Get him!

602
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,811
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

603
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:53,946
Go, go, go!

604
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:56,343
There he is!

605
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,497
Can't get away!

606
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,597
He has a star tattooed on his left hand.

607
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:28,731
Oh, yeah?

608
00:50:29,147 --> 00:50:30,148
Come on!

609
00:50:37,026 --> 00:50:38,862
I know what you look like!

610
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:40,378
You hear me?

611
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:43,214
I've seen your face!

612
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:22,506
Is that all you got?

613
00:51:24,383 --> 00:51:25,884
Just take it, take it.

614
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:34,452
Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders,

615
00:51:34,477 --> 00:51:37,913
Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled.

616
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:42,108
We're just beginning to understand
all the potential industrial applications.

617
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:47,999
A single pellet can safely store several
hundred metres of the lightweight cable.

618
00:51:57,428 --> 00:51:58,256
Mother...

619
00:52:55,979 --> 00:52:59,532
Attention, all units
in the confines of Precinct 13,

620
00:52:59,557 --> 00:53:03,111
receiving a 10-30
on West 19th Street and Broadway.

621
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:05,888
Assailant is Caucasian male, mid-30s,

622
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:10,274
170 to 180 pounds,
shoulder-length blond hair.

623
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:13,141
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.

624
00:53:32,466 --> 00:53:33,207
Hey.

625
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:42,943
You got a description?

626
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:44,482
Well, no, he wears a mask.

627
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,084
A mask?

628
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:49,549
And most of his victims are suspects,
some of them with serious rap sheets.

629
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:50,966
They're calling him a vigilante.

630
00:53:50,991 --> 00:53:53,513
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

631
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,467
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

632
00:53:56,492 --> 00:53:57,771
Please get me out of here.

633
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:00,443
Hey, look!

634
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,433
Spandex. Spandex.

635
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,316
Everything... spandex.

636
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:21,022
Extraordinary velocity vector is a
function of both mass and acceleration.

637
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:22,840
Come on,
you know better than anyone

638
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:25,403
the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

639
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:29,270
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

640
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:07,069
Hey, Aunt May.

641
00:55:07,395 --> 00:55:09,189
Yeah. Eggs?

642
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,912
Organic, got it.

643
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:48,009
In the future, if you're gonna steal
cars, don't dress like a car thief, man.

644
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:49,611
What are you? You a cop?

645
00:55:50,342 --> 00:55:54,760
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

646
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:55,979
You know, you're...

647
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:59,746
You've got a mind of the true scholar, sir.

648
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,549
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

649
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:04,383
Good thinking, good thinking.

650
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:06,221
Get out the window.

651
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:07,713
There you go. You got it.

652
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,252
Crotch!

653
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,810
- Just let me go.
- Is that knife? Is that a real knife?

654
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:24,145
Yes, it's a real knife.

655
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,955
My weakness, it's small knives.

656
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,854
- Just let me go.
- Anything but knives!

657
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:29,651
Oh, it's so simple.

658
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:31,277
- That was cool.
- What is this?

659
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:33,888
Webbing that I developed myself.
I don't think you want to know.

660
00:56:33,913 --> 00:56:34,986
Come on. Let me go!

661
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:38,408
Okay, one second. Hold on, one second.

662
00:56:38,433 --> 00:56:39,559
Knock it off, man. No!

663
00:56:40,684 --> 00:56:43,119
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

664
00:56:44,023 --> 00:56:45,208
That isn't funny.

665
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:46,979
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

666
00:56:57,578 --> 00:57:00,984
This could've gone a lot worse.
Now hold still.

667
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:08,000
Boys in blue here.

668
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:09,640
Yo, I got him.

669
00:57:10,028 --> 00:57:10,848
Freeze!

670
00:57:10,883 --> 00:57:12,719
- He's not going anywhere.
- You in the tights, don't move.

671
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:13,745
You serious?

672
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:15,047
Who are you?

673
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,479
No one seems to grasp
the concept of the mask.

674
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:18,422
Freeze!

675
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:23,000
I just did 80 percent of your job.

676
00:57:23,297 --> 00:57:25,273
And that? That's how you repay me?

677
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:30,069
Hold it right there!

678
00:57:50,281 --> 00:57:52,133
All right. Well, that was fun.

679
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:54,355
Bus!

680
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:55,523
Hey there, everybody.

681
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,143
What are you doing?

682
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,890
Hey, watch out. I'm swinging here.

683
00:58:06,915 --> 00:58:08,416
I'm swinging here.

684
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:30,242
So 38 of New York's finest
versus one guy in a unitard.

685
00:58:30,934 --> 00:58:32,250
Am I correct?

686
00:58:46,163 --> 00:58:47,812
You don't have to wait up for me.

687
00:58:47,837 --> 00:58:49,359
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

688
00:58:49,384 --> 00:58:51,191
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

689
00:58:51,215 --> 00:58:53,194
- Where were you?
- I was out.

690
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:54,804
Did you get the eggs?

691
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,640
Nope. Forgot the eggs.
I'm gonna get them now.

692
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:03,265
No, you most certainly will not.
Not at this hour.

693
00:59:05,623 --> 00:59:07,015
Look at me, Peter.

694
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:11,681
Take off the damn hood and look at me.

695
00:59:19,173 --> 00:59:22,758
Peter. Where do you go?

696
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,360
Who does this to you?

697
00:59:24,385 --> 00:59:26,179
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

698
00:59:26,204 --> 00:59:28,206
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

699
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,093
...please, please go to sleep.

700
00:59:30,118 --> 00:59:33,679
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

701
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:47,718
Peter, listen to me.

702
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:50,492
Secrets have a cost. They're not for free.

703
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:53,023
Not now, not ever.

704
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:03,437
Cross-species genetics is finally working.

705
01:00:03,462 --> 01:00:07,177
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

706
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,609
It's a miracle.

707
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:12,574
No, it's hard work and promise.
And it's a step closer to the primate lab.

708
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,767
He doesn't have time for every little step.

709
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:15,656
Little?

710
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:17,224
I just mean he can't wait.

711
01:00:17,249 --> 01:00:20,972
Well, he'll have to.
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

712
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:22,827
That's not what I'm saying.

713
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,648
So, what are you saying?

714
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:27,383
You have to start human trials.

715
01:00:28,121 --> 01:00:28,937
Now.

716
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,131
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

717
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,422
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

718
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,515
Even Norman Osborn.

719
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,179
- We are not finished.
- Human trials?

720
01:00:39,212 --> 01:00:41,798
Where on Earth are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

721
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,978
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a winter flu shot.

722
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,703
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

723
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:49,695
You've gotta be kidding me.

724
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:51,937
I don't think I am.

725
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:00,374
It's a little late for shock
and indignation, Curt.

726
01:01:00,399 --> 01:01:01,922
About 15 years late.

727
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:03,984
I have no idea what you're talking about.

728
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:05,718
Richard Parker wore it well.

729
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:08,476
On you, it's a cheap suit, as it was then.

730
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:09,961
I had nothing to do with that.

731
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:11,765
Is that what you told his son Peter?

732
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:19,065
I don't know what you're saying.

733
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,398
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

734
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:24,836
I'll remind you what happened.

735
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:29,000
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

736
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,398
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

737
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:36,797
I...

738
01:01:44,861 --> 01:01:46,343
I won't.

739
01:01:48,745 --> 01:01:50,070
Fine.

740
01:01:54,857 --> 01:01:57,568
The formula is ours now anyway.

741
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:01,539
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

742
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:06,119
I'm shutting you down. Have your office
cleared out by the morning.

743
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:09,939
Your toys can be taken away too, you know.

744
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:13,197
Right, Freddy?

745
01:02:28,659 --> 01:02:29,702
- Hey.
- Hi.

746
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:31,732
- How's it going?
- Where you headed?

747
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,368
Monday, B track.

748
01:02:34,392 --> 01:02:36,439
- Oh, it's Thursday.
- It's Thursday?

749
01:02:36,463 --> 01:02:38,283
- What happened to your eye?
- What?

750
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:40,888
- Your eye, it looks bruised.
- Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

751
01:02:40,913 --> 01:02:42,540
Maybe I got a rash or...

752
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:44,576
It's pretty bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

753
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:48,680
Do you like branzino?

754
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,017
Like, a fish

755
01:02:51,366 --> 01:02:52,747
No, no. I know. I know.

756
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:54,372
Well, if you want...

757
01:02:55,603 --> 01:02:59,786
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

758
01:03:00,884 --> 01:03:02,552
My mom's making branzino.

759
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:04,146
So...

760
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:08,163
It's apartment 2016.
I didn't write that part down.

761
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:09,523
I don't know why I...

762
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:10,857
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

763
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:12,851
2016.

764
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,177
Hi.

765
01:04:23,612 --> 01:04:24,864
How did you get out there?

766
01:04:25,716 --> 01:04:27,260
The fire escape.

767
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,161
Your doorman's intimidating.

768
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:32,433
It's 20 storeys.

769
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:34,614
Yeah. It's all right.

770
01:04:38,423 --> 01:04:40,528
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

771
01:04:40,731 --> 01:04:41,896
Books.

772
01:04:42,522 --> 01:04:43,708
Shoes.

773
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:45,935
Oh, hey...

774
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,055
I got your mom...

775
01:04:48,397 --> 01:04:49,536
...these.

776
01:04:50,275 --> 01:04:51,466
Oh, lovely.

777
01:04:51,491 --> 01:04:53,159
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

778
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,947
- They were nice.
- No, they're beautiful.

779
01:04:55,971 --> 01:04:56,857
I'm sorry.

780
01:04:56,882 --> 01:04:59,635
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

781
01:04:59,748 --> 01:05:01,291
I'm gonna keep these.

782
01:05:02,074 --> 01:05:03,534
You have your suit in there?

783
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:07,896
My suit?

784
01:05:08,264 --> 01:05:10,642
It's for dinner. Are you gonna...

785
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:11,966
Are you gonna wear that?

786
01:05:12,235 --> 01:05:13,685
- That's-
- Hey, hon.

787
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,036
You must be Peter.

788
01:05:20,061 --> 01:05:21,450
Dad, this is Peter.

789
01:05:24,915 --> 01:05:26,294
Nice to meet you, sir.

790
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,114
Nice to meet you.

791
01:05:28,323 --> 01:05:29,599
Dinner's ready.

792
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:31,918
Hope you like branzino.

793
01:05:32,484 --> 01:05:33,708
Who doesn't?

794
01:06:33,473 --> 01:06:34,808
Emma, it's Curt.

795
01:06:35,255 --> 01:06:37,465
- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.

796
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,135
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

797
01:06:40,682 --> 01:06:44,321
No. He can't, Emma.
You have to stop him. He...

798
01:06:44,346 --> 01:06:47,088
I would, but I always lose him
when he's on the bridge.

799
01:06:47,113 --> 01:06:50,074
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call
as soon as possible.

800
01:06:59,795 --> 01:07:03,323
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

801
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:05,604
Okay. You want me to take the tunnel
or the bridge?

802
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:07,246
Bridge! Take the bridge.

803
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:08,606
All right, we'll do that.

804
01:07:08,773 --> 01:07:10,775
Hey man, you all right back there?

805
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:12,737
You tweaking, man?

806
01:07:14,714 --> 01:07:16,341
Just drive.

807
01:07:17,073 --> 01:07:18,104
Okay.

808
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,182
You're having trouble there?

809
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,585
The head goes on the other-

810
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,578
Simon, help Gwen's friend with his fish.

811
01:07:29,603 --> 01:07:30,813
On, I...

812
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,312
I got no idea.

813
01:07:32,337 --> 01:07:33,648
First time.

814
01:07:34,232 --> 01:07:35,817
- Branzino.
- George.

815
01:07:35,842 --> 01:07:38,594
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

816
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:40,304
No, we didn't catch him yet.

817
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:45,179
But we will. He's an amateur, who's
assaulting civilians in the dead of night.

818
01:07:45,204 --> 01:07:48,414
He's clumsy, he leaves clues,
but he's still dangerous.

819
01:07:49,605 --> 01:07:51,125
He's assaulting people?

820
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,101
I'm not sure.

821
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:57,571
I mean, I saw that video
with him and the car thief, and...

822
01:07:57,869 --> 01:08:00,997
I think
most people would say that he was...

823
01:08:01,794 --> 01:08:03,234
...providing a public service.

824
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,708
Most people would be wrong.

825
01:08:06,946 --> 01:08:10,570
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

826
01:08:11,012 --> 01:08:12,264
So why wasn't he then?

827
01:08:15,947 --> 01:08:17,233
Let me illuminate you.

828
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:20,803
The car thief was leading us to the people
who run the entire operation.

829
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,154
It's been a six-month-long sting.
It's called strategy.

830
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:26,793
I'm sure you're aware of the term strategy?
You've heard about that in school?

831
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:28,335
- Yeah.
- Good.

832
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:30,109
I know.

833
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:32,144
Obviously, he didn't know you had a plan.

834
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,601
You seem to know a lot about this case.
Know something we don't know?

835
01:08:35,626 --> 01:08:37,695
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

836
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,097
I saw a video on the lnternet-

837
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:42,890
You saw the video on the Internet.
Well, then the case is closed.

838
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:45,804
Well, no. If you watch the video...
Maybe send you a link?

839
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:47,687
It looks like he's trying to help.

840
01:08:47,712 --> 01:08:50,968
I'm sure on the Internet,
he's being made out to look like a hero.

841
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:53,703
No, no. I'm not saying he's a hero.
I don't think he's a hero at all.

842
01:08:53,728 --> 01:08:55,765
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm saying he's trying to help.

843
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,899
It looks like he's trying to do something
maybe the police can't.

844
01:08:57,924 --> 01:08:59,882
- Something the police can't?
- I don't know.

845
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,720
What do you think we do all day?
Sit around eating doughnuts

846
01:09:02,745 --> 01:09:04,625
with our thumbs planted up our asses?

847
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,476
- George. George.
- Daddy.

848
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:07,809
- Up your what?
- Howard.

849
01:09:07,834 --> 01:09:09,882
I think he stands for
what you stand for, sir.

850
01:09:09,914 --> 01:09:11,578
Protecting innocent people from bad guys.

851
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,904
I stand for law and order, son.
That's what I stand for.

852
01:09:13,929 --> 01:09:15,632
Okay? I wear a badge.

853
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:18,878
This guy wears a mask like an outlaw.

854
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:21,589
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same,

855
01:09:21,614 --> 01:09:23,783
like he's got some sort of
personal vendetta.

856
01:09:23,808 --> 01:09:26,593
But he's not protecting innocent people,
Mr. Parker.

857
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,718
Let's get some air, Peter.

858
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,639
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

859
01:09:34,269 --> 01:09:38,381
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry
if I insulted you. It was not my intention.

860
01:09:38,714 --> 01:09:39,879
You're welcome.

861
01:09:39,903 --> 01:09:42,820
Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.
Thank you.

862
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,070
You're welcome.

863
01:09:45,784 --> 01:09:47,625
- Dad.
- Yeah?

864
01:09:54,905 --> 01:09:56,823
Well, that was something.

865
01:09:58,588 --> 01:10:01,476
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

866
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,773
No, I wouldn't have let him arrest you

867
01:10:09,068 --> 01:10:11,195
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

868
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:14,797
Okay.

869
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:21,174
I've been bitten...

870
01:10:25,509 --> 01:10:26,531
So have I.

871
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:32,914
Okay.

872
01:10:34,849 --> 01:10:37,351
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

873
01:10:37,376 --> 01:10:40,746
I gotta tell you this thing about
the vigilante and the car thief.

874
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:41,989
Oh, okay.

875
01:10:42,362 --> 01:10:43,398
What?

876
01:10:44,227 --> 01:10:46,578
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

877
01:10:46,603 --> 01:10:49,855
Forget that. I won't talk about that.
I'm gonna talk about me, okay?

878
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,095
What about you?

879
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,187
It's impo- I wish I could just...

880
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:56,445
I can't. It's hard to say.

881
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,471
Just say it.

882
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:59,320
- I don't know.
- Say it.

883
01:11:02,517 --> 01:11:03,809
What? What?

884
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:08,531
What?

885
01:11:12,964 --> 01:11:14,359
Okay, then forget it.

886
01:11:22,943 --> 01:11:24,109
You...

887
01:11:33,068 --> 01:11:34,945
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

888
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:41,445
Gwen?

889
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:44,015
Gwen...

890
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:47,484
Your father wants you to come inside.
Right away.

891
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,007
Okay.

892
01:11:49,032 --> 01:11:50,101
- Okay?
- Yeah.

893
01:11:52,814 --> 01:11:53,857
Gwen.

894
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:55,265
I'm coming.

895
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,802
Oh, I'm in trouble.

896
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,521
Will you please go and find out
what's going on, Alfred?

897
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:03,942
Excellent.

898
01:13:06,676 --> 01:13:07,521
Hey!

899
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:11,988
Hey! What is that?

900
01:13:12,394 --> 01:13:14,312
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

901
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:15,797
Get back in the car!

902
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:21,346
Help!

903
01:13:24,205 --> 01:13:25,081
Help!

904
01:14:04,798 --> 01:14:07,102
Incoming!

905
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:29,266
Somebody help!

906
01:14:29,491 --> 01:14:31,160
Help me! My kid is trapped!

907
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,334
I want my dad!

908
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:43,895
Dad!

909
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,438
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Help!

910
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:46,974
- Hey, buddy. It's okay.
- Get away.

911
01:14:46,998 --> 01:14:47,943
It's all right.

912
01:14:48,435 --> 01:14:49,724
- Help!
- Hey, look.

913
01:14:50,922 --> 01:14:53,045
Just a normal guy, all right?

914
01:14:54,681 --> 01:14:55,912
Wanna hold this?

915
01:14:57,337 --> 01:14:58,357
Hold my mask.

916
01:14:58,665 --> 01:14:59,693
All right.

917
01:15:00,981 --> 01:15:02,441
What's your name?

918
01:15:03,047 --> 01:15:04,060
Jack?

919
01:15:04,624 --> 01:15:06,292
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

920
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,420
Okay, stay very still.

921
01:15:09,445 --> 01:15:10,279
All right.

922
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:11,555
Okay, I got you.

923
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,059
Okay, now look.

924
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:20,123
I'll undo the belt. You hold on
to that seat in front of you, okay?

925
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:20,998
On three?

926
01:15:21,023 --> 01:15:23,692
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

927
01:15:25,415 --> 01:15:28,084
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

928
01:15:28,109 --> 01:15:29,584
All right, okay.

929
01:15:43,371 --> 01:15:44,982
Jack, climb now.

930
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,537
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

931
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:54,087
Put it on, the mask.

932
01:15:54,112 --> 01:15:55,693
It's gonna make you strong.

933
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,575
Jack, trust me.

934
01:15:57,727 --> 01:15:58,857
Put it on.

935
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,263
There you go. That's it. That's it, buddy.

936
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:03,576
Okay, now, climb.

937
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:04,802
Come on, Jack.

938
01:16:08,271 --> 01:16:10,857
Do me a favour. A little faster, okay, bud?

939
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:12,935
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

940
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:14,610
That's it. Keep coming.

941
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:15,920
Keep it coming.

942
01:16:16,362 --> 01:16:17,405
Keep coming.

943
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:19,170
No!

944
01:16:33,945 --> 01:16:35,966
Jack. Oh, God.

945
01:16:36,056 --> 01:16:37,557
Thank God.

946
01:16:38,814 --> 01:16:40,149
You okay?

947
01:16:43,653 --> 01:16:45,396
My son. My son.

948
01:16:45,786 --> 01:16:48,365
Oh, my son. My son.

949
01:16:53,566 --> 01:16:54,650
Who are you?

950
01:16:56,686 --> 01:16:58,052
Spider-Man.

951
01:17:45,485 --> 01:17:46,873
Beautiful.

952
01:17:55,529 --> 01:17:56,888
Settle down, guys.

953
01:17:57,604 --> 01:17:59,459
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

954
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,730
Listen. At approximately 9 p.m. last night,

955
01:18:02,755 --> 01:18:05,430
an incident took place on
the Williamsburg Bridge.

956
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,605
Much of what occurred
is merely speculation at this point.

957
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:11,050
However, several eyewitnesses
to the crime,

958
01:18:11,075 --> 01:18:13,435
as well as our own preliminary findings,

959
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:17,240
have positively placed
one individual at the scene.

960
01:18:17,265 --> 01:18:18,990
Which is why, this morning

961
01:18:19,015 --> 01:18:24,295
I am issuing a warrant for
the masked vigilante known as Spider-Man.

962
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:33,975
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials

963
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,888
in the first of four meetings scheduled...

964
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:43,968
It's so beautiful.

965
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:45,584
Knows how to bite though.

966
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:47,943
Who else knows about this?

967
01:18:47,968 --> 01:18:49,107
Just you.

968
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:50,459
Really?

969
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:54,498
Hey, you don't...

970
01:18:55,722 --> 01:18:58,308
You don't believe
what the police are saying, do you?

971
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:00,669
Of course not.

972
01:19:02,624 --> 01:19:04,001
Does it scare you?

973
01:19:04,387 --> 01:19:05,904
What you can do?

974
01:19:08,388 --> 01:19:09,537
No.

975
01:19:10,886 --> 01:19:12,012
No.

976
01:19:12,932 --> 01:19:15,059
What did that thing on the bridge
look like?

977
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,336
It was real big. Too big to be human.

978
01:19:18,593 --> 01:19:20,136
You gotta lay low.

979
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,130
No, can't do that.

980
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,925
You've got to.

981
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:26,370
I mean, why...

982
01:19:26,591 --> 01:19:28,427
Because of last night.

983
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,333
Those people on the bridge.

984
01:19:31,358 --> 01:19:35,362
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

985
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:39,693
So I gotta go after it.

986
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,360
That's not your job.

987
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:45,013
Maybe it is.

988
01:19:49,909 --> 01:19:51,453
I really liked kissing you.

989
01:19:54,314 --> 01:19:55,943
You're an amazing kisser.

990
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:01,779
Well, you know, it was...
It was good for me too.

991
01:20:04,514 --> 01:20:05,630
Yeah?

992
01:20:15,846 --> 01:20:17,014
Who did that?

993
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:39,542
Hello!

994
01:20:48,986 --> 01:20:51,238
It's not nice to snoop.

995
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:56,098
I gave everyone the week off.

996
01:20:58,519 --> 01:20:59,427
Yeah.

997
01:21:00,339 --> 01:21:01,818
Shouldn't you be at school?

998
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:07,123
No, I got a free track.
I wanted to ask you a question.

999
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:10,990
How would a predator track a reptile?

1000
01:21:11,015 --> 01:21:15,411
Oh, they don't. Most reptiles are at
the top of their respective food chain.

1001
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:16,938
Kings of their domain.

1002
01:21:16,963 --> 01:21:18,670
They gotta have vulnerabilities, right?

1003
01:21:18,695 --> 01:21:21,239
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1004
01:21:24,738 --> 01:21:26,135
Just asking a question.

1005
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:31,099
I got school stuff. Biology profiles to do.

1006
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,918
So because of the cold blood,

1007
01:21:33,943 --> 01:21:36,099
would they react to
sudden changes in temperatures?

1008
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:37,591
You'd have to catch one first.

1009
01:21:38,591 --> 01:21:42,021
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1010
01:21:42,046 --> 01:21:43,662
Beautiful and quite large.

1011
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:46,463
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1012
01:21:46,623 --> 01:21:48,625
No, it's not yet classified.

1013
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,681
But it can be aggressive...

1014
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:55,857
...if threatened.

1015
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:04,894
Doc, you all right?

1016
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:07,232
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1017
01:22:07,565 --> 01:22:09,108
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1018
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,291
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.

1019
01:22:11,315 --> 01:22:13,880
I have a new project I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1020
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:17,591
Good. Good, good.

1021
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:19,341
Good.

1022
01:22:20,377 --> 01:22:23,297
Don't worry, Mr. Parker. I'll be back.

1023
01:22:24,415 --> 01:22:26,542
Wonderful things are coming.

1024
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:29,466
Wonderful things.

1025
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,452
Fred?

1026
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:52,734
Mr. Mayor, I can assure you
if there was a giant dinosaur

1027
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:55,361
running around the streets of Manhattan,
you would be the first to know.

1028
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:57,972
So tell your son he can rest easy,
all right?

1029
01:22:57,997 --> 01:23:00,041
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1030
01:23:00,185 --> 01:23:02,075
Okay. Bye-bye.

1031
01:23:02,927 --> 01:23:05,658
Mr. Parker, why are you not in school?

1032
01:23:05,682 --> 01:23:06,748
Got a free track.

1033
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:09,573
Okay, well, I do not have a free track.
So make your point quickly.

1034
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,986
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around Manhattan.

1035
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:14,589
But there is something more dangerous,
and I know who it is.

1036
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,538
- You know who it is?
- Dr. Curtis Connors. He's a biochemist.

1037
01:23:16,568 --> 01:23:18,673
- Of Oscorp?
- That's right.

1038
01:23:18,697 --> 01:23:21,727
Dr. Connors, who's also my daughter's
mentor. Is that who you're talking about?

1039
01:23:21,752 --> 01:23:22,961
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1040
01:23:22,986 --> 01:23:26,474
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1041
01:23:26,499 --> 01:23:28,646
It was beautiful. When I read it, I cried.

1042
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,159
You would have me believe
that he, in his spare time,

1043
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:33,395
is running around dressed up
like a giant dinosaur?

1044
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:37,239
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur. He has
transformed himself into a giant lizard.

1045
01:23:40,431 --> 01:23:45,127
Let me ask you a question.
Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?

1046
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,825
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1047
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:50,895
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1048
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,849
He lost an arm, he's been trying to grow
it back, but the equation was imbalanced.

1049
01:23:54,874 --> 01:23:57,335
And he has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1050
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,341
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1051
01:24:01,517 --> 01:24:03,978
Okay. All right, I get it.

1052
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:06,014
Here's what we're gonna do.

1053
01:24:06,223 --> 01:24:09,232
You're gonna go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1054
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:13,997
And I'm gonna go back to protecting the
citizens of this fine, fair city of ours.

1055
01:24:14,022 --> 01:24:17,009
Sergeant Butler, would you please
escort Mr. Parker back to school?

1056
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,404
Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1057
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,349
Just bring him in. Just call him in.

1058
01:24:21,374 --> 01:24:24,271
You have to call him in.
He is a danger to everybody.

1059
01:24:24,296 --> 01:24:26,025
Just, please, listen to me.

1060
01:24:26,049 --> 01:24:26,943
Let's go.

1061
01:24:30,797 --> 01:24:32,131
Jimmy.

1062
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:37,077
Get me everything we have on
Dr. Curtis Connors. Okay? Right away.

1063
01:24:37,102 --> 01:24:38,138
Yeah.

1064
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:06,648
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1065
01:25:06,673 --> 01:25:09,911
Current temperature: 89.7.
Steady for 48 hours.

1066
01:25:09,936 --> 01:25:12,513
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings

1067
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:14,255
consistent with subject's past.

1068
01:25:19,957 --> 01:25:21,747
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1069
01:25:21,772 --> 01:25:26,496
Marked enhancement in
muscle response strength and elasticity.

1070
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,466
Eyesight similarly improved.

1071
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:39,075
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1072
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,568
This is no longer about curing ills.

1073
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:49,519
This is about finding perfection.

1074
01:25:58,528 --> 01:26:00,953
In attempt to redress regenerative relapse,

1075
01:26:00,978 --> 01:26:04,774
dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1076
01:27:39,313 --> 01:27:41,274
You stopped me once.

1077
01:27:41,735 --> 01:27:44,485
You won't stop me again.

1078
01:27:46,434 --> 01:27:49,383
I'm getting stronger every day!

1079
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,828
Oh, that sucked.

1080
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:42,707
Peter Parker.

1081
01:29:00,195 --> 01:29:01,498
Come in.

1082
01:29:04,403 --> 01:29:07,598
You should maybe...
consider coming in through the lobby.

1083
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:14,799
Also, my father is under the impression
that you require psychiatric attention.

1084
01:29:14,823 --> 01:29:15,867
Oh, really?

1085
01:29:16,092 --> 01:29:17,201
Peter.

1086
01:29:17,882 --> 01:29:18,990
What happened?

1087
01:29:19,015 --> 01:29:20,391
You should see the other guy.

1088
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:26,670
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1089
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:27,620
Hey, Gwen.

1090
01:29:27,645 --> 01:29:30,203
Honey, do you want cocoa?
Howard's making some cocoa.

1091
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,365
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1092
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:38,306
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1093
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,752
Okay. I just thought
I remembered somebody saying last week

1094
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:42,990
that her fantasy
was to live in a chocolate house.

1095
01:29:43,015 --> 01:29:44,412
Well, that's impractical.

1096
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:46,651
And fattening.

1097
01:29:49,701 --> 01:29:50,786
Chocolate house.

1098
01:29:53,617 --> 01:29:55,410
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1099
01:29:55,435 --> 01:29:58,599
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work-

1100
01:29:58,624 --> 01:30:01,752
I'm doing this...

1101
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:03,543
I have cramps.

1102
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,032
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1103
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:09,164
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1104
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:10,576
It's brutal.

1105
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:13,643
You don't want to know. It's, like, bad.

1106
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,581
Got it.

1107
01:30:14,623 --> 01:30:16,342
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1108
01:30:41,597 --> 01:30:43,381
Easy, Bug Boy.

1109
01:30:44,267 --> 01:30:45,888
What'd you call me?

1110
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:53,156
I'm going to be all right.

1111
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,748
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1112
01:30:57,237 --> 01:30:59,739
I know what this is.

1113
01:31:00,235 --> 01:31:01,570
What is it?

1114
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:07,128
Every day, for as long as I can
remember, my father has left every morning

1115
01:31:07,153 --> 01:31:12,096
and he's put a badge on his chest
and strapped a gun to his hip.

1116
01:31:14,937 --> 01:31:17,315
And every day,
for as long as I can remember,

1117
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,801
I haven't known
if he was gonna make it home.

1118
01:31:29,509 --> 01:31:31,016
I got you.

1119
01:31:32,565 --> 01:31:33,733
Okay?

1120
01:31:35,897 --> 01:31:36,898
Okay?

1121
01:31:38,608 --> 01:31:40,693
I gotta stop him, though.

1122
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:44,639
I have to, because I created him.

1123
01:31:47,825 --> 01:31:49,285
What do you mean?

1124
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,741
I gave him an equation...

1125
01:31:55,348 --> 01:31:57,475
...that made all of this possible.

1126
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,532
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1127
01:32:08,184 --> 01:32:11,055
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1128
01:32:13,997 --> 01:32:16,458
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1129
01:32:19,935 --> 01:32:21,954
I have to fix it.

1130
01:32:25,315 --> 01:32:26,555
Peter.

1131
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,039
Hey.

1132
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:34,664
Let's get out of here.

1133
01:32:35,262 --> 01:32:38,907
Let's just get out of here.
Just for a minute. Can we?

1134
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:41,790
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1135
01:32:41,815 --> 01:32:42,899
- Yes.
- No.

1136
01:32:42,938 --> 01:32:43,639
Yes.

1137
01:32:43,664 --> 01:32:45,813
If my parents see me leaving, I'm dead.

1138
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:53,325
Your parents aren't gonna see you leaving.

1139
01:33:06,844 --> 01:33:08,470
<i>Peter Parker.</i>

1140
01:33:08,972 --> 01:33:10,640
<i>Spider-Man.</i>

1141
01:33:10,777 --> 01:33:13,359
<i>I'm not the one who needs help.</i>

1142
01:33:14,439 --> 01:33:17,592
<i>There will be no more loneliness,
no more outcasts.</i>

1143
01:33:17,617 --> 01:33:23,946
<i>Species-wide distribution could
enhance humanity on an evolutionary scale.</i>

1144
01:33:24,311 --> 01:33:26,532
<i>One has to adapt to survive.</i>

1145
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:31,727
"That, changing like the snake,

1146
01:33:31,752 --> 01:33:36,594
I might be free to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1147
01:33:36,785 --> 01:33:41,199
<i>Would you give it all up
after all you know you can do?</i>

1148
01:33:41,224 --> 01:33:43,477
<i>All the power you feel.</i>

1149
01:33:47,332 --> 01:33:49,375
<i>I can save them!</i>

1150
01:33:55,852 --> 01:34:00,485
<i>You're not gonna get in the way
of my plan, Peter Parker!</i>

1151
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,269
Go. Go!

1152
01:35:04,518 --> 01:35:06,628
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1153
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:26,558
All these souls lost and alone.

1154
01:35:26,747 --> 01:35:29,449
I can save them. I can cure them.

1155
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:31,964
There's no need to stop me, Peter.

1156
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,704
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1157
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,282
Stop this. This isn't you.

1158
01:35:54,227 --> 01:35:55,458
Let's talk this out.

1159
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:57,454
Doc!

1160
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:04,563
Oh, boy.

1161
01:36:09,493 --> 01:36:11,099
All right, so you don't want to talk?

1162
01:36:11,706 --> 01:36:13,063
There you go.

1163
01:36:16,863 --> 01:36:18,204
Don't...

1164
01:36:18,591 --> 01:36:19,782
...make me...

1165
01:36:20,131 --> 01:36:21,188
...have to...

1166
01:36:21,665 --> 01:36:22,782
...hurt you!

1167
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:31,965
That is disgusting.

1168
01:36:42,166 --> 01:36:43,543
Gwen.

1169
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:09,170
I'm gonna throw you out the window now.

1170
01:37:09,195 --> 01:37:10,014
What?

1171
01:37:23,155 --> 01:37:26,069
Somebody's been a bad lizard.

1172
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:16,962
This is Lieutenant Williams from
the New York City Police Department.

1173
01:38:16,987 --> 01:38:18,915
We've got this building surrounded.

1174
01:38:27,164 --> 01:38:29,166
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1175
01:38:41,343 --> 01:38:42,636
- Hey.
- Where are you?

1176
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:43,788
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1177
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:47,341
I'm down in the sewer, I'm tracking him. 
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1178
01:38:47,366 --> 01:38:49,745
But we need an antidote. 
Do you know how to run a serum?

1179
01:38:49,769 --> 01:38:52,163
- Yeah, I do it for Connors all the time.
- Okay, great.

1180
01:38:52,272 --> 01:38:54,320
Listen, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1181
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:59,784
I need you to access the cross-species
file. It's a blue serum File 12389.

1182
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:01,022
Okay, got it.

1183
01:39:01,047 --> 01:39:02,319
On my way.

1184
01:39:33,598 --> 01:39:37,960
I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness,

1185
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:40,054
without outcasts.

1186
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:44,311
I sought to create a stronger human being,
but there's no such thing.

1187
01:39:44,336 --> 01:39:49,726
Human beings are weak, pathetic, 
feeble-minded creatures.

1188
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:54,364
Why be human at all 
when we can be so much more?

1189
01:39:54,389 --> 01:39:58,007
Faster. Stronger. Smarter.

1190
01:39:58,032 --> 01:40:00,868
This is my gift to you.

1191
01:40:09,593 --> 01:40:11,046
Oscorp.

1192
01:40:13,444 --> 01:40:14,967
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1193
01:40:14,992 --> 01:40:18,737
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed toward Canal Street.

1194
01:40:18,761 --> 01:40:20,905
- What about Spider-Man?
- He's inside the high school.

1195
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,929
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1196
01:42:09,979 --> 01:42:12,928
The lizard creature 
has released a biological agent.

1197
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:14,733
All efforts to stop him have failed

1198
01:42:14,758 --> 01:42:18,085
and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.

1199
01:42:21,844 --> 01:42:23,421
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1200
01:42:23,446 --> 01:42:24,739
Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.

1201
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:26,516
You have to get out of there now, okay?

1202
01:42:26,541 --> 01:42:27,566
The antidote is cooking.

1203
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:31,561
No, no, no. Connors is on the way. 
He's coming to you right now.

1204
01:42:31,586 --> 01:42:34,296
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1205
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:35,421
Eight minutes left.

1206
01:42:35,446 --> 01:42:38,397
You're gonna wait eight minutes after
what I told you? People are gonna die.

1207
01:42:38,422 --> 01:42:41,155
You leave right now.
That is an order, okay?

1208
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,507
I'll get everybody out.

1209
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:43,140
Did you hear wh-

1210
01:42:43,874 --> 01:42:44,972
Gwen! Gwen!

1211
01:42:44,996 --> 01:42:47,210
You Mother Hubbard. Are you serious?

1212
01:43:03,732 --> 01:43:04,900
He's heading south.

1213
01:43:15,544 --> 01:43:17,832
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1214
01:43:17,857 --> 01:43:20,403
You are surrounded. There is no escape.

1215
01:43:21,299 --> 01:43:22,278
Go, go!

1216
01:44:24,631 --> 01:44:25,791
Clear!

1217
01:44:26,276 --> 01:44:27,402
Clear up top!

1218
01:44:29,081 --> 01:44:30,332
Clear, sir!

1219
01:44:30,546 --> 01:44:31,714
All clear here, sir!

1220
01:44:57,104 --> 01:44:58,182
Freeze!

1221
01:44:59,369 --> 01:45:00,900
Down on the ground.

1222
01:45:00,925 --> 01:45:02,385
Your hands behind your head.

1223
01:45:02,604 --> 01:45:03,830
Now!

1224
01:45:07,398 --> 01:45:08,588
Parker.

1225
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:12,056
It's headed to Oscorp!

1226
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:14,174
And your daughter's there right now.

1227
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,453
You gotta let me go.

1228
01:45:42,718 --> 01:45:43,781
Hold your fire!

1229
01:45:50,852 --> 01:45:53,343
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1230
01:45:53,368 --> 01:45:58,164
I won't venture to say what it is crawling
up the north side of the Oscorp Tower,

1231
01:45:58,189 --> 01:46:01,442
but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1232
01:46:17,184 --> 01:46:19,460
Time remaining: one minute.

1233
01:47:32,876 --> 01:47:34,906
Antidote complete.

1234
01:47:47,629 --> 01:47:49,062
Oh, man.

1235
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:52,390
We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.

1236
01:47:52,415 --> 01:47:56,429
The New York Police Department
has called for a city-wide evacuation,

1237
01:47:56,454 --> 01:47:58,648
everything south of 54th Street.

1238
01:47:59,265 --> 01:48:03,882
If you are south of 54th Street, you
have to move out of the area immediately.

1239
01:48:12,982 --> 01:48:16,007
Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.

1240
01:48:16,032 --> 01:48:20,039
He looks injured, and it's really
not clear if he's gonna make it.

1241
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:22,468
That's the guy 
who saved my boy on the bridge.

1242
01:48:22,872 --> 01:48:26,046
Troy, they're clearing us out.
Something bad's going down in Midtown.

1243
01:48:26,336 --> 01:48:29,492
Hey, you still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th Avenue?

1244
01:48:29,517 --> 01:48:31,436
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1245
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:33,757
The cops are evacuating everybody.
Who the hell cares?

1246
01:48:33,782 --> 01:48:35,414
Get him on the phone for me.

1247
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:56,450
Hey, Charlie, 
get me Enrique on 54th Street!

1248
01:48:56,475 --> 01:48:58,560
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1249
01:48:58,585 --> 01:49:00,920
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1250
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,200
All tower cranes on 6th,

1251
01:49:04,225 --> 01:49:07,937
swing your jib arms over the avenue
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1252
01:49:08,183 --> 01:49:10,981
Spider-Man needs those big boys
high and lined up.

1253
01:49:11,006 --> 01:49:13,050
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.

1254
01:49:46,556 --> 01:49:47,856
Come on, Parker.

1255
01:51:44,341 --> 01:51:45,258
Hey.

1256
01:51:45,283 --> 01:51:46,368
Dad!

1257
01:51:46,393 --> 01:51:47,723
I have to get this to Spider-Man.

1258
01:51:47,747 --> 01:51:48,711
Get in. Let's go.

1259
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,609
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1260
01:51:50,634 --> 01:51:52,922
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1261
01:51:53,726 --> 01:51:57,294
Your boyfriend is a man
of many masks. I get it.

1262
01:51:57,519 --> 01:51:58,603
Give me this

1263
01:51:58,794 --> 01:52:00,226
Get in the car.

1264
01:52:04,231 --> 01:52:06,148
Please make sure he's okay.

1265
01:52:18,861 --> 01:52:21,578
Initialising Ganali device.

1266
01:52:21,603 --> 01:52:25,258
Detonation in T-minus two minutes.

1267
01:53:47,144 --> 01:53:49,689
Poor Peter Parker.

1268
01:53:50,924 --> 01:53:54,719
No mother, no father...

1269
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,734
...no uncle.

1270
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:00,711
All alone.

1271
01:54:01,672 --> 01:54:03,129
He's not alone.

1272
01:54:21,924 --> 01:54:25,203
Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.

1273
01:54:33,289 --> 01:54:34,452
Hey!

1274
01:54:34,477 --> 01:54:35,562
Gift from Gwen.

1275
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,500
I got this, Peter! Go!

1276
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:48,000
T-minus 30 seconds.

1277
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:08,601
Detonation in T-minus 10 seconds.

1278
01:55:09,904 --> 01:55:10,905
Nine.

1279
01:55:11,779 --> 01:55:12,914
Eight.

1280
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:14,656
Seven.

1281
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,351
Six.

1282
01:55:17,239 --> 01:55:18,532
Five.

1283
01:55:19,147 --> 01:55:20,281
Four.

1284
01:55:21,363 --> 01:55:22,364
Three.

1285
01:55:23,765 --> 01:55:24,877
Two.

1286
01:55:26,218 --> 01:55:27,296
One.

1287
01:55:52,978 --> 01:55:54,647
No.

1288
01:55:56,242 --> 01:55:58,200
No!

1289
01:57:09,244 --> 01:57:10,370
The captain.

1290
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:13,282
Captain!

1291
01:57:15,834 --> 01:57:17,252
The Lizard.

1292
01:57:17,621 --> 01:57:19,826
It's okay. We stopped him.

1293
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:21,271
Okay.

1294
01:57:21,296 --> 01:57:23,591
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

1295
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:26,225
Okay, okay, okay.

1296
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:29,072
Look at me. Stay with me.
Help's on the way, okay?

1297
01:57:29,096 --> 01:57:30,208
You need to...

1298
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:35,021
You need to be gone
when they get here. Okay?

1299
01:57:35,317 --> 01:57:36,802
I'm not going anywhere.

1300
01:57:37,288 --> 01:57:39,310
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1301
01:57:40,299 --> 01:57:42,036
This city needs you.

1302
01:57:43,681 --> 01:57:44,974
Here.

1303
01:57:45,603 --> 01:57:47,107
You're gonna need this.

1304
01:57:51,185 --> 01:57:53,021
You're gonna make enemies.

1305
01:57:55,596 --> 01:57:57,431
People will get hurt.

1306
01:57:59,063 --> 01:58:01,333
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1307
01:58:04,909 --> 01:58:07,193
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1308
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:12,665
Leave Gwen out of it.

1309
01:58:15,256 --> 01:58:16,883
Promise me that.

1310
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:24,181
You promise me.

1311
01:59:38,006 --> 01:59:41,224
An eerie calm has set in 
over New York City.

1312
01:59:41,257 --> 01:59:46,812
Apparently, some sort of aerosolised
antidote was launched from Oscorp Tower,

1313
01:59:46,841 --> 01:59:49,759
which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.

1314
01:59:49,784 --> 01:59:52,661
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully,

1315
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:55,449
knowing that the alleged mastermind
of this terror plot,

1316
01:59:55,474 --> 01:59:58,568
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.

1317
01:59:58,991 --> 02:00:02,802
We've got John Niles on the street
for a report in Lower Manhattan.

1318
02:00:02,827 --> 02:00:04,411
John, what do you see?

1319
02:00:37,406 --> 02:00:39,575
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1320
02:00:41,649 --> 02:00:43,138
It's all right.

1321
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:46,069
It's all right.

1322
02:00:46,663 --> 02:00:47,802
Rough night.

1323
02:00:49,574 --> 02:00:51,130
It's gonna be all right.

1324
02:01:45,043 --> 02:01:46,753
Where have you been?

1325
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:51,107
Hi.

1326
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:57,685
My father died.

1327
02:02:01,854 --> 02:02:03,606
There was a funeral.

1328
02:02:05,129 --> 02:02:06,463
They shot off...

1329
02:02:08,324 --> 02:02:10,841
...rifles and they made speeches.

1330
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:16,591
Two of my teachers showed up.

1331
02:02:18,096 --> 02:02:19,638
And Flash showed up.

1332
02:02:24,331 --> 02:02:26,771
Everyone was there but you.

1333
02:02:41,556 --> 02:02:43,683
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1334
02:02:46,061 --> 02:02:48,104
I'm sorry. I can't...

1335
02:02:48,395 --> 02:02:49,813
What are you saying?

1336
02:02:49,838 --> 02:02:51,673
I can't see you any more.

1337
02:02:53,605 --> 02:02:55,064
I can't.

1338
02:03:20,673 --> 02:03:22,675
He made you promise, didn't he?

1339
02:03:26,609 --> 02:03:30,488
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1340
02:03:57,062 --> 02:03:58,797
What a pretty girl.

1341
02:03:59,079 --> 02:04:00,247
Yeah.

1342
02:04:00,531 --> 02:04:02,325
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1343
02:04:03,164 --> 02:04:04,832
Did you ask her out?

1344
02:04:08,563 --> 02:04:09,897
Why?

1345
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:12,258
Can't.

1346
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:14,883
Why?

1347
02:04:17,579 --> 02:04:19,289
I'm just no good for her.

1348
02:04:22,499 --> 02:04:26,305
Peter Parker, if there's one thing you are,
it's good.

1349
02:04:27,092 --> 02:04:29,594
Anyone has a problem with that 
can talk to me.

1350
02:04:47,586 --> 02:04:54,673
Peter, I know things have been
difficult lately and I'm sorry about that.

1351
02:04:55,137 --> 02:04:57,431
I think I know what you're feeling.

1352
02:04:57,949 --> 02:05:00,751
Ever since you were a little boy,

1353
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:04,947
you've been living with
so many unresolved things.

1354
02:05:06,407 --> 02:05:08,892
Well, take it from an old man.

1355
02:05:09,691 --> 02:05:12,486
Those things send us down a road.

1356
02:05:12,665 --> 02:05:14,611
They make us who we are.

1357
02:05:15,194 --> 02:05:20,449
And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.

1358
02:05:21,041 --> 02:05:23,460
You owe the world your gifts.

1359
02:05:23,927 --> 02:05:26,673
You just have to figure out
how to use them.

1360
02:05:27,394 --> 02:05:33,048
And know that wherever they take you,
we'll always be here.

1361
02:05:34,135 --> 02:05:36,650
So come on home, Peter.

1362
02:05:37,237 --> 02:05:39,072
You're my hero.

1363
02:05:39,482 --> 02:05:40,983
And I love you.

1364
02:05:49,716 --> 02:05:51,421
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1365
02:05:51,446 --> 02:05:52,906
Hey. How's it going?

1366
02:05:53,063 --> 02:05:54,569
You coming along, man?

1367
02:05:56,877 --> 02:05:57,913
Cool shirt.

1368
02:05:59,572 --> 02:06:02,224
Yeah. Dude's crazy.

1369
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:04,136
But chicks dig him.

1370
02:06:06,649 --> 02:06:08,967
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1371
02:06:18,781 --> 02:06:21,600
I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students

1372
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:24,879
that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1373
02:06:26,187 --> 02:06:28,389
Well, I'm here to tell you he was wrong.

1374
02:06:28,414 --> 02:06:29,832
There is only one:

1375
02:06:30,783 --> 02:06:32,284
"Who am I"?

1376
02:06:32,891 --> 02:06:36,319
Mr. Parker. Tardy again.

1377
02:06:37,884 --> 02:06:39,913
At least we can always count on you.

1378
02:06:39,938 --> 02:06:42,428
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1379
02:06:42,453 --> 02:06:44,733
Don't make promises you can't keep, 
Mr. Parker.

1380
02:06:47,330 --> 02:06:49,499
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1381
02:06:49,524 --> 02:06:53,623
Okay, class, open your books.
Let's begin on page one.

1382
02:09:48,881 --> 02:09:50,584
Hello, doctor.

1383
02:09:51,228 --> 02:09:53,068
Did you tell the boy?

1384
02:09:53,093 --> 02:09:54,328
Tell him what?

1385
02:09:54,353 --> 02:09:58,107
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1386
02:09:59,579 --> 02:10:00,592
No.

1387
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:02,294
Well, that's very good.

1388
02:10:02,705 --> 02:10:04,982
So we'll let him be for now.

1389
02:10:05,888 --> 02:10:07,973
You should leave him alone!
