1
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,797
You swear it?

2
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:16,135
By the Mother. My son has no interest
in the Iron Throne.

3
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,686
Then I see no reason for hostility
between us.

4
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,731
Your son can go on calling himself
King in the North.

5
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,818
The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,

6
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,445
provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,655
And the wording of this oath?

8
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,283
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,705
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,879
And in return for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,923
In the morning, I'll destroy
my brother's army.

12
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,804
When that's done, Baratheon and Stark
will fight their common enemy together.

13
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,223
As they have done many times before.

14
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,232
Our two houses have always been close.

15
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,695
Which is why l am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

16
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,115
-Negotiate a peace with your brother.
-Negotiate with Stannis?

17
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,534
You heard him out there.

18
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,662
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

19
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,583
Please bring my terms to your son.

20
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,171
I believe we are natural allies.
I hope he feels the same.

21
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,299
Together, we could end
this war in a fortnight.

22
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,190
No!

23
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,119
-You'll die for this.
-No, wait, it wasn't her!

24
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,790
We’ve got to leave.

25
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,252
They'll hang you for this.

26
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,216
-Now.
-I won't leave him.

27
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,595
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

28
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,015
Over there!

29
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,517
Not that way.

30
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,970
We need to go home.

31
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,514
Loras.

32
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,808
-My lord, my lady.
-Get out.

33
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,852
Stannis will be here in an hour.

34
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,938
When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

35
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,608
Your former companions
will fight for the privilege

36
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,318
of selling you to their new king.

37
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,862
And you want that privilege for yourself.

38
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:07,492
You will note that I'm standing here
talking to you, not Stannis.

39
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,993
There's no time for this.

40
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,080
Ride back to Highgarden, sister.
I'm not running from Stannis.

41
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,791
-Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
-I don't believe that.

42
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,918
You don't believe that.

43
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,630
Who gained the most from our king's death?

44
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,340
Stannis.

45
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,967
I will put a sword through
his righteous face.

46
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,094
We can't stay here.

47
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,055
He would have been a true king.

48
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,974
A good king.

49
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,813
Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire
most in this world?

50
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,689
Revenge.

51
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,734
I have always found that
to be the purest of motivations.

52
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,779
But you won't have a chance to put
your sword through Stannis.

53
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,866
Not today. You'll be cut to pieces
before he sets foot on solid ground.

54
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,411
If it is justice that you want,
be smart about it.

55
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,288
You can't avenge him from the grave.

56
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,501
Bring the horses.

57
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,338
Please.

58
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,705
-He was very handsome.
-He was, Your Grace.

59
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,456
"Your Grace."

60
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,003
Calling yourself king doesn't
make you one.

61
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,922
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

62
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,302
-Do you want to be a queen?
-No.

63
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,806
I want to be the Queen.

64
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,739
-Killed? By whom?
-Accounts differ.

65
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,783
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark
in some way.

66
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,327
Really? Who would have thought?

67
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,871
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

68
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,832
while still others say
it was Stannis himself who did it

69
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,084
after negotiations went sour.

70
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,504
-To whomever did it, I say, "Well done."
-That's not what Varys says.

71
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,007
He says Renly's army is flocking
to support Stannis.

72
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,886
Which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

73
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,263
Littlefinger says we can outspend
him three to one.

74
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,266
And l say Father raised you
to have too much respect for money.

75
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,103
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

76
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,438
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

77
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,024
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you could ship her away?

78
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,400
She'll be safer in Dorne.

79
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,444
Yes, l know how concerned
you are for her safety.

80
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,570
It so happens that l am.

81
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,157
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and l don't blame her at all for you.

82
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,826
So clever.

83
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,623
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

84
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,001
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

85
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,713
They are going to attack us.
We need to be ready.

86
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,590
No need to concern yourself over it.

87
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,177
The King is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.

88
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,806
May I ask specifically
what the King has in mind?

89
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:21,060
You may specifically or you may ask
vaguely. The answer will be same.

90
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,568
It's important that we talk about this.

91
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,116
It's the King's royal prerogative

92
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,911
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

93
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,213
It's wildfire.

94
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,090
Wildfire?

95
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,553
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

96
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,597
-No.
-That's a lie right there.

97
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,766
It is not a lie. Why would l lie?

98
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,102
Tell me,

99
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,231
if the vile allegations against my brother
and sister are true,

100
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,610
do you think it will make Jaime more
likely to kill you or less likely?

101
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,989
When I tell him you're fucking her,
I mean.

102
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,866
I'm telling you the truth.

103
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,326
The smart money would be
on more likely--

104
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,869
She's making wildfire!

105
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,538
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges
would give him sympathy for yours.

106
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,165
The Alchemists' Guild
is being commissioned.

107
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,916
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

108
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,544
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults!

109
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,588
They are planning to launch it
from the city walls

110
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,549
into Stannis's ships and armies. Please!

111
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,969
When did she tell you this?

112
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,390
l heard her talking with the pyromancer.

113
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:47,438
And the other night after I left her,
she went to meet him,

114
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,939
I swear to you.

115
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,901
-Swear to me on what?
-On my life.

116
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,235
But I don't care about your life.

117
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,406
In the light of the Seven,
by all that is holy and right,

118
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,284
I, Lancel Lannister,
do solemnly vow that--

119
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,245
All right, enough.
Even torturing you is boring.

120
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,705
Just get out.

121
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,087
Lancel? Tell my friend Bronn

122
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,005
to please kill you if anything
should happen to me.

123
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,801
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

124
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,097
It will be my pleasure.

125
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,394
Your Grace.

126
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,523
-What is it?
-I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.

127
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,442
l wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

128
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,194
Fools love a fool.

129
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,446
I grieve for him as well.

130
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,282
For the boy he was,
not the man he grew to be.

131
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,910
I need to speak to you about
what I saw in that cave.

132
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,203
l thought l made it clear to you
there'd be no need

133
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,830
-to speak to me on this matter.
-Your Grace, l--

134
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,998
I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.

135
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,002
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

136
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,839
-You've come to lecture me on truth?
-I’ve come to tell you that what l saw--

137
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,258
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

138
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,804
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.

139
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,515
They won't be able to resist us now.

140
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,225
Soon l shall be sitting
on the Iron Throne.

141
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,769
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the Iron--

142
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,062
I'll hear no more about it.

143
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,698
Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.

144
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,451
When do we sail for King's Landing?

145
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,744
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

146
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,414
We'll make short work
of the Lannisters' fleet.

147
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,458
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

148
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,960
we'll deliver our troops
to their doorstep and take the city.

149
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,380
And will you bring
Lady Melisandre with you?

150
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,383
Well, that's not your concern.

151
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,846
If you take King's Landing with her
by your side, the victory will be hers.

152
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,307
l never thought I’d have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was l wrong?

153
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,851
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

154
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,352
Truth again.

155
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,938
All right, what's the truth?

156
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,275
The hard truth?

157
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,821
She is a foreigner, preaching her
foreign religion.

158
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,492
Some believe she whispers orders
in your ear, and you obey.

159
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,580
What do you believe?

160
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,628
You won those bannermen from Renly.

161
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,339
Don't lose them to her.

162
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,305
We'll set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

163
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,393
And you will lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

164
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,855
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

165
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,190
was spent evading ships,

166
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,734
not attacking them. The other lords
won't be happy.

167
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,321
Most of those lords should
consider themselves lucky

168
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,572
I don't hang them for treason.

169
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,411
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

170
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,431
Yes! I've got it! I've got it!

171
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,976
So it's that one there
at the top, on the right.

172
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,105
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

173
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,025
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

174
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,610
What do we have?

175
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,154
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

176
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,116
Well, I’ve never actually been able
to kill people with it.

177
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,119
Good thing. I'd be out of a job.

178
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,580
What about your father?

179
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,749
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

180
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,543
He's very busy.

181
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,422
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

182
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,258
We won't be able to hold
the city against Stannis,

183
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,718
not the way Joffrey's planning
on holding it.

184
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,970
-Corruption!
-Yes!

185
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,474
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

186
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,437
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings,

187
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,398
and we're surprised when the fruit
of their incest is rotten?

188
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,152
Yes, a rotten king!

189
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,821
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

190
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,699
Not after what he did
to your birthday present.

191
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,118
The King is a lost cause.

192
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,746
It's the rest of us
I'm worried about now.

193
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,000
A dancing king, prancing down
his bloodstained halls

194
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,420
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey!

195
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,424
You have to admire
his imagination.

196
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,925
He's talking about you.

197
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,261
What?

198
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,180
Demon monkey?

199
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,806
People think you're pulling
the king's strings.

200
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,100
They blame you for the city's ills.

201
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,519
Blame me? I'm trying
to save them.

202
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,271
You don't need to convince me.

203
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,067
Demon monkey.

204
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,473
Yeah, come on.

205
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,183
You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?

206
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,478
I'm your commander. Welcome.

207
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,484
Stop. Stop!

208
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,612
Your Captain commands you to stop!

209
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,615
Where we headed, Captain?

210
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,910
The Stony Shore.

211
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,121
To raid their villages.

212
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,833
There'll be spoils in it for you,
and women, if you do your jobs well.

213
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,627
And who decides
if we've done our jobs well?

214
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,091
I do. Your Captain.

215
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,179
l have been reaving and raping

216
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,599
since before you left
Balon's balls, Captain.

217
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,187
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

218
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,649
Don't reckon I've got much use
for a Captain at all.

219
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,486
I'm thinking l can do the job of captain
real well myself.

220
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,989
All l need is a ship.

221
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,618
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

222
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,626
You can do that. Take the ship,
head out on your own.

223
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,671
And I will hunt you down,
drag you back here in chains

224
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,797
and hang you for a traitor.

225
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,341
Stop! We yield!

226
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,473
Congratulations on your first command.

227
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,601
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

228
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,229
I'm not here for you. I was just
on my way to Red Harbor.

229
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,650
I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere
to put them here.

230
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,110
Too narrow.

231
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,070
Better get out there.

232
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,031
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

233
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,824
That would never happen.

234
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,119
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if l asked them to.

235
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,830
This lot, though…

236
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,626
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

237
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,550
Come on. I'll take you out.

238
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,096
-Who are you?
-Dagmer. Your first mate.

239
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,265
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

240
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,187
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

241
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,605
That would be good for a laugh.

242
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,024
They're not going to respect you
until you prove yourself.

243
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,861
And how am l supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

244
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,904
You're not.

245
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,115
And yet that's the task
my father has given me.

246
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,868
To prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.

247
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,414
They're all Iron Islanders.
Do they do as they're told,

248
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,500
or do they do as they like?

249
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,801
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

250
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,971
The seat of the House of Tallhart.

251
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,765
A more impressive prize than a few
fishermen's daughters.

252
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,562
-What, you don't think we could take it?
-No, we could.

253
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,438
But we could never hold it
for more than a few days.

254
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,400
As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

255
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,318
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

256
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,989
And then…

257
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,247
Take me to my ship.

258
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,170
The Starks have overextended their lines.

259
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,882
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

260
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,550
keeping their men and horses fed.

261
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,094
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

262
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,429
The cold won't beat them.

263
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,933
Our spies report growing discontent
among the northern lords.

264
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,938
They want to return home and gather
the harvest before the crops turn.

265
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,108
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

266
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,445
they'd report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.

267
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,363
This is war. No one's content.

268
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,244
We've underestimated the Stark boy
for too long.

269
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,205
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

270
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,583
And as long as he keeps winning battles,

271
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,044
they'll keep believing
he is King in the North.

272
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,422
You've been waiting for him to fail.

273
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,509
He's not going to fail,
not without our help.

274
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,598
So how do we stop him?

275
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,516
We’ve worked through the night, my lord.

276
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,102
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

277
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,188
Yes, l think you would, Reginald.

278
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,233
And because you're my cousin, l might
even let you wake from that sleep.

279
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,154
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

280
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,532
-My wife's in Lannisport.
-Well, then you'd better start riding.

281
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,704
Go. Before I change my mind
and send her your head.

282
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,708
If your name wasn't Lannister,
you'd be scrubbing out pots

283
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,710
in the cook's tent. Go!

284
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,091
Not wine. Water.

285
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,051
We'll be here for some time.

286
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,265
Girl.

287
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,977
Where are you from?

288
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,646
Maidenpool, my lord.

289
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,900
And who are the lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

290
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,321
-House Mooton, my lord.
-And what is their sigil?

291
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:30,580
A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool
girl would remember that.

292
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,167
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

293
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,213
Good. Now, one more time.
Where are you from?

294
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,550
Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin.

295
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,512
Two crossed longaxes
beneath a black crown.

296
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,767
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

297
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,313
They call him the Young Wolf.

298
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,399
And?

299
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,486
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.

300
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,616
They say he can turn into a wolf
himself when he wants.

301
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,578
They say he can't be killed.

302
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,414
And do you believe them?

303
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,292
No, my lord.

304
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,961
Anyone can be killed.

305
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,679
Fetch that water.

306
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,222
A girl says nothing.

307
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,019
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

308
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:22,067
No one hears, and friends
may talk in secret, yes?

309
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,075
-A boy becomes a girl.
-I was always a girl.

310
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:34,204
And I was always aware.
But a girl keeps secrets.

311
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,541
It is not for a man to spoil them.

312
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,461
You're one of them now.

313
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,590
I should have let you burn.

314
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,429
And you fetch water for one of them now.

315
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,432
Why is this right for you
and wrong for me?

316
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,978
-l didn't have a choice.
-You did.

317
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,732
I did. And here we are.

318
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,115
A man pays his debts.
A man owes three.

319
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,741
Three what?

320
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,745
The Red God takes what is his,
lovely girl.

321
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,874
And only death may pay for life.

322
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,586
You saved me, and the two I was with.

323
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,463
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

324
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,136
We have to give them back.

325
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:39,102
Speak three names,
and the man will do the rest.

326
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,524
Three lives I will give you.
No more, no less.

327
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,401
And we are done.

328
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,906
I can name anyone?
And you'll kill him?

329
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,950
A man has said.

330
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,498
-The one who tortures everyone.
-A man needs a name.

331
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,211
I don't know his name.
They call him the Tickler.

332
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,921
That is enough.

333
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,550
Go now, girl.
Your master is thirsty.

334
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,235
He's not here yet. He'd have seen us,
blown the horn.

335
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,861
When will he come?

336
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,447
The Halfhand does things in his own time.

337
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,950
My uncle told me stories about him.

338
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,826
Most of them are true.

339
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,205
I heard the Halfhand spent half
of last winter beyond the Wall.

340
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,748
The whole winter.

341
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,125
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

342
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,585
Had to wait for the thaw.

343
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,548
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own?

344
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,842
It's possible for the Halfhand.

345
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,636
Beautiful, isn't it?

346
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,930
Gilly would love it here.

347
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,684
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

348
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,672
About time you did something.

349
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,174
At least you'll keep warm.

350
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,178
The Fist of the First Men.

351
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,515
Think of how old this place is.

352
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,269
Before the Targaryens defeated
the Andals,

353
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,938
before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.

354
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,774
Before I die, please stop talking.

355
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,694
Thousands and thousands of years ago,

356
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,405
the First Men stood here,
where we're standing.

357
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,198
All through the long night.

358
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,203
What do you think they were like,
the First Men?

359
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,000
Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.

360
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,877
I think they were afraid.

361
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,757
I think they came here
to get away from something.

362
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,676
And I don't think it worked.

363
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,766
Wildlings?

364
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:29,064
One blast is for rangers returning.
Wildlings is two blasts.

365
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,317
So you got to stand there waiting,

366
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,277
wondering.

367
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,404
One blast for friends…

368
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,366
two for foes.

369
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,411
And three for White Walkers.

370
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,460
It's been a thousand years,
but that's the only time

371
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,795
they blow the horn three times.

372
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,672
Well, if it's been a thousand years,
how do you know?

373
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,508
Well…

374
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,134
-I read it in a book.
-I read it in a book.

375
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,470
Look!

376
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,598
That's Qhorin Halfhand.

377
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,018
Aye. We'll live another day.

378
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,437
Hurrah.

379
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,241
Take care, my lord.

380
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,953
l remember reading
an old sailors' proverb,

381
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,956
"Piss on wildfire
and your cock burns off."

382
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,626
I have not conducted this experiment.

383
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:36,089
It could well be true.
The substance burns so hot,

384
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:41,719
it melts wood, stone, even steel,
and, of course, flesh.

385
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:47,142
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

386
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:53,898
After the dragons died,
wildfire was the key

387
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,692
to the Targaryen power.

388
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,112
My companion takes issue.

389
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,574
If I could tell you how many crazy
old men I've seen pushing carts

390
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,536
around army camps, making grand
claims about jars full of pig shit.

391
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,415
-No offense meant.
-Our order does not deal in pig shit.

392
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,211
The substance is fire given form,
and we have been perfecting it

393
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,505
-since the days of Maegor.
-To do what?

394
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,885
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

395
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,011
How much do you have?

396
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,102
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

397
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,189
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in ten.

398
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,984
But all the real soldiers
are in the Riverlands with your father.

399
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,028
my lord, this man is insulting.

400
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,280
I don't know if you've ever seen
a battle, old man,

401
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,158
but things can get a bit messy.
'Cause when we're flinging things

402
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,452
at Stannis, he's flinging
them right back at us.

403
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,246
Men die, men shit themselves,
men run.

404
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,042
Which means pots falling.
Which means fire inside the walls.

405
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,921
Which means the poor cunts trying
to defend the city end up burning it down.

406
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,049
My friend remains unconvinced.

407
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,178
He would not dare insult my order
whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.

408
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,305
Well, he's not living anymore.

409
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,767
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

410
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,811
Men win wars, not magic tricks.

411
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,082
We have been working tirelessly,
day and night,

412
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,461
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

413
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:44,384
Our present count stands at 7,811.

414
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:50,181
Enough to burn
Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.

415
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,766
This is a shit idea.

416
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,895
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne.

417
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,358
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

418
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,697
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

419
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,034
You'll be making it for me.

420
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,087
Dracarys.

421
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,930
Dracarys.

422
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,443
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

423
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,409
-Let him sleep, Doreah.
-Yes, Khaleesi.

424
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,205
He loves you.

425
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,177
Thank you, my friend.

426
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,682
Did you see the dress Xaro
had made for you?

427
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,394
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

428
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,520
It is known.

429
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,858
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city
in Essos--

430
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:27,403
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to Khal Drogo.

431
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,871
Xaro is our host, but we know
nothing about him.

432
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,001
Men like to talk about other men
when they are happy.

433
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,261
You would look like
a real princess in Xaro's--

434
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,305
She is not a princess, she's a khaleesi.

435
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,732
You should wear it, Khaleesi.
You are their guest.

436
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,776
It would be rude not to.

437
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,924
And you must visit the night market.

438
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,721
The Qartheen night market
is like no night market you’ve ever seen.

439
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,597
It sounds wonderful.

440
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,142
The Meereenis think
they have a night market.

441
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,935
I will take you there myself.

442
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,312
Please excuse me for a minute.

443
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,235
What are they doing?

444
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,155
Mallaco says the statue
is too heavy to carry.

445
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,075
Kovarro says that Mallaco is an idiot.
They can pry out the gems.

446
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,286
The rest is pure gold. Very soft.

447
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,788
He can chop off as much as we can carry.

448
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,319
My brother used to say the only
thing the Dothraki knew how to do

449
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,154
was steal things better men have built.

450
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,614
It's not the only thing.

451
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,866
They're quite good
at killing the better men.

452
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,327
That's not the kind of queen
I'm going to be.

453
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,953
Mother of Dragons.

454
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,334
On behalf of the Warlocks of Qarth,
I welcome you.

455
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,754
A demonstration.

456
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,384
Take this gem. Look at it.

457
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,221
Into its depths.

458
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,265
So many facets.

459
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,645
Look closely enough
and you can see yourself in them.

460
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,149
Often more than once.

461
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,490
Should you grow tired
of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

462
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,326
it would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying.

463
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,622
You are always welcome,
Mother of Dragons.

464
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,801
My apologies.
Bi Pree is one of the thirteen.

465
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,595
It was customary for me to extend
him an invitation.

466
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,640
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

467
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,852
What is the House of the Undying?

468
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,146
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

469
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,065
and drink Shade of the Evening.

470
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,819
It turns their lips blue
and their minds soft.

471
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:59,907
So soft, they actually believe
their parlor tricks are magic.

472
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,580
You watch over her.

473
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,834
Do I know you?

474
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:14,338
I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

475
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,634
-Who are you?
-I'm no one.

476
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,429
But she is the Mother of Dragons.

477
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,724
She needs true protectors,
now more than ever.

478
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,478
They shall come day and night to see
the wonder born into the world again.

479
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,565
And when they see, they shall lust.

480
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:39,405
For dragons are fire made flesh,
and fire is power.

481
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,792
It looked like Stannis.

482
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,254
To me, it just looked like…

483
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,304
-a shadow in the shape of a man.
-In the shape of Stannis.

484
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,937
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

485
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,105
Will you stay there long, my lady?

486
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,233
Only long enough to tell Robb
what I have seen.

487
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,071
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

488
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,199
My two youngest need me.

489
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,243
I've been away from them
for far too long.

490
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,205
I never knew my mother.

491
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:31,999
I'm sorry.

492
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:38,255
My own mother died on the birthing
bed when I was very young.

493
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,552
It's a bloody business.

494
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,765
What comes after is even harder.

495
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,936
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people...

496
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,272
will you give me leave to go, my lady?

497
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,819
-You mean to kill Stannis?
-I swore a vow.

498
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,655
But Stannis has a great army around him.

499
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,783
His own guards are sworn
to keep him safe.

500
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:10,705
I'm as good as any of them.
I should never have fled.

501
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,835
Renly's death was no fault of yours.
You served him bravely.

502
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,046
I only held him that once…

503
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,174
as he was dying.

504
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,013
He's gone, Brienne.

505
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,726
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

506
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,187
Renly's enemies
are Robb's enemies as well.

507
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,486
I do not know your son, my lady.

508
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,409
But I could serve you
if you would have me.

509
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,786
You have courage.

510
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,916
Not battle courage, perhaps,
but I don't know.

511
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,753
A woman's kind of courage.

512
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:03,090
And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

513
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,719
Promise me that you will not
hold me back from Stannis.

514
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,561
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

515
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,653
Then I am yours, my lady.

516
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,949
I will shield your back
and give my life for yours

517
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,950
if it comes to that.

518
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,454
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

519
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,590
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home,

520
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:49,178
and at my table,
and that I shall ask no service of you

521
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,763
that might bring you dishonor.

522
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,517
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

523
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,648
And it's not just thieves, my lord.

524
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,152
There's wolves in the hills now.
More than I've ever seen.

525
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,948
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

526
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,952
My three sons is away fighting
for your brother, my lord.

527
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,372
They'll fight, keep fighting
till they're told to go home.

528
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,834
l have no one to man
my flock now. Only me.

529
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,337
And I can't keep watch
all day and all night.

530
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,300
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you,

531
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,844
to help watch over your flock.

532
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,138
If you can give them room and board.

533
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:37,268
My wife always prayed for more children.
We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord.

534
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,645
May the gods bless you and yours.

535
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,733
Stop it.

536
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,196
If that's everyone, I'm going
to go for a ride before dark.

537
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,073
-Good.
-Hodor.

538
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,535
-Hodor.
-Lord Stark.

539
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,745
Torrhen's Square is under siege.

540
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,415
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

541
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,293
How can the Lannisters strike
so far north?

542
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,171
Might be a raiding party
led by the Mountain.

543
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,631
Might be sellswords paid
by Tywin Lannister.

544
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,799
We have to help them.

545
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,386
Most of the fighting men are away with
Robb, but l can gather 200 decent men.

546
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,721
Do you need so many?

547
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,932
If we can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?

548
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,436
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

549
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,522
Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.

550
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,537
-So, what does it mean?
-You should ask your Maester Luwin.

551
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,414
He's the one studying books all the time.

552
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,584
I did ask him. He never heard
of a three-eyed raven.

553
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,544
Must not mean anything, then.

554
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,296
You're lying.

555
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,757
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me liar.

556
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,135
-You know what it means.
-I never said I didn't.

557
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,471
You didn't give me an honest answer.

558
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,308
-That's not the same as being a liar.
-Well, it's not far off.

559
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,020
So, you're dreaming of
a three-eyed raven again?

560
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,067
In the godswood you told me
you didn't dream.

561
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,653
Now who's the liar?

562
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,450
What did you see in your dream?

563
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,579
Something bad?

564
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,040
Tell me, boy.

565
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,296
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

566
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,676
I saw waves crashing against the gates,

567
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,179
and then the water came flowing
over the walls.

568
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,642
It flooded the castle.

569
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,940
Drowned men were floating here,
in the yard.

570
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,237
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

571
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,701
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

572
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,496
I know. It was just a stupid dream.

573
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,456
I've got to get these potatoes
to the kitchen.

574
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,041
Otherwise, they'll put me in chains again.

575
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,420
Osha. The three-eyed raven.

576
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,216
What do they say about it,
north of the Wall?

577
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,013
They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the Wall.

578
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,735
-There.
-Where?

579
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,278
On that mountain.

580
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,947
I don't see very well.

581
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:38,532
A fire.

582
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,661
There's a fire.

583
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,999
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

584
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,294
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

585
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,630
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.

586
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,133
How many wildlings have joined him?

587
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,636
From what we can tell? All of them.

588
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,227
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

589
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,021
They're almost ready to make their move.

590
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,398
Where?

591
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,193
Somewhere safe. Somewhere south.

592
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,862
We can't just march into their midst.

593
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,449
And we can't wait for them here
with nothing but a pile

594
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,533
of stones to protect us.

595
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,411
You're saying we should fall
back to the Wall?

596
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:29,666
Mance was one of us, once.
Now he's one of them.

597
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,795
He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

598
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,132
They'll hit us in force, and they won't
run away when we hit back.

599
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,551
They're going to be more
organized than before,

600
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,263
more disciplined,
more like us.

601
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,143
So we need to be more like them.
Do things their way.

602
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,605
Sneak in, kill Mance,

603
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,067
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

604
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,695
-And to do that--
-We need to get rid of those lookouts.

605
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,658
It's not a job for 400 men.
I need to move fast.

606
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,909
And silent.

607
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,704
Harker. Stonesnake. Borba.

608
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,875
Lord Commander,
I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

609
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,255
I’ve been called lots of things,
but that might be my first "Lord Qhorin."

610
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,216
You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

611
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,679
I fought and killed a wight.
How many rangers can say that?

612
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,930
He's the one?

613
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,184
Aye, you killed a wight.

614
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,605
You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.

615
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,650
Craster?

616
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,902
In the boy's defense,
that's a tough old goat.

617
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,075
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

618
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,661
It'd be no trouble.

619
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,216
I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

620
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,428
Go.

621
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:17,107
So tell me, how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

622
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,611
He's not my manservant,
and he's not in love with me.

623
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,615
He's my advisor. My friend.

624
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:29,244
Unlikely. I can almost always
tell what a man wants.

625
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:33,499
-And what about what a woman wants?
-Much more complicated.

626
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:38,128
You, for example, what do you want?

627
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,632
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

628
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,674
Why?

629
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,177
Because I promised my khalasar
I'd protect them

630
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,428
and find them a safe home.

631
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,682
You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms
for the Dothraki?

632
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,643
I want them because they're mine by right.

633
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,562
The Iron Throne is mine
and I will take it.

634
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,148
A conqueror.

635
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,109
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?

636
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,153
No. I come from nothing.

637
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,322
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

638
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,283
except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

639
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,494
So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

640
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,665
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.

641
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,672
What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?

642
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,800
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.

643
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,134
Why?

644
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,972
I will show you why.

645
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,104
The door in the vault is made
of Valyrian stone.

646
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,482
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

647
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,696
l offered the greatest locksmiths
in Qarth their weight in gold

648
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,863
if they could break into it.

649
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,157
I made the same offer
to the greatest thieves.

650
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,244
They all went home empty handed.

651
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,790
The only thing that can open
this door is this key.

652
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,251
And behind the door?

653
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:07,759
-And it can all be mine?
-All? Let us say half.

654
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:15,392
More than enough to buy horses,
ships, armies, enough to go home.

655
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,647
-All I have to do…
-Is marry me.

656
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,609
That was a romantic proposal.

657
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,904
I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.

658
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,659
I come from nothing.

659
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,787
My mother and father never
owned a pair of shoes,

660
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,124
but marry me and I will give
you the Seven Kingdoms,

661
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,336
and our children will be princes
and princesses.

662
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:49,092
See? I have more ambition
than you thought.

663
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,890
The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen,
first of your name.

664
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,101
Robert Baratheon is dead.

665
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,319
If you cross the sea
with an army you bought bought

666
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,528
and a foreign husband who paid for it--

667
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,946
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war with one another.

668
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,449
Four false kings destroying the country.

669
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,202
To win Westeros, you need support
from Westeros.

670
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,870
The usurper is dead.

671
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,791
The Starks fight the Lannisters.
The Baratheons fight each other.

672
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,210
According to your new friend
who earned your trust

673
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,461
by cutting his hand?

674
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,631
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

675
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,384
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.

676
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,844
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

677
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,014
They'll give you ships and soldiers,
and they'll own you forever.

678
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,226
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

679
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,520
And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

680
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,771
we'd all be dead by now.

681
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,608
l know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have.

682
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,777
-But you must understand--
-Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

683
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,617
-I only want--
-What do you want? Tell me.

684
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,246
-To see you on the Iron Throne.
-Why?

685
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,625
You have a good claim,
a title, a birthright.

686
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,920
But you have something more than that.

687
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,508
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

688
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,512
You would not only be respected
and feared, you would be loved.

689
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,349
Someone who can rule and should rule.

690
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,644
Centuries come and go without a person
like that coming into the world.

691
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,607
There are times when l look at you
and l still can't believe you're real.

692
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,373
So, what would you have me do,
as my advisor?

693
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,675
Make your own way. Find your own ship.
You only need one.

694
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,387
The allies we need are
in Westeros, not Qarth.

695
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,768
-And how do I get this ship?
-I'll find it for you.

696
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,687
A sound ship with a good captain.

697
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,528
I look forward to meeting him.

698
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,284
Khaleesi.

699
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,857
You should stand side face.

700
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,195
-Side face?
-Sideways.

701
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,448
-Why?
-Smaller target.

702
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,036
Am I fighting someone?

703
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:08,208
You're practicing for a fight.
You should practice right.

704
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,800
Did you see anything?

705
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,097
Go up there. Go and see
where he fell from.

706
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,687
Go up the battlement.

707
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,363
Move away!

708
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:41,950
Stand back.
