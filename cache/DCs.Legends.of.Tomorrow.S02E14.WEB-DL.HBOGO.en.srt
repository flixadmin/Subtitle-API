1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,600
<i>Seriously, you idiots haven't
figured this out by now?</i>

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,840
<i>It all started when we blew up
the time pigs,</i>

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,400
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,160
<i>Now, history is all screwed up.</i>

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,360
<i>But it's up to us
to unscrew it up.</i>

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>But half the time,
we screw things up even worse.</i>

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,960
<i>So don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,360
<i>We're something else.</i>

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,160
<i>We're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,520
You're my grandfather.
You are more than that.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,760
- You're a hero to me.
- My quarters. Tonight.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,320
I'll give you something else
to think about.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,800
- You can't date Amaya.
- She has a destiny.

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,080
And so do her descendants.

16
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,400
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,120
The Spear can alter reality itself.

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,960
- Who's coming for you?
- It's not a who, it's a what.

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,280
- And it's trying to kill me.
- He has to keep moving

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,200
in order for his own non-existence
not to catch up to him.

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Captain Hunter
is the only one who can tell us

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,400
where Commander Steel
and the final piece of the Spear is.

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,840
- Where am I?
- You're home.

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,080
So, I've been told you were bumped up
to the prime crew for "Apollo 13".

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,280
Yeah, man.

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,040
We'll see about that.

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
Welcome to Manhattan, 1965.

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,920
{\an5}I have been dropped off
behind enemy lines

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,640
and cities all over the world.

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,880
Never been dropped off
in the future.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,680
Now you have to disappear,
start a whole new life.

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,080
The Spear of Destiny
must be protected at all costs.

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,640
Roger that, sir.

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,000
I know this mission won't be easy,
Commander Heywood.

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,840
For me or for Bettie?

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,440
She'll think I died in Leipzig.

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Little Hank is barely a month old.

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
Your family's sacrifice
might just save the world.

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,400
Give those to my wife and son.

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
Godspeed, Henry.

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,840
- I don't see him.
- That is odd.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,280
{\an5}I dropped him off right here
a moment ago.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,360
Where could he have gone?

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Henry!

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,880
Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Where is he?

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,520
{\an5}We used to call Henry
"the Chameleon."

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,880
{\an5}He speaks seven languages
like a local and he's a master

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,720
{\an5}in the art of camouflage
and concealment.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
If you told him to disappear,
that's exactly what he did.

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,800
{\an5}Don't worry, If it's hard for us
to find your grandfather,

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,120
it's hard for the Legion.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,200
1965 was a bust.

54
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,480
Oh, sorry, buddy.

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,680
{\an5}It's all right, Rip said
he dropped my Grandfather off

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,840
{\an5}in 1965 New York and told him
to assume a new identity.

57
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,400
Well, he'd need to find work.

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,560
Why?

59
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,240
Henry was a military man.

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
He wouldn't have become
an accountant.

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
He would have wanted a job
that still offered adventure,

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,520
and yet was still
somehow patriotic.

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
FBI? CIA?

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,840
He was a fighter pilot before
he was recruited by the JSA.

65
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,760
In the '60s, the fledgling
National Aeronautics

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
and Space Administration
used to call upon

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
test pilots to apply
to be astronauts.

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
Exactly, what could be
more patriotic, more adventurous

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,760
than exploring space?

70
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,720
Nice, Gideon,
pull up anything you can.

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,280
Press clippings, newspaper articles,
re: NASA circa 1965.

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,600
<i>Certainly, Captain.</i>

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,120
Okay, okay, okay.

74
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,280
Come on, come on.

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,640
Wait, wait, stop, stop.

76
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Right there.

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,320
I'd recognize that Heywood
jawline anywhere.

78
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,680
April 13th, 1970.

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,720
"Mission Control works
to save 'Apollo 13.'"

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,560
Come on, could your grandfather
get any cooler?

81
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,120
I think I may have found a way
to track Commander Heywood.

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,040
Don't worry, Mr. Hunter.
We've already found him.

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,400
- You did?
- We're headed to Houston, 1970.

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,920
Elvis at the Astrodome.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
And then we're going
to rescue my grandfather.

86
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,680
Then Elvis.

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,360
We still need to figure out a way

88
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,520
of contacting Commander Heywood
without arousing suspicion.

89
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,920
To that end, I suggest that we...

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,160
It's simple.

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
We infiltrate NASA.

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,240
{\an5}Today, NASA Flight Controllers
are monitoring "Apollo 13",

93
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,400
{\an5}NASA'S seventh manned mission
to the Moon.

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,320
We need to figure out a way
to get into Mission Control.

95
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,080
{\an5}I don't think that's included
in the tour.

96
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,440
<i>Commander Heywood is not
at Mission Control.</i>

97
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,240
- How do you know that?
- Because I'm looking right at him.

98
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
That's the Flight Director of NASA.

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,640
They're probably debating
on how to talk to the press

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,560
about the oxygen tank explosion
on "Apollo 13".

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Henry.

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
Great to see you.

103
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,560
You son of a wench.

104
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
Sorry, folks.

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,200
He doesn't have
the right credentials.

106
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,960
{\an5}We take press access
very seriously around here.

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Surprise!

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
We're back.

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Why are you doing this, Henry?

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
{\an5}I was never supposed
to see him again.

111
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,560
So you punched him?

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
That's between him and me.

113
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,400
What brings you to 1970?

114
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
{\an5}Oh, well, I supposed Nate
should probably tell you.

115
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,760
Nathaniel's here too?

116
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
Sir?

117
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
They say they know you.

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,520
You could say that.

119
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,360
Henry.

120
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,480
Amaya.

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
As I live and breathe.

122
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,720
It's good to see you again, son.

123
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
Come here, man.

124
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,960
I thought I'd never see you again.

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,000
Look at you. You still got it.

126
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,200
Is that Rip?

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Get him out of there!

128
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,600
As soon as one of you explains
what in tarnation is going on.

129
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
We're here for your fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
See, there's a Legion of villains

131
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,000
who are hunting anyone
who is trying to protect it.

132
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,240
We have Stargirl's fragment.

133
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,520
But... Mid-Nite died trying
to protect his.

134
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,920
I appreciate your concern...

135
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,120
{\an5}but I hid my piece of the Spear
somewhere safe.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,760
Believe me,
there's no place on Earth

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
safe from these guys.

138
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,880
Exactly.

139
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,720
You old fox you.

140
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,080
You want to clue us in?

141
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,960
He hid the Spear in the flag

142
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
Neil Armstrong planted on the moon.

143
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,960
Well, that is pretty ingenious.

144
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,680
{\an5}The whole reason I worked
my way up through NASA

145
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,520
{\an5}was to make sure that my piece
of the Spear remains safe.

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,720
{\an5}Speaking of, I really should be
getting back to Mission Control.

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
Yeah, I guess
you gotta figure out how to save

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
the "Apollo 13" astronauts.

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,880
What are you talking about?

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
The mission is textbook.

151
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,120
Didn't an oxygen tank explode
and the moon landing get aborted?

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,560
{\an5}No, everything is going great
up there.

153
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,320
Unless...

154
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
Unless...

155
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,280
history's changed.

156
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,040
Houston, we are about to enter
the dark side of the moon.

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
Loss of signal in 30 seconds.

158
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
<i>Roger that, "Odyssey".</i>

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,600
<i>See you in 28 minutes.</i>

160
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
<i>Happy sailing.</i>

161
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,080
Over and out.

162
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,520
Time to sit back
and enjoy the view, fellas.

163
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,560
Sorry, fellas.

164
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
Change of plans.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,880
We have to intercept "Apollo 13"
before it lands on the Moon.

166
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,000
Where's Commander Heywood?

167
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,360
He and I need to have a little chat.

168
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,120
He's introducing the rest of the team
to the Flight Director.

169
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
Interesting. Why?

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,080
Because we need somebody
monitoring on the ground.

171
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,680
These are flight controllers?

172
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,600
Yes. They're with the...
British Space Program.

173
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,920
They're here to study our procedures.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,880
What's your area of expertise?

175
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,360
I'm a Booster Systems Engineer.

176
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,760
They call me "the Rocket Man".

177
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,240
And him?

178
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,080
He's a man of few words,

179
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
but makes up for it with...
personality.

180
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
All right. Fine.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,280
But if any of you Brits
get in the way of my controllers

182
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,960
or jeopardize the safe return
of our astronauts,

183
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,480
you'll answer to me.

184
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,680
Of course.

185
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,120
- All right. Good luck, fellas.
- You're not sticking around?

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,360
We might need you to run
a little more interference for us.

187
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,840
No can do.
I gave up my life for that Spear

188
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,080
and I'll be damned
if I let anyone steal it now.

189
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm going with my grandson to space.

190
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
Would you look at that?

191
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
Outer space.

192
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
Never gets old.

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,920
Martin, how much longer
before "Apollo 13"

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
<i>should reestablish radio contact?</i>

195
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
17 minutes.

196
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,880
All right, we got 17 minutes
to figure out what's going on

197
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
before the whole world is watching.

198
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,640
Yeah, you're not wrong there.

199
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,800
Gideon, pull up Apollo 13's
original flight pattern.

200
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,360
We need to find it first.

201
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,240
Henry. Perhaps now would be
a good time to have a chat?

202
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,040
Actually, Captain Hunter,
I don't feel much like talking.

203
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,640
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,080
You know, in 2017,
men share their feelings.

205
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm just saying.

206
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,440
My wife has spent the past 14 years
raising our son by herself.

207
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,720
And it is Captain Hunter's fault.

208
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,240
The man has a wife and son

209
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,440
and still he asked me
to abandon mine.

210
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,680
He doesn't have a family.

211
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,800
I mean, he did.

212
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,000
It's just...

213
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,640
they were killed.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,160
I... I didn't know.

215
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,040
You know, I often wonder
what Hank would have been like

216
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,320
if you hadn't left.

217
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,640
Yeah, I call my dad Hank.

218
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
We don't have the best relationship.

219
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
But I don't need to tell you
all that.

220
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

221
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,600
This is all my fault.

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,960
But once this is over,
I'm getting Captain Hunter

223
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,360
to take me back to 1956...

224
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,920
to the day
I abandoned Bettie and Hank.

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,240
Wait, I was...
I was just talking hypothetically.

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
Why?

227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,880
I mean, this is a timeship, isn't it?

228
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,360
It'll be like I never left my wife
and son.

229
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,400
Think of all the heartbreak
I could save them.

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,640
Huh, I never thought of it that way.

231
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But we found "Apollo 13".

232
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Oh, this isn't right.

233
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,400
The spacecraft shouldn't be
in this position.

234
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,400
Can the astronauts see us?

235
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,800
No, no, no. We're cloaked.

236
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,520
- What's our plan?
- Well, I thought that we...

237
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
All right. I've got Ray suiting up.

238
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
He's gonna fly over there,
shrink down

239
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,360
and let us know what's
going on inside.

240
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,880
<i>I'm entering the Command Module.</i>

241
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,560
I see Lovell and Haise,
but they're unconscious.

242
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,960
<i>What about Jack?</i>

243
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,120
<i>Dr. Palmer?</i>

244
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,200
Thawne's here.

245
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm gonna follow him
into the Lunar Module.

246
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,560
He's going to land on the moon.

247
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
<i>Well, I'll stop him.</i>

248
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,800
Who's Thawne? Where is Swigert?

249
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,480
Ray, whatever you do,
just don't let Thawne see you.

250
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,320
Yeah, about that...

251
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,840
Well, what do we have here?

252
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,040
Looks like a stowaway.

253
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
<i>What's happening?</i>

254
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,280
NASA expects radio contact
in three minutes!

255
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,520
We ran into a problem.

256
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
If we come back online,
you're gonna have to cut the feed.

257
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,040
Yeah, I'm on it.

258
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,080
He doesn't have superspeed
without gravity.

259
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Newsflash, Raymond.

260
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,760
I don't need superspeed
to kick your ass.

261
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
What's the red button?

262
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
It separates the LEM
from the Command Module.

263
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,440
That's not good.

264
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,800
Dr. Palmer, you're gonna have
to fly the LEM.

265
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,400
Houston, we have a problem.

266
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

267
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,480
Jefferson, the entire world

268
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,240
is about to listen to Raymond
crash on the moon.

269
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,440
Wait.

270
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,800
Haircut's on the moon.

271
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
Guys, I'm gonna need more time.

272
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,560
<i>I need you to create a distraction.</i>

273
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,880
Day-o!

274
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,880
<i>Day-ay-ay-o!</i>

275
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,000
<i>Daylight come
and me wan' go home</i>

276
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,040
<i>Day, me say day, me say day</i>

277
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,760
<i>Me say day, me say day,
me say</i>

278
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,080
<i>Day-ay-ay-o</i>

279
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
Everybody.

280
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,880
<i>Daylight come
and me wan' go home</i>

281
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,560
<i>Work all night for a drink a'rum</i>

282
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,200
<i>Daylight come
and me wan' go home</i>

283
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,960
<i>Stack the banana
till the morning come</i>

284
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,400
<i>Daylight come
and me wan' go home</i>

285
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,080
<i>Come, Mr. Tally Mon,
tally me banana</i>

286
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,720
<i>Daylight come...</i>

287
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,880
<i>Lift six foot, seven foot,
eight foot, bunch!</i>

288
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,160
What the hell are you two playing at?

289
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,720
Okay. I got it. I cut the feed.

290
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,080
Oh, it's a...

291
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,120
It's a British tradition, sir.

292
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,720
Flight, I had radio contact
for a second

293
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,040
then I lost it again.

294
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,400
- Nice voice, Professor.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,840
- Guidance?
- It was the darnedest thing.

296
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
The LEM appeared for a second.

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,880
But it looked like it was about
to crash on the lunar surface.

298
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,720
Where the hell
is the Command Module?

299
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,320
It's spinning off course.

300
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Ray.

301
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Are you all right?

302
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm alive at least.

303
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,760
I was able to salvage the descent.

304
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,280
<i>But it burned up too much fuel.</i>

305
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,880
There is no way the LEM
will launch into space.

306
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
What about your suit?

307
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,960
<i>My thrusters were damaged
in the fight.</i>

308
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
You guys are gonna have
to pick me up.

309
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,760
NASA must be going berserk
right now.

310
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,400
Fred and Jim...

311
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,960
Don't worry, we're gonna get
"Apollo 13" home in one piece.

312
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,160
Gideon, plot a course
for the Command Module.

313
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,400
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

314
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,760
- Ray, we'll pick you up later.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

315
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
We landed near
the Sea of Tranquility.

316
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,760
So, I'm gonna head out

317
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,200
and retrieve Commander Heywood's
piece of the Spear.

318
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,880
Which is, needless to say,
very exciting.

319
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Good luck, big guy.

320
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,600
What about Mr. Thawne?

321
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,520
He's a little tied up at the moment.

322
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,440
Puns, the lowest form of humor.

323
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,280
Can I talk to you?

324
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,400
About what?

325
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,960
I overheard you and Henry
talking about returning him to 1956.

326
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,120
Okay, look, I know
what you're gonna say...

327
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,800
That you're a historian
as well as a Legend.

328
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,760
You know the consequences
of returning Henry to the timeline.

329
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,240
Yeah, my dad grows up with a father.

330
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
Look, my childhood was miserable.

331
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,800
My dad was a cold,
disconnected jackass.

332
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,560
But maybe, just maybe

333
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,040
returning Henry to that time
could change everything.

334
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,200
This is my chance to fix three
generations of Heywood men.

335
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,200
You don't need fixing.

336
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,080
Your childhood made you
into the man that you are...

337
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,800
the person that you are today.

338
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
And without that man,

339
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,000
then, well, this ship would
probably still be stuck

340
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,960
at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

341
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,200
That's conjecture.

342
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,760
My grandfather's happiness,
my father's happiness, that's real.

343
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,160
<i>Excuse the interruption.</i>

344
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>But you might want to brace
for impact.</i>

345
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
Good news,
we found the Command Module.

346
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,040
Bad news, it's heading straight
for a bunch of space rocks.

347
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,280
- The meteoroid belt.
- Don't we have a tractor beam?

348
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,560
Can we pull the Command Module
away from the meteorites?

349
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
No, no, the velocity
of the Command Module

350
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,800
would merely bring us closer
to the meteorites.

351
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
Which is why I'm swinging
the ship around.

352
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,880
I'm gonna try and stop the trajectory
of the Command Module.

353
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,760
Sara, you need to abort.

354
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,000
We're going to hit the meteoroids.

355
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,600
Better us
than the Command Module.

356
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,240
Can't you at least to try
to destroy the meteoroids

357
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,560
rather than using my ship
as a human shield?

358
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,520
It worked before back in 1942.

359
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
You put the Waverider
in front of a nuke

360
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,640
and it absorbed the blast.

361
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
At least I had the decency
to time-scatter you all first.

362
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
Decency? Did you ask any of us
if we wanted to be time-scattered?

363
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,960
- Sara.
- I was trying to save your lives!

364
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
You put me in a time period

365
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,800
where they wanted to hang me
for being a witch!

366
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,920
Sara!

367
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,920
<i>Shield integrity at 63 percent.</i>

368
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
<i>34 percent.</i>

369
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
<i>Rerouting the reserve power
to the shields.</i>

370
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,160
<i>I'm afraid the Jumpship
has been critically impaired.</i>

371
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

372
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,280
<i>Our landing gear has...</i>

373
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,480
We're clear.

374
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,520
Waverider crew...

375
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
we are now the proud owners
of the last fragment

376
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,160
of the Spear of Destiny.

377
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
<i>Copy.</i>

378
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Copy.

379
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,880
That's all I get is a "copy"?

380
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,080
Guys, I'm standing
on the freaking moon!

381
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,840
Yeah, about that.

382
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,640
The... the Waverider has sustained
major damage, Dr. Palmer.

383
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,320
Same for the Jumpship.

384
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,800
Wait, the Jumpship...
That means...

385
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,720
Unless you can figure out
a way to launch the LEM...

386
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,760
You're stranded on the moon.

387
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,320
And now I know
how Matt Damon felt.

388
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,720
<i>I'm Dr. Raymond Palmer.
Time traveler...</i>

389
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,640
<i>superhero, and most recently,
astronaut.</i>

390
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,000
<i>It's April 13th, 1970, at 2200 hours,
and I am stranded on the moon.</i>

391
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,200
<i>Fuel on the LEM is close to zero.</i>

392
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,760
<i>The food and water provisions</i>

393
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,920
<i>were designed to last days,
not months.</i>

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,520
<i>So, yeah.</i>

395
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,280
<i>I'm gonna have to science
the crap out of this.</i>

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
<i>What are you doing?</i>

397
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,720
<i>I'm filming us for posterity.
In case we don't...</i>

398
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,280
<i>make it back.</i>

399
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,840
<i>I'm not dying on the moon.</i>

400
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,280
<i>Sign... signing off.</i>

401
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
Certainly not doing it
in a tin can with the likes of you.

402
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
And to that end,
I propose an alliance.

403
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,240
You untie me
and we'll figure out a way

404
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
to get ourselves off this rock.

405
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,440
And I'll play nice until
we get back to Earth.

406
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,040
I promise.

407
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,160
Yeah.

408
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,160
Not a chance.

409
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,320
And for your information,
I already have a plan.

410
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,600
All I have to do is transfer
the fuel source from my exo-suit

411
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,000
and power the fuel cells.

412
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,600
Use the dwarf star
to power the LEM.

413
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,920
Yeah, that should work.

414
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,160
Of course, you've taken the gas
spectrometer into account.

415
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, unless you adjust
for the relative volatility

416
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,240
of the dwarf star, then the LEM
could explode mid-launch.

417
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,120
I'm a scientist from the future

418
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,800
and I'm here to tell you,
this is two-person patch job.

419
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,560
Look at it this way:
If I'm lying, we're both dead.

420
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,160
We'll be over Ray's launch
position in 18 minutes.

421
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,920
We only get one chance
at this intercept

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,680
before the moon's gravity
slingshots us back to Earth.

423
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Henry.

424
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,640
You need to understand
how time travel works.

425
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,520
My grandfather understands it
just fine.

426
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,480
You can't return to 1956.

427
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,400
- Amaya.
- Why?

428
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,280
Every time we change history,

429
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,320
we create what we call an Aberration.

430
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
Now, if your son grows up
with you around,

431
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,320
he could become
an entirely different person...

432
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
choose a different life.

433
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,320
That, in turn, could change Nathaniel
and the person he becomes.

434
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,880
If he's even born at all.

435
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,160
She doesn't know that.

436
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,240
But it's a possibility?

437
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Yes.

438
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,280
Why didn't you tell me?

439
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,160
Because my dad needs you.

440
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,960
And as much as I want
to protect history,

441
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,760
I want to protect our family more.

442
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,320
We both should have learned
by now, the mission comes first.

443
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,840
Thank you for telling me.

444
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
I was just trying to protect you.

445
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,320
Nathaniel, changing
your family's history

446
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,640
would have changed you.

447
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,360
And in case I haven't made it clear,

448
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,800
I like who you are.

449
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,480
You and I don't have
a future together.

450
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,600
What do you mean?

451
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,200
When you stowed aboard
the Waverider,

452
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,680
we pulled you from the timeline.

453
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
Back in 1942,
you have a destiny waiting for you.

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,280
- How do you know all this?
- Ray told me.

455
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
He knows your granddaughter.

456
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
I don't think
I should be hearing this.

457
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,520
Ask Ray what happens to your village.

458
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,640
Ask him what happens to your daughter
and your granddaughter.

459
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,800
Then tell me...

460
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,320
tell me you'll choose history
over your own family.

461
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,680
That offer to clear the air
still good?

462
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,160
So long as it doesn't involve
punching me in the jaw again.

463
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,480
I'm sorry about that.

464
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,880
After five years, I found myself
blaming you for the choice I made.

465
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
Turns out that abandoning
my wife and son,

466
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,680
even to save the world, was...

467
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,880
a mistake.

468
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,240
Oh, it's the great irony
of time travel.

469
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,520
That, despite it, we still find
ourselves living with regret.

470
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,000
One of mine is that I couldn't find
a better way to protect the Spear.

471
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
One that would've...

472
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,680
spared you such a personal sacrifice.

473
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,600
When you showed up,
I thought maybe I could go back...

474
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
change history.

475
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,600
But what's done is done.

476
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,480
All we can do now is look forward.

477
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,840
Oh, I gotta say, you really
turned this team around.

478
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,000
When I met the Legends in 1942,
they were constantly bickering.

479
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,440
Unable to work together
in any cohesive way.

480
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,800
Actually, I'm not the one
who deserves your praise.

481
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,440
Menial labor without superspeed
is really quite tedious.

482
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,160
Then again, I've missed working
with a fellow scientist.

483
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,720
Cisco and Caitlin and I,
as you know,

484
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,640
worked together
for some time and...

485
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,720
I miss the camaraderie.

486
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,080
Legion of Doom doesn't have
Karaoke Fridays?

487
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,360
I know it's easier for you
to think of me as a monster.

488
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,800
But I've met some
of history's monsters, Raymond.

489
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,920
And believe me...

490
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm not one of them.

491
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,800
You killed Barry's mother.

492
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,960
Twice.

493
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,040
Rex Tyler.

494
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,720
Brainwashed Rip
into killing Dr. Mid-Nite.

495
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,440
Time travel has a way
of revealing the truth to you.

496
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
And you and I have more
in common than you think.

497
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,120
Pass me the pliers.

498
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,960
We're both scientists.

499
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,720
We're both obsessed
with achieving the impossible.

500
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,120
You dedicated your life to learning

501
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
how to shrink yourself down
to the size of an atom

502
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,360
and I spent mine learning
the secrets of the Speed Force.

503
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,040
I became the Atom to help people.

504
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,120
You could use the dwarf star

505
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,640
in your exo-suit
to power an entire city.

506
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,160
But instead,
you chose to become the Atom

507
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,760
because you weren't satisfied
with your small, pathetic life.

508
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,080
There is no shame in wanting
to be great or to reach higher.

509
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,200
To...

510
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,080
walk on the moon.

511
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,360
Is that why you want the Spear?

512
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,200
Reach higher, become greater,
run faster?

513
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
No.

514
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,760
I'm after something much more...

515
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
elemental.

516
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,000
I want to live.

517
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,120
Surely, you can sympathize.

518
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,960
<i>One minute to the intercept,
Raymond.</i>

519
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,080
Are you ready up there?

520
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,480
Yeah, we're ready.

521
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
"We"?

522
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,360
Long story. Let's do this.

523
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,640
Rip, how's our trajectory looking?

524
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
Keep her steady.

525
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,880
Martin, are you sure
about these calculations?

526
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,440
<i>I'm piloting manually here.</i>

527
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,840
- Did I or did I not win six Carlins?
- No.

528
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,640
Yes, I did.

529
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,240
<i>20 seconds to intercept.</i>

530
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,240
Jax, be prepared to restore
the feed on my signal.

531
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,360
Ten seconds.

532
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,000
You're just gonna have to trust me.

533
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,680
<i>In three, two, one...</i>

534
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,520
Distance to target, 100m.

535
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,880
And closing fast.

536
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,840
Intercept successful.

537
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,400
You, ma'am, are a steely-eyed
missile man!

538
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,240
I take that as a compliment.

539
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,880
Ray, I'm gonna dock with the LEM.

540
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,840
Be prepared to get your ass
back on the ship.

541
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,000
<i>Copy.</i>

542
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,000
Head up, son.
We got work to do.

543
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm sorry, sir,
but they're just... gone.

544
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,840
<i>Tractor beam disengaged.</i>

545
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,240
"Apollo 13" is headed home.

546
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,280
Jax, restore the feed.

547
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,600
Let's get history back on track.

548
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,600
<i>"Odyssey", this is Houston.
Do you read us?</i>

549
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,600
<i>Come in, "Odyssey".
"Odyssey", this is Houston.</i>

550
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Houston, this is "Odyssey",
do you read me?

551
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,640
<i>I repeat, do you read me?</i>

552
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,400
We read you, "Odyssey".

553
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Loud and clear.

554
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,840
You don't seem happy, Professor.

555
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,360
The intercept might have been
a success, but...

556
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,080
the Waverider is on reserve power.

557
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,440
Not to mention the difficulty

558
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,920
of re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere.

559
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
What are you saying?

560
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,360
I'm saying that our crew

561
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,800
has an infinitesimal chance
of ever returning home.

562
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,040
By "infinitesimal", I mean...

563
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,600
A snowball's chance in hell?

564
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,800
That would look rosy in comparison.

565
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,360
Welcome aboard.

566
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,240
Relax.

567
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,960
I'm not gonna kill my ride home.

568
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,640
Yeah, we still don't trust you.

569
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,000
Rip Hunter. It's good to see you.

570
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,600
I guess these morons
figured out a way

571
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
to restore your original personality.

572
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,960
Enjoy the brig, Eobard.

573
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,360
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

574
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,840
Sara, you have to power down

575
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,640
every non-essential piece
of hardware on the ship.

576
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,280
Gideon is already shut down.

577
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,320
Waverider is using gravitational
inertia to float back to Earth.

578
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,520
What? I know science.

579
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,680
<i>It isn't enough.</i>

580
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,720
If you want to activate
the heat shields

581
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,360
and survive re-entry, you have
to conserve more power now.

582
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
Stein is right. We need to
shut down the water filtration

583
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,720
and the heating systems.

584
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,680
Right, because clean water and heat,
we don't need those to survive.

585
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
You got a better idea?

586
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,480
At the moment, no.

587
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,360
Well, bundle up,
'cause it's about to get chilly.

588
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,040
Actually,
if the shields don't work...

589
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,720
atmospheric re-entry will burn us
all to a crisp.

590
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Science.

591
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,000
- You lost, son?
- No, sir.

592
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,600
I won a contest
to see "Apollo 13" land.

593
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm Hank.

594
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,040
Hank Heywood.

595
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,200
This place is turning
into a damn circus.

596
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,120
<i>Stein, we're ready for re-entry.</i>

597
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,400
What's the status
of your secondary thrusters?

598
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,680
It's sporadic.

599
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,000
She's still got
a couple pushes left in her.

600
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,560
Just need to point her
in the right direction.

601
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,080
There's been a rather
interesting development

602
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,480
down here on the ground.

603
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,280
<i>Nate, are you there?</i>

604
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,560
Yeah, Mick, what's up?

605
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,400
There's some kid in Mission Control
calling himself Hank Heywood.

606
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,400
That's your son.

607
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,360
I fixed an essay writing
contest so Hank would win.

608
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,240
I should've told you earlier.

609
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,520
I had to meet him.

610
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,520
Well, our guidance system
failed to power back up.

611
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,040
Can we enter the atmosphere
without it?

612
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,040
We need to figure out
a re-entry angle.

613
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,720
If it's too steep,
the ship will burn up.

614
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,840
If it's too shallow, we'll bounce off
the atmosphere

615
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,560
and go into orbit around the sun.

616
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,160
<i>Stein, little help here?</i>

617
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,760
I'm working as fast as I can.
But I need a supercomputer,

618
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,280
which is not readily
available in 1970.

619
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,680
We have a supercomputer.

620
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,840
Gideon is off-line.

621
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,360
I'm not talking about Gideon.

622
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,000
38 degrees.

623
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,960
You don't even know my question.

624
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,200
At what angle do we need to re-enter
the Earth's atmosphere?

625
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,240
38 degrees.

626
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm from the 22nd century.

627
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,680
I've learned astro-navigation
in grade school.

628
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,920
38 degrees.

629
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,440
Or don't you trust me?

630
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,920
The re-entry angle
needs to be 38 degrees.

631
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
How do you know?

632
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Thawne.

633
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
He wants to get back to Earth.

634
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Same as the rest of us.

635
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,160
So that he can kill us when we land.

636
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,280
I'm with Amaya, grudgingly.

637
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
I don't trust him.

638
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Agreed.

639
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,120
Professor Stein, does 38 degrees
sound right to you?

640
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,120
It could be,
but without more time I...

641
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
I can't be certain.

642
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,880
We haven't gotten any time.

643
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,520
Someone needs to make a decision.

644
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,960
Ms. Lance.

645
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,120
You're the Captain.

646
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,040
Do you trust Thawne about this,
after everything that he's done?

647
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,040
I do.

648
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,240
Then I trust Ray.

649
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,680
Let's go.

650
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,640
<i>Stein, we're a go for re-entry.</i>

651
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,880
If we don't adjust the angle,
we'll burn up.

652
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,480
The thrusters are toast.

653
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,800
In a few seconds,
we're all gonna be toast.

654
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,920
We need to blow the cargo bay door.

655
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,080
- What?
- He's right.

656
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,000
The depressurization
will correct your angle of descent.

657
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
The air pressure is too great.

658
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,760
If anyone opens up the door
at mid-descent...

659
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
they'll die.

660
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,880
- I'll go.
- No.

661
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,800
I'm Captain. I'll go.

662
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
Where is Henry?

663
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,720
I'm in the cargo bay.

664
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,200
<i>It's the only way to right the ship.</i>

665
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,080
Talk me through this.

666
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
You have to secure
the inner door first.

667
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Check.

668
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Right, there should be a lever
to your, to your left.

669
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,640
I see it.

670
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,320
Hey. Hey!

671
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,080
Hey, don't! Don't do this.

672
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,480
I am so sorry, Nathaniel.

673
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,200
No, no. You open that door,

674
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,160
the explosive decompression
will suck you out.

675
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,200
If I don't, you will all die.

676
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,440
I can do it. Let me do it.
I have powers now.

677
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,400
No, no.
I won't let you risk your life.

678
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,920
I have fulfilled my duty,

679
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,760
protecting my piece of the Spear.

680
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,000
But I'm just a grunt.

681
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,840
Now it's your turn.

682
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,800
You can figure out a way
to destroy the Spear.

683
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,800
Don't let it ruin
another person's life.

684
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,360
Your son is at Mission Control.
He's there, he's waiting for you.

685
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Come on.

686
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,880
Don't.

687
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,440
Give him a message for me.

688
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,120
Tell him...

689
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,240
I'm sorry for leaving.

690
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,280
Don't. Please don't. Please don't.

691
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,440
It's working.

692
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,000
30 degrees.

693
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,200
36.

694
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
38.

695
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,520
Commander Heywood's done it.

696
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
We're gonna make it.

697
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Yes, we are.

698
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,680
Nathaniel.

699
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,520
It's a funny thing about Rip Hunter's
anti-speedster weapons:

700
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,600
I invented them.

701
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,440
I knew you'd escape.

702
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,560
You're on the run.

703
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,880
Because you're a time remnant.

704
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,320
You should have died when
Eddie Thawne killed himself.

705
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,600
And now something's chasing you,

706
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,320
trying to correct the Aberration.

707
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,160
One of history's worst monsters.

708
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,080
Speak of the devil.

709
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,080
Well, I guess you won't have time

710
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,320
to search the ship
for the Spear now, will you?

711
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,480
Till we meet again, Raymond.

712
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,040
<i>Re-entry successful.</i>

713
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,000
It's pretty cool, huh?

714
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,120
Got to witness history.

715
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
You an astronaut?

716
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,040
No, no, I'm...

717
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,440
I wish I was that brave.

718
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,440
They made it home.

719
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
Not all of them.

720
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,040
They're my dad's.

721
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,160
Or they were.

722
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,280
He was gone before I knew him.

723
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm sure he was sorry he left.

724
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,920
My dad wasn't really there
for me either.

725
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,680
But I knew he loved me.

726
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
He just...

727
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,520
just couldn't show me.

728
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,120
- It's not fair.
- No.

729
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,960
No, it's not.

730
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,160
But if you can accept that...

731
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,080
you'll be a better man for it.

732
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,920
You and your son.

733
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,720
Drinking alone?

734
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,280
Only as metaphor.

735
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
You're in here feeling sorry
for yourself?

736
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,640
Oh, no. I've got more than one way
of feeling sorry for myself, surely.

737
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,360
Thanks for backing my play earlier.

738
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,360
I wasn't entirely supportive
on this mission.

739
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,520
Indeed.

740
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,080
Still...

741
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,400
must be hard coming back
to your ship

742
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,000
and finding someone else in charge.

743
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,880
No.
That was the easy part.

744
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,240
The harder adjustment
was seeing that you are

745
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,400
a much better captain
than I ever was.

746
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,440
So that's why you're in here
feeling sorry for yourself?

747
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,840
I'm in here trying
to figure out what my place is

748
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,680
if I'm not this team's captain.

749
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,960
So, you're saying you don't fit in.

750
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,200
You're an outcast.

751
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,000
A misfit.

752
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,040
Let's assume.

753
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Sounds to me like you're a Legend.

754
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,320
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

755
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,280
This was my fault.

756
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,480
If I hadn't told Henry
that he shouldn't return home...

757
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,440
He would've still thrown
himself off of the ship

758
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,600
to save us.

759
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,040
That's just who he was.

760
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,280
Maybe destiny
has plans for all of us.

761
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,200
Not just me.

762
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,760
Yeah, about that.

763
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,240
I am...

764
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,360
so sorry I said those things.

765
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,920
No one should know too much
about their future.

766
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,360
I'm not afraid of the future.

767
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,080
Whatever is supposed to happen...

768
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,160
it's bigger than just me.

769
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,600
I know this is cheesy...

770
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
but...

771
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,200
once you see Earth from outer space,
you realize how small we all are.

772
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,840
In a good way?

773
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Yeah.

774
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,720
In a good way.

775
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
Gideon.

776
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,280
I need you to help me
with something.

777
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,840
<i>Of course, Ms. Jiwe.</i>

778
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,840
I need you to show me
the historical record on Zambesi...

779
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,600
starting with my return home.

780
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,160
<i>You're asking for me
to show you your future.</i>

781
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
<i>I must counsel you against
doing this.</i>

782
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,560
Please, Gideon.

783
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,520
<i>Hey, Mr. Tally Mon,
tally me banana</i>

784
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,200
<i>Daylight come
and me wan' go home</i>

785
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,920
<i>Come, Mr. Tally Mon,
tally me banana</i>

786
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,160
<i>Daylight come
and me wan' go home</i>

787
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,800
{\an5}<i>Lift six foot, seven foot,
eight foot, bunch!</i>

788
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,360
<i>Nice voice, Professor.</i>
