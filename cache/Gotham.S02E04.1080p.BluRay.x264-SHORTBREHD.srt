1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:06,925
My forefathers were betrayed,
their legacy erased.

3
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:09,594
And I am here to punish those
who wronged us.

4
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,262
- We have a deal?
- We do.

5
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,196
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll train every day.

6
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:29,739
Yeah, but you said that before,
didn't you?

7
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,199
I'll even go back to school.

8
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,662
I saved your life.

9
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,747
You wanted to do it, too.
You just didn't have the guts.

10
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:39,666
Selina, I miss you.

11
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,630
This is not what we rehearsed.

12
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:47,632
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

13
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,593
Enter the hero.

14
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,862
<i>Gentlemen,
ladies, others,</i>

15
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:12,991
let us discuss the future
with a little civility, shall we?

16
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,503
So, not one of you knows who orchestrated

17
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,714
and/or executed the Arkham breakout?

18
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:30,675
I find that hard to believe.

19
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:34,846
I mean, the cop's only lead
is an old blind man, for God's sake.

20
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,223
A blind man!

21
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:40,018
Then, who here is to be trusted?

22
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,271
Because someone knows.

23
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,232
Uh... We thought it was you.

24
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:50,361
Why would I do that?
We've never had it better.

25
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:54,199
I gave you all the freedom in the world

26
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:57,702
and business boomed for all of us.

27
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,205
<i>A new generation.</i>

28
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:04,000
Then that ginger maniac
had to spoil everything.

29
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,585
<i>Even now he's dead,</i>

30
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:08,171
public is still terrified,
business is in the can,

31
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,756
and what are we doing?

32
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,549
Fighting among ourselves.

33
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,219
Is this how any of us wants to live?

34
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:18,139
Squabbling, brawling, running, hiding?

35
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,183
This city belongs to us now.

36
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,353
But kids, that brings responsibilities.

37
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:28,066
We need to restore
confidence in our brand, if you will.

38
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,735
We need discipline and unity, yes?

39
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,240
There will be no more chaos,

40
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,699
<i>no more gang wars,</i>

41
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,410
<i>no more blood in the streets
scaring decent folk.</i>

42
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,288
From now on, if you want to kill someone,

43
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,916
<i>blackmail, steal, or kidnap anyone,</i>

44
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,709
<i>I need to hear about it first.</i>

45
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,336
Understand?

46
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,754
- We got it.
- Fine.

47
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,600
Bravo.

48
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:05,311
Quite the King Solomon.
You had them nicely in line.

49
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:06,521
Who are you?

50
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,357
My brother would very much like
to talk to you.

51
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:10,859
Alone.

52
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,277
Why are you looking at me like that?

53
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,444
You don't know me.

54
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,612
Relax, Butch.

55
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,532
He has issues. Bipolar.

56
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,784
She don't know me. I'm just saying.

57
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,120
Your brother?

58
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,788
Theodore Galavan.

59
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,207
<i>There's a car waiting for you outside.</i>

60
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,338
I'm sick and tired of your
holier-than-thou crap, Gordon.

61
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,132
Yeah? Then do some police work.

62
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,467
The last arrest you made was your bookie.

63
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,011
- Which is why--
- Back off!

64
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:43,391
My name is Nathaniel Barnes.

65
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,144
Captain Nathaniel Barnes.

66
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,439
That's right, I'm your new boss.

67
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:51,733
Ten hut!

68
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,238
You, clean that up.

69
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,411
You know when this place was built?

70
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,706
Over 100 years ago.

71
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,003
Can you imagine how many perps have been
booked in here since that time?

72
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:17,467
All the murderers, rapists, thieves
that have been locked up?

73
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:22,555
They don't make them like this anymore.
Strong, sturdy.

74
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,684
And yet,

75
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,354
just days ago,

76
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:34,442
an escaped convict just strolls in here,
into our house.

77
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:35,944
Our house.

78
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,905
And murders your commissioner,

79
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,866
<i>and nine of your fellow comrades.</i>

80
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,869
I wasn't even here, and I'm ashamed.

81
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,747
Are you all ashamed?

82
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:49,707
<i>I hope so.</i>

83
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:53,628
Anyone that's here
that's not ashamed and angry

84
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,421
should resign.

85
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:56,798
Right now!

86
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,805
Huh.

87
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,685
Some of you are lying to yourselves.

88
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,395
I've got your files here.

89
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:15,108
I've read them all.
Step forward if you hear your name called.

90
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:19,487
Pollard. Guthrie. Coulson.

91
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:24,951
Dowler. Brooks. Perez. Hightower.

92
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,959
You aren't ashamed. You have no shame.

93
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:37,380
You're not police,
you're lowlife criminals.

94
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:43,094
Bribery, drug abuse,
extortion, racketeering.

95
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,638
Sons of bitches! You're all fired.

96
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,892
Drop off your badges

97
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,979
and your guns with the desk sergeant
on your way out.

98
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,566
Hey. You can't do this. We got rights.

99
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,279
Yes, you're right.
You do have rights.

100
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,114
You have the right to remain silent,

101
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,741
<i>you have the right to an attorney.</i>

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,951
Take him.

103
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,078
From now on,

104
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:14,000
any officer, detective, rookie or clerk
who breaks the law

105
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,295
will not just lose their job,
they will go to jail.

106
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,466
If you turned a blind eye to crime,
I will bust you.

107
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,468
If you fail to help a fellow officer

108
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,305
because of cowardice or apathy,
I will bust you.

109
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,685
What the hell are you still doing here?

110
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,480
Don't make me mad.

111
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,361
Anyone who didn't hear their name called,
get back to work.

112
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,740
I'd like to see you in my office, please.

113
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,335
Well? What do you think about
what I said out there?

114
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:03,508
I agree with every word, sir.

115
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,511
Every word, huh?

116
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,388
You a sycophant, Gordon?

117
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,849
No, sir.

118
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,351
"No, sir."

119
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,229
I've read all your files.

120
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,815
Army, Academy, G.C.P.D.

121
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,276
You're a troublemaker.

122
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,362
A fighter.

123
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,491
Is that an accurate assessment?

124
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:30,952
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,872
Good. You're my second-in-command.

126
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,375
Starting now, Jim,

127
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,085
we're gonna fix this department

128
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:41,879
and bring respect for law and order
back to this city.

129
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,214
Yes, sir.

130
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,428
We're, uh, kind of shorthanded.

131
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,181
What, do you think I cut too deep?

132
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,434
You could have thrown out 20 more guys
and not hit bottom.

133
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,562
<i>Fixing this department is gonna be tough.</i>

134
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,274
Maybe tougher than you think, sir.

135
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,028
Welcome to my unit, you sad-ass Army hump.

136
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,573
Tough is what we eat for breakfast.

137
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,242
Jarhead, huh?

138
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,494
Who would have guessed.

139
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,457
Sir.

140
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,755
I hope you just told him
he made a huge mistake.

141
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,048
I don't think he did.

142
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,092
Come on, Jim.
We've seen his type come and go.

143
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,761
Idealists, always looking
to walk the straight line.

144
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,388
Gotham doesn't have straight lines.

145
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,348
It's got twists and turns and dead ends.

146
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,934
Yeah. But it doesn't have to be that way.

147
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,443
<i>With Mayor James still missing
and the deputy mayor recently murdered,</i>

148
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,947
<i>the need for leadership at City Hall is of
paramount concern to Gotham's citizens.</i>

149
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:53,701
<i>Today, two more hopeful candidates
have thrown their hats into the ring.</i>

150
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,120
<i>Janice Caulfield is a city councilor</i>

151
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,665
<i>who began her political career
as an environmental activist.</i>

152
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:03,878
<i>Randall Hobbs, the longest-serving
teamster boss in Gotham's history,</i>

153
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,297
<i>is another candidate with a strong base.</i>

154
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:07,715
<i>In the latest polls, though,</i>

155
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:11,552
<i>a surprise surge for a man
who has not even declared his candidacy,</i>

156
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,845
<i>Theo Galavan.</i>

157
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:17,141
<i>The dashing billionaire businessman has
not ruled out a bid for the mayor's job.</i>

158
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:20,394
<i>But he is considering his options,
according to a spokesman.</i>

159
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,649
Mr. Cobblepot, finally, we meet.

160
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,525
Call me Penguin.

161
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,653
I thought I heard you hated that name.

162
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,571
It grew on me.

163
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,199
Penguin it is. Please, sit.

164
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,494
- How's your head?
- Oh, healing, thank you.

165
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,329
Gave me quite a scare.

166
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,373
You were lucky to get out of there
with your life.

167
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,792
Wasn't I just?

168
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,212
Was it luck?

169
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,464
You are a clever man.

170
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,677
Perfect timing, dear.
Do you two know each other?

171
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,845
We've met.

172
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,101
Oh, my.

173
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,145
The Arkham breakout,

174
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,358
the G.C.P.D. massacre,
Jerome and the Maniax.

175
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,236
All you.

176
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,905
<i>- Of course.</i>
- Guilty.

177
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,034
It was foolish of me to think
I could trick the King of Gotham.

178
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,536
Here.

179
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,371
You need this more than me.

180
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,373
I'll make another.

181
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:28,713
My sister tells me you're doing a
stellar job of organizing your new empire.

182
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,048
I try.

183
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,342
You're not the King of Gotham,

184
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,177
you're the King of Garbage.

185
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,055
A year ago, I held Fish Mooney's umbrella.

186
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,099
<i>Now she's dead by my hand.</i>

187
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,184
Along with Maroni.

188
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,188
Falcone is in hiding
and all of their businesses are mine.

189
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:51,193
They all underestimated me.
I suggest you not make the same mistake.

190
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,238
My sister is too blunt.

191
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,032
But she is honest.

192
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,745
The foundations of this great city
were laid 200 years ago

193
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,873
by some very dedicated people.

194
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,253
Now, it's an old, crumbling pigsty,
full of human waste.

195
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,881
<i>It's time to move into the future.</i>

196
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,259
A cleaner, brighter

197
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,679
future.

198
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,564
Uh...

199
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,650
Those are all residential areas.

200
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,863
So, thousands of homes would
have to be destroyed, wouldn't they?

201
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:37,573
Yeah, so?

202
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,577
<i>Here's the rub.</i>

203
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,871
In order to rebuild,
I need first to destroy.

204
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,289
But I can't do that.

205
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,166
I mean, watch the news, I'm a hero.

206
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,253
But you have a certain flair
for such a task.

207
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,464
You, Penguin.

208
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,301
You will be my destroyer.

209
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,889
Truly, I'm flattered.

210
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,141
<i>Thank you so much for thinking of me.</i>

211
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,437
<i>But, my dear sir, you have me all wrong.</i>

212
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:13,317
I have no flair for destruction.
I'm a builder, a problem solver.

213
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:18,239
Besides, such a huge project would need
the support of hundreds of city officials.

214
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:21,409
Yes. Only the highest authority
could see it through correctly.

215
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,787
Say, a mayor with a landslide mandate.

216
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,665
But you're not a candidate.

217
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:29,041
Oh, I will be.

218
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,752
By popular demand.

219
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,464
Alas, some of my fellow candidates
actually stand a chance of winning,

220
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,676
so, they'll have to go.

221
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,679
"Go"?

222
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,223
And I'm gonna need you
to take a crack at me, also.

223
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,100
And miss, of course.

224
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,394
<i>Don't want anyone to think
that I had anything</i>

225
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,896
to do with my fellow candidates' demise.

226
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,865
That's smart thinking.

227
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,576
However, with all due respect,
Mr. Galavan,

228
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,327
I'm not your man.

229
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,997
You need an assassin.

230
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,708
This is Gotham,
you can find them in the phone book.

231
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,084
Under "A."

232
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:18,007
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

233
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,386
I'm sorry. I took you for a man of vision.

234
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,848
Taba, do you wanna get the remote, dear?

235
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,850
Yay.

236
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:30,895
Before you leave,

237
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,857
my sister would love to show you
her favorite reality show.

238
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,901
She's addicted!

239
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,492
She's being kind of dull right now,

240
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,120
but sometimes,
she cries and bangs on the door.

241
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,080
<i>- Free me.</i>
<i>- Mother!</i>

242
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,209
<i>I swear.
I swear, I don't know about--</i>

243
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,586
You'll pay for this!

244
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,088
That's the spirit.

245
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,301
They die, your mother lives.

246
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,595
Simple.

247
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,682
<i>Please!</i>

248
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:15,606
<i>I swear. I don't know nothing.</i>

249
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,710
- Thompkins.
<i>- Good morning, Dr. Thompkins.</i>

250
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,171
Captain Barnes, G.C.P.D.

251
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,717
- Captain Barnes, hi.
<i>- I hear great things about you, Doc.</i>

252
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,469
Get ready to get real busy.

253
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:48,681
We're gonna be sending you
a whole lot of dead bad guys.

254
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,642
Oh, uh, okay, okay.

255
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,435
May I speak to Jim?

256
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,648
He wants to talk to you.

257
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,570
This is Gordon.

258
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,030
Meet me at the Police Academy at 0700.

259
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,699
The Academy, yes, sir.

260
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,868
If you don't mind me asking, sir--

261
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,954
Everybody knows you're banging the ME.

262
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,248
<i>I'll see you in an hour.</i>

263
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,686
<i>Oldest in your class.</i>

264
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,358
Not the strongest, or the fastest,

265
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,612
or even the most
academically-gifted, either.

266
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,946
And yet,

267
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,365
you finished at the top of your class.

268
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,034
Now how did you do that?

269
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,036
I'll tell you how.

270
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,414
You were a soldier.

271
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,207
You saw combat

272
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,002
while your classmates
were still playing with themselves

273
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,920
in their parents' basements.

274
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,505
You got blood on your face.

275
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,717
You could say that.

276
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,012
You're a warrior, Jim. So am I.

277
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,390
But you can't carry on
the way you've been.

278
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:18,687
Going after everyone on your own.
You need help that you can rely on.

279
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,356
With all due respect, sir--

280
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:24,193
What if there were a team of young cops
who haven't been bought yet?

281
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,903
<i>Not jaded, not corrupted,</i>

282
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,947
still filled with hope and faith
in the system.

283
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,243
Cadets?

284
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,454
This is the greatest academy
in the country.

285
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,581
Graduation is next week.

286
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:42,086
We could grab a group of their finest
before some precinct kills their spirit.

287
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,839
Wouldn't hurt to look into it, right?

288
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,934
I don't want anybody getting shot
under my supervision, okay?

289
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,395
- Gus!
- Captain Barnes.

290
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,896
This is Gordon.

291
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:04,608
Sure, I remember this guy.
He argued a lot.

292
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,152
I like to think I was raising questions.

293
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,279
- What do you got for us?
- This way.

294
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,953
Keep your eye on the little one.

295
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,374
The one getting her ass handed to her?

296
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,292
Wait.

297
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,181
Patience.

298
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:41,353
Not your strong virtue,
if I remember right, Gordon.

299
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:45,149
State wrestling champ,
Academy running back.

300
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,401
Why this place
and not a sports scholarship?

301
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,778
People from my neighborhood
don't get scholarships.

302
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,989
They join gangs, sell drugs.

303
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,533
I needed to change the direction
my life was going.

304
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,368
Mr. Martinez,

305
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,037
it says here you're the best shot
this school's ever seen.

306
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,414
<i>Where'd you learn to shoot?</i>

307
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,874
Gotham Gun Range.

308
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,501
One of my mother's three jobs
was cleaning it.

309
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,337
When she died, the owner let me go there
after hours and practice,

310
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,173
until I worked out my anger.

311
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,759
I still go there.

312
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,844
You're way too smart to be here, Garrett.

313
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,597
Don't tell me, your father's a cop?

314
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:17,973
Negative.

315
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,435
My father's family business
was destroyed by armed thugs

316
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,520
<i>who demanded he pay them protection money.</i>

317
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,190
When he refused,
they beat him half to death.

318
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,193
I'm here to make sure
that doesn't ever happen again.

319
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,114
Garrett!

320
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,742
<i>Pinkney!</i>

321
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,077
<i>Josie!</i>

322
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,872
<i>Martinez!</i>

323
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,170
Do you swear to honor that badge
with your life?

324
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,379
Yes, sir!

325
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,006
Congratulations.

326
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:56,011
You are now Unit Alpha
of the G.C.P.D. Strike Force,

327
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,639
under the command
of Detective James Gordon.

328
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:01,433
<i>You will answer only to him,
and him, only to me.</i>

329
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,810
Dismissed.

330
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,570
"Strike Force"?

331
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,739
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

332
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,074
They're good kids.

333
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,077
But facing what's out there
at their age...

334
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,830
It's a big risk, sir.

335
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,248
True.

336
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,791
But what have we got to lose?

337
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,085
Yes, sir.

338
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,258
For your acts of courage

339
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:37,261
in the face of overwhelming uncertainty,

340
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:41,223
the city of Gotham would like to
give you this token of appreciation.

341
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,184
The Medal of Valor and Bravery.

342
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,987
- Mr. Galavan...
- Uh...

343
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,780
Please, "Theo."

344
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:00,075
Theo, for Pete's sake,
why aren't you running for mayor?

345
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,621
Get down!

346
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,420
Everybody, stay where you are!

347
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,130
<i>Everyone okay?</i>

348
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,840
<i>Everyone?</i>

349
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,261
<i>You know what?</i>

350
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,891
<i>Gothamites don't buckle under pressure,
and neither will I.</i>

351
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,227
<i>We will not be intimidated by the scum</i>

352
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,981
<i>that seek to reduce this
great city of Gotham to ruins.</i>

353
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,067
<i>If the bad guys want to stop me running,</i>

354
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,987
<i>well, then, I guess I got no choice.</i>

355
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,116
<i>I will run for Mayor!</i>

356
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,659
Yes!

357
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,508
Hello? Caulfield for Mayor.

358
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,011
<i>Yes. Will do.</i>

359
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,138
Excuse me! You can't go in there!

360
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,189
Miss Caulfield,
what a pleasure.

361
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,650
Allow me to introduce myself.

362
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,987
I can see what you are.

363
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,031
How did you get in?

364
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:26,244
I know it's late,
but I'm afraid there's no time for delay.

365
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,664
Someone tried to kill
Theo Galavan this morning.

366
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,207
Are you here to kill me?

367
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,625
Actually, yes.

368
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,127
Please, no.

369
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,713
I'm a mother.

370
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,925
- Wait!
- I have a mother, too.

371
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,222
Steady now, folks.

372
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:48,600
<i>- No!</i>
- Just think of blue skies and cornfields.

373
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,018
<i>That's what I do.</i>

374
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,312
Why are you doing this?

375
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,732
Darling, I got no freaking idea.

376
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,236
We've been doing crazy stuff all day long.

377
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,497
Well, we're away, then.

378
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,207
Sorry to ruin your evening.

379
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,501
Now, remember...

380
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,463
Yeah, I got your names and addresses.

381
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,091
So, think about your families
and keep mum, eh?

382
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,036
That's Bruce Wayne, right?

383
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,252
Are you waiting for someone?

384
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,421
No.

385
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,302
That's your job.

386
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,224
That's for Reggie.

387
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,978
I know you killed him.

388
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,814
Now, I don't know what you want
with Master Bruce,

389
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,150
but I'm certain

390
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,361
that his life's gonna be
a damn sight better without you in it.

391
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,491
So, you do yourself a favor, treacle,

392
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,952
and jog on.

393
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,373
All good.

394
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,508
Oh, Master Bruce.

395
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:48,011
You know, I could always
pull out front, if you want.

396
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,471
No, I...

397
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,264
Alfred, I don't want
the other kids to see--

398
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:55,060
To see that you've got a butler.
Yeah, I completely understand that.

399
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,230
<i>I made dinner reservations,
as requested, for tomorrow night.</i>

400
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,900
Mr. Galavan suggested the Regal Hotel.

401
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:03,819
<i>Very posh.</i>

402
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,987
You're gonna be forking out
serious dosh for that, I'll tell you.

403
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:09,866
He saved my life.
Dinner's the least I can do to repay him.

404
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,332
Uh, Master Bruce.

405
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,834
Where are you going?

406
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,715
Now, I clocked Wayne Manor
at exactly six and a half miles.

407
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,384
It should take 90 minutes to two hours,

408
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,886
depending on how many times
you stop, of course.

409
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,013
I know you said you wanted to train.

410
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,640
<i>To prepare.</i>

411
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,268
Well, this is it.

412
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,272
Wait, you...

413
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,107
You expect me to walk?

414
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,778
No, Master Bruce. I expect you to run.

415
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,415
Miss Kringle,

416
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,210
ever since I first laid eyes on you,
I've felt this deep connection.

417
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,755
Perhaps you've felt it, too.

418
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,176
Not cheesy.

419
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,429
Miss Kringle,

420
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:15,765
you've perhaps
felt my affections from afar.

421
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,685
"Afar"? Really? Oh, God.

422
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,147
Miss Kringle...

423
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,109
Be quiet.

424
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,237
I don't need your opinion.

425
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:33,283
And what you need is to stop mumbling
and fumbling and tell her what's up!

426
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,535
Well, she's been bullied
and taken for granted for too long.

427
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:39,831
- And I want her to understand--
- You saved her life, for God's sake!

428
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,917
She owes you.

429
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,045
Take what you deserve.

430
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:02,187
Miss. Kringle. Dinner, tonight.

431
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:03,813
Um...

432
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,316
Chez Moi. 8:00.

433
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,863
Okay. I'd like that.

434
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,281
You will.

435
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,828
What?

436
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:24,501
A wise cop once said,
"If you catch a kid smashing a window,

437
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,045
"even a small one, bust him.

438
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,423
"If you let it slide,
he'll smash another one.

439
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:34,844
"Then he'll tag a wall, steal a bike,

440
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,597
"rob a store, maybe hold someone up.

441
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,934
"Crime unpunished is a crime in itself."

442
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,687
This city is bleeding to death

443
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,482
<i>from the amount of free passes
we hand out.</i>

444
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,526
<i>Time to put a tourniquet over that wound.</i>

445
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:54,322
From now on, no one gets a free pass.

446
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,575
What is this strike force for?

447
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:03,873
<i>To send a message that this epidemic
of lawlessness will no longer be treated,</i>

448
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,667
but extinguished.

449
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,044
With extreme prejudice.

450
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,383
Gentlemen, lady, your new uniforms.

451
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,890
Sir, got a caller,

452
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:24,102
says Councilor Caulfield has been
attacked. Says she's dead.

453
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,989
<i>You got an extra pair of gloves?</i>

454
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,076
No security cameras.

455
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:44,205
Galavan, and now her.
Looks like a damn pattern.

456
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,416
Only, she's dead.

457
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,753
Come on, people.

458
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,421
Who knows what?

459
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,925
Just give us a name, a description.
You will not have to testify.

460
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,388
They have our names and addresses.

461
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,393
All right, ma'am,
so could you show me your...

462
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,566
Miss Caulfield was stabbed repeatedly.

463
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,277
Probably drowned in her own blood.

464
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,407
Forget it, Jim.

465
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:26,331
The man with the knife
was short, fancy clothes,

466
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,708
walked funny.

467
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,265
Mr. Galavan, thank you for meeting me.

468
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,434
It's an honor, the pleasure's all mine.

469
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,479
- I'll meet you in the lobby, Master Bruce.
- Oh, why not dine with us?

470
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,607
That's very kind of you, sir,
but I don't think it's appropriate.

471
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,777
And I know that Master Bruce
wants to speak to you on his own.

472
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,696
Sir?

473
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,199
Thanks, Alfred.

474
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,161
Enjoy.

475
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,666
You like this place?

476
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,002
I've never been here before.

477
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,839
To be honest, I don't go out much.

478
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,632
Well, I hope I can change that.

479
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,510
There's always some tedious function
I could drag you to.

480
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,763
I just...
I wanted this opportunity to thank you

481
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,890
in person for saving my life.

482
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,600
Oh, you're very kind.

483
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,854
The truth is,
I don't know what came over me.

484
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,357
I don't think I was in complete control
of my faculties.

485
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,987
I also wanted to speak with you
face-to-face.

486
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,823
It's regarding your parents' passing.

487
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,162
I find it astonishing that the police have
failed to produce any evidence

488
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,414
or any real suspect in all this time.

489
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,292
It is disappointing.

490
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,295
Even your father's own company,
Wayne Enterprises,

491
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,881
<i>has failed to advance the investigation
in any way.</i>

492
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,382
It's shocking.

493
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,845
Yes, Mr. Galavan, it's very disappointing.

494
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,477
That's Silver.

495
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,562
I'm sorry?

496
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,397
Silver St. Cloud.

497
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,065
Her father was my stepbrother.

498
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:19,235
<i>He passed, sadly. She's my ward now.</i>

499
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,031
Would you like to meet her?

500
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,368
Yes.

501
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,293
Hello, my dear.

502
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,587
Uncle.

503
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,090
I'd like to introduce you to Bruce Wayne.

504
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,636
- Nice to meet you, Bruce.
- Hello.

505
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:49,557
I was early, so I came out here.
It's such a warm day.

506
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:54,270
Do you know, I do believe that you two
will be sharing a school soon.

507
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,481
Anders Prep, yes?

508
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:00,109
<i>Silver just got back to Gotham
after two years abroad.</i>

509
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,987
Switzerland, Geneva. Ugh.

510
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,157
Yes. We have a house there.

511
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,409
So, what's it like?

512
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,995
- Switzerland?
- No, Prep, silly.

513
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,248
I think it's fine.

514
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,791
I've been homeschooling
for quite a while now.

515
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,377
So, I'm virtually a new boy, too.

516
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,547
Then we shall brave it together.

517
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,504
I was kind of expecting a restaurant.

518
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,174
Miss Kringle, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.

519
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,510
Uh... I like to cook.

520
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,387
I'm a good cook. Is that okay?

521
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:14,267
It is, it is. Uh, and perhaps
you should call me Kristen.

522
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:16,561
Kristen.

523
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,197
Hobbs' campaign office
is the entire second floor.

524
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:30,783
You sure about this?

525
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,786
Don't worry, I've got it under control.

526
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,625
Okay, you gotta tell me
what the hell's going on.

527
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,711
I know I gotta do whatever you say,

528
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:45,006
but at least tell me
why the hell we're doing it.

529
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:49,469
- They have my mother, Butch.
- Who?

530
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:53,473
Galavan and his sister. They have her.

531
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:55,600
They're making me do this.

532
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,311
Holy smokes.

533
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:00,980
We gotta find your mom.

534
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,568
If they find out we're looking,
they'll hurt her.

535
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,322
Don't worry. We'll find her.

536
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,414
He's here. Let's go.

537
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,376
Got it. Thanks.

538
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,630
I still think we should move you
somewhere a little more secure.

539
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:26,798
Forget it.

540
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,758
Anyone has the guts to come after me,

541
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,219
they'll find out real soon
who they're messing with.

542
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,056
<i>All right,
sweep around. Whoa, oh, oh.</i>

543
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,944
Who the hell are you?

544
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,154
Oh.

545
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,740
I came here to volunteer.

546
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,326
Well, run back to whoever hired you.

547
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,912
<i>Tell them I'm not going anywhere.</i>

548
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,747
This city needs me.

549
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,874
Oh.

550
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,459
Cool pins.

551
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:09,257
Count, idiot.

552
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:10,883
There's five of us.

553
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,636
I know, hardly seems fair.

554
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,193
Move, move, move, move, move! Go!

555
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,250
Keep going.

556
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:48,004
There you go. Right there! Go!

557
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,923
<i>G.C.P.D.! Put down your weapons!</i>

558
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,484
Fan out! Flank him from both sides,
catch him in our cross fire.

559
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,194
Yeah, do that.

560
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,695
I'll cover you! Go!

561
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,410
Okay, so, they move well.

562
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,351
Unexpected.

563
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,731
Move, move, move.

564
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,366
Let's go.

565
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,412
The shooter got away, sir.

566
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,542
You just met Victor Zsasz.

567
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,919
Works for Penguin these days.

568
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,588
What the hell is Penguin playing at?

569
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:24,267
No, but I... I feel like, uh,
I owe you an apology.

570
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,727
I feel as though I have been
nothing but mean to you.

571
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,271
No, I don't think that's fair.

572
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,773
I feel like all I've ever done
is annoy you.

573
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,901
I've been consistently inappropriate.

574
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,570
No, no, no, no, no, it's me.

575
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:40,533
You have been nothing but sweet.
And I ignored your card, and your gifts.

576
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,451
Miss Kringle, I can honestly say

577
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,955
that our interactions are
always the highlight of my day.

578
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,457
Please, uh, "Kristen."

579
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,670
Oh, my God, I even accused you of
writing Dougherty's good-bye note.

580
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,840
Right. Crazy.

581
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,717
I mean, oh, who knows
what that jerk was thinking?

582
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:58,885
Jerk.

583
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:02,054
How I ever let him lay a hand on me,
I'll never know.

584
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,431
I'm glad he's dead.

585
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:10,438
Well, he's...

586
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,983
He just left town, he's not dead.

587
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,484
Right, yeah, I know.

588
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,446
Figure of speech.

589
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,281
He's dead to you.

590
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,533
Out of your life. Not "dead" dead.

591
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:28,164
Um...

592
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,167
I'm gonna use the restroom.

593
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,512
You blew it, dummy. Nice work.

594
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,847
Leave me alone!

595
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,599
Are you talking to me?

596
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,435
No.

597
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,355
Honestly, Kristen,
I wasn't talking to you.

598
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:53,731
Who else is there?

599
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,652
I talk to myself.

600
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,655
It's crazy, I know, just...
I have this, uh...

601
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,533
I have this voice inside my head,

602
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:07,495
a sort of stronger version of me,
that keeps this me in line,

603
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,913
because I'm such a klutz.

604
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,044
I can understand that.

605
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:20,049
I think that we all have
a voice like that.

606
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,052
You think?

607
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,929
What was your inner voice saying?

608
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,431
He was mad at me for spoiling the mood.

609
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:29,141
Mmm-hmm.

610
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,811
It was... It was a really nice mood.

611
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:38,150
But my inner voice is telling me that

612
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,237
I think maybe we can get back there.

613
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,583
You killed Caulfield.

614
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,585
<i>We have a witness.</i>

615
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,547
And the attempt on Galavan?
Was that you, too?

616
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:43,591
- Not now.
- And Hobbs?

617
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:47,386
- You sent Zsasz there?
- It's complicated! Okay?

618
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:49,889
What does it profit you
to mess with the election?

619
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:52,641
<i>You have your own
sordid empire to rule over.</i>

620
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:57,313
Walk away, Jim. Let me be.

621
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,524
The G.C.P.D. has new leadership.

622
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:03,152
<i>No more deals, no more favors.</i>

623
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,488
If they find out
you're behind these attacks,

624
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:09,033
- we will come after you--
- Rousing speech! Really.

625
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,202
Goose bumps.

626
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:15,081
But you came here alone, Jim.

627
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:19,335
<i>With no warrant, no cuffs,
no backup, and why?</i>

628
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,213
Because you would hate
for your new captain to find out

629
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:26,550
about how you gunned down
Ogden Barker in cold blood.

630
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,928
<i>Over a debt.</i>

631
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,014
A debt to me.

632
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,058
He was trying to kill me.

633
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,353
Where are your witnesses?

634
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,980
And just that day before,

635
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,858
I suppose you did not ask me

636
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:46,695
to run Commissioner Loeb out of town
so that you could get your old job back?

637
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:03,629
I'll face whatever's coming to me.

638
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,422
As will I.

639
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:07,424
<i>Good-bye, Jim.</i>

640
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:19,103
- Obviously.
- I don't think so.

641
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,021
- I'm serious.
- For a second--

642
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,399
Hey, you shouldn't be joking
about near misses.

643
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:26,152
Next bullet might get stuck
right in your eye.

644
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,112
Yes, sir.

645
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,738
No joking.

646
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,574
<i>All right. Gather around.</i>

647
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:39,081
Today, I'm giving the Strike Force
its first real mission.

648
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,419
Build a case to put away
Gotham's enemy number one.

649
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,007
Time to take down the Penguin.

650
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:04,773
Bruce!

651
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,579
Hey, Selina, come on, let's go!

652
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:22,458
<i>I don't know what you want
with Master Bruce,</i>

653
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,001
<i>but I'm certain</i>

654
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:27,463
<i>that his life's gonna be a damn sight
better without you in it.</i>

655
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:33,552
So, what do you think? Red? Or Blue?

656
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,387
- Red.
- Blue.

657
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,557
- Blue it is.
- I want some fun.

658
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:40,684
I'm sick of staying indoors.

659
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:45,189
Patience, Barbara. Your time will come.

660
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,734
The wheel is turning.

661
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,405
While the G.C.P.D. chase the Penguin,

662
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:58,452
<i>I'll steal the mayor's office
right from under their noses.</i>

663
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,498
Did you find her?

664
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:03,976
English - SDH
