2
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,390
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,520
Who's been naughty?

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,810
It is dead centre on your brand.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,520
- Let's get a picture.
- I love pictures.

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,980
Hey.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,990
Smile.

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,870
Another one.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,630
Oi, gorgeous.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,930
- Vodka soda, hold the soda.
- Thank you.

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,100
Drinks are free,
but the food's bloody awful.

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,890
Ahi tartare, for fuck's sakes.

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,390
Okay. Just let me shake a few more hands,
and then we'll be out of here... Whoa.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,440
Easy, tiger. I want you on your A game.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,230
A game?

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,820
You know, I like the sound of that.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,940
Merry Christmas.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,280
Becca.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,830
New senior director, digital marketing.

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,830
- Yeah. How did you know?
- I have my sources.

22
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,620
And your nametag.

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,580
Yes, that, too.

24
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,800
- This is my husband, Billy.
- Great to meet you.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,840
Billy Butcher.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,760
Becca, you handled my takeover, right?

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,180
Yes, I did.

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,930
- You saw it?
- I loved it.

29
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,260
- Wow, thank you.
- No, thank you.

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,890
- What'd you take over?
- Vought's Twitter account.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,320
Yeah.

32
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,560
Your brilliant wife
here did all the work.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,230
She posted my photos,
she wrote my messages.

34
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,360
It was exceptional.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,740
All right, so they thought it was
you up there, but it was really Becca.

36
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,240
Bit deceptive, isn't it?

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,570
No, Billy, that's what we do
because Homelander's busy saving lives.

38
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,080
It's okay, it's okay. It... You're right.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,290
It's a little dishonest,

40
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,960
but I'm all thumbs when it comes to that
kind of stuff, so leave it to the experts.

41
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,420
Listen, I would love to talk to you

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,090
about maybe quarterbacking
the rest of my social media.

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,130
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

44
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,800
My dad, he always said,

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,510
"Surround yourself with
people smarter than you."

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,310
My better half

47
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,850
is wanting my attention,
but maybe we could chat tomorrow.

48
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,810
- That sounds wonderful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,150
Great to meet you, pal.

50
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,360
Good to meet you.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,190
Love that accent.

52
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,320
- Hello, beautiful.
- Ready to go?

53
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,070
How the fuck does he walk around

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,200
in that sweaty fucking
wetsuit all day long,

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,580
balls mashed up against
his leg like pancakes?

56
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,120
- What?
- You promised to behave.

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,420
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah?

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,960
Yeah.

59
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,800
Hi.

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,090
I didn't realise you were
such a cigar aficionado.

61
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,510
I really, I just...

62
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,720
I can't get enough of huge gross logs

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,510
of filterless tobacco.

64
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,940
This is all really nice.

65
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,360
But...

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,620
There is a "but" coming.

67
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,910
Okay.

68
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,250
But why did you bring me to a hotel?

69
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,080
And not your place?

70
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,340
Well, you know. I mean, yeah, sure,

71
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,170
my Dad could make you
some post-coital pizza rolls.

72
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,760
I just figured this would be
slightly less humiliating.

73
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,350
Yeah, all right.

74
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,850
Yeah.

75
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,810
Yeah, very convincing.

76
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,940
You okay? What's going on?

77
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,940
It's just...

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,110
I've never seen your place, or your job.

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,740
You're kind of a mystery to me.

80
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,620
That's hot, right?

81
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,580
Look, you got to understand that my dad

82
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,630
was nothing but corny
jokes and expensive gifts,

83
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,090
until he was gone,
and all the money along with him.

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,010
I know that that's not you, but...

85
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,560
I need to know that
the hotel is a nice thing

86
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,100
and not a red-flag thing.

87
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,190
I quit my job.

88
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm sorry, I...

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,370
I really should've told you.

90
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,660
After Robin,
programming other people's remotes,

91
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,330
it felt kind of pointless.

92
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,880
And yeah, I mean, you can meet my dad,

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,010
but you're gonna regret asking that.

94
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,850
So everything's okay?

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,940
It's great.

96
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,320
No red flags.

97
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,180
Now, I know this is not
as swanky as New York City,

98
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,720
but to have a hero like you
in a place like Sandusky, I mean,

99
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,810
everyone down at the local branch
is just tickled pink.

100
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,610
- Yeah.
- Now, we got Cedar Point,

101
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,570
biggest roller-coaster park
in the whole U.S. of A.

102
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,900
We're just a couple short hours
from Cleveland or Toledo.

103
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,320
And Lake Erie? Right here,

104
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,370
- if you want to swim.
- Yeah.

105
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,790
There it is.

106
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,500
- What's this?
- That's your per diem.

107
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,420
You get $75 a day.

108
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,790
Grocery store, right down the street.

109
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,000
To make my own food?

110
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,550
There's a Dairy Queen, too.

111
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,720
Like Blizzards and stuff?

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,130
You betcha.

113
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,680
Well...

114
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,300
I mean, what about my crime itinerary?

115
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,720
I think the best thing's just to get out
there and put some points on the board.

116
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,520
Not much crime in Sandusky.

117
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,730
I mean, we're not a shithole like Akron.

118
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,530
But if something comes up, we'll call.

119
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
You'll call?

120
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,570
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

121
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,520
- This is killing me.
- Come on.

122
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,780
Damn.

123
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,240
No fucking way.

124
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,410
You need 3,000 calories an hour,
or you're gonna pass out.

125
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,700
I can't do this shit, man.

126
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,410
Tough shit.

127
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,920
You heard the doc.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,880
Your heart is getting bigger,
balls are getting smaller,

129
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,380
your bone density's for shit.

130
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,210
That Compound V shit is killing you.

131
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,220
Hey. Don't even say it out loud, all right?

132
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,550
- You don't know shit about it.
- I don't want to know.

133
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,430
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

134
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,600
Did you see my last time out there?

135
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,350
Sioux City's got a fucking
faster runner than me.

136
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,900
Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

137
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
Okay? None of that shit. We train.

138
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,070
Back to the basics.

139
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,820
Nobody gets it back at my age.

140
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,280
I'm gonna be a freak show like Ben Johnson
racing against horses.

141
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,540
At least you'll still be breathing.

142
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,120
Shit.

143
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,380
- I got to go.
- Where?

144
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,970
- What's going on?
- I missed you guys.

145
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,850
Just wanted to see your smiling faces.

146
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,560
Take a seat, buddy.

147
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,320
And, truth be known,
I felt like we were overdue

148
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,610
a little heart-to-heart.

149
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,660
A rap session, maybe a little tough love.

150
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,040
What's that supposed to mean?

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,040
It means that lately,

152
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,500
some of you have
been a little out of sorts.

153
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,300
Erratic.

154
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,010
Unreliable.

155
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,100
Downright sloppy.

156
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,810
Not you, Noir. You've been great.

157
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,930
But the rest of you...

158
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,940
It is fair to say that I am disappointed.

159
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,030
Got to keep your eye on the ball, guys.

160
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,320
The enemies are storming the gates.

161
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,620
I mean, we're not even the Seven anymore,
we're down to five.

162
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,450
We're dropping like fucking flies,

163
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,830
but at least now I know why.

164
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,210
Why...?

165
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,010
Is this a joke?
Why is Hughie up there?

166
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,760
I don't understand. Who is this guy?

167
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,100
This guy is Hugh Campbell.

168
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,430
He and Starlight are going steady.

169
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,690
He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

170
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,400
Wait, what?

171
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,900
As well as blackmailing
Mesmer, Ezekiel, Popclaw

172
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,700
- and God knows who else.
- Popclaw?

173
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,030
No. No, no, no.
You... That is insane.

174
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,950
Starlight, sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

175
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,120
- but words...
- No, sir.

176
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,290
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

177
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,880
It's just, he's not...

178
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,420
I mean, why would he do that?

179
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,130
Good question. A-Train, over to you.

180
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,140
- What?
- Boy.

181
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,220
That little egg of
yours is still scrambled?

182
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,890
How about now?

183
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,860
Shit.

184
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,320
I know this guy.

185
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,690
You did smash through his girlfriend,
so I should hope so.

186
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,030
Robin something or other.

187
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,830
I remember now, I've seen him
outside of Popclaw's place.

188
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,000
He was all in my face.

189
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,080
- You're fucking this guy?
- Okay, slow down.

190
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,630
I don't know what's going on,

191
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,880
but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

192
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,550
Well, that is true,
actually. That's very true.

193
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,050
He is just a man and, by the looks of it,
not much of one.

194
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,520
But... But hear me out.

195
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
What if he was helped?

196
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,850
Say someone,

197
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,480
I don't know,

198
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,570
got him in to see Ezekiel

199
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,110
and got rid of the Deep.

200
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,700
No. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

201
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,910
Keep those hands down by your sides, missy.

202
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,540
Sit down.

203
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,920
Now... I know

204
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,550
that you want to make this whole Deep thing

205
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,260
an "All the single ladies" moment.

206
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,350
Power, right?

207
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,190
But really, what you've done is pulled off
every criminal's wet dream.

208
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,900
I mean, the Seven is down by two.

209
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,690
I just can't help
noticing that it all started

210
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,610
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

211
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,740
which one of us is next?

212
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,030
You bitch.

213
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,200
- I didn't do anything.
- Enough!

214
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,750
We're a different fucking breed.

215
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,420
We shine with the golden light

216
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,250
of providence, but you,
you've been helping these

217
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,920
fucking mud people

218
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,920
- to go against us.
- No.

219
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,180
Shut your fucking mouth, young lady.

220
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,390
If you were in my position...

221
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,400
what would you do to you?

222
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,860
Homelander, that's enough.

223
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,150
You got something to add, Maeve?

224
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,030
She didn't know.

225
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,080
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

226
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,290
and her heart's
beating like a little rabbit.

227
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,290
The only thing she's guilty of
is being fucking stupid.

228
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,540
She obviously fell for
this Hugh Campbell guy

229
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,670
and he's pumping her for information,

230
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,210
so back off, leave her alone.

231
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,470
Starlight,

232
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,850
you must be something special.

233
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,150
I can't remember the last time
Maeve gave a shit...

234
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,770
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

235
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,610
really.

236
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,210
And if I say no?

237
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,290
Come on.

238
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,750
I got this.

239
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,630
It's you and me,

240
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,300
remember?

241
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,060
Don't say I never do anything for you.

242
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,440
All right.

243
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,190
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

244
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,740
I just hope you're right about her,
for both your sakes.

245
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,370
Class dismissed.

246
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,340
Look at this.

247
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,470
No. You don't stir,

248
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,010
you fold. Like this.

249
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,180
Now, that's what makes them spongy.

250
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,470
Here you go.

251
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,400
She wants to know where you were.

252
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,610
That's a compelling fucking question.

253
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,080
- Hey, can we talk?
- That's what we're doing, isn't it?

254
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,870
No, I mean...

255
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,120
There ain't no secrets
here, son. Spit it out.

256
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,500
Stop being an asshole,
just talk to the guy.

257
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,420
Hughie doesn't mind. Do you, Hughie?

258
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,760
Okay, fine. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

259
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,890
- Do what?
- This.

260
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,810
I mean, Vought, whatever with Kimiko,

261
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,640
it's awful, and you got to stop it,

262
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,360
- but I can't.
- Right.

263
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,570
You just want to kick
back, drink a few Mai

264
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,820
Tais, and let us do
all the work, is that it?

265
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,780
I managed to go my whole life
without seeing someone die horribly,

266
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,370
and now I'm up to about a half dozen,
so I think I'm good.

267
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,370
Please. You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

268
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,500
just like the rest of us.

269
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,620
Now, why don't you stop pissing around

270
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,330
and tell everybody what
this is really all about?

271
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,920
- Yeah?
- Fine.

272
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,590
- Annie. Okay?
- Fuck.

273
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,550
It's about Annie.

274
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,430
Fucking finally.

275
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,770
He's been sneaking off to give her one
at Lincoln Grand.

276
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,140
- You've been following me?
- Like you gave me a choice.

277
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,690
She doesn't know anything.
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

278
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,070
- We'll just...
- Just what?

279
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,150
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

280
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,360
- Maybe pump out a few flying babies?
- No. I... I don't know.

281
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,530
No, you don't know
because you ain't thinking,

282
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,080
- except with your dick.
- You're wrong about her.

283
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,540
That bitch is fucking playing you,

284
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,410
and you're too fucking blind to see it.

285
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
So better to be loyal to a dead woman
who doesn't know and doesn't care?

286
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,790
How's that working out for you?

287
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,730
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Hughie.

288
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,280
Long time no talk.

289
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,740
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

290
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,660
- Who's this?
- I thought you would recognise my voice.

291
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,870
You spend so much time obsessing
about me, am I right?

292
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,750
- Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
- Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

293
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,120
Why is he here? He says you're
in some kind of trouble.

294
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,290
Dad, are you okay?

295
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,500
Okay.

296
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,090
He's fine.
Remington Steele's almost on.

297
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,470
A-Train, listen to me.

298
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,930
Shit, if he's burned, then I'm fucked.

299
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,060
He's on fucking Medicaid.
He's harmless. Let him go.

300
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,770
- My place is burned. They've got me.
- My God.

301
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,020
Get your ass over here in 20 minutes,

302
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,310
or I'm gonna burst through him
like a fucking piñata,

303
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,650
do you understand me?
Just like I did your girlfriend.

304
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,980
- Yeah. Got it.
- And, Hughie,

305
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,950
alone. If I catch a whiff, a whiff of
one of your little asshole friends...

306
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,370
I got it.

307
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,620
All my bank accounts
are frozen and flagged.

308
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,500
Monique, listen, when you get this,

309
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,080
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

310
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,750
- Well, I hope she was fucking worth it.
- It's not Annie. She doesn't know.

311
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,130
- I'm gonna fucking do her in.
- The hell you will!

312
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,840
Hey, hold on. She doesn't know. It
wasn't her. She's never seen me before.

313
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,970
Not once, not ever.
So how did I get burned?

314
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,640
Mesmer. You fucking
idiots had to go to Mesmer.

315
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,560
Fuck me.

316
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,610
Thank you.

317
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,400
That was not smart, to sleep with her.

318
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,460
- Hughie.
- Dad.

319
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,290
He's acting strange.

320
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,300
You know, real jumpy.

321
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,380
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he...

322
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,130
Right here, sport.

323
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,970
Look what I got.

324
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,930
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

325
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,940
What, they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

326
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,440
Watch out, A-Train's coming.

327
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,900
You were a fan!

328
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,610
You were a fan, and
not, like, a dabbler, no,

329
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,820
you were Super Fan 99.

330
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,320
- Excuse me, sir. What is this about?
- Shut the fuck up.

331
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,740
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

332
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,950
I came alone.

333
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,870
You let him go.

334
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,920
Alone?

335
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,590
You really did come alone.

336
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,260
Next time... There's not gonna
be a next time, but next time,

337
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,180
have at least a few cards up your sleeve.

338
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,470
Okay. You mean... You mean, like this?

339
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,810
- Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
- What is that?

340
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,770
- I don't know what that shit is.
- You don't?

341
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,530
So you don't mind if I do this.

342
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,650
- No, fuck!
- What?

343
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,070
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I have a bigger dose.

344
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,240
I have a real dose hidden somewhere
outside. Let him go, I hand it over,

345
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,700
then you can do whatever you want with me.

346
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,410
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

347
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,170
as long as you take
it, you'll be the fastest?

348
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,430
If you try anything,

349
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,100
I can catch up to dear
old Daddy in a millisecond.

350
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,970
- Dad, time to go.
- Not without you.

351
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,020
- I'll be right behind you.
- I am not leaving you with him, all right.

352
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,850
- You're just a kid. You're my kid.
- Dad.

353
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,110
I'll be all right. I got this.

354
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,400
Go.

355
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,000
All right, where is it?

356
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,710
You know, this shit must be pretty good

357
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,800
if it's worth running through
a human being for.

358
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,050
My God, man, that was an accident.

359
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,130
- Where the fuck is the V?
- That accident had a name.

360
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,090
And what about Popclaw?

361
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,100
She had a name, too.

362
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,760
Charlotte!

363
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,770
The only good thing
in my life is gone now.

364
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,610
What is this, man?
I kill your girlfriend and you kill mine?

365
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,940
- I didn't kill your girlfriend.
- You used her.

366
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,900
You put her in danger,

367
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,740
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

368
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,490
How does this not all
start with you, Hughie?

369
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,870
The only difference between you and me
is that I made a mistake.

370
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,420
The shit that you did was on purpose.

371
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,000
So who's worse?

372
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,260
You bitch!

373
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,630
You know, you're right.
It would've been stupid to come alone.

374
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,980
Monique, it's not safe here anymore.
We got to go.

375
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,310
You swore to me and to Jesus Christ
that you were done with Billy Butcher.

376
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,110
I get it. Everything Butcher touches

377
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,280
- turns to flaming hot shit.
- I ain't blaming him.

378
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,900
Last I checked, you're a grown-ass man.

379
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,700
It's my fault, okay?

380
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,120
But we can't do this right now.

381
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,070
You put us in danger
without thinking twice.

382
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,580
Monique...

383
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,830
Daddy!

384
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,540
Hey, baby, come here. Give me a hug.

385
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
- What have you been up to?
- I was drawing you a picture.

386
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,710
You were? Can I see?

387
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,720
My goodness, this is beautiful.

388
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,550
Thank you, baby.

389
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,140
Janine, honey, Daddy's gonna
take us on a sleepover.

390
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,770
Can you help Mommy pack your toys?

391
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,680
- Good girl.
- Baby, we're running late.

392
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,060
We don't have time to pack toys.

393
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,020
We got to go.

394
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,480
I knew you'd vote your conscience, senator.

395
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,940
Thank you.

396
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,360
Goodbye.

397
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,700
Three votes to go.

398
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,080
And the B.A. guys

399
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,330
said that the Pentagon is shelling out

400
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,380
$35 billion on the low end.

401
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,920
- That puts us ahead of Lockheed.
- Amazing.

402
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,930
That's incredible. Edgar must be thrilled.

403
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,890
Fuck Edgar.

404
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,770
We did this, you and me. This is about us.

405
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,650
Hey, do you remember that marketing girl?

406
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,230
Ashley?

407
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,280
I'm sorry, I had to fire her, she...

408
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,820
No. No, no, no.
Seven, eight years ago.

409
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,910
Becca.

410
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,870
- Becca? Becca Butcher.
- Yes. That's it.

411
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah, her.

412
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,670
What about her?

413
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,290
Well, she's missing.

414
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,260
What do you mean, missing?

415
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,800
I mean missing, as in missing,
presumed dead.

416
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,350
Yeah. I looked at her file,
and the cops think it was suicide.

417
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,940
Yeah, it seems her husband...

418
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,900
Well, he got pretty riled up.

419
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,570
William Butcher.

420
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,030
Am I supposed to know his name?

421
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,070
No. Not specifically, but...

422
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,080
I was just wondering if you knew
what happened to her.

423
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,330
No, I just assumed that she quit.

424
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,540
Quit?

425
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,500
Is there any particular reason

426
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,130
why you are asking all of these questions?

427
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,220
No, no. I'm just... curious.

428
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,890
It's interesting, right? I mean, it's...

429
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,850
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely sad.

430
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,220
Yeah. Yes, very.

431
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,600
You know, I was thinking that maybe

432
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,860
I could get Maria to stay
late with the baby and...

433
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,860
maybe we could order in...

434
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,410
and catch up. Just me and you.

435
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,750
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

436
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,130
But you go be a mommy.

437
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,140
I'm telling you, you're gonna love it here.

438
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,230
You like roller coasters?

439
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,060
I'm more of a water park guy.

440
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,440
Well, Cedar Point's got both.

441
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,450
You first.

442
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,540
Well, most girls like the suit.

443
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,590
Well, I'm not most girls.

444
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,800
Is it true what they say?

445
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,220
Come on, baby.

446
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,430
I got you here in the flesh.

447
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,800
I gotta see it.

448
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,220
Please?

449
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,350
I don't... I don't look like everyone else.

450
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,360
That's what I'm counting on.

451
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,820
All right.

452
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,870
Look at those gills.

453
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,590
My God, that's so fucked up.

454
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,170
Hey, can... Can we just...

455
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,920
Be gentle, be gentle.

456
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,550
It's tender. God.

457
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,600
Okay. That hurts. Stop, stop, stop.

458
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,020
- Stop, stop. Stop..
- Come on, it's just my pinkie.

459
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,810
No, I said it hurt.

460
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,110
All right, look,
I think maybe you should go.

461
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm not going anywhere,
you little fucking freak.

462
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,370
Lay back.

463
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,370
I said, lay back.

464
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,500
God.

465
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,710
My God. God.

466
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,250
Yeah. You like that?

467
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,590
You little fucking freak.

468
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,130
You like getting
your fucking gills fingered?

469
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,800
God.

470
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,140
God.

471
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,580
Having a good growler, are we?

472
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,750
How did you...?

473
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,500
I stuck a little bug on you
back at that shithole of yours.

474
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,510
Because, you know, fuck you.

475
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,470
No...

476
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,970
What did you expect me to do?

477
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,970
It was Homelander.

478
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,890
You got to talk to me.

479
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,730
Wait, wait. No. I can help you.

480
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,190
Becca?

481
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Your wife.

482
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,280
She's missing?

483
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,540
I can help you find her.

484
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,730
Please, I have a daughter! No!

485
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,880
Don't want none, fuck off.

486
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,760
I'm here about your wife.

487
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,100
I believe this was a few days

488
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,020
after you met Homelander
at that Christmas party?

489
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,410
She was alone with him for three hours.

490
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,390
Not long after that, Rebecca went missing
and has remained so ever since.

491
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,270
One way or another, Mr Butcher,
I believe Homelander was involved.

492
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,940
Homelander?

493
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,770
But he's a fucking superhero.

494
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,780
You wouldn't believe
what they get up to.

495
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,580
Who the fuck are you?

496
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,910
My name is Mallory.

497
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,540
I'm the person who can get you payback.

498
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,890
Who's calling?

499
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,270
Nobody.

500
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,320
Listen, if you...

501
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,530
If you want to talk, I suppose we...

502
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,910
No.

503
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,420
But would it kill you
to make me one of those?

504
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
You know, I had someone once.

505
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,800
We were gonna get away, start a family.

506
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,890
So what happened?

507
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,440
Well...

508
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,900
Everyone always asks,

509
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,110
what's our special weakness?

510
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,990
Gamma rays?

511
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,950
Iron daggers?

512
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,080
Some ridiculous, stupid thing?

513
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,160
The truth is...

514
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,920
our weakness is the same as anyone's.

515
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,290
It's people.

516
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,340
The people we care about.

517
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,050
So I say, cut them loose.

518
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,560
For your good and for theirs.

519
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,310
That way you're really bullet-proof.

520
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,630
What's up, man?

521
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,880
How'd you end up here?

522
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,340
Tell me about it.

523
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,930
Me, too.

524
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,720
What's that?

525
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,690
Wait, you can't get
in your head about that.

526
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,190
It's really not that big of a deal.

527
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,150
I'm gonna get you out of here.

528
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,860
Just hang tight.

529
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,570
Excuse me, sir.

530
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,530
Hey. Can I take one of these
lobsters back with me?

531
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,790
- You got it.
- Thanks.

532
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,670
Wait, no, no, no. Not that one.

533
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,750
This one.

534
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,960
Yeah, that's my guy.

535
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Wait, wait, wait.

536
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,850
Larry, please.

537
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,860
I just need a secure place
for a few nights.

538
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,690
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

539
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,700
Hi, you've reached Annie.

540
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,870
- I can't come to the phone...
- Damn it.

541
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,500
That's Hughie, baby.

542
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,670
- She looks like you.
- Nah.

543
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,290
She's good-looking, man.

544
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,090
Right, baby?

545
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,020
Mr Campbell.

546
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,610
Yeah.

547
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,650
Pleasure to meet you. Billy Butcher.

548
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,820
Hugh Campbell.

549
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,700
- You got a hell of a lad there.
- Well, yeah.

550
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,570
He's all mine.

551
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,620
Hello, hello, hello.

552
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,330
What have we got here, then?

553
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,080
What's your name, sweetheart?

554
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,920
You can call me Uncle Billy.

555
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,170
He ain't your uncle, honey.

556
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,260
- He ain't nothing to you.
- Monique.

557
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,850
Good to see you.

558
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,190
Hi, you've reached Annie.
I can't come to the phone right now...

559
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,240
What's she doing?

560
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,030
Okay. It's okay.

561
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,990
It's okay.

562
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,460
Does the Oriental girl not talk?

563
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,370
Asian.

564
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,750
- Yeah.
- You're right. Asian.

565
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,790
And no, I don't think she does.

566
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,260
Dad, I'm really sorry.

567
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm sorry about everything.

568
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,720
No, no, no. Don't say sorry. No.

569
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,470
Look at you, standing up for yourself.

570
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,140
Jings.

571
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,820
Cold feet?

572
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,190
- What?
- You said Raynor got cold feet.

573
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,860
Yeah, that's what I said.

574
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,410
You know what I think it is?

575
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,240
I think Raynor's plenty interested,

576
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,830
only she didn't bring you
Homelander's head on a plate,

577
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,620
and you blew the whole fucking thing up.

578
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,080
How am I doing so far?

579
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,420
No, mate. Way off.

580
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,550
Bullshit, Butcher.

581
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,800
You're so hot for Homelander
right now, Butcher,

582
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,090
you're not gonna let
anything get in your way,

583
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,180
even if it's your own
fucking friends, man.

584
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,430
You promised me things would be different.
Matter of fact, you swore it.

585
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,350
But this is worse, man.

586
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,350
This is gonna be
Mallory's family all over

587
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,570
again, only this time
it's gonna be my family.

588
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,940
And if something
happens to them, Butcher...

589
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,160
I don't know what happened
with you and Raynor

590
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,120
or how that situation got fucked up,

591
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,330
but just please call her.

592
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,920
Please.

593
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,350
Yeah.

594
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,770
There you go.

595
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,150
Dr Vogelbaum.

596
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,240
Surprise.

597
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,320
Thought I'd drop in on you.

598
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,240
You look well.

599
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,290
How long's it been, John?

600
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,250
Long enough that no one
calls me John anymore.

601
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,840
So, what are these? Pets?

602
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,470
No, just breeding them.

603
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,590
German retrievers.

604
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,180
I try not to get too
attached to my subjects.

605
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,180
Well, that's true.

606
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,020
Seems retirement suits you.

607
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,530
Between this and 80-hour weeks at the lab,

608
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,570
I'll take the lab. No contest.

609
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,330
So, you ever...

610
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,620
catch up with any of the
old gang from Vought?

611
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,460
Look, do you mind if we don't do this?

612
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,080
- Do what?
- This cat and mouse bullshit.

613
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,000
You want to know about Rebecca Butcher.

614
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,090
You went to Stillwell about it because
you knew that'd tip over the first domino.

615
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,340
Well, it led to me.

616
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,010
So just ask.

617
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,680
I'll be honest.

618
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,190
Well, that would be a first.

619
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,860
Eight years ago...

620
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,660
Stillwell called me
with quite an interesting challenge.

621
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,780
Rebecca Butcher had come to her with...

622
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,660
a completely unprecedented
medical condition.

623
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,670
What condition?

624
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,050
She was pregnant.

625
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,380
With your child.

626
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,180
Pregnant?

627
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,730
But I thought I couldn't.

628
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,520
So did I.

629
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,440
Apparently, nature is tenacious.

630
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,860
The foetus was developing unnaturally fast.

631
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,570
We told her we'd deliver the baby safely
at a secure location,

632
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,620
but she had to sign an NDA.

633
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,370
Couldn't tell anyone.

634
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,910
Not even her husband.

635
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,830
You can imagine the size
of the potential scandal.

636
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,220
No! No! Pull it out... My...

637
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,310
The birth was difficult.

638
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,150
The baby clawed its way out of her.

639
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,860
The blood loss...
No one could have survived.

640
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,150
She died on the table.

641
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,030
And the baby?

642
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,580
Lived all of ten seconds.

643
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,830
Drowned in its mother's blood.

644
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,920
Was it a boy?

645
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,880
Does it matter?

646
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,010
Why didn't you tell me?

647
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,720
To protect you.

648
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,720
That's always job one at Vought, isn't it?

649
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,760
Protect our most profitable asset?

650
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,310
So why are you telling me now?

651
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,270
You don't understand.

652
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,860
The thing about cross-breeding dogs,

653
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,860
you get the right genes,

654
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,320
you can get a perfect creation.

655
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,820
But it doesn't matter how perfect they are.

656
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,490
It's not enough.

657
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,620
When I raise subjects
without their mothers,

658
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,870
they become violent.

659
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,750
Aggressive.

660
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,710
Downright hateful.

661
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,050
You should have been raised
in a home with a family who loved you.

662
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,970
Not in a cold lab with doctors.

663
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,260
And yet, I turned out great.

664
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,810
When I think what it's done to you,

665
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,150
and what you can now do to everyone else...

666
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,990
I'm sorry.

667
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,950
I don't want your fucking apology.

668
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,620
All this is my fault.

669
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,580
What do you want?

670
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,410
What?

671
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,500
What do you want? Forgiveness?

672
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,880
Now?

673
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,840
After you raised me like a fucking lab rat?

674
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,220
No.

675
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,930
Too little, too late.

676
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,230
I don't want anything from you, John.

677
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,990
I'm just an old man
thinking about his mistakes.

678
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,580
I'm the world's greatest superhero.

679
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,080
You're my greatest failure.

680
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Hi. You've reached Annie.
I can't come to the phone right now, but...

681
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,600
Butcher.

682
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,860
- Yeah, yeah, here's a gun.
- Fucking hell. Calm down.

683
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,000
All right, easy, lads. Easy.

684
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,370
M.M.

685
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,880
Deputy director.

686
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,210
Your family's gonna be okay,
you have my word.

687
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,300
Thank you.

688
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,840
You called?

689
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,470
You are a human after all.

690
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,890
Well, let's not get too carried away.

691
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,350
Thanks, man.

692
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,430
Come right this way, ma'am.

693
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,490
- Monique, I'm sorry.
- I never want to see you again, Marvin.

694
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,860
Come here, baby.

695
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,620
Daddy loves you, okay?

696
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,160
You're gonna be safe with Mommy.

697
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,410
All right? All right.

698
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,170
Take care of yourself.

699
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,680
All right. All right.

700
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,730
- No Homelander.
- No Homelander.

701
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,690
We had a deal.
Everyone else is fair game.

702
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,440
Do you want this or not?

703
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,180
Annie, are you okay?

704
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,560
I have to see you.

705
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,900
I...

706
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,150
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

707
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,400
You have to explain, Hughie.

708
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:51,280
You have to make this make sense.

709
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,660
Just you and me.

710
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,410
You owe me that much.

711
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,630
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm not following.

712
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,500
You and your corporation are fucked.

713
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:09,720
Unequivocally, unilaterally fucked.

714
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,590
How was that? Is that clearer for you?

715
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,810
For the last half century,

716
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,890
you have been feeding
the American people the line

717
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,230
that your superheroes are chosen by God.

718
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,280
I mean, I get it.

719
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,530
Jamming illegal drugs into babies' arms,

720
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,740
I mean, that doesn't
quite have the same ring,

721
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,000
and that's not even the worst.

722
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,080
What did you do to this one, and why?

723
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,170
I've never seen her in my entire life.

724
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,050
- What do you want?
- For starters,

725
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,930
there are no superheroes
in the U.S. Armed Forces.

726
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,340
The bill's already gone down to the floor.

727
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,100
They're gonna vote on it any day now.

728
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,140
And you're pulling it.

729
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,430
Retooling the concept
for internal development.

730
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,640
I don't give a shit, but the deal is dead.

731
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,980
And we're gonna go back to status quo,

732
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,610
where we're the
government and the military,

733
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,610
and you're just assholes
running around in your capes.

734
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,150
- And if we refuse?
- Everything goes public.

735
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,030
Corruption story of the century.

736
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,660
Vought shares go to zero.

737
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,830
The civil suits, criminal prosecution,
and you go bankrupt,

738
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:26,000
and your cute little suit goes to
a lovely shade of orange for 15 to 30.

739
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,630
Ms Raynor?

740
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,760
Thank you, Michaela.

741
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:37,970
We're done here.

742
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,680
Everything okay, I hope?

743
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,980
Someone tell me what the hell is going on.

744
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,690
About 12 minutes ago,
Navy SEALs took out Abu Ressam

745
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,360
about 15 miles outside of Damascus.

746
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,240
Right, as planned. So what's the problem?

747
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,570
Watch.

748
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,330
We got two.

749
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,540
- Eyes on.
- Stop.

750
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,880
That's our guy. Light him up.

751
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,420
Great.

752
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,710
The prick behind Flight 37 is dead.
What am I missing?

753
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
Just wait.

754
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,390
- Step inside.
- Watch this.

755
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:25,640
- We got movement!
- Hey! Hey! Get down!

756
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,190
- Hey!
- Get down!

757
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,150
- Get down, motherfucker!
- Don't fucking move!

758
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,520
I said get down!

759
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,190
What the fuck does that say?

760
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,150
"Naqib."

761
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,780
Hey!

762
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,620
Freeze, motherfucker!

763
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,450
Kill him!

764
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,630
That's not all.

765
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,940
How is that son of a bitch still alive?

766
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,240
"Naqib" means "captain."

767
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,490
We believe it's his...

768
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,370
Supe name.

769
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,960
Are you telling me...

770
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,880
they have a Supe terrorist?

771
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,150
Look, Annie, I...

772
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,070
Did you kill Translucent?

773
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,950
It's... It's not that simple.

774
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,790
And you haven't been using me
to get back at A-Train?

775
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,220
You're a murderer.

776
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,640
We didn't have a choice.

777
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,020
- There is always a choice.
- Wait.

778
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,560
What are you doing?

779
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,520
- I'm taking you in.
- No. Annie, hold on.

780
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,940
To the cops! At least
they'll treat you better

781
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,190
- than the Seven would.
- Just listen to me.

782
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,900
- I know this is so fucked.
- You were the only thing, Hughie.

783
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,380
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

784
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,490
I'm still me, Annie.

785
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,830
Please. You know me.

786
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,490
I don't know you.

787
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,540
- Never did.
- If you bring me in,

788
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,290
- I'm dead before sunrise.
- No.

789
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,420
Vought will want to string
you up for a long trial.

790
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,640
Lots of press. The guy
who killed Translucent.

791
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,050
This isn't about Translucent.

792
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,510
Okay? This is about Compound V.

793
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,220
Compound V?

794
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,100
It's this drug.

795
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,640
It...

796
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,810
It gives the Supes their powers.

797
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,110
Vought will do anything to cover it up.

798
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,450
No... No. What...?

799
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,360
What are you talking about?

800
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,830
We're born like this.

801
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,580
I'm so sorry.

802
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,750
Annie. Annie. Annie, watch out!

803
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,670
Fucking run, Hughie.

804
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:49,430
I'm so sorry.

805
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,180
Get the fuck away from her!

806
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,900
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

807
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,150
I didn't ask for your help.

808
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,280
Yeah. Looked like you
had it all under control.

809
