1
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,488
I said, how long
we gonna be sulkin' about

2
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:15,034
like some poncy
eyeline-wearin' emo twat?

3
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,828
All right, look,

4
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,872
I will say,
I lost me bottle a little bit

5
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,792
when I popped you one.

6
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,170
So, um...

7
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,631
sorry?

8
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,175
There, I said it.

9
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,135
We all square?

10
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,440
Hey,
hey, hey, hey!

11
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,734
- Easy, easy, kid. Relax.
- I'll fucking kill you!

12
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,361
Fucking hell.
Kid's stark ravin'.

13
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,112
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

14
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,989
Come on, breathe, breathe.

15
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,908
You mind?

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,368
- Fuckin' hell.
- Now, breathe.

17
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,578
- Just breathe. Okay?
- Okay.

18
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,163
- Okay. I'm fine.
- All right.

19
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,456
- All right.
- I'm fine.

20
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,584
What's the ETA?

21
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,419
A team's on the way... they'll
be there in a few hours.

22
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,713
- A few hours?
- I'm a civilian,

23
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,423
I can't just
push a button anymore.

24
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,842
The target's secure?

25
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,093
No one's seen him?

26
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,594
We're three fucking miles
offshore, Grace...

27
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,054
what do you think?

28
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,473
I think if there's a way to
screw this up, you'll find it.

29
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:24,854
Look, I just want me wife back.

30
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,438
I know.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,691
Bring Langley the terrorist,
and you'll have her.

32
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,360
Hey, you ever hear

33
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,737
of an old Supe called Liberty?

34
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,531
The fuck's that got
to do with anything?

35
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,158
I'm not sure yet.

36
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,619
How's your crew holding up?

37
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,996
Yeah, all good.

38
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,039
Uh, we are having a few laughs
here, I'll tell ya that.

39
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,541
The target is

40
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,876
the girl's brother?

41
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,502
Yeah, so?

42
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,130
You don't think it compromises
her allegiances?

43
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,300
Well...

44
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,844
if it comes to that,

45
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,971
I'll neutralize her.

46
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,891
The compassion you show
your team is truly touching.

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,859
It was just
a figure of speech, mate.

48
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,602
You remember in the camp...

49
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:34,108
you were so hungry
you'd cry all the time

50
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,778
and I snuck into the storage
room to steal you rice?

51
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,993
I took care of you.

52
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:50,332
I still will.

53
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,675
I also remember the time they
came after you for stealing.

54
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:04,346
I said no, it was me,
and they broke my hands.

55
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,725
You might be my big sister.

56
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,437
But I protect you too.
We protect each other.

57
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,940
You know...

58
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,360
the Americans will torture me.

59
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,488
I won't let them.

60
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,324
How will you stop them?

61
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,664
You have to let me go.

62
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,586
I won't attack anyone.

63
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,671
I won't hurt anyone.

64
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,636
I'm your brother...

65
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,848
we only have each other now.

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,684
Please.

67
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,868
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,954
I gotta go, man. I'm out.

69
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,148
- Breakfast is served.
- Mmm.

70
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,566
Do you want one or two, buddy?

71
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,860
- Just one.
- Yeah, just one.

72
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,737
You want maple syrup?

73
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,990
- Um...
- Yes, please.

74
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,870
A little more.

75
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you. Love it.

76
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,934
This is nice.

77
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,397
- Um, Mama?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,025
Quiero Raisin Bran, por favor.

79
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,276
Sí.

80
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,819
What is that?

81
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,112
That's Spanish.

82
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,740
Monday mornings
we have breakfast in español.

83
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,203
Hey, Ryan.

84
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,872
Do you want to stay in here
and learn Spanish,

85
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,874
or do you want to come
outside and have some fun

86
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,167
with your old man, huh?

87
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,960
I think that he needs to...

88
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,462
Mom, is it okay
if I go with him?

89
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,464
Yeah, of course it's okay,
right, Mom?

90
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,715
Come on.

91
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,009
Sure.

92
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,305
There you go, champ.

93
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,228
You guys fucking ready?

94
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,813
Okay, we pan up,
we see Homelander flying

95
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,774
towards Martinez's
Miami mansion.

96
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,442
And Martinez make a run for it.

97
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,944
Octavio, vámonos!

98
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,695
Vámonos, mi amigo!

99
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,447
Octavio accelerates
but Homelander

100
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,325
laser blasts out the tires...
bzz...

101
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,701
Boom!

102
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,371
Martinez gets out of the car,

103
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,831
dazed, looks up...

104
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,250
Homelander.

105
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,252
You're under arrest.

106
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,878
Oh-ho-ho.

107
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,505
And he slaps the handcuffs
on Martinez,

108
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,756
the cops take him away,

109
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,758
Homelander turns
to the other heroes.

110
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,969
We should work together
more often.

111
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,763
You mean like a team-up?

112
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,515
Exactly.

113
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,226
All seven of us.

114
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,312
Holy shit.

115
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,274
Holy shit.

116
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,359
That is the moment

117
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,196
The Seven became...

118
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,698
The Seven.

119
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,741
Rousing music.

120
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,290
Title card:
Dawn of The Seven.

121
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,791
Cut to black.

122
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,297
- That is amazing.
- Thank you.

123
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,673
Wow, I am very impressed.

124
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,300
Thank you so much.

125
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,802
And, gang,
that's just the teaser.

126
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,804
Look, this is not just
a superhero...

127
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,765
You look like shit.

128
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,225
Had a big night.

129
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,520
And I want to shoot the whole
thing hand-held, right?

130
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,855
Very Greengrass, very grounded.

131
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,107
I want to take the audience
and literally put them...

132
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,400
boom... right there
in the action.

133
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,402
But what's the plan
on Translucent?

134
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,070
That's a great question. Okay,
we're gonna take a stuntman,

135
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,822
put him in a jumpsuit
and just CG him out.

136
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,950
And... fuck,
I don't want to jinx this,

137
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,328
but Lin-Manuel Miranda
wants to do the voice.

138
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,872
- I love Hamilton. Oh, man.
- The world loves Hamilton!

139
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,498
- Oh, my God, you think he'll do a...
Excuse me.

140
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,208
-I'm sorry to interrupt this lovefest,
-No, of course.

141
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,710
- I just want to be a part of it.
- Understood.

142
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,879
Um, this...

143
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,464
- Great work.
- Thank you so much.

144
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,467
This script is a great start.

145
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,385
Really good bones.

146
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
Uh, I just have a few headlines.

147
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,139
Yeah, totally.
Listen, we can tweak dialogue

148
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,682
right up to
the day of production.

149
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,226
Yeah, it's not really tweaks.
It's more...

150
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,771
global.

151
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,315
Okay, yeah.
What are we, um...

152
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,941
What are-what are we thinking?

153
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,402
Oh, um, like, uh...

154
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,364
you write all women as either
unknowable Hitchcock bitches

155
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,157
or Michael Bay fuck dolls.

156
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,826
I mean, I get that a lifetime
of jerking off to Transformers

157
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,495
didn't exactly make you popular
with the ladies,

158
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,580
but, um, a little effort
would be nice.

159
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,873
You know what I'm saying?

160
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,166
Um, excuse me,

161
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,667
but I do have two sisters.

162
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,877
Thank you very much.

163
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,879
And, uh, excuse me,

164
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,173
but Homelander really loves
this script.

165
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,926
- So...
- Oh, okay. Where is he?

166
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,808
Ashley?

167
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,604
Um, okay. Okay. Okay, uh,

168
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,272
just, you know, continue doing
what you're doing.

169
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,982
Um, I just have to get to my...

170
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,526
I have to... I have a...

171
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,027
Uh, I just have to get
to my next thing.

172
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,155
I have a, um,
I have a-a noon...

173
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,576
Can someone open this, please?!

174
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,790
- Okay.
- Okay!

175
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,500
I got a few more headlines.

176
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,879
Mr. Edgar.

177
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,841
Sir, if this is all true,
I will get a strategy together

178
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,676
with crisis management and PR.

179
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,011
- We're fine for now, Ashley.
- Sir, is it true?

180
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,389
- What they're saying?
- We're investigating.

181
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,932
Sir, I have to tell you
something.

182
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,392
We have to tell Homelander,

183
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,352
and I have to admit something
to you. I...

184
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,939
You don't have the faintest
idea where Homelander is.

185
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,109
He will know
when I want him to know.

186
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,111
Just keep the rest
of the infants on 99

187
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,738
in check, will you?

188
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,414
...and if you are
just tuning in,

189
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,708
we have some major
breaking news.

190
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,043
Superheroes are not born
but made,

191
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,631
in fact created by a chemical
serum, Compound V,

192
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,718
produced and administered
by Vought International...

193
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,511
...the company that has been

194
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,389
the corporate face
of superheroes for decades.

195
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,016
Now, we don't know

196
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,392
where their superpowers

197
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,227
- actually came from.
- What... did you do?

198
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,271
I don't know
what you're talking about.

199
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,272
Oh, come on.

200
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,566
I saw you with the V
in your hand.

201
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,028
Yeah, and you let me
walk away with it, so...

202
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,863
this is kind of on you, too.

203
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,365
If I go down, you come with me.

204
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,534
Pretty sure they'd kill us both.

205
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,414
You don't get it.

206
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,211
You don't fuck with the money.

207
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,797
You never fuck with the money.

208
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,261
We're gonna lose everything...
I mean, cars, houses, bonuses...

209
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,264
There are more important things.

210
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,185
You know, the only people
that say that...

211
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,271
are the people who grew up
with money.

212
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,273
...provided evidence

213
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,609
proving Vought has been
administering Compound V

214
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,570
to children for decades.

215
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,656
Our very own reporting suggests

216
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,408
the parents also received
a very generous payment.

217
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,452
- It started when I was nine.
- Now, after the kids

218
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,996
were treated with Compound V,
they were then monitored...

219
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,416
I was at the mall.

220
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,877
And we, uh...

221
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,922
we passed the pet store...

222
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:06,513
...and I heard the goldfish
begging for their lives.

223
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,557
They were begging.

224
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,356
And after that, I...

225
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:20,569
The beach, the aquarium,
Red Lobster...

226
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,913
I mean, I thought
I was going crazy, you know?

227
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,627
But my mom said it was a gift.

228
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,259
That I was born this way.

229
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,388
But I wasn't.

230
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,978
It didn't have to be this way.

231
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,188
- I could've been normal.
- But early reports

232
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,190
seem to suggest the first
manifestation of powers

233
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,067
can cause fear and anxiety

234
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,694
In the affected children,

235
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,446
especially if they are not
carefully guided

236
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,905
through the process.

237
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,284
So far, Vought has refused

238
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,202
to release a statement.

239
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,331
Likewise, Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum,
former C.S.O. at the company,

240
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,374
refusing comment.

241
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,793
He's been in seclusion
since an undisclosed accident

242
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,670
- left him paralyzed.
- Uh, hey.

243
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,399
Is this you?

244
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,506
Vogelbaum all but
disappearing from public life.

245
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,133
You did it.

246
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,718
We did it.

247
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,346
Um, call me. Call me back
when you get a chance.

248
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,764
...on their stock price,

249
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,641
which is already
falling today,

250
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,601
- Did what?
- signaling a huge trend

251
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,436
that could be potentially
catastrophic

252
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,271
to Vought's bottom line.

253
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,274
You did this?

254
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:45,487
Uh, yeah. S-Starlight did,
mostly, I'm pretty sure,

255
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,240
but I just gave her
an old alley-oop.

256
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,868
Hughie.

257
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,453
Hughie, yes!

258
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,996
- Okay.
- Hughie!

259
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,790
Dude, look at what you
fucking did.

260
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,583
- Oh, my God.
- You lads touchin' yer tips?

261
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,085
Look at what the kid just did.

262
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,628
Me and Starlight, but yeah.

263
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,963
- Petit Hughie?
- The fucking kid.

264
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,715
Oh, shit.

265
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,966
Yes!

266
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,386
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Nice one.

267
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,429
That's all you got?

268
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,891
We've been trying to do
this shit for years.

269
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,768
Vought's finally fucking
going down,

270
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,395
the kid did it,
and "nice one"?

271
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,313
All right, real nice one.

272
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,609
You can't even give me this,
can you?

273
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,696
Not one goddamn win.

274
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,906
I'll tell you what.

275
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,574
When we're all done here,

276
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,535
I'll buy you a nice, big,
family size bottle

277
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,913
of top-shelf lube
and I'll tickle your balls

278
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,708
till you beg me to stop
and even then I won't.

279
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,042
I just won't do it.

280
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:45,046
But right now, we got
a Supe terrorist below deck

281
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,383
and shit could go sideways
just like...

282
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:57,016
So all of ya, keep your fucking
eyes on the ball, yeah?

283
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,569
Don't worry about him.

284
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,028
Yeah, fuck him.

285
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,321
You did great.

286
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,794
Isn't this great?

287
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,130
Yeah.

288
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,550
Your mom ever bring you up here?

289
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,968
No.

290
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,344
Nah.

291
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,805
Of course not.

292
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,476
You see, that is why a boy
needs his father.

293
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,064
Hey, I think it's time.

294
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:49,027
Yeah. You ready?

295
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,864
Um... ready for what?

296
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,908
To jump.

297
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,503
Wait, you can't be serious.

298
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,463
I'm not going to jump.

299
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,340
Ryan, you're my son.

300
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,510
You can fly, just like me.

301
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,096
I-I... I don't want to.

302
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,099
You take a big, deep breath,
you step off

303
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,726
and your body will just
do the rest.

304
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,019
It'll just take over.

305
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,813
But I-I can't fly.

306
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,231
I'll just fall
right off of here and get...

307
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,482
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy.

308
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,276
You're gonna love it.
I promise.

309
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,861
I'm nothing like you.
I-I can't fly.

310
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,655
You can. You can.

311
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,073
I promise you can.

312
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,661
Dad, please.

313
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,288
Please, don't make me jump.

314
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,958
Aw.

315
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,252
Buddy.

316
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,965
You called me Dad.

317
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,728
Ryan.

318
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,730
God. Ryan!

319
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,898
Hey. Hey, hey.

320
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,316
What did you do?

321
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,278
It's fine. It's a 20-foot drop.
Relax.

322
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,279
Inhuman fucking monster.

323
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,488
- Come here.
- Don't help him up.

324
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,824
- Let him do it himself.
- Come here. Baby, hey.

325
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,659
Hey, Ryan, I need you
to wake up.

326
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,412
Baby, can you hear me?
I'm right here.

327
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,080
I don't think he's breathing.

328
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,582
- He's fine.
- I don't think he's breathing.

329
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,792
- I don't think he's...
- Mom?

330
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,460
- Hi. Hi.
- Look. See?

331
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,879
- Told ya.
- Hi, sweetie.

332
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,255
Are you hurt?

333
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,423
Does anything feel broken?

334
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,716
- Oh, for God's sake, broken?
- Let me see.

335
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,426
Come on, look at him.
There's not a scratch on him.

336
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,512
You know why?
'Cause he's my son.

337
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,264
And you, you...

338
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,057
...you're raising him
to be a pussy.

339
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,350
You don't get to tell me
how to raise my son.

340
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,643
I'm his father.

341
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,353
You don't get to say that
after what you did.

342
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,355
What I did to you...

343
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,190
was give you a son,

344
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,192
that you are raising

345
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,278
like a little girl.

346
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,654
Let go of me.

347
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,283
- He's mine.
- Get your hands off of her!

348
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,046
Good boy.

349
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,756
See?

350
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,717
- I told you.
- What?

351
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,760
You're just like me, Ryan.

352
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,303
No, I'm not like you.

353
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,804
I'm nothing like you!
I fucking hate you!

354
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,889
Leave us alone!

355
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,849
Hey, hey, it's okay.
I'm not angry.

356
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,477
- Ryan.
- Go away!

357
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,562
- Buddy, it's o...
- Leave us alone!

358
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,065
Ryan, this is a good thing.

359
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,043
So, um...

360
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,509
These are horrible,
powdered cheese things,

361
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,011
but, um, if you're hungry?

362
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,684
Fuck you.

363
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,436
So you do speak English.

364
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,609
Thirsty?

365
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,660
You know,

366
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,705
the way you talk
with your sister...

367
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,915
it's no sign language
I ever seen.

368
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,714
I just want to help her.

369
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,761
I can help her.

370
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,596
Tu comprends?

371
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,016
You understand?

372
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,274
The night our parents
were murdered...

373
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,070
...Kimiko just stopped talking.

374
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,905
Can't talk.

375
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,783
She's never made a sound since.

376
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,453
In the camp,

377
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,290
we were alone week after week,

378
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,918
just the two of us, for years.

379
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,633
We... came up a language

380
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,511
so we could get through it.

381
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,017
I-It saved us.

382
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,770
Both of us.

383
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,942
Will you teach me?

384
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,539
Please.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,418
Fuck you.

386
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,223
I think your sister
is very special.

387
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,603
And she loves you very much.

388
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,742
I don't know anything about
this Compound V monkey business.

389
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,369
If someone gave it
to my little Maeve,

390
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,204
I sure as hell didn't know.

391
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,206
Bullshit he didn't know.

392
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,666
I remember this one weekend

393
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,585
where he made me do
three mall appearances

394
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,211
and a photo shoot
for Teen Vogue,

395
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,631
all to get the cash for
my braces, which he then blew

396
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,050
at the five-dollar table
at Circus Circus.

397
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,427
Maybe this is what

398
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,469
we've been waiting for.

399
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,430
What do you mean?

400
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,099
They've lied to you from
the beginning, all of them.

401
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,101
You don't owe them anything.

402
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,978
Maybe this is our chance
to leave while we can.

403
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,313
Elena...

404
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,357
if we do that,
you know what'll happen.

405
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,986
I'll call you back.

406
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,742
Not, uh, interrupting, am I?

407
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,368
No, of course not.

408
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,495
Great.

409
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,050
It's funny, you know, uh...

410
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,764
...of all the people here,

411
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,267
I've known you the longest.

412
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,686
Yeah.

413
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,108
Sometimes it, um,

414
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,779
just seems like you're
the only person I can lean on.

415
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,490
Yeah, I...
I-I feel the same way.

416
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,287
You do?

417
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,957
Of course.

418
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,428
You...

419
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,348
Oh... fuck.

420
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,225
Life, huh?

421
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,273
It's crazy.

422
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,401
Who's Elena?

423
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,736
Elena's an old friend.

424
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,535
Since when do you have friends?

425
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,622
I was just venting
about all this fucking bullshit.

426
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,041
What bullshit?

427
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,543
Wait, you haven't heard?

428
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,129
Where have you been?

429
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,723
What the fuck?

430
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,391
This is the NYPD.

431
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,393
This boat's been
reported stolen,

432
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,728
and you're all under arrest.

433
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,937
I repeat. This is the NYPD.

434
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,647
This boat's been
reported stolen...

435
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,566
I thought you said this boat
belongs to a friend.

436
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,693
Gather on deck and get
your hands in the air now.

437
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:54,780
Well, a stranger is just
a friend you ain't met yet.

438
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,157
Don't fuck this up.

439
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,491
I ain't gonna fuck it up.

440
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,617
Vought's almost toast,

441
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,202
we're almost home free...

442
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,746
I said I ain't gonna fuck it up,
all right.

443
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,165
Ahoy, gents.

444
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,208
I am the captain
of My Big Wet Dream.

445
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,588
I'm holding papers,
signed by the owner,

446
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,715
for the lease of this vessel.

447
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,676
So there must be some kind
of misunderstanding...

448
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,511
Look out!

449
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,058
Get his hands!

450
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,947
Time to go!

451
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,576
Hey, what are you doing?
We gotta help 'em.

452
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,203
Trust me, they're already dead.

453
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,204
You don't know that.

454
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,497
- We have to try.
- Hughie.

455
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,457
Literally everyone
is on their way here right now.

456
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,125
We stay here, we die, too.

457
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,812
What?

458
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,064
I wasn't the one
who fucked that up.

459
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,081
I know how you feel.

460
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,666
I'm a freak, too.

461
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,918
Oh, you shoot a fucking
bow and arrow.

462
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,420
I'm amphibious.

463
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,423
Okay, just...
just give me the phone.

464
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,841
Cancel the call.

465
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,260
Postmating Papa John's
isn't gonna help.

466
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,011
How do you know what helps?

467
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,596
You don't know
anything about me.

468
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,392
Let's just recite
the Fifteen Tenets, together.

469
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,685
No, fuck you

470
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,686
and your creepy shit, Eagle.

471
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,979
I'm hungry.

472
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,899
Deep, it's time.

473
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,276
Time for what?

474
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,735
For you. It's your time.

475
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,237
To get back into The Seven.

476
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,488
What?

477
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,533
This came from Alastair himself.

478
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,702
Holy shit.

479
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,245
Who?

480
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,705
Alastair Adana, the...

481
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,206
the leader of the Church.

482
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,375
He sits in the First Chair.

483
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,003
Cool.

484
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,630
Guys, with everything going on,

485
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,466
I just, I don't think
I can do it right now.

486
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,633
No, Deep.

487
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,635
This is your journey.

488
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,970
You're ready.

489
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,972
You have been ready all along.

490
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,559
Now, get out there
and be a hero.

491
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,232
My dad always used to say,

492
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,525
"Where there's smoke,
there's fire."

493
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,069
So Vought lied to us
about Compound V.

494
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,280
What else are they lying
to us about?

495
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,282
We're down 68%
in morning trading,

496
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,992
20% in the last 15 minutes.

497
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,827
- It hits 19, start a buyback.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,913
Jesus. What about
the pharmaceuticals?

499
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,748
Pfizer's circling, "dismayed
at our lack of ethics."

500
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,166
Investor lawsuits,

501
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,667
breach of fiduciary duty,
non-disclosure.

502
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:54,793
We have exposure
for fraud, assault,

503
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,086
infliction of bodily harm...

504
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,088
all policy exclusions,
no coverage.

505
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,131
We have two options.

506
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,008
Option one, deny.

507
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,635
High risk, high reward.

508
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,762
But if we deny
and they nail us,

509
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,180
if there is a legit
whistleblower,

510
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,389
there's no coming back.

511
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,849
That's bankruptcy,
criminal charges,

512
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,601
ten to 15 for everyone
in this room.

513
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,520
Option two, mea culpa.

514
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,313
They've called it.

515
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,731
Trading's halted.

516
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,902
Stan.

517
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,656
We got to put out a statement.

518
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,658
Which one is it?

519
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,953
Stan.

520
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,040
A power drink can, Frenchie?

521
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,542
You're a goddamn idiot.

522
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,502
I was trying to help her.

523
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,797
Where the hell are your mates?

524
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,173
New deal...
you gotta bring him in.

525
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,008
Grace,
we're three miles offshore.

526
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,927
You just crashed
a police helicopter.

527
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,221
Not exactly keeping
a low profile.

528
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,808
All right,
where do you want us to go?

529
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,351
CIA safe house Hazlet.

530
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,644
Be there in 30.

531
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,563
And Butcher?

532
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,772
Yeah?

533
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,358
Please be careful.

534
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,152
I will.

535
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,990
Fuck me.

536
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,702
Please leave
your name and number

537
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,121
and a message after the beep.

538
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:16,542
Hey, uh, Annie, it's me again.

539
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:20,504
I was just wondering, have
you ever seen the music video

540
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,549
for that Billy Joel song
"You're Only Human"?

541
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:26,218
There's this kid
and he's climbing up a bridge

542
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,178
and he's-he's gonna
kill himself,

543
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,097
but then Billy Joel
steps out with his harmonica

544
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,599
and tells him stop,

545
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,601
you just have to wait
for your second wind,

546
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:37,605
and now I-I feel like
I'm-I'm that kid

547
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,607
and I'm gonna drown,

548
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,650
and...

549
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,364
...and thank God
I found my second wind

550
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,284
because it's-it's you.

551
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,328
You're my second wind.

552
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,166
Um,

553
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,877
look, I know it's exciting,
uh, taking down Vought

554
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,839
and being like James Bond
and everything,

555
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,799
but you've got to be careful,

556
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,011
because that stuff can go
to shit really quick...

557
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,847
and you wind up hurting
the people that...

558
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,850
you love.

559
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,019
Like the way that I hurt you.

560
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,813
Um...

561
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,107
Anyhoo...

562
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,527
...that's all I wanted to say.

563
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,112
Second wind.

564
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,155
Fuck.

565
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,699
Um, okay, thanks.

566
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,785
Bye.

567
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:57,017
I know I don't come up

568
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,562
to 99 enough
and I apologize for that.

569
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:05,484
But times like this
tend to give us clarity,

570
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:08,445
don't they?

571
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,157
You and me are partners,
after all.

572
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,785
A symbiotic part
of a larger thing,

573
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:19,331
a living thing named Vought.

574
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,916
And that's how
we'll get through this,

575
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:24,044
together, as Vought.

576
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,838
But, sir...

577
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,509
...I got to say...

578
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,808
...we didn't know about
this Compound V shit.

579
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,436
- None of us.
- Is that so?

580
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,438
Well, we're all victims here,
A-Train,

581
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,815
but we'll get to the bottom
of it, I promise.

582
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,484
Right now, catching
this Super terrorist is...

583
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,777
Villain.

584
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,906
Super... villain.

585
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,992
Sure. Whatever.

586
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,910
It must be our priority,

587
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,704
and it changes the conversation.

588
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:01,790
So you want us
to go out there?

589
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,625
Now?

590
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,880
I mean, we still need to be
prepped by Legal and PR.

591
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,215
We'll be eaten alive out there.

592
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,884
- There's no time for that.
- Well, I'm sorry,

593
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,512
but I don't think
we have to damage control

594
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,889
your fuck-up.

595
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,308
Hey, guys.

596
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,351
Enough.

597
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,563
We gotta pull together here.

598
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,441
- Thank you, Homelander.
- Shh! Not you.

599
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,235
Us.

600
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,279
The Seven.

601
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,117
See, it doesn't matter
who made us

602
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,662
or how we got here,
the point is...

603
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,623
we are here.

604
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,209
Together.

605
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,877
Family.

606
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,714
You guys...

607
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,635
...you are my real family.

608
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,097
This guy...

609
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,058
he doesn't care about us.

610
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,977
We're not his partners,
we're his product.

611
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,064
So who gives a shit if Vought
burns to the fucking ground?

612
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,233
You should think before you
say something you don't mean.

613
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,526
Really, should I?

614
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,737
We are not Vought.

615
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,698
You see, companies,
they come and go,

616
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,992
but talent...

617
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,578
talent is forever.

618
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,499
The world still needs
superheroes,

619
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,293
and that, family,

620
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,128
that's what we are.

621
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,466
So let's get out there
and do what it is we do.

622
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,678
Let's take this cocksucker down.

623
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,975
Fuck Vought, huh?

624
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,394
I did not see that
coming from you.

625
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,646
Maybe you don't know me
that well.

626
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,857
Maybe I don't.

627
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,280
How far?

628
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,906
A mile, right there.

629
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,334
- What the fuck was that?
- What the hell was that?

630
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,510
Take the wheel!

631
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,445
We lost power.

632
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,709
Everyone, off the boat, now!

633
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,004
Frenchie, grab the winch.

634
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,594
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go! Get in!

635
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,012
Come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go!

636
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,972
Fuck!

637
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,600
- Go on. Frenchie, start it up!
- Go, go, go!

638
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,226
Go, go, go!

639
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,946
Look, there.
Head for the storm drain.

640
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,047
Oh, shit.

641
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,560
Butcher!
What are you doing?

642
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,728
Butcher!

643
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,945
Stop...!

644
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,101
Fucking diabolical.

645
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,235
Where's Hughie?

646
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,071
Hughie!

647
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,451
Oh, geez.

648
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,203
You all right?

649
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,705
Come on, son.

650
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,040
We got to leg it... Deep's here,

651
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,666
and The Seven
won't be far behind.

652
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,376
Um, you know what?

653
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,627
Okay, you guys go ahead.

654
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,212
You guys go ahead. I'm good.

655
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,839
Eh? What?

656
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:04,593
Just gonna sit here and wait,
i-if you don't mind.

657
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,219
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

658
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,723
My second wind.

659
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,227
All right, son.

660
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,937
Come on.

661
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,900
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

662
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,152
Geez.

663
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,988
All right, fine. Suit yourself.

664
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,867
All right!

665
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,535
Come on, let's go.

666
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,332
Whoa.

667
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,667
We can't leave the kid, man.

668
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,753
Pinocchio is staying put.

669
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,797
Have at it.

670
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,850
Hey, kid.

671
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,894
What are you doing here?

672
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,530
You ain't going...

673
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,906
I ain't going.

674
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,202
They're gonna be here
any second.

675
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,038
Probably.

676
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,257
Asshole.

677
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,925
Yup.

678
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,192
This way.

679
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,612
Frenchie.

680
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,700
Hey, Butcher.

681
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,285
Petit Hughie.

682
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,163
Hey, the kid's falling apart.

683
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,622
You know that, right?

684
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,541
Well, what'd you expect?
He's a fucking civilian.

685
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,126
No, no, no, it's not just him.

686
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,752
It's all of us.

687
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,171
Move the feet.

688
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,882
Just move the feet. Come on.

689
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,425
Move.

690
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,801
We're at our breaking point,

691
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,053
at each other's throats,

692
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,763
and you keep pushing us
and pushing.

693
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,641
- It's like...
- Right over the fucking finish line.

694
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,935
We just need to keep
our shit together

695
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,979
a little bit longer.

696
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,189
Okay?

697
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,024
We hand the cunt over,

698
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,818
and I get Becca
and you get your girls.

699
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,986
-Butcher, Butcher,
-We're right fucking...

700
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,112
- Butcher, Butcher.
- we're right there.

701
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,948
Hughie's not gonna make it.

702
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,117
And you need that kid,

703
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,661
more than any one of us.

704
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,872
He's your canary.

705
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,916
My canary?

706
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,752
You let your canary die,

707
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,296
how you gonna know
when you've gone too far?

708
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,926
I mean, what a load of bollocks.

709
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,641
Hell, I tried, all right?

710
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,643
The kid doesn't want
a part of me,

711
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,603
so fuck him.

712
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,568
Come on.

713
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,118
Lucy.

714
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,954
I promise
we'll harvest your blubber.

715
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,956
Jesus Christ.

716
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,042
Deep.

717
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,377
- Homelander.
- Hey.

718
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,586
- Hey.
- What happened?

719
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,879
They killed her.
They fucking killed her, man.

720
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,130
- What?
- I just was trying to help out.

721
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,423
- You know, I got some intel on the boat.
- Okay...

722
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,800
We started to cut them off
and then, fuck,

723
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,426
they just ran right into her.

724
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,929
I'm so sorry. I was just,
like, gonna try to stop them.

725
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,472
- I tried to cut them off...
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

726
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,057
So you're saying th-there's
people with the terrorist?

727
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,767
Look at me. You're saying
they're not alone?

728
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,018
I think so.

729
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,728
All right. Did you get
a good look at them, or...?

730
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,146
Not really.

731
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,856
I was too busy
worrying about Lucy.

732
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,150
Oh, Jesus. Right. Lucy.

733
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,819
But I think they went off
in the storm drains.

734
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,904
Can't be too far.

735
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:56,324
Uh, who invited you, exactly?

736
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,701
Starlight.

737
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,662
Listen, what I did
was unforgivable.

738
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:01,997
- Oh, God.
- I'm going to do everything in my power

739
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,291
- to renew my light.
- Mm.

740
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,418
Not just for you
but for all the female people

741
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,961
- that I've offended.
- "Renew your light"?

742
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,588
Did you just fucking join
the Church of the Collective?

743
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,216
- Maybe.
- You're an idiot.

744
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,802
Hey, easy on the religious
persecution, okay, new girl?

745
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,388
Starlight, maybe one day
you can welcome me back

746
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,474
into The Seven, but I know
my road is long and hard.

747
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,684
Are you serious?

748
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,397
There is no fucking way

749
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,065
you're coming back.

750
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,109
There's no need for language.

751
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,319
All right, enough.

752
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,696
We do not have time for this.

753
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,616
Look, I am with you, sister,

754
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,411
but first we have to go get
the terrorist, okay?

755
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,167
All right,
everyone in the tunnels.

756
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,418
- Yeah, everyone in the tunnels.
- Not you.

757
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,880
Anyone gets eyeballs
on the target,

758
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,381
he's mine, understood?

759
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,592
Go get 'em.

760
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,552
Noir.

761
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,763
All right, you...

762
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,223
need to hang back a bit. Okay?

763
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:02,775
Okay.

764
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:04,351
Still got some work
to do with the ladies,

765
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,435
but it's going to be okay.

766
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,686
You'll be back in no time.

767
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,730
- Really?
- Sure.

768
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,607
One other thing. You, uh,

769
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,442
you ripped your vest.

770
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,735
What?

771
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,612
Your gill is showing.

772
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,530
Cover it up.

773
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,741
It's disgusting.

774
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,852
Come on.

775
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,896
Come on!

776
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,536
You okay?

777
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,162
Yep.

778
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,914
I just need a little rehab.

779
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,374
I'll be fine.

780
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,962
Yeah.

781
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,297
I know you will, A-Train.

782
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,762
You got my message.

783
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,808
Annie, I...

784
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,875
Oh, come on.

785
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,793
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

786
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,754
This guy?

787
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,172
Again?

788
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,633
- I did not know...
- Shut it.

789
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,384
What, do you got rocks
in your fucking head?

790
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,846
Come here.

791
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,015
All right.

792
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:52,977
I'd like you to do something
for me, okay?

793
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,355
Kill him.

794
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,316
Uh, n...

795
00:46:58,358 --> 00:46:59,817
Wait.

796
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,110
N-N... he...

797
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,238
- He...?
- He's wanted.

798
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,906
Shouldn't we...
take him to the police?

799
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:09,285
Yes, he is. Yes, we should.

800
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,954
Kill him.

801
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,789
Right now.

802
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,416
Chicks, right, Hughie?

803
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,002
Oh, for God's sakes.
Come on, it's easy.

804
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,129
Hands in the air,

805
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,382
like you just don't care.

806
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,592
Kill.

807
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,804
Do it.

808
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,020
More incentive? Okay.

809
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,607
You kill him
or I'll fucking kill you both.

810
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,030
Do it.

811
00:47:58,418 --> 00:47:59,877
Oi. Cunt.

812
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,882
William?

813
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,051
What a surprise.

814
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,845
Hey.

815
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,847
You know, I had
a great breakfast

816
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,599
with your wife this morning.

817
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,434
Pancakes.

818
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,604
Mmm. Delicious.

819
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,732
Yeah?

820
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,109
Eat this, motherfucker.

821
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,048
Please.

822
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,090
Don't.

823
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,770
Come on, Hughie.
Before that cunt gets out.

824
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,816
Come on.

825
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,627
Please.

826
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,464
I love you.

827
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,802
- I love you, too.
- Hey, guys.

828
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,638
Call the foul!

829
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,488
Dad, no!

830
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,036
Daddy, you okay?! Dad!

831
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,388
Aw.

832
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,182
Can't do your magic little hand
thingy anymore?

833
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,810
How come?

834
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,997
Open your eyes.

835
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,209
Open your eyes.

836
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,796
I like to see the light go out.

837
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,845
Fucking yellow bastard.

838
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,165
I said he was mine.

839
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,967
You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

840
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:32,501
I know the news of Compound V
came as a shock to everyone.

841
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,961
As you can imagine,

842
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,422
this has been a very difficult
day for the Vought family.

843
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:40,801
Our focus now will be
to learn the truth.

844
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,638
As I said, we are conducting
a robust investigation

845
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,516
into Compound V,
but let me be clear:

846
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,978
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

847
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,648
We believe it was the work
of a small,

848
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:56,108
disaffected group of scientists

849
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:00,237
led by former Vought employee
Madelyn Stillwell.

850
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:04,325
But sadly, there are more
important matters at hand.

851
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,160
Everyone at Vought

852
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,579
sends their thoughts
and prayers

853
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,874
to those families
that were affected today.

854
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,834
Though it is important
to acknowledge

855
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,003
that this tragic event
could have been far worse,

856
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,090
today's attack underscores

857
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,717
just how dangerous the threat
of Super terrorists has become.

858
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:25,763
And, at a time like this,
America needs its heroes

859
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:27,056
more than ever.

860
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:29,433
We live in a dangerous world.

861
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:33,145
Our brave heroes were already
fighting terrorists overseas,

862
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,524
but now, America faces this war
on a different front:

863
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,943
right here at home.

864
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,486
These enemies
will stop at nothing

865
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:41,487
to infiltrate our borders

866
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,364
and attack our citizens.

867
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:47,368
Our superheroes are
the last line of defense.

868
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,454
And today, the death toll
would have been much higher

869
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,958
had it not been for the brave
actions of our newest hero,

870
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,252
Stormfront,
who stopped the terrorist

871
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,380
before he could take
more innocent lives.

872
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,241
Ladies and gentlemen...
Stormfront.

873
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,465
Thank you.

874
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,133
But we all know
who the real heroes

875
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,968
of this group are, right?

876
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,929
The people you see behind you,

877
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,307
the people who are struggling
every day.

878
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,850
So let's give them all a hand.

879
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,290
Stormfront, over here.

880
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,709
Stormfront, over here, please!
