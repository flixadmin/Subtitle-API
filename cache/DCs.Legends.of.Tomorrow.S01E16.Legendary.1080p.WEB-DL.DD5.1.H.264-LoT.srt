Because he didn't pose a threat

The timeline is unclear,

Of the oculus, meaning
savage is lost to history.

We've lost savage before.
We'll find him again.

We have no way

37
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,550
That kendra and carter
are in his possession,

Assuming that
they're still alive,

39
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,353
Which is highly unlikely.

42
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,393
And return them
to the timeline.

43
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,928
It will be as if
you never left.

44
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,196

that we can just

45

Return to our old lives,
and then pretend

a tad difficult.

48
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:48,140
So I had to bring you back to
may 2016, not January 2016.

- Great, so what you're saying
is for the last five months,

50

My mom probably thinks
that I'm dead.

Thanks a lot, man.

Was doing in 1944.

- It's called transmutation.
- Yeah.

416
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,872

Transmutation is a literal

I figured out how savage
plans to erase time.

456
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,338
I believe he intends to detonate
each of these meteors

destroy the world

Three times
in three different times?

460
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,746
- You can't, it would create
a temporal paradox.

461
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,114
- Which would result
in a timequake

462
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,683
That would return
the earth to the point

463
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,851
Of the first
chronothermic reaction,

464
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,588
Ancient egypt.

465
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,489
This is the craziest
bad guy plan

In the history
of bad guy plans.

By which vandal savage can
be measured.

469
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,930
- Okay, so which time periods
are we talking here?

470
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,599
- You said savage
was in possession

471
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,168
Of one of these meteorites
in 1958.

472
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,103
That was a year
of a rare alignment,

473
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,771
With the earth
and thanagar.

474
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,474
- Evidently he got hold of
a second meteorite in 1944.

475
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,443
- Which would be
useless to him in a year

476
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,311
Where earth and thanagar
weren't in alignment.

477
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,615
Now, if my math is correct,
and trust me, it is,

478
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,050
The next two years
that earth and thanagar

479
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:57,788
Are in sync
are 1975 and 2021.

505
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,002
Now,
the radiation works both ways.

506

It gave savage
his immortality, but--

507
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,772
- It also makes him
vulnerable.

508
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,574
- And savage
is about to unleash

509
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,609
The radiation
from three meteorites

510
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:28,179

511
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,348
- Triple the exposure.
- Yes.

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,919
Which should be sufficient
to render savage mortal.

513
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,455
- And then all we got to do
is kill savage three times.

514
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,056

Gideon can navigate
