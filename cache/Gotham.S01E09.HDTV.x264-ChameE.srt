00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:02,905
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:05,108
Mooney:<i> Killing falcone</i>
<i>would only create chaos.</i>

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,443
<i>I need to siphon his strength.</i>

4
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:08,379
<i>So, when the time is right,</i>

5
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:09,847
<i>Taking over his organization</i>

6
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:11,716
Will be like
slipping on a glove.

7
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:14,253
I'm so angry all the time.

8
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:15,922
Will that ever go away?

9
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:18,025
Alfred, can you teach me
how to fight?

10
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:20,295
You've been
through a lot.

11
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,763
I'm scared, jim.

12
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:22,897
Everywhere I go,

13
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,100
<i>I can feel that monster, zsasz.</i>

14
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:27,571
Alvarez:<i> Gordon,</i>
<i>some unis brought in a perp.</i>

15
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:29,073
<i>Claims to know you.</i>

16
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:30,374
Hey, detective.

17
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,312
Miss me?

18
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,987
Barbara?

19
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:43,860
Whoa.

20
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:45,695
Sweet crib.

21
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:49,066
You must be one rich cop.

22
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:50,935
It's my girlfriend's place.

23
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:52,203
Where is she?

24
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:54,340
I don't know.
Barbara?

25
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:59,947
So... What?

26
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,282
I get to stay here alone?

27
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:06,122
I'm hungry.

28
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:08,058
Barbara:
<i>Dear jim,</i>

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,829
<i>I thought I could be strong
and brave for you, but I can't.</i>

30
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,634
<i>Every place I go,
I see falcone and zsasz.</i>

31
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:16,970
<i>I'm nervous and needy
and screwed up,</i>

32
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:19,039
<i>And I know that's not
what you need or want,</i>

33
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,309
<i>So I'm going away for a while,
to get myself together.</i>

34
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:23,412
(cell phone ringing)

35
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:29,053
This is gordon.

36
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,755
Uh... Uh, right.

37
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,890
Yeah.

38
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,259
We're in the penthouse.
Come on up.

39
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:43,204
Sounds like your girlfriend's
not coming back, huh?

40
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:45,107
Why's she worried
about falcone?

41
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,677
None of your business.

42
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,378
So what happens now?

43
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,181
You gonna get the charges
against me dropped?

44
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,185
I will, but you're my only
witness to the wayne murders.

45
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:55,355
You gonna cuff me
to a drainpipe again?

46
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,257
No, I'm not gonna hold you
against your will.

47
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,060
GCPD, juvie...
you'd just break out.

48
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:01,028
So I do get to stay here.

49
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,031
No, I have someplace
else in mind.

50
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,701
(knocking on door)

51
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:06,769
That's the sketch artist.

52
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:08,806
I need you to describe
the man who shot the waynes.

53
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:12,077
Wait, where am I going to stay?

54
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,546
Wayne manor.

55
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,126
Do not speak
to the inmate.

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,730
Do not touch the inmate unless
in the service of your job.

57
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:29,400
Do not accept anything from the
inmate under any circumstances.

58
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:31,203
Who is this guy,
anyway?

59
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,505
<i>Name's ian hargrove,
some genius bomb maker.</i>

60
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,975
<i>Took out over a dozen buildings
in and around gotham.</i>

61
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:38,012
<i>He's the one that blew up
the commissary last month?</i>

62
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:39,780
Yeah, and he did it
with match shavings

63
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:40,949
And apple cider vinegar.

64
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,851
So no mistakes today, got it?

65
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:01,510
Put your hands up.

66
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,955
(latch slides, clicks)

67
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:20,435
She said this is the man
who killed your parents.

68
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:22,604
She said she saw his face.

69
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:25,075
Do you recognize him,
bruce?

70
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:27,510
No.

71
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:31,216
What's her name?

72
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,651
Selina kyle.

73
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,320
Do you believe her?

74
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:35,555
Yes, I do.

75
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:37,891
So, she saw...

76
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,560
Everything?

77
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:45,234
And you want her to live here
with us, do you?

78
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:46,703
A common street criminal.

79
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,004
She's hardly older than bruce.

80
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:50,875
She's just a kid
who's seen too much.

81
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,544
This is for her safety.

82
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,346
GCPD is full of moles...

83
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:56,750
Right, and how long would you
have us put her up, then?

84
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,152
I don't know.

85
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,321
No.
The answer is no.

86
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,724
Her being here will put
master bruce in great danger.

87
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,427
Alfred.

88
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,331
She is the witness
to a murder, master bruce.

89
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,565
You do understand that,
don't you?

90
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,135
She's also
the best chance we have

91
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:11,369
Of finding
who killed my parents.

92
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:13,839
Isn't she?

93
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:14,841
Yes, she is.

94
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:17,477
Then she can stay.

95
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:20,782
As long as it takes.

96
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:26,689
I've made my decision.

97
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:30,094
Yes, master bruce.

98
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,868
Look, I know this is a lot.

99
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,871
But I'm doing
everything I can.

100
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,541
Montoya and allen
and I are meeting

101
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:41,509
With an ada they trust
this afternoon.

102
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,479
Oh...

103
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,315
A trustworthy lawyer.

104
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:47,317
In gotham.

105
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,321
Look, if we find this guy,
we'll need her.

106
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,523
She'll have to testify.

107
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,724
Go before a judge.

108
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:53,926
It won't be easy.

109
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,896
Witnesses back
out all the time.

110
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,499
The ones that stick it out do so

111
00:04:58,501 --> 00:04:59,967
Because they care
about the victims.

112
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:03,739
We'll do our best to be nice
to her, then, won't we?

113
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,390
It's from the chinese
ming dynasty.

114
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,597
Five...

115
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,536
500 years old.

116
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:30,041
You can get one just like it
for five bucks, in chinatown.

117
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,623
I'm bruce wayne.

118
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,496
Selina kyle.

119
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:50,468
People call me cat.

120
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,704
Nice to meet you, cat.

121
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,388
What are you doing?

122
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,324
Nothing.

123
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,327
What's in your hand?

124
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,396
I said, what's in...

125
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:23,713
What the hell...?

126
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,917
(tires screeching,
horn honking)

127
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,217
Hargrove!

128
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:57,224
Ian hargrove, time to go.

129
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:08,873
Man:
<i>Kid, you screwed up, big-time.</i>

130
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,744
But you're still young,
you deserve a second chance.

131
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:13,145
So I have a
bet for you.

132
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,516
You call heads
or tails.

133
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:18,719
You lose, you go to jail.

134
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:21,156
You win, we let you go.

135
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,791
Bet.
Hold on.

136
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:24,560
There's a catch.

137
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,698
You have to make a promise
to god right now.

138
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,402
If you win, you're gonna
take this as a sign from him

139
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,405
Telling you that you need
to go back to school

140
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:33,472
And get your
life straight.

141
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:34,807
Can you promise that?

142
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,343
Do you promise that?

143
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:38,112
Yes, sir.

144
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:42,017
Okay then.

145
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,089
Call.
Heads.

146
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,096
Walk away, kid.

147
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,300
Somebody up there loves you.

148
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:56,170
Hey, harvey.

149
00:07:57,972 --> 00:07:59,841
Go.

150
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:00,875
Remember your promise.

151
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,879
Jim gordon, GCPD.

152
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,549
I hear good things
about you, counselor.

153
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,819
Harvey dent, likewise
about you, detective.

154
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,720
That was some trick
with the coin.

155
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,056
What if the kid guesses wrong?

156
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,591
You gonna send him to jail?

157
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,427
Teenagers, they nearly
always call heads.

158
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,595
I don't know why.

159
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:19,633
Two-headed coin.

160
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,436
Whatever works, right?

161
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,339
Dent:
<i>So who is he, jim?</i>

162
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:25,374
Who really killed the waynes?

163
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:28,479
This is what we have.

164
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:30,048
No I.D.

165
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,617
But this is from an eyewitness?

166
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,018
That you have in safe custody.

167
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,590
It's not nearly enough
to go to the law with.

168
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:37,992
Even if we had I.D. On this guy,

169
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:39,594
It's the people who hired him
we really want.

170
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:40,929
I agree.

171
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:43,398
Your eyewitness is useless
in a courtroom.

172
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,235
But the idea
of your witness

173
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,138
Could be immensely valuable.

174
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,576
Ever hear the name
dick lovecraft?

175
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,446
Sure. Billionaire.

176
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,381
Property, construction,
chemicals.

177
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:56,583
And as corrupt
as they come.

178
00:08:56,585 --> 00:09:00,889
Falcone, maroni,
even wayne enterprises,

179
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:03,092
Lovecraft has dealings
with all of them.

180
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:04,828
Since the waynes' deaths,
he's doubled his fortune.

181
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,730
Including a huge piece
of the arkham deal.

182
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:08,900
Dent: Lovecraft had a long
feud with thomas wayne

183
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,736
Over deals
and politics.

184
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,771
They couldn't have had a more
different vision for gotham.

185
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:14,641
I'm willing to bet my career...

186
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:16,109
On his involvement
in the wayne murders.

187
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:17,244
That's a big bet.

188
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,279
I want to use your witness

189
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,015
To go after lovecraft.

190
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,052
How? My witness can't connect
lovecraft to the perp.

191
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:26,156
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

192
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,925
I'll let it leak out

193
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:29,694
That we have a
secret eyewitness

194
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,830
Who's going to blow
the case wide open

195
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,699
And connect lovecraft
to the wayne killings.

196
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:35,368
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

197
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,605
And the people around
him will get nervous.

198
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,007
And that's when people start
talking; you know how that goes.

199
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:42,177
Unless lovecraft wasn't involved
in the wayne murders.

200
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,813
If so, which I doubt,
we still win.

201
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,348
Whoever was involved
in the wayne killings

202
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,117
Will get their
cage rattled

203
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,118
Like the dickens, won't they?

204
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,154
I bet he makes a move.

205
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,056
You like to bet a lot.

206
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,326
Well, what do we got to lose?

207
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:54,860
My witness becomes a target.

208
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:55,863
No.

209
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:56,897
That's the beauty of it.

210
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:57,999
We never actually file papers.

211
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,168
We never name names.

212
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,304
It's just a
powerful story.

213
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:03,772
Your witness is perfectly safe.

214
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:05,141
And you're on board with this?

215
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:06,376
We've been on board, jim.

216
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:07,912
Harvey's one of us.

217
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:09,915
I want what you want, jim.

218
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:13,386
I want to make this city
a better place.

219
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,994
No names.

220
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:22,164
Not mine, not my witness,
nothing... just a story.

221
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,935
Just a story.

222
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:27,137
All right.

223
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,406
Let's try something.

224
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,849
Hey, I thought I was gonna have
to work this case without you.

225
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,051
Where the hell have you been?

226
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,452
You know what?

227
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,122
On second thought, never mind,
I don't want to know.

228
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:41,356
What do we got?

229
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,159
A biggie.

230
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,061
Blackgate prisoner escaped
while in transit to st. Mark's

231
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,363
For psychiatric care.

232
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:49,000
His name's ian hargrove,
clinically insane,

233
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:51,169
With a compulsion for
blowing things up.

234
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:54,106
He exploded a bunch of
old buildings around gotham.

235
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,310
Last one,
two janitors were killed.

236
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:58,012
Says here he was busted out
by four gunmen?

237
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:01,050
Yeah, which is odd...
hargrove never used accomplices.

238
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:03,820
All right, so who did hargrove
spend time with at blackgate?

239
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,889
Who did he communicate with
on the outside?

240
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:09,226
His entire stretch,
he was isolated from gen pop.

241
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:10,996
Never made
or received phone calls.

242
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,799
Only one visitor
in those two years...

243
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:13,801
His brother john.

244
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:16,470
Got an address?
We do.

245
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,406
Unis are bringing him
in right now for questioning.

246
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,909
We're lucky you deigned
to show up.

247
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:22,311
Yeah, sorry.

248
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,848
No problem.

249
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:27,485
Girl trouble?

250
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah.

251
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,756
I told you.

252
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,960
Those high society dames...
get you all twisted.

253
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:38,132
Keep your guard up.

254
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:39,166
Knock lumps out of ya.

255
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:40,469
Watch your feet.

256
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,937
Right...
Jab, jab, right.

257
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,172
(grunting)

258
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:44,174
Lead with the...
Hey!

259
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,409
Jab, jab, right.
Jab, jab, right.

260
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,710
(grunting)
jab, jab, right.

261
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,045
Keep that guard up...
jab, jab, right.

262
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,515
Lead...
Jab, jab, right.

263
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:51,650
Jab, jab, right.

264
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,419
Now keep that...

265
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,789
(grunts fiercely)
yes.

266
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,791
(laughing)
oi!

267
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,025
Sorry, alfred.

268
00:11:58,027 --> 00:11:59,160
Hello.
Bruce.

269
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,233
That hurt.

270
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:04,434
Yeah, it's supposed to,
isn't it?

271
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:06,103
Taking a punch is

272
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,239
Just as important
as throwing one, master bruce.

273
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,841
What you doing?

274
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,510
Alfred's teaching
me to fight.

275
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:12,712
Why?

276
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:15,182
So I'll be prepared if
something bad happens.

277
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:19,821
Yeah, 'cause you live
in a pretty rough neighborhood.

278
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,424
Not here,
in gotham.

279
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:23,793
In gotham, people don't fight
with gloves on.

280
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:28,132
How's your room?

281
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:29,200
Everything good?

282
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,337
It'll do.

283
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,907
I'm hungry, though.

284
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,108
Right.

285
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,778
Well, breakfast was
served at 8:00, miss,

286
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,048
Which you slept through.

287
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,216
Lunch shall be
served at 12:00.

288
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,585
There's plenty to
eat in the kitchen.

289
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:43,986
And alfred will be happy
to fix you something.

290
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,189
No, he won't be, will he?

291
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,590
Because it's not
a bloody hotel.

292
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,295
Relax, old man.

293
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,797
I'll figure it out.

294
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,165
Yeah, you can mind
your manners as well,

295
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,901
You cheeky little minx.

296
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:57,205
Be nice to her, alfred,
she's our guest.

297
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:00,175
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
master bruce.

298
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,010
Didn't realize you fancied her.

299
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:03,313
What do you mean?

300
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,948
N-no.

301
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,350
Well, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

302
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,952
It's only natural, isn't it?

303
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,521
But you watch her.

304
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,725
She's a lairy one.

305
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,661
Right... Left, left, right.

306
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:18,132
(grunts)
keep your guard up, son.

307
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,134
You know about girls,
do you, alfred?

308
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:21,937
Fair sight more than you.

309
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,207
And she, mate,

310
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,909
Is trouble...
watch.

311
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,778
Oi! Oi, oi!

312
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:52,144
Liza, liza...

313
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:54,281
What are you up to?

314
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:27,792
(inhales deeply)

315
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:38,206
(inhaling)

316
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:45,515
(quiet laugh)

317
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,452
Lilacs.

318
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,492
♪ ♪

319
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,311
I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about his escape.

320
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:33,346
I haven't talked to him.

321
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,380
Your own baby brother

322
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,483
Busts out of prison,
and doesn't call you,

323
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,286
The only person he's
talked to in two years?

324
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:39,954
What happened?

325
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,123
You two have a falling out?

326
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,658
No, ian and I are close.

327
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,860
Always have been.

328
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,896
Even after he bombed
those janitors?

329
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,165
That was an accident.

330
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,500
Bullock:
<i>That's what they all say.</i>

331
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:50,803
John hargrove:
<i>It's the truth.</i>

332
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:53,039
(timer dings)

333
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,574
My brother's not a killer.

334
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:55,943
He never was.

335
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:58,647
He blew up 12 buildings
in gotham.

336
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:01,651
Yes, munitions factories
and their offices.

337
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:04,220
<i>Places that made guns
and bullets and missiles.</i>

338
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:06,490
<i>I know he was wrong,</i>

339
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:09,360
<i>But ian thought that
what he was doing was good.</i>

340
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:14,234
<i>He didn't hurt a soul
until the last bombing.</i>

341
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,136
And he felt terrible about it.

342
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:19,775
He practically handed himself in
to the cops and pleaded guilty.

343
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:24,814
Ian has had mental problems
ever since he was a kid.

344
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:25,883
<i>My parents didn't
have the money</i>

345
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,618
<i>To get him the help he needed.</i>

346
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,888
And he sure as hell wasn't
getting it at blackgate.

347
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,193
<i>Look...</i>

348
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,730
My brother's not a bad man.

349
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,234
Then what is he?

350
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:43,140
He's sick.

351
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,208
<i>There's a difference.</i>

352
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,216
Gordon:<i> Okay...</i>

353
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,653
<i>So who would want
to bust him out?</i>

354
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:55,089
I don't know.

355
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,824
But my brother
needs help.

356
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,693
You have to find him.

357
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:02,832
(door opens)

358
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,670
It's done.

359
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,680
I have a delivery
for you.

360
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,685
I'll take that.

361
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:50,629
Oh.

362
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:52,632
Who sent this, anyway?

363
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:53,366
Who cares?

364
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,702
Hmm.

365
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,637
(timer ticking)

366
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,640
Wait a second.

367
00:17:58,642 --> 00:17:59,975
You hear that?

368
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:02,044
Sounds like ticking.

369
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,382
(timer dings)

370
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,452
(explosion booming,
men screaming)

371
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:23,506
Good morning.

372
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,576
Uh-huh.

373
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,347
How'd you sleep?
Your house makes noise.

374
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,783
It's old.

375
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:33,754
You didn't come here with much.

376
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:34,855
If you want, alfred can
buy you some clothes.

377
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:37,825
Pass.

378
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:44,434
Detective gordon told me
you live on the streets.

379
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:46,704
Yeah.

380
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,105
So?

381
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,741
What's it like?

382
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,178
Not as nice as here.

383
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,947
Do you live alone?

384
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,984
Are you going to ask me
questions all morning?

385
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,957
Aren't you supposed to be
in school or something?

386
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,992
I'm developing
my own curriculum.

387
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:05,996
It lets me move at my own speed

388
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:07,799
And focus on academic areas
that interest me.

389
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,802
Why?

390
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,270
You're a billionaire,
what's to learn?

391
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,706
That's a strange attitude.

392
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:20,115
So, where are your parents?

393
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,088
They alive?

394
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,090
Um...

395
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,059
Sure.

396
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,661
They're around.

397
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,697
Where?

398
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:33,200
What's that to you?

399
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:34,234
Nothing, I just thought...

400
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,070
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

401
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,341
I'm not an orphan.

402
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,410
I got family all over.

403
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,626
This was bad enough when it
was just a prison escape.

404
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:55,295
Now we've got five
dead security guards,

405
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:58,199
And the press is calling
hargrove an urban terrorist.

406
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,202
Did you get anything
from the bombing site?

407
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:01,771
Bullock: Forensics is still
looking into it,

408
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:03,840
But the entire office
was destroyed.

409
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,743
Gordon:
Including all security footage.

410
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,045
Yeah.

411
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,148
We do know that hargrove
and his guys made off

412
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,183
With a compound
called hmx.

413
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:12,652
Gordon:
It's military grade.

414
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:14,354
Ten times more powerful
than c-4.

415
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:15,656
Nasty stuff.

416
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:17,158
Using explosives

417
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,360
To steal explosives.

418
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,528
What's that about?

419
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,464
Trading up?

420
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,732
He must have
another target in mind.

421
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:23,767
Some place difficult to crack.

422
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,102
You know what I'm gonna say.

423
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,238
So, go, do it.

424
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,307
(cell phone ringing)

425
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:34,014
This is gordon.

426
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,315
Alfred:
Yes, detective.

427
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,318
It's alfred.

428
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,021
Alfred, is everything all right?

429
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:40,255
Is selina okay?

430
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:41,658
Well, she's safe.

431
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
But?

432
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:46,997
But I'm afraid, detective,
this isn't gonna work out.

433
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:50,001
She's a... A tough nut,
this one.

434
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:51,704
Well, look, we need her help

435
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,707
If we have any chance
of catching the waynes' killer.

436
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:56,411
Just hold onto her for now,
and I'll be out to check on her

437
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:57,946
As soon as I can.

438
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:01,016
We shall patiently await
your arrival,

439
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:02,486
Detective.

440
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:07,925
Everything good?

441
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:10,929
Right as rain.

442
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,032
You sure you want to go
through with this?

443
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:16,103
Butch, don't you go getting
scared on me now.

444
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:17,706
Never, boss.

445
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,007
(door opens)

446
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,882
Oswald, you're back.

447
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,718
(chuckling)

448
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,321
I'm starting to think
you enjoy being hurt.

449
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:30,890
(chuckles)

450
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,325
I was passing by.

451
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:33,460
Thought I'd say hello.

452
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:35,997
Well, you said it.

453
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,431
Now why are you here?

454
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:41,471
Honestly, I'm just trying
to be friendly.

455
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:45,309
(inhales deeply)

456
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,080
(sighs with satisfaction)

457
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:50,416
Lilacs.

458
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:52,251
Mmm.

459
00:21:52,253 --> 00:21:53,887
You smell good.

460
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,222
You don't.

461
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:59,428
(laughing)

462
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,163
Snappy as ever.

463
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,700
Oh! (chuckles)

464
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:06,137
Well, good-bye then.

465
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,140
Sorry you're still
grumpy with me.

466
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:11,077
But, you know,

467
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,915
Reaching out in friendship
is never wrong.

468
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,826
Man, that dude's creepy.

469
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:26,764
Forget him.

470
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,834
He's nothing.

471
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:30,505
Hargrove's contacts
and phone records

472
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:31,740
From before he went
to blackgate.

473
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:33,309
Uh-huh. Yeah.

474
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:35,511
You all right?

475
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:36,747
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,289
Barbara left.

477
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,425
<i>Left</i> left?

478
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:46,627
Yeah.

479
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:48,096
Where'd she go?

480
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:49,430
I don't know.

481
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:52,334
It's a ploy.

482
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:55,105
She wants you to set a date.

483
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,139
It's a standard move.

484
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,208
She'll be back.

485
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,509
Do you play video games?

486
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,147
Ed, don't<i> ever</i>
do that again.

487
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,549
My apologies, detective.

488
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,318
Do either of you
play video games?

489
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,387
I do, I...

490
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,122
(giggles)
I love video games.

491
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:11,259
I find that each one presents
a new challenge, a puzzle.

492
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:13,296
It's a lot like detective work
in that way.

493
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:14,263
Ed.

494
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:15,565
Oh, sorry.

495
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,468
Uh, I had a chance
to analyze the shrapnel

496
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,536
From the security office.

497
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:19,637
And I found something.

498
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:20,673
It's a nameplate.

499
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,474
It was damaged in the bombing,

500
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:24,177
But you can still
read the information.

501
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,812
It's from an abandoned
metal factory

502
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:28,582
Here in gotham.

503
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:31,486
That's really good work, ed.

504
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:32,489
Thanks.

505
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,990
Thank<i> you,</i> detective.

506
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,226
Let's go check this out.

507
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:04,797
GCPD!

508
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,333
Freeze!

509
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:08,436
Don't shoot!

510
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:10,438
You found the nameplate,
thank god.

511
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,475
Bullock:
Is anyone else here?

512
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:14,578
No, but they'll be back soon.
Please, you got to help me.

513
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,847
They broke me out of prison,
they kidnapped me, they told me

514
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:19,584
They'd kill my brother and his
family if I didn't help them.

515
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:21,653
Who's "they"?
Russians.

516
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:23,423
One of their names
is-is kasyanov.

517
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:24,924
They're planning something
against falcone.

518
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:26,494
Falcone?
Yeah.

519
00:24:26,496 --> 00:24:28,462
It's a, it's a big job, a vault.

520
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:30,365
That's why they needed me
to build explosives.

521
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:31,600
(men shouting)

522
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:32,702
Behind you!

523
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:33,936
Get down, get down!

524
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:49,657
(man shouting)

525
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:55,331
(men shouting)
help me!

526
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,006
(men shouting)

527
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:26,273
Bruce: If you want
to go somewhere,

528
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,775
We can call you a taxi.

529
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:31,781
You move quiet.

530
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:33,683
So do you.

531
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:38,857
Are you leaving?

532
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,894
Thinking about it.

533
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:45,432
I'm sorry if talking
about your family upset you.

534
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:46,868
I wasn't upset.

535
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,970
You seemed kind of upset.

536
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:03,523
That's your mom, huh?

537
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:07,027
She looks nice.

538
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,796
She was.

539
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,768
You saw her...

540
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,472
The night she was killed?

541
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,943
Uh-huh.

542
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,746
And you saw me?

543
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:25,252
What I did?

544
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:26,720
What I didn't do?

545
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,089
What are you talking about?

546
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:29,658
What could you have done?

547
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,026
I don't know... something.

548
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:34,631
You're dreaming, kid.

549
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:37,001
A gun's a gun.

550
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:44,077
My mom's in show business.

551
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,781
Oh?

552
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:49,184
Yeah.

553
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:52,221
She sings and dances
and does magic tricks.

554
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:56,260
Gets paid,
like, millions.

555
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:58,263
But that's just a cover.

556
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:00,365
Really, she's a secret agent
for the government.

557
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,835
Wow.

558
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:05,105
Yeah.

559
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:08,109
She's on a secret mission.

560
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:12,314
But when she's done,
she's coming back to get me.

561
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:15,886
That's good.

562
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:20,626
Yeah.

563
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:23,363
Did you ever kiss a girl?

564
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:25,833
No.

565
00:27:25,835 --> 00:27:27,635
Do you want to?

566
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:29,404
Why-why do you ask?

567
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:32,008
Just curious.

568
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:39,050
Time for your studies,
master bruce.

569
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,757
Thank you, alfred.

570
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,494
You're more than welcome
to join, miss kyle.

571
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,831
Right.

572
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,235
I'll see you later.

573
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,505
Do you have any idea
how many angry phone calls

574
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,040
We've been
getting this week?

575
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,442
Got a terrorist
out there.

576
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:58,444
And that's our fault?

577
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:00,211
Jim!

578
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:03,917
No, no, please.

579
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,521
You tell me, detective...

580
00:28:06,523 --> 00:28:07,855
How is this my fault?

581
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:09,425
Well, for starters,

582
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:11,326
You have the mentally ill
housed at blackgate,

583
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:13,329
A prison with
no facilities for them.

584
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:14,831
So, you send them
out for treatment,

585
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,167
Which was exactly where

586
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:17,849
Hargrove was headed
when he was broken out.

587
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:21,974
I want him found.

588
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:23,076
Yes, sir.

589
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,312
Today.
Yes, sir.

590
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:28,516
What is wrong with you?

591
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,955
By the way,
hargrove's brother john,

592
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:35,559
I went ahead and put him and his
family in protective custody.

593
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:37,095
That'll help.

594
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:38,429
Yeah, only problem is...

595
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,365
Hargrove doesn't know that.

596
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:43,970
All right, dent.

597
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,907
You dragged me
down here, now what?

598
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:53,850
I got the last piece
of the puzzle in place.

599
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:55,219
I'm bringing charges
against you.

600
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:57,489
Oh, that old song again?

601
00:28:57,491 --> 00:29:00,126
You will never prove fraud.

602
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:02,695
You know that, and I know that.

603
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,598
Fraud charges are only
part of it.

604
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,068
Oh, really?
What, then? Jaywalking?

605
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,271
Conspiracy to commit
first-degree murder.

606
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:10,839
Murder?

607
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:12,408
So, tell me, dent...

608
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,843
Who did I kill?

609
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:16,013
Thomas and martha wayne.

610
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,949
(scoffs):
Oh, god...

611
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:20,385
I have an eyewitness who
can tie you to the crime,

612
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:22,955
You and all the
others involved.

613
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:24,958
That's absurd.

614
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:34,037
Help yourself
out here, dick.

615
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,576
Think about your options.

616
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:40,445
This is gonna get ugly.

617
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,216
(scoffing laugh)

618
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:45,786
You're a fool.

619
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:50,525
And you have no idea who or
what you're even dealing with.

620
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:53,062
Don't you ever
threaten me!

621
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:56,099
I will rip you open.

622
00:30:10,053 --> 00:30:12,088
It was good to see you, dick.

623
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,056
Bullock:
<i>Jim!</i>

624
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:14,390
Got it.

625
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:15,626
Yeah?

626
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:17,228
Meet gregor kasyanov.

627
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,463
Long rap sheet.

628
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:19,931
Worked for nikolai
before he died.

629
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,367
Who does he work for now?

630
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:22,369
Beats me.

631
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,704
All right.

632
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:25,706
Hargrove said it's a big
job, right? A vault.

633
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,375
Somebody's got to
be bankrolling it.

634
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:29,511
Yeah, someone with cash
and pull and beef with falcone.

635
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,180
Problem is... in gotham,

636
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:33,316
Anyone with cash and pull
has beef with falcone.

637
00:30:33,318 --> 00:30:34,284
Gordon:
Hmm.

638
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:35,453
So, who is it?

639
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:53,310
(mooney clicks tongue)

640
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,145
You kept me waiting.

641
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,582
Ran into a little trouble.

642
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,218
Nothing to worry about.

643
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,854
Good, I've got a lot
riding on this job.

644
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,356
You've said.

645
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:05,660
Mooney:
Your boss nikolai is dead

646
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:07,662
Because of falcone.

647
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,031
You want to get back at him,

648
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,068
You hit him where it hurts...
his money.

649
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,369
Ain't that right, butch?

650
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,705
Yep.

651
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,473
The root of all evil.

652
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,243
We'll take his money.

653
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,611
No problem.

654
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:22,181
As long as it's there,
like you said.

655
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:24,184
Oh, it's there.

656
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:27,021
I'm positive.

657
00:31:27,023 --> 00:31:28,723
The truck you needed.

658
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:32,562
And gregor...

659
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:35,833
...Break a leg.

660
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:49,952
(water burbling)

661
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:57,929
(heart beating)

662
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:00,132
(heartbeat increases)

663
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,307
(selina scoffs)

664
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,811
You're the weirdest
kid I've ever met.

665
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,220
Why are you doing that?

666
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:18,590
Training.

667
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:20,226
Oh...

668
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:22,261
Like the boxing.

669
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:24,931
So, if anyone mugs you
with a diving board,

670
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:26,501
You'll be ready, huh?

671
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:28,236
Yes.

672
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,239
I mean, no.

673
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,409
I'm developing
self-discipline and willpower.

674
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,643
Why?

675
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,713
So I can be strong.

676
00:32:35,715 --> 00:32:38,884
I get you, but it won't work.

677
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:41,888
Not on the streets,
not in gotham.

678
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,989
Why's that?

679
00:32:42,991 --> 00:32:44,758
Out there on the streets,

680
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,959
It's not enough to be strong.

681
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:49,264
You gotta be mean.

682
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,600
Gotta be ruthless.

683
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,805
Do you know what ruthless means?

684
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,374
Of course I do.

685
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:57,909
Yeah?

686
00:32:57,911 --> 00:32:59,044
Well, you ain't.

687
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:01,213
You're a nice kid.

688
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,850
Five minutes on the street,
you'll be mincemeat.

689
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:06,420
And holding your breath
won't do a damn thing.

690
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,375
Host: The subject of today's
category is numbers.

691
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,377
Here we go.

692
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,246
How many bones in the human arm?

693
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,248
Thirty-two.

694
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:27,249
Woman:
Thirty-two.

695
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,251
(bell dings)

696
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:29,818
Host:
Correct.

697
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,923
Next, how many elements
in the periodic table?

698
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:35,159
118.

699
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:37,762
Woman:
Uh... 118.

700
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:38,997
(bell dings)

701
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,766
Host:
Yes, again.

702
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,001
Now for a tough one.

703
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:45,205
How many eyes are there
on cards in a deck?

704
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:46,208
Forty-two.

705
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,475
Woman:
21.

706
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:48,776
(buzzer sounds)

707
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,446
Host:
No, I'm sorry.

708
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:53,383
The number you were
looking for is 42.

709
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,219
You forgot to double it
for two eyes.

710
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:56,921
(lively music playing)

711
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,225
(whoops, laughs)

712
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:01,828
Host: Well, that concludes
our show for today.

713
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,062
We'd like to thank
all the contestants

714
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:04,965
That participated here in studio

715
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,767
And those of you
playing along at home.

716
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,770
We'll be back right after this.

717
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:10,273
Bullock:
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

718
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:11,440
What about the explosives?

719
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:13,777
It-it's a very
specific type.

720
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:15,312
It's highly volatile,

721
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:17,215
And it's very difficult
to manufacture.

722
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:20,252
It's for one use,
and one use only.

723
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,888
To penetrate iron.

724
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,290
Like a vault
in a bank.

725
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:24,759
Mm-mm, no, they're all steel.

726
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,394
No one makes anything
out of iron anymore.

727
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:28,397
Not for...
A hundred years, at least.

728
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,465
The gotham armory.

729
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:31,734
Yeah.

730
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,136
Yeah, they have
those iron vaults

731
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,605
They used to keep
the gunpowder in.

732
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:36,006
A few years ago,

733
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,375
A private investment
group bought it.

734
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:39,177
Ten to one,
falcone's behind it.

735
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,248
Hmm...? Do you...?

736
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:52,462
How much longer?

737
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:54,732
It's ready.

738
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,794
It didn't work.

739
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,837
(laughter echoing)

740
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:27,976
Hey, hey...

741
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:29,611
Promise me nobody else
is gonna get hurt.

742
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:30,614
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

743
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:31,615
Sure, no problem.

744
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:32,749
Cross my heart.

745
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:50,239
You're surrounded!

746
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:51,073
(sirens approaching)

747
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:52,242
There's no way out!

748
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:53,677
(sirens whooping)

749
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,913
Drop your weapons!

750
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:57,949
Kasyanov:
Don't do it! Get back!

751
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:00,453
Hargrove!

752
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:03,490
Ian hargrove!

753
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:05,326
Your brother
and his family are safe.

754
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:07,095
We have them in
protective custody.

755
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:09,865
Kasyanov:
If he runs, shoot him!

756
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:10,933
Don't shoot!

757
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,069
Man: You shoot him,
they shoot us!

758
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:14,137
Drop your weapons!

759
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:23,450
(cell phone ringtone playing)

760
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:27,656
Get away from the truck!

761
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:28,658
Everybody down!

762
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:07,442
Why'd you do that?

763
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:09,044
Bet you can't hit me.

764
00:37:09,046 --> 00:37:10,846
I could.

765
00:37:10,848 --> 00:37:12,048
But why would I want to?

766
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,183
Try.

767
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:14,185
What for?

768
00:37:14,186 --> 00:37:18,123
Hit me, and...

769
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,025
Hmm...

770
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:24,028
I'll let you kiss me.

771
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:31,906
Ha!

772
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:39,482
You didn't get me.

773
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:41,351
Ah, no!

774
00:37:47,694 --> 00:37:49,496
Oh!
(laughing)

775
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:56,839
(bruce shouting playfully)

776
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,979
(cell phone ringing)

777
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,418
Gordon:
Morning, alfred.

778
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,854
Ah, detective.

779
00:38:07,856 --> 00:38:09,288
I've been trying
to get out there.

780
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,824
I'm sorry, uh...
Is everything okay?

781
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:12,192
Is she behaving herself?

782
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:14,529
Well, uh, not really, no.

783
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:15,730
That's all right.

784
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:17,032
It is?

785
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:18,267
Yes, well, she's...

786
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:21,304
A breath of fresh air,
I might say.

787
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:23,741
Glad to hear it.

788
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:26,111
I'll be out there
as-as soon as I can.

789
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:28,748
Very good, sir.

790
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:38,160
(surprised gasp)

791
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:40,163
Oh...

792
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:41,532
Forgive me for the intrusion,

793
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:43,268
But it's urgent
that I speak with you.

794
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:46,171
(laughs)

795
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:47,573
You know who I am.

796
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,010
Yeah.

797
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:52,446
And falcone would kill you
if he knew you were here.

798
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:56,184
Perhaps.

799
00:38:56,186 --> 00:38:58,187
What would he do if I told him

800
00:38:58,189 --> 00:39:00,490
That you were spying
on him for fish mooney?

801
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:02,760
You don't have any proof.

802
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:05,330
No.

803
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:11,638
But suspicion,
it's a funny thing.

804
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,308
Hmm?

805
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,211
Falcone might not choose
to believe me at first,

806
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:18,314
But every time
he looked at you,

807
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:22,286
He'd ask himself... is she?

808
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,155
Could she?

809
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,657
Would she?

810
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:27,292
You're wrong.

811
00:39:27,294 --> 00:39:28,595
He cares about me.

812
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:31,799
Let's call him and find out,
shall we?

813
00:39:33,836 --> 00:39:36,538
(keypad beeping)

814
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,741
Stop!

815
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,093
Your secret is safe with me.

816
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:55,197
I won't tell,

817
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,600
Because you...

818
00:39:57,602 --> 00:40:02,106
Are gonna keep working for fish.

819
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,777
And you are not going
to tell anyone.

820
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,847
Or you'll die.

821
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,520
Gordon:
Messages for gordon.

822
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:14,589
Thanks.

823
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,625
Jim.
You have a minute?

824
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,328
Uh, yeah.

825
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,334
I met with lovecraft.

826
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:24,369
How'd it go?

827
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:25,371
He was scared.

828
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:26,805
He's involved, all right.

829
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:29,175
Scared isn't proof.
You didn't see him.

830
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,378
Told the same story
in a few other spots.

831
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,546
All the big players
will know by now,

832
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:33,548
Someone will start talking.

833
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,216
If and when they do,

834
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:36,919
Neither of us makes a move
without talking first.

835
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:38,220
We move together on this.

836
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:39,790
Absolutely.

837
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,192
Hey, nice work
on the hargrove case.

838
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,393
You saved the poor
guy's life.

839
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:43,928
You're a regular saint.
Thanks.

840
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,397
Uh, we'll be talking
again soon, I hope.

841
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,865
You bet.

842
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:48,234
Thanks, counselor.

843
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,837
Finish up with hargrove?

844
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,840
Yeah.

845
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:54,342
He's on his way to arkham.

846
00:40:54,344 --> 00:40:55,544
Arkham?

847
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:57,413
Mayor's directive.

848
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,315
He's taking all the criminally
insane inmates from blackgate,

849
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:00,651
Sending them to arkham,

850
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,352
So they can get
appropriate treatment.

851
00:41:02,354 --> 00:41:03,822
That's nuts.

852
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:05,623
Appropriate tr...
The building's 200 years old.

853
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,426
Welcome to gotham.

854
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:09,329
Oh, and get this...
hargrove said that the bomb

855
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:10,831
That blew up the money
wasn't his.

856
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:13,534
Whose was it?
He didn't know.

857
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,879
How did it go?

858
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,380
Cops were everywhere.

859
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:25,584
Our guys had
no way out.

860
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,286
I had to make
the call.

861
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:28,554
Is everybody dead?

862
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:30,324
Gregor? All his men?

863
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:32,259
Every last one.

864
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,229
Good.

865
00:41:34,231 --> 00:41:36,232
I can't stand loose strings.

866
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:37,633
You're not mad?

867
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:39,503
That's a hell of a lot
of money we just lost.

868
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:40,804
Mad?

869
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:42,774
I couldn't be happier.

870
00:41:42,776 --> 00:41:45,010
The point wasn't to steal
that money, butch.

871
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:46,812
It was to hurt falcone.

872
00:41:48,282 --> 00:41:51,285
Well, that you did, fish.

873
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:52,686
That you did.

874
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:53,922
Good afternoon, everyone.

875
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:56,024
Thank you all for coming.

876
00:41:56,026 --> 00:41:58,261
As you well know,

877
00:41:58,263 --> 00:41:59,663
The people of gotham

878
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:03,001
<i>Have been shaken
by tragedy in recent days,</i>

879
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:07,673
<i>Tragedy no citizen
should have to endure.</i>

880
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:10,877
<i>What has happened these past
few days is a direct result</i>

881
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:14,448
<i>Of gotham's criminally
insane not getting</i>

882
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,888
<i>The appropriate treatment
and help that we owe them.</i>

883
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,325
<i>That is why I am moving
forward with plans</i>

884
00:42:21,327 --> 00:42:25,230
<i>To turn the recently
renovated arkham asylum</i>

885
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:27,133
<i>Into a remedial facility...</i>

886
00:42:27,135 --> 00:42:28,701
All right, let's go,
here, man; let's go.

887
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:30,838
<i>...For the criminally insane.</i>

888
00:42:33,876 --> 00:42:34,943
Gordon:
<i>Barbara...</i>

889
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:36,745
It's me.

890
00:42:36,747 --> 00:42:39,316
I got your letter, and I, um...

891
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:44,155
I know you said you needed
some time away from gotham.

892
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:46,225
From me.

893
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:49,262
But I want you to come back.

894
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:53,902
I need you... To come back.

895
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,273
I don't have anything
without you.

896
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,313
And I love you.
