1
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,000
But be very careful, because
the second any blood is shed,

2
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:13,100
we'll no longer be Robin Hoods but
just a bunch of plain motherfucking punks

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,360
Rio, Rio!

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,382
Damn it to Hell!

5
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:08,400
The fucking first rule!

6
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:11,137
You know it! It was
the first fucking rule!

7
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,280
Fuck!

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,400
Fuckers!

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,002
Paula, you're missing the purple.

10
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:25,320
Paula.

11
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:27,080
Paula.

12
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:31,771
I don't understand why papa can't
come to my birthday party tomorrow.

13
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,280
I already told you, Paula.

14
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:37,458
A judge has denied him custody
and now I'll take care of you.

15
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,000
It wasn't a judge.

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,400
- Oh no?
- No.

17
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:41,421
Then who?

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,370
It was you. You don't want him
to come to my birthday.

19
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:45,695
Right, grandma?

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,212
Well, you see, mom and dad
are not on good terms right now.

21
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,480
- They'll figure it out, you'll see.
- Mom, could you?

22
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,160
Yes, chief.

23
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,340
Raquel, I know this is your day off,
but we have a situation with hostages.

24
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:09,986
The suspects tried to get away with
the money, but they weren't successful.

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,769
They wounded two cops.

26
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:13,834
And now they're holed up at the Royal Mint.

27
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,537
I want you at the scene
to be the negotiator.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,720
- Better send a car.
- It's already outside.

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,956
What the fuck was that?
Explain to me what the fuck was that!

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,353
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you a psycho bitch?

31
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,760
<font color="#B20000">8 HOURS INTO ROBBERY</font>

32
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:41,152
- You shot a cop, god damn it!
- Calm down.

33
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,439
A fucking cop began shooting, alright.

34
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,112
What would you do, spit on him?

35
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:48,827
- I don't give a shit!
- What would I do?

36
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,874
I would follow the the
fucking plan, damn it!

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,375
We've been over it 400 million times.

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
<font color="#B20000">FRIDAY 6:25 P.M.</font>

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,872
Didn't we agree, no one gets hurt.

40
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,409
- I blacked out from the impact...
- I don't care!

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,214
Nairobi and I covered you,
but aimed at the ground,

42
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,283
We didn't aim at the cops, asshole!

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,208
They're taking the wounded cops away.

44
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:18,237
Are the phones connected?

45
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,960
Drop any radio or wireless signal.

46
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,533
We're switching to analogue.

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,999
Call the Professor.

48
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:48,708
What are you wearing?

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,160
What are you wearing?

50
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:55,541
What are you wearing?

51
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,102
- What happened?
- Two cops were wounded.

52
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,124
Who fired?

53
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:07,459
Tokyo.

54
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,680
Connect the cameras for the Professor.

55
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,967
Rio got grazed and Tokyo opened fire.

56
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:17,080
Apparently, they're involved.

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Let me talk to her.

58
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,840
- What?
- Is this true?

59
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,429
- That you were involved with Rio?
- Are you serious?

60
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:38,482
No.

61
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,796
The love of my life died because of me,

62
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:43,791
so the last thing I want
is getting involved with a kid.

63
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,384
I only fired to protect
myself and my partner.

64
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:50,762
And Professor, no matter
how much you thought it out,

65
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:52,419
things don't always
end up how you planned.

66
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,017
What's happening?

67
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,916
It looks like they blew
up one of the vaults

68
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,620
in an attempt to take the
last of the printed sheets.

69
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:17,496
- Why didn't the alarms go off?
- We don't know.

70
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,582
A manual alarm went off, we assume
one of the employees activated it.

71
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:21,493
How many hostages?

72
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:24,000
It's impossible to say,
the museum was open.

73
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,887
Give me a number.

74
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:30,022
Confirmed: 35 employees, 11 security guards
and 17 students from the British School.

75
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,520
- Why would students be in there?
- A field trip.

76
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:35,344
- Has the media reported it?
- No, not yet.

77
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,909
And the suspects?

78
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,672
We don't know yet. We're compiling
images from nearby businesses.

79
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:41,962
How many are there?

80
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:45,982
Well, four came out, we think
there's no more than six.

81
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:49,280
- Weapons?
- We know they have at least three M16s.

82
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,002
- And they're extremely aggressive.
- And SWAT is here.

83
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, they were the first to arrive.

84
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,120
Okay, please, give me
some good news, alright.

85
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:02,800
Well, the cops that
were shot, they're alive.

86
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,696
Thank goodness.

87
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,137
Let's go.

88
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,391
What's on the images from the cameras?

89
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,360
- The ones that are on the inside?
- There's no signal.

90
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,793
- What do you mean?
- There's no signal

91
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,473
I don't know. Maybe
they smashed them.

92
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,071
There's no signal.
We're working on it.

93
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:25,069
What about the network?

94
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,080
They took down the fiber optic,
therefore we can't hack them.

95
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:33,520
Everybody, listen carefully,
Police, Public Safety Teams,

96
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,587
I want every phone disconnected.

97
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,110
Just in case they try
to contact us,

98
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:40,199
we'll free the relay that's
on the roof of the building

99
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,867
Whatever cellphone signal
that is in the perimeter

100
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,400
must go directly through us.

101
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,966
Okay, I want the analysts here,
in two seconds. Got it?

102
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,862
Do we have the floor
plans for the building?

103
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,720
Yes, I'm looking
it over for a way in.

104
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,246
Isn't love exciting.

105
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:07,280
And they say that civil
servants aren't well taken care of.

106
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,480
What the hell are you doing?

107
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:12,160
This is our short break

108
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:14,173
They have to set up camp,

109
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:17,174
send in a drone, look
for the building plans.

110
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:20,880
We need to allow them some time
so the police can get organized.

111
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,840
Hey, why did Tokyo pretend that
you two are not together?

112
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:28,880
Because we're not.

113
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:34,946
Then why did I hear her headboard
thumping like a sledgehammer every night?

114
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:38,449
You think she might be learning to dance
the samba at 5 o'clock in the morning?

115
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:41,720
I have no fucking idea if she's dancing
samba or if she's a nervous sleeper.

116
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:48,085
Tell me, you think
I'm an asshole?

117
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,684
And that you can just
lie right to my face?

118
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:58,336
I'm joking.

119
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,520
I'd do the samba with her, too.

120
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,360
In fact, I might try.

121
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,837
I think you're mistaken.

122
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,467
I'm dead serious about her.

123
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:16,635
Dead serious?

124
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,578
You mean, serious like
plant a flower garden

125
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:23,484
and do household
chores on the weekends?

126
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:24,415
That's it.

127
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
And fill it with kids.

128
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:34,520
Sit down.

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,606
Look, kid,

130
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:47,111
women will give you
sex and fun because...

131
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,713
they're programmed to
be impregnated by you,

132
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:51,230
and bend your will.

133
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:53,473
After that, you're nonexistent.

134
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,802
During labor you'll realize that.

135
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,994
A birth is the biggest
event for a father.

136
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:01,047
During labor...

137
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:06,868
what you'll see between her legs is a
nuclear warhead that'll destroy all.

138
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:11,767
First, the wonderful cave
that you used to put your dick in

139
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:12,911
will never be the same.

140
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,387
And while she's curses your name

141
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,960
and asks for the
epidural, she'll shit herself.

142
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,426
Do you know what
she's telling you with that?

143
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,597
That she will no longer be sexy.

144
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,680
That from now on that fatso

145
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:32,150
will be the center of the universe.

146
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,487
They're all like that.

147
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,038
Take it from me,
with five divorces.

148
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,956
Do you know what
five divorces is?

149
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:45,080
Five times I thought I was in love.

150
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,320
What the fuck's going on in your head, man?

151
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:54,795
Huh?

152
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:58,040
So why did he put you in command?

153
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,160
For my sensitivity
toward people, of course.

154
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:12,354
Now take the little lamb
to one of the offices.

155
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:13,695
And don't leave her side,

156
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,673
even if she has to change her tampon.

157
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,757
Alright.

158
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,973
Okay, we need to be back
in 30 minutes. 30 minutes.

159
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:40,533
Excuse me.

160
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,408
Well, look, I uh...
I'm going for a quick jog,

161
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:52,443
to stretch my legs a bit.

162
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,501
Go ahead. Enjoy the view.

163
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Learning a language
is easier than it seems,

164
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,680
It's just a matter of semantics.

165
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:24,149
Come on.

166
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,881
Relax. I'm taking you somewhere
else so you can rest, that's all.

167
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,852
Raquel, all communications
from inside the building

168
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,542
must be done from that phone
or radio, no cell phones, alright?

169
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,520
Make the call right now,
I want to talk with the suspects.

170
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:50,716
Angel, what the hell
is Colonel Prieto doing here?

171
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,920
I don't know. I don't know.

172
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,240
There's some guys firing guns in the
same place where money is printed.

173
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,680
Don't you think that Intelligence
should be involved?

174
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:05,479
Raquel, we're making the call now.

175
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,674
Chief, phone call is going through.

176
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,770
Hello.

177
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:37,193
Good evening.

178
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:40,980
This is Raquel Murillo, the inspector
in charge of negotiations. Who are you?

179
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:43,173
The man in charge of the heist.

180
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,880
- He has a voice changer.
- Cleaning up the signal.

181
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,770
How are your colleagues doing?

182
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:54,531
At least as of now, we don't
have any casualties to report.

183
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,543
I'm glad.

184
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,040
Honestly, I'm glad.

185
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:05,960
Sorry, but your voice sounds strange.

186
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:09,064
Yes, my apologies for
this hideous metallic voice,

187
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,640
but you have to understand
that I must protect my identity,

188
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:15,456
unless you get us a helicopter
so we can go to Brazil.

189
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,112
That's what you need, a helicopter?

190
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:20,480
For now, what I want
is to is to negotiate

191
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:21,837
with someone who
doesn't waste time,

192
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,847
who doesn't have to
check with a supervisor, or

193
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,954
with Intelligence or even their
mother to get a yes or a no.

194
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,687
Then you should talk
directly with the president,

195
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,228
but since he's kind of busy
running the country right now,

196
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,003
I'll do my best to stand in
for him, if you don't mind.

197
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,347
Are there any other questions?

198
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:39,308
Yes.

199
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,000
What are you wearing?

200
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:47,508
What?

201
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:48,977
How are you dressed?

202
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Don't you think our clothes
say a lot about our personalities?

203
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,120
Look, I really don't mind
answering your questions,

204
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,966
but I think I should let you know

205
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,120
that this conversation is being
heard by several members

206
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,232
of UDEV, the UIT, the CNI

207
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:10,240
and their liaison office, the head
of the GEOs and several more officers.

208
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,840
In that case, I believe the polite
thing to do is to introduce ourselves.

209
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,179
Gentlemen, it is a pleasure

210
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,477
Forgive me for not giving you my name,
but you can call me Professor.

211
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,840
That's what everybody calls me.

212
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,983
Hello. I'm Angel, Deputy
Inspector of the Police Department.

213
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,840
Pleased to meet you, Angel.
How are you?

214
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,240
- Fine, good morning.
- Good morning.

215
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:37,879
Hello, how are you?

216
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,665
Very good. I'm well, thank
you for asking. And you?

217
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:45,240
Well, this was a touching moment.

218
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,320
Tell me,

219
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,303
what do you want?

220
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:49,800
Time...

221
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,400
to try to set things straight.

222
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:54,918
Listen, Madam Inspector.

223
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,055
It was a matter of seconds
for us to be able to flee,

224
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,827
but we are perfectly prepared
to defend ourselves, so

225
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:02,605
try to avoid any
type of intervention.

226
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:06,686
Can I trust you?

227
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:08,440
Yes, of course.

228
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:13,310
But in order for me to trust you,
you must give me something.

229
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:17,308
Let those school kids go,
they're minors.

230
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:18,760
It will go a lot easier.

231
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,000
But, Inspector, you haven't yet
told me what you are wearing.

232
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:30,749
I have on a light grey
suit, with a blue shirt,

233
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,437
high heeled black boots and...

234
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:36,864
Well, I think that's
enough for now, don't you?

235
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,669
I can imagine you much better.

236
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,022
But, Inspector, a women's suit
comes with a pair of slacks or a skirt,

237
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,422
so when I ask you about your
clothing next time, please be

238
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,680
a bit more specific.

239
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:52,774
I'll think about your request.

240
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,156
Al right, what kind of nut-job
holding 60 hostages

241
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:01,976
plays games with his negotiator?

242
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,099
No, he's way too
calm to be a nut-job.

243
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:13,060
I want a helicopter flying
above his head, 24/7!

244
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,483
There will be no food, water or
any other requests. Is that clear?

245
00:18:16,702 --> 00:18:17,880
Excuse me, Inspector.

246
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,782
I don't think they'll surrender just
because you took away their dessert.

247
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:25,080
The head of the GEOs, and I believe

248
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:27,960
what we need now is an
immediate intervention.

249
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,003
If they had wanted a disaster
like the one they had in Moscow,

250
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,000
they'd have called you directly,

251
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,728
but unfortunately you're only here
to bust everyone's balls, aren't you.

252
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:41,245
Please, Inspector, don't
get defensive about it

253
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:42,560
I'm here to help you.

254
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,960
I know you're going
through a rough patch.

255
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:49,396
If you're referring to menstruation, that's
not it, but thanks for asking anyway.

256
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm referring to the complaint of
domestic violence against your ex-husband.

257
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:03,820
Wow, great Intelligence job.

258
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,600
There's not one asshole you
won't stick your nose in, is there?

259
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:09,654
Internal Affairs does it's job.

260
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:12,920
In fact, they believe
your complaint is not valid.

261
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,585
Your ex-husband has rebuilt his life

262
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,058
privately and professionally at the force.

263
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,960
But some women just can't let go

264
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:26,707
Look, I don't know if
you're just a pig or...

265
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:28,760
it's simply your method.

266
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,240
If anyone's interested
in my private affairs,

267
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:36,365
well then, I'd like to let you know
that the matter has been dealt with

268
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:37,788
and now it's up to a judge.

269
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,656
I want to thank you for
your concern, colonel.

270
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,159
Incoming call on the museum's relay.

271
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,400
- Record it.
- Yes, we're recording.

272
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,034
Turn up the volume. Silence, please!

273
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,201
Honey, I can't make it.

274
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,488
How come you're
not coming for dinner?

275
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:00,411
I'm working.

276
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:02,381
Explain to your mother and sister.

277
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:04,472
- I can't believe you're not coming.

278
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:06,660
Give my apologies. Please, believe me.

279
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:09,440
Don't give me grief, sweetheart.
I'll be there as quick as I can.

280
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:10,455
Almansa!

281
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,676
I need to go now. I love you
very much. I'll see you soon, okay.

282
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,160
Drop it.

283
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,360
It was Almansa.

284
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:52,861
Why did you take me here?

285
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,182
It's okay.

286
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:02,951
They sent me to protect you.

287
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,180
That's all.

288
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,267
Take your clothes off,
put on the red overalls.

289
00:21:09,774 --> 00:21:10,219
All right.

290
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:44,790
If everything goes south?

291
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,448
What if the plan fails?

292
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:47,760
Well, puppy dog,

293
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,240
same as always: back to the can,

294
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,193
cigarette in the courtyard,
four shrimp for Christmas,

295
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:55,856
personal visits,
shower once a week.

296
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,484
That sounds cool.

297
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:59,592
The fucked up thing
is, if it goes well,

298
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:00,741
what do we do
with all that money?

299
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,334
Look, I'm getting a Maserati,

300
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,055
color: clear sky blue.

301
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,033
- I can see it.
- And a martial arts studio.

302
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:09,359
Why not.

303
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:11,829
And a nightclub, but
a three story nightclub

304
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:13,840
With huge speakers that
will make your ears bleed.

305
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,377
- Boom, boom, pam, pim pam pum.
- Okay, yeah. There you go.

306
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:20,126
- For him, three million is enough.
- And for you, new lungs,

307
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:22,008
because you fucked them
up working in the mine.

308
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:24,560
You're going to spend all
your money on a pair of lungs, huh?

309
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:26,080
Come on, enough already.

310
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,480
And can you tell us where the hell
you're getting those lungs?

311
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,907
There's people that sell kidneys.
There must be people that sell lungs.

312
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,720
As for me... a winery in Provence.

313
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:39,525
A 250 acre vineyard
to make my own wine,

314
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:43,128
oak casks...

315
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,180
yeah, but...

316
00:22:44,352 --> 00:22:47,600
you can just go to the grocery store
and buy any bottle of wine you want.

317
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:49,559
Why go through
all that hassle?

318
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:51,120
For the art.

319
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:55,312
As for me, I want an island.

320
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,560
- Get more than one.
- Yeah, get three.

321
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:02,160
- Three is a crowd.
- Oh, yeah, like an archipelago.

322
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:05,429
No, I want a tiny island
with a huge house,

323
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:07,805
with a balcony overlooking the sea.

324
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:11,600
So I just get up from bed
and jump in the water.

325
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,880
At last someone with some brains.

326
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:16,320
Yeah, well I think some
of us need to pay off

327
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,632
a few outstanding debts first.

328
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:20,400
Well, I do, at least.

329
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:23,793
And with whatever's
left, a plane.

330
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:25,909
So I can fly it.

331
00:23:26,063 --> 00:23:27,535
Why not have
a pilot who's hot?

332
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,815
No, you don't get it,
I want to have fun

333
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,200
with the control tower, so I could say;
everybody clear the runway

334
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,415
because this lady is landing.

335
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:38,027
Even if you were to buy all
those things you could imagine,

336
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:39,674
at an expensive price.

337
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:41,943
Let's say the most lavish,

338
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:46,280
Even then, you would have
lots of money left over.

339
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,080
If we're stealing huge,

340
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,519
then think huge.

341
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:54,480
Well, I'd record a music
album, the corridos.

342
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:56,580
With this face on the cover.

343
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,520
Like Bertín Osborne,
but 60 pounds heavier.

344
00:24:02,427 --> 00:24:05,927
That Bertín, he sings
rancheras, I said corridos,

345
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:06,960
it's completely different music.

346
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,200
Show them what a
corrido is, papa. Come on.

347
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:10,324
No way man, no.

348
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,880
- Come on!
- Come on, man.

349
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:14,315
- But you love them.
- You've all been drinking too much.

350
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,094
- We want a song.
- We want a song.

351
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,840
Because I didn't have your lips
I cried for the first time

352
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,640
And I cursed knowing you
to not stop loving you

353
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,911
I wanted to make you my wife

354
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,996
I looked for luck loveless

355
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,113
I took out my gun

356
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:43,200
And fate brought death

357
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,087
María, my life, my love

358
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:52,678
I won't stop loving you

359
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:56,320
I lost you due to bullets

360
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,880
You won't see me again.

361
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:22,120
Stand up.

362
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:25,400
Come on, come on.

363
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,677
Take off your masks.

364
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:34,503
Come on, let's see those faces.

365
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:37,720
Behave.

366
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:42,870
Listen, something unexpected happened.

367
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:45,280
And in spite of those helicopters,

368
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:48,086
I know for a fact they're
giving us a few hours of a truce

369
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,920
so you'll be able to rest.

370
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:53,400
In a few minutes we'll
distribute some sleeping bags,

371
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:57,760
water and a sandwich.
And I want to ask you a favor.

372
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,640
Take your clothes off.

373
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:05,952
I want to give you a red
overall just like this one

374
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,360
so you're more comfortable.

375
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,071
Excuse me, sir,
I don't mean to bother you.

376
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,100
But there's some of the folks here
who have things like heart conditions,

377
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:18,280
ladies who are pregnant,
diabetics, and even teenagers...

378
00:26:19,918 --> 00:26:22,981
I beg you, please, let
the most vulnerable go.

379
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:25,682
I don't think they can withstand
this anguish all night long.

380
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,040
- Who do you think you are, fucking Gandhi?
- Relax Denver,

381
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:33,120
He's a friend of mine.
We share a fondness for movies.

382
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:44,354
Here, take the gun.

383
00:26:46,102 --> 00:26:48,272
I'm not asking you, I'm
ordering you to take the gun.

384
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:51,476
Go ahead, take the gun from
me. Take the gun from me.

385
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,480
- Now point it at me.
- No, please.

386
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,620
I said for you to point the gun at me.

387
00:26:59,454 --> 00:27:01,455
It's a fucking order.
Point the gun at me.

388
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,840
Here. Alright.

389
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:04,525
Now, shoot me.

390
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,693
- What?
- I said, shoot me.

391
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,800
- Shoot me.
- Please.

392
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,640
- No, please!
- Either you shoot me

393
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,479
or I'll shoot you. You got ten seconds.

394
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:16,920
One, two, three, four, five,

395
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,280
six, seven, eight...

396
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,501
They're fake, Arturito,
but you did great.

397
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:31,180
You did great. It's a
gift, you can keep it.

398
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,120
Now we're going to
distribute some fake guns.

399
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,786
In a few hours we'll be
needing your cooperation.

400
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,260
And, as you've seen, the only
thing you need to do is obey.

401
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:45,656
So just trust us... and obey.

402
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,480
Why are you all still dressed?

403
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:51,389
Come on.

404
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:02,960
What are you wearing?

405
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,837
Raquel, neither walkies,
cellphones, or electronic devices.

406
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:09,401
We haven't been able to trace
any radio frequencies from inside.

407
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:12,335
You're saying that they're
communicating with a cup and a string

408
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,640
- so we can't trace them?
- I have no ideaif it's a cup

409
00:28:14,665 --> 00:28:17,360
or they're deaf-mutes, but we
haven't found any radio frequencies.

410
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,853
What the hell are those
armored cars doing here?

411
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,320
We're going to enter, right now.

412
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,498
Only if I give the order.

413
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,656
I'm in charge and
I haven't done that.

414
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,158
We got the orders, ma'am.

415
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:35,062
I'd like someone to tell me
what the fuck is going on here

416
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:37,389
or should I personally call
the Minister of Interior?

417
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:42,044
What the fuck is going on?

418
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,914
In there is a top priority person.

419
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:55,958
Do you know
what top priority is?

420
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:59,840
No. I don't belong to your Intelligence
gang, so I don't know what that means.

421
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,090
They will go in.

422
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:04,251
They will go in because
we have our little lamb.

423
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,440
Alison Parker.

424
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:11,008
The daughter of Mr. Benjamin Parker,
the United Kingdom's ambassador

425
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,880
and close friend of
the Queen of England.

426
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,135
That's why we have no
other choice but to enter,

427
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,103
because, if we don't do it now,
tomorrow the whole country will know.

428
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:20,802
They'll think we're not aware.

429
00:30:21,915 --> 00:30:25,523
They'll think they successfully kept
all this information from the public.

430
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,149
Today she's just
another hostage,

431
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,206
but tomorrow she'll
be their main target and

432
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:32,440
all the guns will be
pointed at her head.

433
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:34,261
Is that what you want? Huh?

434
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:38,176
That's why, on
the first night,

435
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,480
they'll come in. And
they'll do it before 4:15.

436
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:44,796
Because at 6:30 the sun rises.

437
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,568
Can you imagine what
it would mean for Spain

438
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,899
a hostage crisis
negotiated by the UK?

439
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,853
And it's best they come
in without much thought

440
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:54,334
then our chances of winning

441
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:56,800
are improved greatly.

442
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,221
Inspector Murillo,
we're going in now

443
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,480
and we're bringing
that girl out alive.

444
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:29,871
Hey.

445
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:33,168
- I have to talk to you...
- Quiet.

446
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,321
I promise.

447
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:35,838
Shut up, or they'll kill us.

448
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,875
Sorry.

449
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,691
Apparently, you don't
like your boss, do you?

450
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,400
How do you know he's my boss?

451
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:06,488
Because I know everything about you.

452
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:08,324
I studied.

453
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:12,878
And, I saw the pregnancy test on your desk.

454
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,720
And now it's easy to imagine the father.

455
00:32:21,395 --> 00:32:22,715
He didn't like the idea?

456
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:27,292
What did he say?

457
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:28,779
He doesn't want the hassle?

458
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,005
It's not easy to let it go.

459
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:48,050
What are you going to do?

460
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:54,600
Abort it.

461
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:15,360
Intervention units 1, 2 and 3, be ready.

462
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,192
- We're going in.
- Go, go, go!

463
00:33:18,911 --> 00:33:20,800
Teams 1, 2 and 3, on my go.

464
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,738
Do it.

465
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,640
Team 1, barricade the main entrance.

466
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,773
Watch the rooftop and the higher flanks.

467
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:52,400
Yes?

468
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:53,491
Berlin,

469
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,931
- They're coming.
- On our way.

470
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,699
People, it's time!

471
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:04,487
The time to follow my orders has come!

472
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,850
Come with us.

473
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:24,830
And that's how the nation's security forces

474
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,792
did exactly what the
Professor told us they'd do,

475
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,063
but when he told us that afternoon,

476
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,279
we were out in the country,

477
00:34:31,646 --> 00:34:35,068
not a single one of us was thinking
about getting a bullet in the head.

478
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:37,795
They'll try to come in
through these four places:

479
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,673
the main entrance,
the loading zone,

480
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:42,521
the emergency exit and rooftop.

481
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:44,415
Cover all the doors in the back.

482
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,543
Don't let anyone out.

483
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,208
But they'll wait.
They'll wait...

484
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:53,440
for the tactical team to set up
surveillance and assess the area inside.

485
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,040
They'll do that from the loading zone.

486
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,673
Come on, come on, come on.

487
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,804
Come on, they're already at the door.

488
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:33,760
You ready?

489
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:36,800
Get me eyes on the room.

490
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,880
Your masks on.

491
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,680
Raquel, there's an incoming call
from one of the hostage's cellphones,

492
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
Alison Parker.

493
00:35:55,994 --> 00:35:57,098
Turn up the volume.

494
00:35:57,452 --> 00:35:59,243
We have another listener on the phone.

495
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,989
I'm not a listener.
I'm a hostage and I've been kidnapped.

496
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,480
My name is Alison Parker. I'm
the daughter of the UK ambassador.

497
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:08,143
They're airing this live.

498
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,520
I'm making this call right
now from inside the Royal Mint.

499
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:12,209
Drop that call immediately! Now!

500
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:15,280
- I said drop the call!
- Drop the call!

501
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
They've dressed us up
just like the kidnappers.

502
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,750
Colonel, we have a visual on the interior.

503
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,307
What the hell is that?

504
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,720
They made us wear the
same masks, and gave us guns.

505
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:34,320
- Zoom in. Right there.
- Nobody knows who is who.

506
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,651
It's a mounted
Browning machine gun.

507
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:38,158
Those motherfuckers.

508
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,480
If the police come in,
they're gonna shoot.

509
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,175
They're entrenched
with the hostages.

510
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,345
They're all dressed
the same way.

511
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,201
It's impossible to know
who they're firing at.

512
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,480
- Don't do it.
- Stop this.

513
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:50,300
Stop it!

514
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,326
- Don't come in.
- Call it off.

515
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,089
Abandon all positions. Aborting operation.

516
00:37:20,392 --> 00:37:21,352
Inspector...

517
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:25,236
Finish what you started, colonel.

518
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,120
I don't want to have
anything to do with this.

519
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:45,149
And that's how we won our first battle
on our first night,

520
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:48,908
without engaging in combat
and with common sense.

521
00:37:50,254 --> 00:37:51,654
And 20 minutes later...

522
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,300
we started doing what we came to do.

523
00:37:56,346 --> 00:37:58,584
Alright, now the
best part starts,

524
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:00,330
we begin the work.

525
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
With me:

526
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:06,640
Torres, Sánchez, Biesma,

527
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,320
Lennon,

528
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Guatsani,

529
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:12,800
Molina, García,

530
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,760
Domingo, De Gora, Mateo.

531
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,040
Go on, up there.

532
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,074
Molla, Pérez.

533
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,200
Let's go.

534
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:30,900
Now then, I want to see
these machines working 24/7

535
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,646
I want it to feel like
we're in a techno rave.

536
00:38:33,737 --> 00:38:36,047
Chicka booh. Chicka booh.
Chicka booh. Chicka booh.

537
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:39,800
Each time we stop, we lose
half a million, you got that.

538
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,806
We'll make technical corrections
every three hours,

539
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:44,277
ink and offset, as well.

540
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,000
It's a party. I say have fun and enjoy it.

541
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:55,316
The best paid job in history:

542
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:58,379
2,400 billion euros, maybe more.

543
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,466
It'll depend on how
long we can hold the fort.

544
00:39:02,678 --> 00:39:06,579
Oh my god! This is so wonderful, dude!

545
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:09,691
This is incredible!

546
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,916
Our money, dudes!

547
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:14,611
This is our money!

548
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:38,031
Can I get a decaf, please?

549
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,613
Hello. This is Mariví's
answering machine.

550
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,399
Leave a message after the beep.

551
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:51,068
Mom, I've just finished, it's six am...

552
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,898
Excuse me, do you have a
cellphone charger on hand?

553
00:39:59,031 --> 00:39:59,926
No, sorry.

554
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,323
You want to use mine?

555
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,091
Really? You don't mind?

556
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:13,640
- No. No.
- Are you sure?

557
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:16,120
Thanks.

558
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,981
I have to make a few calls.

559
00:40:19,596 --> 00:40:21,219
- That's all right.
- Thanks again.
