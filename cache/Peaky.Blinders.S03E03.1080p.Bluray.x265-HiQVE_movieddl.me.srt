he goes off again.

He wanted to see people

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,120
ARTHUR: I know what we can do.

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,560
We get the guns out, John.

163
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,560
We go outside,
and we shoot some fucking pheasants.

164
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,120
(BOTH LAUGH)

165
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,600
-That's what the bosses do, isn't it?
-Yeah.

166
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
Fuck off, Arthur.

167
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,960
Fuck you just say to me?

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,400
I didn't ask for separate meetings
today, all right?

169
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,120
No. No, what the fuck did you just say?

170
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,960
'Cause I didn't fucking hear you right.

171
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
I didn't ask for separate meetings
today, all right?

172
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,560
Fucking pheasant.

173
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,520
-Carl!
-(LAUGHS)

174
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,520
You can't say things like that.

175
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,760
Now look what you've done.

176
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,600
All right, brothers.

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
It's just the fucking whisky talking.

178
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,400
I don't ask to be protected, all right?

179
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,040
POLLY: Right. Shut up.
The pair of you, sit down!

180
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,360
Sit down!

181
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,520
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Look around you.

182
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,080
And look at this house.

183
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,960
Look where we are.

184
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,320
Look how far we've come.

185
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,480
I think it's about time
we all started acting

186
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,760
in a way more appropriate
to our station.

187
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,240
We're none of us bin men any more,
Arthur.

188
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,520
Tommy needs us all together.

189
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
I'd like to propose a toast.

190
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
(CLEARS THROAT)

-(DOOR OPENS)
-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

193
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,960
Tommy's gone. Swear to God,
he's in a wagon with Johnny Dogs.

194
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Shit.

195
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
This is what he does now.

196
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,160
ARTHUR: Tommy! Wait!
POLLY: Arthur!

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,880
ARTHUR: Tommy!
POLLY: Arthur, let him go!

198
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,520
ARTHUR: Tommy! Tommy!

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
Tommy!

200
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
Walk on. Walk on.

201
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,400
JOHNNY: Tommy.
TOMMY: Walk on.

202
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
They're coming out in the drive.

203
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,240
-You're not gonna tell them?
-Tell them what?

204
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,440
That we're going to Wales.

205
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I left a note.

206
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,840
Did you tell them
why we're going to Wales?

207
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,960
No.

208
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,160
At some point you're gonna tell me
why we're going to Wales?

209
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,640
Yeah, when we get there.

210
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,480
TOMMY: Walk on.

211
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,360
Should have brought
at least one woman, Tommy.

212
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,520
Johnny, it's a woman we're going to see.

213
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,920
-There, boy. Walk on. Walk on.
-Right.

214
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,680
Says he'll be back in Birmingham
in three days.

215
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,400
POLLY: (SIGHS) Let him go.

216
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,240
The important thing is,
if he says he'll be back, he'll be back.

217
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,040
Come on.
Let's go light a fire in the big room.

218
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,120
Let's go drink whisky, with water.

219
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,400
See to the horses, Johnny.

220
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,040
Aye, Tom.

(SIGHS)

222
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,200
So we'll go out through Meridian,
then into the Black Mountains.

223
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,440
-Here.
-(YELLS)

224
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,920
Here, give me some.

Here you go.

227
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,960
Now, remember last night
when you asked after Mama?

228
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,080
She's gone, Charlie, and there's
a few things we need to get straight.

229
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,320
There's her photographs.

230
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,880
There's her clothes.

231
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,960
I'll keep things the way they are
in the room. (CLEARS THROAT)

232
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,800
Just keep things the way they are.

233
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,280
Here you go.

234
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,440
Yeah. Here you go.

235
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,840
I'm not much good, Charlie.

236
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
-(CHARLIE EXCLAIMS)
-You'll find that out soon enough.

237
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,120
She's not gonna be coming back,
so it's just you and me.

238
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,560
She'll be with us in our hearts
'cause we love her.

239
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,200
-JOHNNY: Tommy.
-Yeah.

240
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,080
This fucking horse of yours
won't come to me.

241
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,080
-All right, I'll be there. All right.
-Huh? Come on.

242
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,920
That was her favourite horse, Charlie,

243
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,680
and he's been all over the place
since she's gone.

244
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,320
-Tom?
-Yeah, you watch him.

245
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
I will. Oh, yeah.

246
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Huh?

247
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,480
All right, now cock it with your thumb.

You boys are fucking crazy men.

256
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,720
-Yeah, but you feel it, though, right?
-Yeah.

257
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,320
You feel it.

258
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,760
Yeah, you can feel the power.

259
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Now, squeeze it.

-Piss off, John.

on his arse all day wanna fire a gun?

Look at that face.

But you won't feel nothing

00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,680
until you point that thing on a man.

274
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,640
So do it.

275
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,440
There you go, young boss.

There you go. Now you feel it.

How does it feel, Michael, huh?

282
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,240
Better than having a pen
in your hand, isn't it?

283
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,160
More like having your cock in your hand.
Yeah.

Yeah, it is.

285

Michael, you fucking watch
that Webley don't jump. You know that?

290
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
When you pull that fucking trigger,

291
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,960
and the body of the man you shot
wraps itself around your ankles,

-they pile up.

where you can't walk in a room

without bringing
a load of them with you.

Polly, we're just
educating the boss here

one our side of the business.

299
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,200
Michael, get in the house.

300
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,360
I'm not a fucking kid any more.

You've come to tell me it's cancel led.

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,720
No, why would it be?

305
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,880
I read the papers.

-This is business.
-It won't work.

307
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,480
I told your brother,
this whole fucking plan won't work.

If Tommy wants to keep this secret...
Tell him.

309
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,080
There was a woman in a fur coat
walking through here in broad daylight

310
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,280
like the Queen of fucking Sheba
asking about armoured cars.

311
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,040
During a period of grieving,
some things were allowed to slip.

312
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,440
We know the woman.
We're dealing with it.

313
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,440
Now, take a look at this list.

314
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
These are all the men
who work the night shift

315
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,120
who are members
of the South Birmingham Communist Party.

316
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,760
You've got six weeks. Sack them all.

317
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,000
Are you fucking mad?

318
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,040
He is.

319
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah.

320
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,160
Every factory in the city
will come out on strike.

321
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,520
So? You find reasons.

322
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,480
You set them up.

323
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
You sack them.

324
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
Look at the list again.

325
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,400
Are there any communists on your shift
who aren't on the list?

326
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,560
No.

327
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Please don't fucking lie to us.

328
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,960
-Who's missing?
-I don't know.

329
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,680
Emmanuel Hunter.

330
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Hmm?

331
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,040
Convener, deputy treasurer,
Sparkhill Communist Party.

332
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,560
Lathe operator to you.

333
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,760
I didn't know he was a communist.

334
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,000
We left that name
off the list on purpose.

335
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,360
See if you could be trusted.

336
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
You can't be trusted.

337
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,640
Look, I'm just a working man.

338
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,280
JOHN: We're gonna be watching you.

339
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,280
-Watching your fucking house.
-I've got kids.

340
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,280
Ethan and John.

341
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,280
Just get them sacked

342
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,560
as they appear on the list, two a week.

343
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,440
The last one before
the clocks go forward.

344
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,080
Is that a yes or a no?

345
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,560
-Yes.
-Thank you.

346
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
-(METAL CLANKING)
-(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

347
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,680
Good.

348
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,560
Good.

349
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,680
-Do you think he'll return?
-Tommy?

350
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,760
He'll always come back.

351
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
You speak differently when you talk...

352
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
I prefer to talk about other things.

353
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
Let me see.

354
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,160
What books do you like?

355
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,280
Riding, flower arranging, embroidery?

356
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
You'd be surprised of the things I know.

357
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,080
You'd also be surprised
of the things I don't know.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,280
What could you possibly not know?

359
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,880
I wasn't educated.

360
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,240
-At all.
-What is there to learn, after all?

361
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Goodness.

362
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm sorry. You must need a rest.

363
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,200
Do you tell your friends
you're painting a gangster?

364
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,120
Is that the fun in all of this?

365
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,600
In truth, I don't have any friends.

366
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,080
I knew everyone through my wife.

367
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,920
When she died...

368
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,840
Well...

369
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
Look, Polly,

370
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,320
my motivation for doing this is twofold.

371
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,040
Firstly, you have a face
full of contradictions,

372
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,800
and it's a challenge
to capture them in one expression.

373
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,000
-(SCOFFS)
-That's the sales pitch.

374
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,720
The second motivation is that
I am planning to seduce you eventually

375
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,200
and, please God, sleep with you.

376
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,240
How would that please God?

377
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,280
Please me.

378
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,080
And stop.

379
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,920
And he didn't say what he wants.

380
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
When he was drunk, he said absolution.

381
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,800
Other than that, nothing.

382
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Thank you for your time, Madame Boswell.

383
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,920
I heard someone shot your wife.

384
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,600
If you're looking for soldiers,
our men are all up at Apple by.

385
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,560
I have no need for soldiers.

386
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,080
It's not why I came here.

387
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
What do you think?

388
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,040
You're selling?

389
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,280
Giving.

390
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,640
-Why?
-Would you take it?

391
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,760
I'd take it.

392
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,680
Would you wear it?

393
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
-Why would I not?
-That's my question.

394
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,800
My wife was wearing it
the night she was shot,

395
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,320
and I lie awake at night
at 4:00 in the fucking morning,

396
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,800
and I blame myself for her death.

397
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,400
I pushed some people too far.

398
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,760
You want me to tell you
this jewel is cursed,

399
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,600
and then her death won't be
all your fault.

400
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,520
If I believed in the priests,

401
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,520
I would confess and ask for forgiveness,

402
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,760
but all I have is you, Madame Boswell.

403
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,760
I have a son.

404
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,680
I have a business.

405
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,800
I need to get some sleep.

406
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
It is cursed.

407
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,440
I feel its curse
burning through my heart.

408
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,280
Bless you, Tommy Shelby.

409
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,400
You'll have good fortune from now on.

410
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,920
-The business is done?
-It's done.

411
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,720
You're not going to give me
one fucking clue what that was about?

412
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,840
All religion is a foolish answer
to a foolish question.

413
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,440
What does that mean?

414
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,920
Go and get Charlie from the camp.

415
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
He'll have learned enough
bad habits by now.

416
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,920
You can drop us to the train station.

417
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,400
And Johnny boy, if I were you,

418
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,880
I'd come back here tonight later on.

419
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,680
It's gonna be
one hell of a big fucking party.

420

MAN: The day and date on your ticket.

421
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,920
If you can't read, find someone who can.

422
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,440
Tickets for sailings other than today's
will be destroyed.

423
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,280
He has people all over the docks.

424
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,400
If it's going to happen,
it will happen now.

425
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,000
We'll be all right.

426
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,280
Why don't these Irish
fill in their papers in advance?

427
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,320

Is that the lad I used to teach?
John Shelby, I smacked your arse.

438
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,480
Let him go.

439
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,320
-Please. Please, let her go.
-Arthur?

How many times I looked the other way
because of your sweet smile.

I said, let him go. He's coming with us.

Not until I know my wife is safe.

443
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,600
She's safe. We're not going to harm her.

444
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Let's just get a move on.

445

Look, we're disobeying Tommy's orders
just by talking to you.

Don't push it, please.

-Come with us. Let him go.
-AUDREY: Let him go, too.

448

He can do you no harm from New York.

450
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,320
I can't do that, Mrs Changretta.
I can't do that. Sorry.

-No!
-Listen to me!

00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,320
which my wife will never hear again.

482
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,440
Now, I'm gonna have to choose carefully

483
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,240
which part of you I cut away first.

484
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
Open your eyes.

485
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,560
Open your eyes,
or I will cut away your fucking eyelids!

486
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,080
Now look at me.

487
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,880
Look at me.

488
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,320
This is the end.

489
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,880
This is the end.

490
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,160
It was your tongue that gave the order.

491
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,040
I'll take your tongue first.

492
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,520
Then I'll take your ears.

493
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,280
Then I'll take your fingers.

494
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,480
Then your fucking toes.

495
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,280
See, I take your balls first,
you drain too fast like you fuckers do.

496
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,280
No, I think tongue first. Tongue first.

497
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,240
(MUFFLED GROANING)

498
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Tongue first.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

500
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,400
If I take your tongue,
you won't be able to explain,

501
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,960
and I want you to explain.
I want you to fucking explain.

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,840

505
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I forget who I am.

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,120
I forget who I am.

I'll take your fucking eyes first!

509
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,760
I heard the blackbird sing.

510
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,360
And we let his wife
board the immigrant ship to New York.

511
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,520
We didn't kill Mrs Changretta.

00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,520
Did you do what was on your list, Ada?

522
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
You and your fucking lists.

523
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,680
Did you?

524
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,680
I spoke to an old friend of Freddie's.

525
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,440
He's a Communist Party candidate
for Basall Heath.

526
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,360
I asked him about the Birmingham branch
of the National Vigilance Committee.

527
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,840
He said he'd heard the Soviet Embassy
was getting information from the inside.

528
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,760
And? Has he got a name?

529
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,560
Yes.

530
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,880
But just promise me
no one will get killed.

531
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,560
Ada, it'll be me or John or Arthur
who gets killed

532
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,200
if you don't give me the fucking name.

533
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,240
There's someone ahead of us,
and I need to know why.

534
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,920
James Monkland.

535
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,000
He's a Lloyds underwriter.
He's got an office on Curzon Street.

536
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,320
Tommy, for fuck's sake,
who is it that's ahead of you?

537
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,880
I knew I could count on you, Ada.

538
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,240
No, you can't,
and I just asked you a fucking question.

539
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,200
And I notice
you started wearing lipstick again.

00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,040
So what?

542
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,120
I got bored.

543
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,240
You can change what you do,
but you can't change what you want.

544
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,320
And what is it that I want?

545
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,440
There's gonna be a vacancy coming up
at Shelby Company Limited.

Boston office.

Boston, America?

548
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,080
Lipstick. Clothes from Paris.

549
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,240
No revolvers. All legal.

550
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,400
Just turn a few heads.
Do the transit deals.

551
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,880
James Monkland, right?

552
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,360
Good night, Ada.

00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,440
-James Monkland?
-Yours, sir.

What do you want with me?

556
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,240
You've been passing information
about a robbery

557
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
at the Lanchester factory in Sparkbrook.

558
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,680
Are you Tommy Shelby?

559
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,720
I need to know the name of the person
in the organisation

560
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,200
that was giving you information.

561
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,200
What organisation?

562
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,920
The Economic League,
the Vigilance Committee,

563
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,760
the Odd Fellows, Section D.

564
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,200
They have many fucking names.

565
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,520
Shit, shit, shit.

566
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,400
Give me the name of the informant.

567

568
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,200
they are very, very dangerous people.

00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,240
Oh. Hmm.

570
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,520
Well, fortunately, so are we.

You have to choose
who you're more afraid of.

The Peaky Blinders at exactly 11 :43,

573
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,480
or Section D at some point
in the future.

574
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,880
If you make the wrong choice,
you won't see 11 :44.

575
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,000
LINDA: Do they always have to do
the stock taking at night, Arthur?

576
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,360
ARTHUR: Only 'cause, you know,
it slows down production.

00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
Yeah.

583
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,680
I know.

584
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,840
We've spoken about it.

585
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,720
I was gonna wait until you had
a strong cup of tea in your hand.

586
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,120
-Come on, then.
-But I'm gonna have a baby, Arthur.

Yeah.

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,720
You said you spent the night
taking stock. Well, so did I.

590

-Yes, I am.

644
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,480
I am curious.
What was your father's profession?

645
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,760
Well, he told fortunes,
and he stole horses.

646
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,080
Often, he would tell a man
that his horse would be stolen,

647
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,680
and they would marvel at his powers
when it was.

648
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,560
Before we eat, should we say grace?

649
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,600
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

650
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,840
-Amen.
-I'm not here to eat.

651
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,160
I'm here to do business.

652
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,240
What I have to say can be said
before the main course.

653
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,000
Then I will leave you all
to your evening.

654
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,880
Grand Duchess, I must apologise
for the bad manners of my compatriot.

655
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,200
This is a report on the mission's
progress so far. (CLEARS THROAT)

656
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,680
I've made only one copy for security.

657
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,440
Who should I give it to?

658
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,120
My husband
is in charge of this operation.

659
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,480
But since there will no doubt
be vodka later,

660
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,080
perhaps you should give it to me
for safe-keeping.

661
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,000
Speak, Mr Shelby, while we eat.

662
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,800
Five factory foremen on our payroll
have begun a campaign of victimisation

663
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,520
against communist workers
in five factories across Birmingham.

664
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,040
Anger amongst the workers will grow,
but we will control it.

665
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,040
On the night of June 21 st,

666
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,800
a general strike will be called
across the city.

667
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,760
Protests will develop into riots,

668
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,320
and all police that are not
already under our control will be busy.

669
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,040
The city will be paralysed.

670
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,360
So how will you move the train?

671
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,360
We have two locomotive drivers

672
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,400
who've been allocated to drive
the midnight goods train to London.

673
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,760
The armoured vehicles will be waiting
on flatbeds.

674
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,720
-And ammunition?
-The ammunition...

675
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,880
I have to say
that this soup is exceptional.

676
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,920
Absolutely delicious.

677
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,680
Ammunition, incendiaries will already
have been packed up and crated

678
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,280
for transport to Istanbul.

679
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,480
-And how long to London?
-The train won't reach London.

680
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,640
All the goods will be unloaded
at a coal yard at St Albans

681
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,880
and put onto Shelby Company trucks.

682
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,840
From there, they will go directly
to the Poplar Docks.

683
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,360
You Highness, if you're having
difficulty understanding his accent,

684
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,800
then I can go through the plan with you
at a later date.

685
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,840
If there is no ship waiting for my men,

686
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,680
all goods will be dumped into the sea
before first light.

687
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,120
What happens when they discover
the armoured cars are missing?

688
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,360
During the rioting, the
Lanchester factory will be firebombed.

689
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,960
A scrap metal dealer of my acquaintance
will declare

690
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,200
that all the armoured vehicles
are in the wreckage

691
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,040
and should be written off as salvage.

692
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,320
No one will know
that they are in your possession.

693
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,040
We formulated this plan
when we met at Birmingham.

694
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,640
I'm certain that
nothing has been overlooked.

695
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,880
This is the amount of extra expense
I believe I will incur

696
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,720
for trucks and fuels.

697
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,440
I trust you will respond in kind.

698
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,960
But of course, Mr Shelby.

699
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,960
Before I go,

700
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,600
I would like it known
that I'm unable to swallow food

701
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,040
in the same room as this priest.

702
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,760
Enjoy your evening.

703
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,040
Tatiana, see Mr Shelby to his car.

704
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,520
Yes.

705
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,440
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

706
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,640
Walk with me.

707
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,440
The priest is passing information
about the robbery

708
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,200
to a Lloyds underwriter called Monkland.

709
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,880
He, in turn, is passing information
to the Soviet Embassy.

710
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,920
You want him dead?
I'll kill him, no charge.

711
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,760
Why would the priest
pass information to our enemies?

712
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,480
I'm being paid to act and to observe,
like a soldier.

713
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,520
The complexities are your business.

714
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,320
Go and speak to Izabella.
I trust her to decide.

715
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,360
You were able to contain your business
dealings even after what happened.

716
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,640
Perhaps you didn't love her.

717
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,400
She's here by my side,

718
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,920
and she says,
"Don't trust these people."

719
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,240
Now give me permission
to kill the priest.

720
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,680
