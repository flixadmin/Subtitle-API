[Oliver] <i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,630
<i>After five years in hell,
I returned home with only one goal,</i>

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,509
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,847
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,307
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,685
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,895
[Oliver]<i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

10
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,481
Promise me that you'll be his father.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,733
I promise.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,193
William blames me for Samantha's death.

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,613
{\an8}Now, you don't have to like me.
I'm your dad.

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,908
{\an8}I'm gonna be there for you,
whether you want me to be or not.

15
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,330
[groans]

16
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,833
[John]<i>Curtis and Lance took Rene
to Dr. Schwartz for treatment.</i>

17
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,003
Saw you take the shot at that merc,
never seen you miss.

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,504
Turn on Channel 52, right now.

19
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,299
{\an8}[newsreader]
<i>This photo provides unequivocal proof</i>

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,136
<i>of the identity of the vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.</i>

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,304
What are we gonna do?

22
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,097
I don't know.

23
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,480
[Oliver] Anything interesting
on the news last night?

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,315
[reporter 1] Can you comment
on the photo released last night?

25
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,026
[reporter 2] How do you feel about
the accusation of being the Green Arrow?

26
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,112
[Oliver] Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

27
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,447
If you wanna know what I have to say,

28
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,532
it would probably help
if you could hear me.

29
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,868
Thank you.

30
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,996
I'm gonna tell you two things,
both of which you probably already know.

31
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,459
First, this is important,
I am not the Green Arrow.

32
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,503
[reporter] If you're not the Green Arrow,
then who is?

33
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,796
Number two,

34
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,589
photos can be doctored.

35
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,801
They could've put
Bruce Wayne's head on that body.

36
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,970
Has Bruce Wayne left Gotham
to hangout in Star City recently?

37
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,096
No.

38
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,432
Now, if I was running around the city

39
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,810
during the day, and managing it as mayor,

40
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,313
while running around at night
fighting criminals as a vigilante,

41
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,774
that really would make me a superhero.

42
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,320
But I'm not, I'm just the mayor.

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,864
Thank you very much.

44
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,241
[reporters clamoring]

45
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,244
[Quentin] You seem to be
taking this in your stride.

46
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,037
I've been here before with you.

47
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:05,375
Yeah, but I didn't have a photograph
of you in <i>flagrante de Arrow.</i>

48
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,794
-Where did Channel 52 get the photo?
-Anonymous source.

49
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,130
Arrived in yesterday's mail.
No return address.

50
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,048
Get the envelope,
let's get it to forensics,

51
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,175
and let's figure out who leaked it.

52
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,052
And why.

53
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,932
We can't let this distract us.
Where are we with rebuilding SCPD?

54
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,976
Well, I fast-tracked the insurance claim.

55
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,686
So, we should have 20 million
burning a hole

56
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,187
in our account by the end of the day.

57
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,438
Our account?

58
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,607
I figure we peel off
a few bucks and fly off to Vegas.

59
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,900
[Quentin laughs] That's cute.

60
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,820
I think it might be a little suspicious
if Oliver left town right about now.

61
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,364
I need to be in town
for the Markovian delegation.

62
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,578
So, it's all right for me to go
to Vegas, is what you're saying?

63
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,875
[Oliver] Hello?

64
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,337
I don't think you have an appointment.

65
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,715
No, but I really don't need one.

66
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,050
Special Agent Samanda Watson.

67
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,927
Uh, can we help you with something?

68
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,680
Not really. I'm here as a courtesy,

69
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,391
to inform you of the investigation
I'll be conducting in your city.

70
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,767
Investigation into what?

71
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,144
You.

72
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,187
[scoffs] You gotta be kidding.

73
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,773
Yeah, because the FBI is
world-renowned for its sense of humor.

74
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,150
[sighs]

75
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,404
You were on the news last night
wearing the outfit of a known criminal.

76
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,324
Can you honestly say you're surprised
there's an investigation?

77
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,826
No, but I wasn't expecting the FBI.

78
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,787
Well, quite frankly,
the local law enforcement

79
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,749
has proven ineffective
where the Green Arrow is concerned.

80
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,292
Agent Watson?

81
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,630
-Yes.
-I was cleared five years ago.

82
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,507
Of being The Hood, not the Green Arrow.

83
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,594
And you were cleared by the guy
who's now your deputy mayor.

84
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,597
Would like me to send you a copy of
the polygraph that Mr. Queen passed?

85
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,765
For starters.

86
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,851
The local AG will be issuing
subpoenas later on today.

87
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,979
It was nice meeting you, gentlemen.

88
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,649
I'm sure we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

89
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,162
{\an8}At least they caught his good side.

90
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,914
{\an8}Sorry, not funny.

91
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,415
{\an8}All right, John said
you guys have experience

92
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,125
{\an8}putting this particular genie
back in the bottle.

93
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,002
{\an8}Well, yeah, I mean,
John's put on the hood on before,

94
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,588
{\an8}but I don't see how that's gonna work now,
not with photographic evidence.

95
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,714
{\an8}What about the human target?

96
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,174
{\an8}The human what-now?

97
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,842
{\an8}Best cosplayer ever.

98
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,678
{\an8}He can literally make himself
look like someone else.

99
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
{\an8}Yeah, Chance is out of the country
right now, only God knows where.

100
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,266
{\an8}We have to think of a new way
of getting out of this.

101
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,558
{\an8}And if we can't?

102
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,894
{\an8}Because assuming Oliver
does not go to prison,

103
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,230
{\an8}he's not gonna be able to do anything
with a million eyes on him.

104
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,607
Not to mention that if he's outed...

105
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,567
Rather if he stays outed,

106
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,569
it won't be much of a leap
to the rest of us.

107
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,114
-One step at a time.
-[Felicity] Okay.

108
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,658
First step being, figuring out
where this picture came from.

109
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,410
[keyboard clacking]

110
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,120
{\an8}It came from nowhere.

111
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,579
{\an8}What do you mean?

112
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,374
{\an8}I mean, this envelope wasn't
mailed, delivered or sent.

113
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,918
{\an8}It came from inside
the Channel 52 news offices.

114
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,170
{\an8}-How do we know that?
-Barcode.

115
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,673
{\an8}Channel 52 uses it for internal traffic.

116
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,216
{\an8}How many people work there?

117
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,927
{\an8}-Five-hundred and sixty-eight.
-[Oliver sighs]

118
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,555
{\an8}I'm just gonna say it to say it,
what if this was Chase?

119
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,974
{\an8}He could've put this in motion
months ago, a little parting gift.

120
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,976
{\an8}Seems like his style
messing with you like this.

121
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,145
{\an8}[sighs] It is more than possible.

122
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,398
{\an8}How's your boy holding up with all this?

123
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,693
{\an8}Okay. I wanted to keep him home from
school, but he insisted on going.

124
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,487
-Like his father, huh?
-I wasn't much of a student.

125
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,031
I mean, he's tough.

126
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,576
[door opens]

127
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,288
[Curtis] Where's he standing?

128
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,499
{\an8}If we can figure out
when and where this was taken,

129
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,792
{\an8}it could give us something to go on.

130
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,252
{\an8}I wrote an image analysis algorithm,

131
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,129
{\an8}but there's just not very much
for the computer to chew on.

132
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,881
{\an8}Was the original photo taken digitally,

133
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,007
{\an8}or was it taken the old-fashioned way?

134
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,800
{\an8}Digital. Printed on standard inkjet stock.

135
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,677
{\an8}-Hmm.
-Okay, maybe if we can get the file,

136
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,430
{\an8}there may be metadata on it and
we can figure out who took the photo.

137
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,639
{\an8}That's a pretty epic maybe.

138
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,267
{\an8}Yeah, well, like you said,
if we don't figure this out and fast,

139
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,643
{\an8}we're screwed.

140
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,729
{\an8}-I did say that, didn't I?
-Yeah, you did.

141
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,981
{\an8}This could destroy our whole lives.

142
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,567
{\an8}It's hard to think that, before,
my biggest worry was

143
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,402
{\an8}getting a new job, and now...

144
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,821
{\an8}It's about whether or not
we'll end up in jail.

145
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,907
{\an8}I thought you were sitting pretty
from your Palmer Tech severance.

146
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,492
{\an8}Yeah, from like a year ago.

147
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,453
{\an8}What are you gonna do?
Assuming that we're all not in jail.

148
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,246
{\an8}I mean, I'd definitely
rather go to Iron Heights

149
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,499
{\an8}than work at Tech Village again.
That place was horrendous.

150
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,667
{\an8}What about you? I mean, you've been
out of a job as long as I have.

151
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,754
{\an8}Not really. I've been doing some

{\an8}[stammering] What? What spare time?

153
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,799
{\an8}Yeah, tell me about it.

154
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,052
{\an8}Barely any, but I did not take a dime
from Paul in the divorce,

155
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,261
{\an8}and a man's gotta eat.

156
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,472
{\an8}You just got a secret job this whole
time you didn't tell anyone about?

157
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,307
{\an8}I thought we all, like,
had, like, secret jobs.

158
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,809
{\an8}-No.
-Except for John maybe.

159
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,935
{\an8}What does he do for money?

160
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,269
{\an8}That's something
that's been perplexing me.

161
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,522
{\an8}Well, he's married
to the director of A.R.G.U.S.

162
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,107
{\an8}Ah. Yeah, that's right.

{\an8}She does make a lot of money.

164

{\an8}[Oliver] This building has been vacant

165
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,491
{\an8}since being claimed by the city
under eminent domain four years ago.

166
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,451
{\an8}[reporter] Do you have any comment on
the FBI investigating you

167
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,536
{\an8}on murder charges?

168
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,620
{\an8}[Oliver] We're not gonna talk about that.

169
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,413
{\an8}[Quentin] Except to say
it's a load of crap.

170
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,750
{\an8}By offering subsidized leasing to
Markovia's Vortex Industries,

171
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,628
{\an8}they're gonna be able to create
a high-tech factory here,

172
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,298
bringing, at the very least,
800 new jobs to Star City.

173
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,717
Can you shed light on
the accusation of being the Green Arrow?

174
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,803
You have said you're not
the Green Arrow, then who is?

175
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,430
-Why are you being...
-[Oliver] Guys, enough!

176
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,932
If we're not here

177
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,143
to discuss the Markovian initiative,

178
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,936
then you can just get back on the bus,

179
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,522
because I will not, for the last time,

180
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,858
be answering questions on the Green Arrow.

181
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,568
But I'd be happy to.

182
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,070
Alec Tarkov. I'm the Vortex CEO.

183
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,990
And if your mayor is truly a superhero,

184
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,117
which seems ludicrous...

185
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,493
Thank you.

186
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,495
We will double our investment.

187
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,290
A safe city is a good place
to do business, no?

188
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,876
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, Mr. Tarkov,

189
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,211
but not even my son considers me

Hello, Mr. Mayor.

Hope you are having pleasant day.

You look like maybe you want
to throw a punch at me.

Don't worry. We are not here for you.

210
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,155
We have business
with our Markovian cousins.

211
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,866
These are legitimate businessmen.

212
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,203
I never said my business
was not legitimate.

213

Unless, you know something
maybe a mayor should not know?

Are you okay?

220
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,322
My best friend is under a microscope
by everyone in this city and the FBI.

221
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,075
So he couldn't stop the Bratva
from taking hostages.

222
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,910
So, let's just assume I'm not.

223
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,205
I wasn't talking about
what's going on with Oliver.

00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,042
Dinah, I'm fine.

225
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,421
The only thing that's really bothering me,
is you being up in my business.

[door opens]

227

Hey, we came as soon as we heard.

228
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,095
We need to know why
Anatoly took the Markovians

229
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,430
and we need to find him now.

230
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,724
Oliver, Felicity and Curtis are on this,
but you need to stay here.

231
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,684
Look, I know I said before
Chase could be behind this,

232
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,353
-but now I'm thinking...
-It's Anatoly.

233
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,022
He leaked the photo to tie my hands.

234
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,065
We're on this. We'll take care of it.

235
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,530
-SQL or Java?
-What?

236
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,200
In your job, as a secret programmer.
Are you coding in SQL or Java?

237
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,786
Both. Plus, a little SWIFT.

238
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,538
I can't believe you've had
a secret job this whole time

239
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,706
and you didn't even tell me about it.

240
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,459
Is this relevant to locating
the Bratva and/or their hostages?

241
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,127
I am multitasking. Thank you very much.

242
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,295
And yes, if you must know,

243
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,256
I am running my image analysis
algorithm on the photo of Oliver.

{\an8}What, get something?

245
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,887
{\an8}[Felicity] Just my algorithm
crapping out again.

246
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,096
Don't despair.

247
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,308
I think I might have a line
on our friend Anatoly.

248
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,935
Now, working on the assumption

249
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,104
that he hasn't been in town that long,

250
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,564
I wondered how he was fixed for cash.

251
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,107
I bet his Bratva buddies
are good for it, no?

252
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,734
Well, he has to pay them somehow.

253
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,486
Cash would set off too many alarm bells,

254
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,112
plus he'd have to convert it from Rubles.

255
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,491
Credit cards are way too
easy to track. But then there's...

256
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,286
Crypto-currency is virtually
impossible to track.

257
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,288
For mere mortals.

258
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,000
But we're Mr. Terrific and Overwatch.

259
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,836
Overwatch and Mr. Terrific.

261
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,466
No, I can assure you.

-We're doing everything...
-We haven't determined the motive

-...to recover the hostages back.

264
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,679

around the clock.

-All right?
-Thank you, Minister.

266
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,141
Yes, that's right.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,395
The Markovian consulate
is losing their minds.

00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,021
It's the same with the Vortex home office.

to get their people back.

307
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,134
They said you're not here to help me.

308
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,263
Oh, man. Look...

309
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,893
-William, I'm really sorry...
-They were really big.

310
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,353
Eighth graders.

311
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,108
Eighth graders, huh?

312
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,820
You should go for the nose.

313
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,198
What?

314
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,246
If something like this happens again,

315
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,331
go for the nose.

316
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,709
Find the biggest one,
the biggest one in the group.

317
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,545
Walk right up to him
without saying a thing

318
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,130
and punch him the nose
as hard as you possibly can.

319
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,425
He will have no idea what is going on.

320
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,886
He won't be able to see.
If he can't see, he can't fight.

321
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,722
And all his buddies, all the guys
that were being so brave,

322
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,932
-they will back off.
-[cell phone vibrating]

323
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,433
Trust me on that one.

324
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,603
-But what if...
-Hang on.

325
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,317
-Yeah.
-[Felicity] <i>It's me, hang on a second.</i>

[crackling]

327
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,116
-What was that?
-I had to secure the line.

328
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,076
Curtis and I found Anatoly.

329
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,078
Russian restaurant owned
by a dummy corporation.

330
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,455
Thermal satellite reads
four bodies in an industrial cooler.

331
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,082
Must be the hostages.

332
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,166
That's what we're thinking.

333
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,043
Text me the address. I'll be there soon.

334
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,545
Stop the car please.

335
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,880
-What are you...
-I gotta get out.

336
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,924
Listen, [clears throat]
the driver and security,

337
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,510
they're gonna make sure
that you get right home to Raisa.

338
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,178
-But...
-I promise we'll talk about this

339
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,764
when I get home, but for now, I gotta go.

340
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,683
Listen, please trust me.

341
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,813
[sighs]

342
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,818
Three access points,
north, south and east.

343
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,112
Lance said these guys are
packing some heavy artillery.

344
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,281
-Where's GA?
-[Green Arrow] Right here.

345
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,867
We thought maybe you couldn't get away.

346
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,243
It wasn't easy.

347
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,123
Terrific, keep eyes on the perimeter.
Spartan, Canary, occupy the guards.

348
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,208
I'll extract the Markovians.

349
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,467

[grunting]

357
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:40,124
-There were four of you.
-Alec Tarkov, our CEO. They took him.

358
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,001
-Where?
-They did not tell us.

359
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,795
Spartan, Canary, we are short one hostage.

360
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,715
-We just did a sweep...
-There's no one else here.

361
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,425
-Overwatch?
-I don't know what happened?

362
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,844
Thermal read four warm bodies inside.
They must have moved one.

363
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,727
[Felicity] In the least
surprising news ever,

364
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,730
the Bratva-run restaurant
is lacking in security cams.

365
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,732
Oh, you mean, Russian mobsters
like their privacy?

366
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,816
So, what now?

367
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,194
So now I show you security camera
footage from outside the restaurant.

368
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,489
Okay, where's Anatoly going with Tarkov?

369
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,991
From this feed,
it looks like he's headed northeast,

370
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,617
but then we lose him right about there.

371
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,371
We could cross-reference our list of
Bratva crypto-currency activity

372
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,249
with Bratva-owned properties,
see what comes from that direction.

373
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,001
John, Dinah, be prepared to hit
whatever location

374
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,252
Felicity and Curtis come up with.

375
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,712
-Copy that.
-What about you?

376
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,714
I have to meet
Quentin and Rene at the FBI.

377
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,008
The agent pursuing the investigation
wants to interview me.

378
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,092
[Felicity] You have a lawyer
for that, right?

379
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,343
Or an army of lawyers,

380
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,887
that would probably be better,
that would work for you?

381
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,971
If you had an army of them.

382
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,389
I don't wanna look like
I have anything to hide.

383
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,474
Where are we with the photo?

384
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,268
Oh, I'm doing a re-code
into Felicity's analysis algorithm.

385
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,520
Should have something
working within an hour

386
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,397
to 30 days, give or take.

387
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,442
-[Felicity clears throat]
-Much closer to the hour mark though.

388
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,693
-Thank you.
-[cell phone chimes]

389
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,239
Keep me updated.

390
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,829
[clock ticking]

391
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,709
[sighs]

392
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,879
Did you always know you were gonna be FBI?

393
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,426
'Cause I have a little girl
who I think has that potential.

394
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,763
I mean, of course,
a woman can do anything a man can.

395
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,014
And why wouldn't they?

396
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,934
Exactly, I mean, they can.

397
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,018
I'm a feminist like that.

398
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,731
Look, it's been over an hour
and my patience is beyond gone.

399
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,567
Actually, you know what,
that's the Mayor himself.

400
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,444
Got a family emergency.
He's at home with the kid.

401
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,737
Look at that.

402
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,991
So, it must be a coincidence
that during his family emergency,

403
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,660
the Green Arrow was spotted rescuing

404
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,829
the Markovian executives
from the Russian mob?

405
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,038
Definitely a coincidence.

406
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,791
Do I really look that stupid?

407
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,835
You don't look stupid at all.

408
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,878
We're really sorry about
keeping you waiting, all right.

409
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,004
But I don't know if you know this,

410
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,757
but the mayor's actually
recently a single dad.

411
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,636
Yes, after the boy's mother died
unexpectedly in a car accident.

412
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,973
Well, most car accidents are unexpected.

413
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,600
And most leave behind
a car wreck and a body.

414
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,686
The only proof of Miss Clayton's death

415
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,105
was the accident report and the autopsy,

416
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,190
both of which
could have been easily faked.

417
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,193
You're not exactly a very trusting person,

418
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,195
are you, Special Agent Watson?

419
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,447
Trust isn't part of my job description.

420
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,492
But let me make one thing
clear as glass to you both.

421
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,413
If you're protecting Mr. Queen,
I'll find out.

422
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,832
And I'll have you both
indicted for obstruction.

423
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,128
Now get out of my office.
You've wasted enough of my time.

424
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,382
Let's go.

425
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,343
Hey, William.

426
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,346
That was a gift
from a very good friend of mine.

427
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,514
It's all fake.

428
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,601
Superheroes don't save anyone.

429
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,394
Buddy, I know that I ran out on you.

430
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,521
And I'm sorry, but people needed help.

431
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,734
I know that you needed help too,
so I'm here.

432
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,069
-Do you wanna learn a few more moves...
-No.

433
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,697
Because I don't wanna learn how to fight.

434
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,073
I don't want you to learn how to fight,

435
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,450
but you can't always reason with bullies.

436
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,452
You just left me, by myself.

437
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,331
I know. I know, and I'm sorry.

438
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,418
I didn't know if you were gonna come back.

439
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,836
William, look at me.

440
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,796
I will always come back.

441
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,715
Just like my mom?

442
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,510
-This is different.
-Yeah, it's worse.

443
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,931
Because there's a million psychos
always trying to kill you.

444
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,017
-I can handle them.
-What if you can't?

445
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,937
Then I'll be alone. I'll have nobody.

446
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,192
You wouldn't understand.

447
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,028
I do understand.

448
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,907
I lost my mom.

449
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,743
And I lost my dad.

450
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,207
And I was a lot older than you are now,

451
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,542
but I remember exactly how it feels.

452
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,713
It's sad. It's scary.

453
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,674
And it's lonely.

454
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,427
And I swear to God,
I will never let that happen to you.

455
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,263
It's not up to you.

456
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,810
[cell phone vibrating]

457
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,900
I'm sorry, it's work.

458
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,861
Which work?

459
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,532
[cell phone vibrating]

460
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,418
<i>Hello, Oliver.</i>

461
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,796
-Anatoly, why are you doing this?
<i>-I need money.</i>

462
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,340
And from what I understand,
your city recently

463
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,759
came into possession of $20 million.

That's a neurotoxin.

Yeah, inhibits the firing

00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
[Mr. Terrific] If one of us spots Tarkov,
we should have a signal.

624
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,762
[Wild Dog] I was gonna go with
something like, "I see him."

625
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,430
Or maybe even, "Hey, over there."

626
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,141
Not terribly original, but effective.
What if we spot the Bratva?

627
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,726
[Wild Dog] How about, "Heads up?"

628
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,311
[Mr. Terrific] Heads up!

629
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,276
[screams]

630
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,781
-You okay?
-Look out!

631
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,575

[gunshots]

635
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,968
I asked for 20 million specifically
because I know you had it.

636
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,013
You'd trade this man's life
for a new police station?

637
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,223
Not exactly.

638
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,188
I do not think you understand how
this whole rescue thing works.

639
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,898
No, I think I do.

640
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,612
Some sort of antidote?

641
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,281
Very clever.

642
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,242
Now step away from him, Anatoly.

643
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,244
He's not a part of this.

644
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,954
I made him part of this.

645
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,539
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

646
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,667
And I never got my money.

647
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,504
What the hell has happened to you?

648
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,384
-Not even Gregor would've done that!
-Yes, he would have.

649
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,137
You never saw because you were too naive.

650
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,388
You still are.

651
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,309
-We were friends.
-Yes.

652
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,769
But I see how you treat your friends.

653
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,188
No, Anatoly. No.

654
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,608
This is on you.

655
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:47,447
-You used to be an honorable man.
-I am an honorable man.

656
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,951
Did I have bomb
planted in your son's school?

657
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,412
Did I have him kidnapped?

658
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,332
Tortured? No.

659
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,418
Because even though we stand apart,

660
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,755
I am still good man.

661
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,926
I wonder.

662
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,386
What would happen to William

663
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,599
if you ran afoul of someone
who is not good?

664
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,229
Anatoly!

665
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,108
-Don't you move.
-Don't bluff.

666
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,528
We have been here before.

667
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,074
We both know you will not kill me.

668
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,627
Why did you leak that picture of me?

669
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,462
As <i>Kapiushon?</i>

670
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,382
I did not.

671
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,718
I told you.

672
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,387
I am honorable man.

673
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,566
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

674
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,695
I can always make time
for the subject of my investigation.

675
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,406
But I should advise
you have a lawyer present.

676
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,950
Why do I need a lawyer?
I haven't done anything wrong.

677
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,868
You know the kind of person who says that?

678
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,204
-No.
-The kind that needs a lawyer.

679
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,747
[chuckles]

680
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,960
Agent Watson, if you feel
the need to investigate me,

681
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,504
I am more than happy to open up
my entire life to you.

682
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,841
With the exception of my son.

683
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,176
He's off-limits.

684
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,679
You're aware that telling an FBI agent

685
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,181
how to conduct their investigation
is obstruction of justice.

686
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,517
If I really am the man
that you think I am,

687
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,811
how far do you think such a man would go

688
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:45,440
to keep his son
from being scrutinized by the FBI?

689
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,526
[knock on door]

690
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,157
-Miss Watson?
-A little busy here.

691
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,452
There's something on the news
that you need to see.

692
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,706
<i>Channel 52 just received

-Lucky you.
-Not really.

698
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,723
Like I said...

699
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,475
I'm not the man you think I am.

700
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,602
No, Mr. Queen, I think you are.

701
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,022
And if you think this means
I'm dropping my investigation,

702
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,815
then you're the one who's mistaken.

703
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,234
You should do whatever it is you have to.

human beings on the planet.

Oh, well,
it's not arrogant if it is accurate.

to look bummed out. Crazy.

I mean, our photo analysis
algorithm was right, right?

715

-So...
-So? What's the problem?

717
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,229
So, who would want to frame
Oliver for being the Green Arrow?

Wow.

719

-Sorry.
-No, listen.

00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,319
That is future us' problem.

I'm not gonna, like, let you take
away my buzz right now, okay.

00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,828
When are you gonna let that go?

726
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,037
When you go into business with me.

727
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,956
I'm sorry, go into what with you?
Wait, what?

We work so well together.

Okay, that photographic analysis algorithm

of amazing tech
that you and I have collaborated on.

All the cool stuff we could do.
All the cool things we could make.

Please don't say no.

-Yes.
-Oh, thank God, good.

736
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,726
Because I already filed the paperwork.

[Curtis] Oh, man, this is so cool.

738

We'll be like Woz and Jobs,
like, back in '76.

Wait. Who's Woz and who's Jobs?

-Shotgun Jobs!
-Shotgun Jobs!

Hey.

742
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,913
Can we talk for a second?

743
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,459
There's nothing to talk about.

744
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,881
We both know that's not true, Dinah.

[sighs]

746
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,094
What do we both know?

747
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,516
I need you to say it.

748
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,646
You nearly got killed last night
because you couldn't rely on me.

749
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,024
-Because you're compromised.
-I know.

750
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,277
I know.

751
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,034
Things just got worse
than I was willing to admit.

752
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,625
That's okay.

753
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,003
But what are you gonna do about it?

754
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,547
Tell Oliver.

755
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,343
Go from there.

756

[indistinct grunting on TV]

757
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,519
-You're home early.
-So I am.

758
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,065
I'm hoping to make that
more of a regular thing.

759
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,191
If that's okay with you.

760
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,318
Whatever.

761
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,531
I would like to apologize.

762
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,825
For what?

763
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,663
For making you a promise
I wasn't 100% sure I could keep.

764
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,840
You were right, and I was wrong.

765
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,266
Raisa said you have a hard time
admitting when you're wrong.

766
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,518
You have no idea.

767
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:59,026
Buddy, I heard what you said
in the limo and I hear you.

768
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,530
But I also meant what I said.

769
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:07,743
I am going to do
everything in my power, forever,

770
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,873
to make sure that you never
end up alone in this world.

771
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,877
And I know that you think that
that's not up to me.

772
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,799
And that's a fair, smart, point.

773
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,094
Which is why I think...

774
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,556
I found a way so that maybe it can be.

775

-How?
-I'm working on the details.

776
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,647
I want you to believe me when I say
that I'm trying to make it happen.

777
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,774
All right?

778
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,445
One more thing.

779
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,114
I promise

780
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,951
that I will do my best every single day

781
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,081
to be the very best father that I can be.

782
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,461
And that I know how to be.

783
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,548
That promise is 100%.

784
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,764
Okay.

785
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,145
Wanna play with me?

786
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,446
-What is this?
-Honestly, I don't know.

787
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,616
All you got to do is just button mash
and see where we can win.

788
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,034
All right, let me try.

789
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,494
-Yeah.
-All right.

790
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,381
[footsteps approaching]

791
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,509
Thanks for meeting me.

792
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,053
Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you
about a few things.

793
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,724
What is it, Oliver?

794
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,811
I'd like you to do something for me.

795
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,021
If it's suit up as Green Arrow,

796
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,856
Felicity and I already talked
about it and we don't think

797
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,191
it's enough to take the heat off of you.

798
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,567
That's not what I'm asking.

799
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,780
You're serious?

800
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,908
Every time, that I'm out there
as the Green Arrow,

801
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,284
I'm a target.

802
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,955
Of the FBI, of the Bratva...

803
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,125
Of the threats that are out there

804
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,877
and the threats that are
undoubtedly coming.

805
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,798
And on my own,

806
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,676
I can take it.

807
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,889
I'm not on my own anymore.

808
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,562
I cannot be responsible

809
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:45,109
for my son losing
the only parent that he has left.

810
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,405
-Oliver...
-Star City needs the Green Arrow.

811
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,076
It just can't be me anymore.

812
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,039
So, I'd like it to be you.
