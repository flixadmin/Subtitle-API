You've had an accident.

You need an ambulance.
I'll call for one.

I can
clearly see you do.

25

I'll call for one.

I've even bought a cake.

00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,684
- Not my coat.
- It smells rather badly.

45
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,644
It's my coat.

46
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,897
It's your coat.

47
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,110
So what happened?

48
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,362
Were you robbed?

49
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,785
It's my own fault.

50
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,873
I'm just
a bad human being.

51
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,376
I've never met
a bad human being.

52
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,627
Well, you have now.

53
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,756
Do you want
to talk about it?

54
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
You wouldn't understand.

55
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,264
Well, try me.

56
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,060
But I wouldn't know
where to start.

57
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,073
Why is that ridiculous
fishhook hanging there?

58
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,784
(Man) It's a fly.

59
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,578
I caught a fish
with it once,

60
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,246
a rather big one

61
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,040
strangely enough.

62
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,920
Fly-fishing is about

63
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,298
tying feathers
and other things to a hook

64
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,052
so it resembles something
the fish likes to eat.

65
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,804
And then because
the fly is very light,

66
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,224
you have to have
a line that is heavy.

67
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,186
It creates the velocity
when you cast.

68
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,610
You fish a lot?

69
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,363
Well, some...

70
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,241
But I don't catch much.

71
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,619
When I was young, I...

72
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,413
I had a book I...
I worshipped.

73
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,167
It was an old book
by Izaak Walton

74
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,545
called
"The Complete Angler."

75
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,676
It was like a romantic
nature Bible to me.

76
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,433
Maybe I know
where to start.

77
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,690
But if you're
to understand, I'll...

78
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,151
I'll have to tell you
the whole story,

79
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,237
and it'll be long.

80
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,575
Long... is good.

81
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,661
And moral,
I'm afraid.

82
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,089
To begin with the bait,

83
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,593
I discovered my cunt
as a two-year-old.

84
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,847
(Woman's voice)
At an early age,

85
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,890
I was mechanically inclined.

86
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,685
Kinetic energy,
for example,

87
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,813
- has always fascinated me.
- (Water running)

88
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,941
And my friend...
Let's call her b...

89
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,569
Always came up
with the ideas.

90
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,490
Playing frogs was
one of b's classics.

94
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,933
(Woman #2 knocks)
Joe, are you all right?

95
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,518
Just a moment!

96
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,272
(Woman #2)
Are you done?

97
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,692
(Flushes)

98
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,827
For Christ's sakes,
leave them alone.

99
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,997
(Joe's voice)
I loved my father very much.

100
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,666
He was a doctor.

101
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,669
My mother's name
was Katherine.

102
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,796
My father called her kay.

103
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,675
I suppose she was
what you'd call

104
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,426
a cold bitch.

105
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,720
She always had
her back turned

106
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,681
when she played solitaire.

107
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,141
I hated solitaire.

108
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,601
(Sighs)

109
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,732
When we had p.E.,

110
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,526
I'd climb up
into the ropes

111
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,985
and hang there for ages

112
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,155
with the rope
between my legs.

113
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,950
"The sensation"
we called it.

114
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:46,705
I remember very distinctly
this word, "sensation."

115
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:57,006
Perhaps the only difference
between me and other people

116
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,010
was that I've always demanded
more from the sunset.

117
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:06,015
More spectacular colours
when the sun hit the horizon.

118
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,062
That's perhaps
my only sin.

119
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,860
Why are you insisting
that children are sinful?

120
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,530
Not children. Me.

121
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,409
I don't see sin anywhere,

122
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,494
but then
I'm not religious.

123
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,664
That's because you don't know
the rest of the story.

124
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,333
And by the way,
I'm not religious either.

125
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,295
Why would you take the most
unsympathetic aspect

126
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,256
of religion such as
the concept of sin...

127
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,260
And let it survive
beyond religion?

128
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,767
I don't understand
this self-hatred.

129
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,852
That's what I said...

130
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,438
- You wouldn't understand.
- No, I'm...

131
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,357
I'm sorry,
I'll shut up.

132
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,778
Please continue.

133
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,793
Nervus pudendus.

134
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,965
Nervus dorsalis
clitoridis.

135
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,803
(Snorts)

136
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,977
(Rustling)

137
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,790
(Joe's voice) My dad loved
telling me about the trees

138
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,416
and their leaves

139
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,920
and considered it
part of a good education.

140
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,549
When the ash tree
was created,

141
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,760
it made all the other trees
in the forest jealous.

142
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,138
It was the most
beautiful tree.

143
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,727
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

144
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,274
Then in the winter...

145
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,153
When the ash tree
lost all of its leaves...

146
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,244
All the trees noticed its black
buds and started laughing.

147
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,663
"Oh, look...

148
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,709
The ash tree's had
its fingers in the ashes."

149
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,379
See?

150
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,550
You can always tell
the ash tree in winter

151
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,302
by the black buds.

152
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,972
(Joe's voice)
He especially loved

153
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,182
the childish educational
stories he told

154
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,352
to help me remember
what I had learned.

155
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,231
I knew how much he loved
telling those stories,

156
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,818
so sometimes I pretended
I had forgotten them.

157
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,871
Am I boring you?

158
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,332
(Seligman) No, I'm just
looking forward

159
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,751
to how you will get fishing
weaved into your tale.

160
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,255
You could start with
the fly on the wall there.

161
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,383
It's called a nymph.
It would tie in elegantly

162
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,053
with your discussion
about nymphomania.

163
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,388
A nymph is...

164
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,683
An early stage
in the life of an insect.

165
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,313
(Joe)
As a quite young nymph,

166
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,233
it was imperative for me
to get rid of my virginity.

167
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,818
Hopla.

168
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,155
I kind of knew
this boy j,

169
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,325
who had a moped.

170
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,786
So in my eyes,
he was rather sophisticated.

171
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,747
I was 15, and perhaps

172
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:02,001
my girlish romantic
expectations were a bit high.

173
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,795
(Clicks)

174
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,633
(Joe's voice) But he had
good strong hands.

175
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,011
- (Blowing)
- I liked his hands.

176
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,223
Hello?

177
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,393
- Young Joe: Hi.
- Hi.

178
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,908
If I asked you
to take my virginity,

179
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,827
would that be a problem?

180
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,913
No, I don't see
a problem.

181
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,378
So, um...

182
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,924
Where shall I go?

183
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,260
(Door closes)

184
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,639

(Sputters)

186
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,482
It's the fucking
carburettor.

187
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,029
I just can't work it out.
Can you imagine that?

188
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,782
- That's not very good.
- Hmm?

189
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,118
- That's not very good.
- No, it bloody isn't.

190
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,871
It ruins the whole idea
of having a moped.

191
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,460
You should probably
take off your knickers, yeah?

192
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,381
(Joe's voice) He shoved his cock
inside me

193
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,300
and humped me three times.

194
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,427
(Both grunting)

195
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,813
Then he turned me over
like a sack of potatoes...

196
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,447
Then he humped me
five times in the ass.

197
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,242
- (Grunting)
- (Cries out)

198
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,445
(Clattering, squeaking)

199
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,084
(Sputters)

200
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,052
(Engine starts)

201
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,435
(Joe's voice) I never forgot
those two humiliating numbers.

202
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,646
(Seligman's voice)
Three and five?

203
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,356
Those are
fibonacci numbers.

204
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,111
That may be.

205
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,198
In any case,
it hurt like hell.

206
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,826
I swore I'd never sleep
with anyone again.

207
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,412
But of course, that only
lasted a short while.

208
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,374
And now to get back
to your fishing...

209
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,379
A couple of years later
I was at my friend b's.

210
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,549
And as always,
she had a new idea...

211
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,719
Financed by her younger
brother's piggy banks,

212
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,222
which she regularly emptied.

213
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,853
We put on clothes
later known

214
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,232
as the fuck-me-now clothes.

215
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,027
The idea was
a competition.

216
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,655
We were to go
on a train trip.

217
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,659
B said there was
no need for tickets.

218
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,161
The one who
had fucked the most men

219
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,413
when we reached
the destination

220
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,707
would win
the chocolate sweets.

221

229
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,901
What you were doing

230
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,861

235
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,965
from the current

236
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,134
- and to hide from the prey.
- (Water flowing)

237
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,844
Where the fish hides
in the stream

238
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,263
entails a very
complicated hierarchy.

239
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,433
The topography decides

240
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,560
where the most
attractive places are,

241
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,396
and the biggest fish
choose the best positions.

Smile and make eye contact.
If you have to talk,

243
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,406
remember to ask a lot
of wh- questions

244
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,325
if you want more
than a yes-or-no answer.

245
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,744
Then it'll just happen on its own.
Just take them to the lavatory

246
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,370
and you have sex with them.

247
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,124
Oh. But what if it's nasty?

248
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,419
Then you just think of
the bag of chocolate sweeties.

249
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,162
What... what time is it?

250
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,999
10:00

251
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,682
(Young Joe)
Where do you come from?

252
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,936
From home.

253
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,821
Who knows where
the lavatory is?

254
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,489
(Man)
Well, if you take a right,

255
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:32,201
you will arrive at a lavatory
at the end of the car.

256
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,162
At the same time,
it is so cleverly arranged

257
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,539
that if you take
a left turn,

258
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,166
you will also arrive
at a lavatory,

259
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,420
since at the end of
the next car there is also one.

260
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,550
I'll show you where
the lavatory is.

261
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,489
(Breathing heavily)

262
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,872
(Joe's voice) It turned out
to be shockingly easy.

263
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,666
In no time, B was ahead,
five to three.

264
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,419
And it was exactly right...

265
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,463
Look them
in the eye and smile.

266
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,549
But then suddenly
it stopped.

267
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,595
That's a very clear parallel
to fishing in the stream.

268
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,638
As it happens,

269
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,390
either none
of the fish are feeding

270
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,517
or they all feed
at the same time.

271
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,769
They go
into feeding frenzy.

272
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,480
All bite.

273
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,941
And then just as suddenly
as it started, it stops.

274
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,069
The fish most readily bite
at the beginning of a light rain,

275
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,405
and I think that's
because they feel safe

276
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,199
when they swim
in the stream.

277
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,868
Because they can't
be seen from above.

278
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,496
The water's surface
is disturbed.

279
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,583
But then it started again,

280
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,419
although a bit
more slowly.

281
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,005
Yeah, and I think
I know how.

282
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,883
Because fly-fishing can
be done in several phases.

283
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,262
And if the fish stop biting,
you move on to phase two.

284
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,766
And in phase two,
you not only imitate an insect

285
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,352
but an insect in trouble.

286
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,563
You pull...
You pull the line.

287
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,525
You tug it...
Irregularly,

288
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,485
so the fish gets
the impression that

289
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,238
it's dealing with an injured
and easy prey.

290
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,323
And then helplessly

291
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,326
let the fly float
down the river again.

292
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,161
Then half-heartedly

293
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,205
make a few jumps
forward again.

294
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,750
It can be done...

295
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,752
It can be done
very elegantly.

296
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,801
(Sighs)

297
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,101
Are you all right?

298
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,811
It's Betty.

299
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,690
I was just told
that she's very ill.

300
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,442
Is Betty
a close family member?

301
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,406
You could say that.

302
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,325
She's my dwarf hamster.

303
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,119
(Seligman's voice)
Dwarf hamster?

304
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,121
You can't be serious.

305
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,123
(Joe's voice)
Well, what was I to do?

306
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,668
And then I did have a dwarf
hamster when I was young.

307
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,212
(Seligman's voice) That you
were very close to?

308
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,381
(Joe's voice) Not at all.
A bloody nuisance.

309
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,216
(Man #2)
Dwarf hamster.

310
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,885
It would've been worse
if it were a person.

311
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,096
(Young Joe)
Don't say that.

312
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,725
I'm extremely fond
of my hamster.

313
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,812
Yes, I think that's a rather
cynical thing to say about Betty.

314
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:51,650
Yes, I had made the cage
nice and cosy for her when...

315
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,278
- When I got her.
- And Betty liked that?

316
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,615
Betty was excited.

317
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,619
(Joe's voice) One of nature's
most meaningless creatures.

318
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,370
(Seligman's voice)
You're aware that the choice

319
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,914
of a dwarf hamster
possibly suggests

320
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,083
certain sexual connotations.

321
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,627
(Joe's voice)
I can see that now,

322
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,796
but it was really
not a conscious choice.

323
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,225
Can you show me
where the lavatory is?

324
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,480
I... have to
blow my nose.

325
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,036
(Joe's voice) We were
running out of subjects,

326
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,372
and B was ahead
on points,

327
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,417
which led us to s's
first-class compartment.

328
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,507
(Conductor)
Tickets, please!

329
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,389
Thank you.

330
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,682
Ladies?

331
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,518
Tickets?

332
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,775
(Young Joe) Well...

333
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,904
I think
I might've lost it.

334
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,239
(Conductor) Perhaps.

335
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,118
Dropped yours as well,
did ya?

336
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:28,122
I haven't bought a ticket
for your shitty train.

337
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,499
It's so bloody slow,
we should've been

338
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,334
at the end of the track
half an hour ago.

339
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,379
Regardless of delays, you still
need a ticket, sweetheart.

340
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,840
£8 each, please.

341
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,385
Oh!

342
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,347
I accidentally tore it up.

343
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,392
You can't expect be to pay
for scraps of paper.

344
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,644
- Have another one.
- Oh, great idea.

345
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,855
Oh, that one's
disappeared too.

346
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,524
(Conductor) I can get the police
to collect your payment

347
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,942
at the next station.
How about that?

348
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,069
Now let's just take it
easy here, shall we?

349
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,072
Apparently the young ladies
have left without any money.

350
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,450
If it's okay with you, I'd like
to pay for their tickets.

351
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,327
No sir, it's not. Just leave
your money where it is.

352
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,620
We'll let the police
deal with these two.

353
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,707
Actually, we did have an
agreement that I was to pay.

354
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,125
I just forgot about it.

355
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,671
I see.

356
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,340
Two first-class tickets...

357
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,885
For two first-class ladies.

358
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,263
Enjoy the rest
of your journey.

359
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,809
Tickets, please!

360
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,981
(B) Now that you've been
so nice to us...

361
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,943
We'd like to be
nice to you too.

362
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,612
(S) Oh, that's
very kind of you,

363
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,988
but there's no need.

364
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,077
I mean that.

365
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,917
Well, I've already
lost anyway.

366
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:01,507
I'm willing to give you
five extra points...

367
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,136
If you can get
that one in there.

368
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,809
(Joe's voice) I decided,
perhaps a bit desperately,

369
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,936
that the only thing
standing between me

370
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,979
and the bag
of chocolate sweets

371
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:20,442
was an unequivocal
provocation of this man.

372
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,070
(Seligman's voice)
Excellent. An induced take.

373
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,572
When all other
attempts fail,

374
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,324
a dramatic provocation
can get

375
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,993
an otherwise completely
passive fish to bite.

376
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,247
They will react instinctively
to the right provocation,

377
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,041
which would not be a fly,
but, for instance,

378
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,837
a brightly-coloured wobbler,
preferably red.

379
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,422
The very best is one we call
"the Finnish weapon,"

380
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,092
the so-called Rapala.

381
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,513
(Young Joe)
You've bought a gift.

382
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,766
Yes.

383
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,645
- It's for my wife.
- Oh.

384
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,690
You travel first-class

385
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,276
and you bought us
our tickets.

386
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,405
Why then not buy
a decent gift for your wife?

387
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,533
I can see it comes
from the station.

388
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,499
Of course,
I should have...

389
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,001
Bought her something...

390
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,920
Something better, but...

391
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,465
Let's just say I was suddenly
in a hurry to get home.

392
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,845
Why would a man
like you

393
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,973
with such an orderly life
suddenly have to hurry?

394
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,520
It has to do with family.

395
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,692
My wife and I
have decided that we...

396
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,656
We miss having children
after all,

397
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,451
and that if we are to have
children, it has to be now.

398
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,040
So my wife called yesterday
to say that she...

399
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,542
She started ovulating.

400
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,880
And all signs point
to maximum fertility

401
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,049
precisely tonight.

402
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,092
You see...

403
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,304
That's why I bought her
a gift at the station.

404
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,265
I had to get a ticket home
as quickly as possible.

405
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,977
Well, I understand now.

406
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,480
What is it
you understand?

407
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,149
Why you didn't
have sex with us.

408
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,781
It wasn't because
I didn't want to.

409
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,174
(Whispering)
Please.

410
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,973
I'm begging you,
please don't.

411
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,058
It's okay.

412
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,894
Please don't.

413
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,232
You've been
as horny as hell...

414
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,402
But you wouldn't
give up your load.

415
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,154
Please stop.

416
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,125
(Grunts)

417
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,926
(Grunting)

418
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,600
Oh God.

419
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,034
(Chuckles)

420
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,037
Wow.

421
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,125
(Crunching)

422
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,426
(Seligman)
So oral sex

423
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,970
became, in the eye
of the angler,

424
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,556
your...
Your Finnish weapon.

425
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,769
(Joe's voice)
Is that your only comment?

426
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,023
What else... what else
do you want me to say?

427
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,069
That I behaved
reprehensively,

428
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:36,073
that already my actions
exemplify that I'm a...

429
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,325
I'm a terrible
human being.

430
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,828
That's not
the way I see it.

431
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,914
On the contrary,
I saw it as a...

432
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,000
As a very pleasurable
and humorous story.

433
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,670
I've consciously
used and hurt others...

434
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,841
For the sake
of my own satisfaction.

435
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,761
And what I've told you so far
only begins to suggest that.

436
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,179
But when you told
the story, you were...

437
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,724
You were cheerful,
full of humour.

438
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,018
The only thing
you've done...

439
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,021
Except giving a few people
an experience to remember

440
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,109
is that you... you relieved s
from his load

441
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,362
in some...
Some youthful hubris.

442
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,242
And I read somewhere that
if you keep the load too long,

443
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,910
the sperm will die.

444
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,037
Or worse, degenerate.

445
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,832
Maybe thanks to you,

446
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,625
Mr. S and his wife
now have a healthy

447
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,669
and well-functioning child.

448
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,297
I discovered
my power as woman

449
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,467
and used it without
any concern for others.

450
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,137
That's completely
unacceptable.

451
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,097
Oh, little darling.

452
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,932
Don't you
"little darling" me.

453
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,019
No.

454
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,607
What I wanted
to say was that

455
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,694
if you have wings,
why not fly?

456
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,407
(Train passing)

457
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,812
No more stories.

458
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,441
You need to sleep.

459
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,234
No, no.

460
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,571
This is beginning
to amuse me.

461
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,246
I don't even
know your name.

462
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,333
My name is Joe.

463
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,919
I'm Seligman.

464
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,964
What a fucking
ridiculous name.

465
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,216
(Snickers)

466
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,259
It's Jewish.

467
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,387
You said
you weren't religious.

468
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,723
No, but my
great-grandfather was.

469
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,225
And my parents
gave me the name

470
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,227
as a sort of...

471
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,272
Sentimental association
to judaism.

472
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,609
But we've always been
anti-zionists...

473
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,322
Which is not the same
as being anti-semitic,

474
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,867
as certain political powers
try to convince us.

475
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,787
Seligman...

476
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,498
Means "the happy one."

477
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,836
So are you happy then?

478
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,633
Well, I suppose I am...

479
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,427
In my own way.

480
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,180
Even if
I'm the kind of person

481
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,266
who cut the nails
of the right hand first.

482
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,433
What does that mean?

483
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,020
Well, I divide humanity
into two groups:

484
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,773
The people who cut the nails
on the left hand first

485
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,608
and the people
who cut the nails

486
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,278
of the right hand first.
My theory is

487
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,905
that the people who cut
the nails of the left hand first,

488
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,324
they... they...
They're more light-hearted.

489
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,660
They have a tendency
to enjoy life more

490
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,330
because they go straight
for the easiest task and...

491
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,834
Save their difficulties
for later.

492
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,340
So what do you do?

493
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,510
Always the left hand first.

494
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,637
I don't think
there's a choice.

495
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,349
Go for the pleasure
first, always.

496
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,436
And then once
you've done the left hand,

497
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,980
only the right hand remains,

498
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,275
and that's
the easiest one left.

499
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,326
I've never thought
of it like that.

500
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,497
Well, you...
You're never too old...

501
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,166
Never too old
to learn.

502
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,925
That's rugelach.

503
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,596
Mm-hmm.
It's a Jewish cake.

504
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,348
There's that
sentimentality again.

505
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,266
No, but it's more
than rugelach.

506
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,019
It's rugelach served
with a cake fork.

507
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,148
Rugelach, in my opinion,
is pastry,

508
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,735
which there is no excuse
for eating with a cake fork.

509
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,447
To serve it with a cake fork
is irritatingly unmanly,

510
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,241
not to say
downright feminine.

511
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:36,081
However it can bring us
further with the story.

512
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:42,796
I also knew someone who
consumed rugelach every day,

513
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,799
almost ritually,
with a cake fork.

514
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,927
And although we'll be
jumping a bit in time...

515
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,390
I have to tell you
about Jerome.

516
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,518
As far as I can see, the next
chapter doesn't contain

517
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,646
as direct an accusation
against my person

518
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,107
as the rest of the story.

519
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,234
The chapter will also make

520
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,403
a sentimental soul
like you happy,

521
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:11,408
as it contains observations
on the subject of love.

522
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,621
(Young Joe grunting, moaning)

523
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,665
(Moaning loudly)

524
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,336
(Both breathing hard)

525
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,599
Can I tell you something?

526
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,479
Sure.

527
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,646
Yeah.

528
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,814
Yeah sure.

529
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,691
It might not be
important to you...

530
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,777
But it is to me.

531
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,822
I've never had
an orgasm before.

532
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,994
Really?

533
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,206
(Kisses)

534
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,250
You're my first one.

535
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,005
You don't know
how happy that makes me.

536
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,717
(Both laugh)

537
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,345
I love you.

538
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,555
(Laughs)

539
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,143
(Whispers)
You're my first.

540
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,857
Well, I have to admit:

541
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,318
Quite a lot
of girls say that.

542
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,112
(Chuckles)

543
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,449
(Joe's voice) The train trip
had increased my appetite,

544
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,495
and soon B and I started a club
that we called the little flock.

545
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,455
(Tritone playing)

546
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,125
(Women) Mea vulva,
mea maxima vulva.

547
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,877
(Joe's voice) B, of course,
took the lead,

548
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,380
as she was
the most daring of us.

549
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,257
She was raised catholic.

550
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,551
I'm sure you're familiar
with the practices

551
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,177
of the catholic church.

552
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,555
(Women)
Mea maxima vulva.

553
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,723
Mea vulva, mea...

554
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,517
(Seligman's voice)
That's interesting.

555
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,645
Blasphemic, satanic.

556
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,064
The music...

557
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,233
The interval
between B and F...

558
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,151
It's a tritone,

559
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,153
the devil's interval.

560
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,156
It was banned from music
in the middle ages.

561
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,160
Well, the vacuum cleaner
invented it.

562
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,288
She took piano lessons.

563
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,415
The vacuum cleaner?

564
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,958
The vacuum cleaner
possessed

565
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,128
a special talent
for floppy cocks.

566
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,590
She had some kind
of vacuum in her cunt.

567
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,635
I... I was imagining
something like that.

568
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,262
It was about fucking

569
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,931
and about having
the right to be horny.

570
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:26,060
We masturbated together,
that kind of thing.

571
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,855
But it was rebellious.

572
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,900
We weren't allowed
to have boyfriends.

573
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,695
No fucking the same guy
more than once.

574
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,780
What did you rebel against?

575
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,407
Love.

576
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,909
Love?

577
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,162
We were committed
to combat

578
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,539
the love-fixated society.

579
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,751
(Running footsteps)

580
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,878
- (Classical score playing)
- (Kissing)

581
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,722
(Joe's voice) I really believed
in our little flock,

582
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,224
but of course,
that was naive of me.

583
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,728
Over time,
even the strongest

584
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,938
couldn't stay true
to our manifest.

585
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:15,151
Third of the fifth. My third
intercourse this week,

586
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,487
- again with Alex.
- Third.

587
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,533
Haven't we stated
that we fuck each guy once?

588
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,622
I don't think
you can understand Alex.

589
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,666
(Laughs)
I don't want to.

590
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,918
- Our relationship...
- Relationship?

591
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,711
There you are.

592
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:38,341
Do you think you know
everything about sex?

593
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,432
(Whispers) The secret ingredient
to sex... is love.

594
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:56,943
For me, love was just
lust with jealousy added.

595
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,196
Everything else
was total nonsense.

596
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:04,784
For every hundred crimes
committed in the name of love,

597
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,954
only one is committed
in the name of sex.

598
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,289
That's quite a statement.

599
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,084
Well, it all
strengthened my wish

600
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,169
for a serious education.

601
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,392
Glasgow.

602
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,522
Aberdeen.

603
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,942
(Joe)
Why are you smiling?

604
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,779
Oh, I just pictured
how an education

605
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,990
would be conveyed
in your storytelling.

606
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,076
Well, that's nothing
to smile about.

607
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,495
I understand that.

608
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,750
So what kind
of education did you get?

609
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,545
I began studying medicine
like my father.

610
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,882
But it was harder and harder
for me to concentrate,

611
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,470
so I studied less and less
till finally I dropped out.

612
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,099
So instead I began
to look for a job.

613
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,729
It turned out
it was hard to get a job

614
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,106
that paid
even halfway decently.

615
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,902
I didn't really know
how to do anything,

616
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,571
so I didn't have
high hopes

617
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,114
when I applied
for a position

618
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,617
as an assistant
at a printing house.

619
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,120
So could you tell me
a little bit more

620
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,790
about your background?

621
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:38,085
- Um...
- Education-wise.

622
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,214
Oh. Well,
I finished high school

623
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,842
and decided
to study medicine...

624
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,054
But I didn't finish.

625
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,807
I know it sounds
a bit pointless coming here.

626
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,309
- Right.
- I just really need a job

627
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,353
and I've tried everywhere.

628
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,355
I don't usually
give jobs to people

629
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,315
just because they need one.

630
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,860
What about
secretarial skills?

631
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,821
Do you have any of those?

632
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,865
No, I didn't think
you needed skills.

633
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,952
You didn't think
you needed skills

634
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,579
for this position
as a secretary?

635
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,164
No.

636
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,749
Can you open
an envelope?

637
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,586
Yeah, I... yes, I think
I can open an envelope.

638
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,880
Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

639
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,133
I shall discuss
this conversation

640
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,928
with Mr. Jerome,
my boss.

641
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,600
(Young Joe) Do you think
there's a chance?

642
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,269
I doubt it.

643
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,229
Oh.

644
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,648
(Knocks on door)

645
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,042
Well, apparently

646
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,712
having absolutely
no experience

647
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,797
is absolutely fine
for this job.

648
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,966
You've got it.

649
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,510
Oh.

650
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,929
Does that mean
I should start tomorrow?

651
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,265
Yeah, I suppose it does.

652
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,393
(Young Joe)
Good morning.

653
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,686
(Secretary) Right.

654
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,319
- (Clears throat)
- (Knocks on door)

655
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,904
Yes?

656
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,825
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

657
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,745
I just wanted to introduce you
to our new junior secretary. Joe?

658
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,663
I believe you wanted
to explain her work duties.

659
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,915
Hi.

660
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,082
This is the new
junior secretary, sir.

661
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,500
Liz, can I have
another coffee?

662
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,377
- Yes, of course, sir.
- Thank you.

663
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,548
Hi.

664
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,762
Jerome?

665
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,056
Your first love.

666
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,730
I bet you didn't think I'd make
something of myself, right?

667
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,732
And now here I sit,

668
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,818
the director's chair
of m&j Morris ltd.

669
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,490
Yes, quite surprising.

670
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,033
Surprising?

671
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,952
It's a sign from God.

672
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,541
You know, I've thought
about you often since then.

673
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,711
Have you thought of me?

674
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,217
- Well...
- Ah.

675
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,636
Usually, you know,
my Uncle sits here.

676
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,013
But he's developed
a bit of a tummy problem,

677
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,890
so he's at the spa,
taking long baths,

678
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,725
drinking lots of water.
Poor guy.

679
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,519
And no one knows
for how long,

680
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,689
so now I'm the j
in m&j Morris ltd.

681
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,774
How about that?

682
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,444
We print cards and envelopes
and nonsense like that.

683
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,363
It's a bloody complicated
business, you know.

684
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,823
I don't understand
a word of it.

685
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,785
Come on, I'll show
you around. Yes?

686
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,412
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

687
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,706
Oh, look, there you are.
Good job.

688
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,041
Every time you do a good job,
I say, "good job, Liz."

689
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,710
- Thank you, sir.
- What's her name?

690
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,545
- Liz.
- "Good job, Liz."

691
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,755
- Good job, Liz.
- Good job, Liz!

692
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,966
This is Bobby. Bobby, say hello.
This is Joe.

693
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,635
- (Bobby) Hello.
- He does the business cards.

694
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,514
(Elevator clangs,
whirring)

695
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:28,566
(Elevator clangs)

696
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,942
It stopped.

697
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,986
Fuck.

698
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,282
Yes.

699
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,493
Well, isn't there
an alarm?

700
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,120
To which?

701
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,581
- Isn't there an alarm?
- Alarm, all right, yes.

702
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,168
- Good thinking. I'll press this.
- (Bell rings)

703
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,672
Imagine...

704
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,300
You look just as great
all these years later.

705
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,052
Oh no.

706
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,724
(Sighs)
No.

707
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,059
No?

708
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,479
- Wha?
- No, Jerome, this won't work.

709
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,315
- Which won't work?
- This.

710
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,027
Why not?

711
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,613
You're not really my type.

712
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,700
That's how it's gonna be?

713
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,286
- Yes.
- All right.

714
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,086
Fuck's sake.

715
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,005
(Sighs)

716
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,347
Okay.

717
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,442
- (Young Joe) Umm...
- Give me your hand.

718
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,737
In a fireman's grip.

719
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:58,697
Ooh!

720
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,199
- You okay?
- Yeah.

721
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,204
Why didn't you
have sex with him?

722
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,540
I'm not quite sure.

723
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,126
I've shagged lots
of idiots.

724
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,545
I suppose
he fired you then.

725
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,672
No. If he had fired me,

726
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,215
then he would've lost.

727
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:23,222
As I didn't recall anyone
having defined my work duties,

728
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:27,101
I decided to clean up
in order to smooth the waters.

729
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,278
- (Liz) Good morning, sir.
- Any calls?

730
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,696
No sir.

731
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:45,995
What have you done?

732
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,873
Oh. I cleaned up.

733
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,291
You cleaned up?

734
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,877
It... it was
quite messy and...

735
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,461
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

736
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,422
She cleaned up.

737
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,341
I know...
I didn't know, sir.

738
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,760
- I was away from my desk.
- Are you completely mad?

739
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,431
(Door slams)

740
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,352
What is the tea
and pastry doing here?

741
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,479
I thought that's what
you wanted for breakfast.

742
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,939
You thought? Mmm!

743
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,232
You're not supposed
to think.

744
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,609
I don't pay you
to think, do I?

745
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,818
This is a do-over.

746
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,486
- A do-over?
- Right.

747
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,697
Pick it up,
take it outside

748
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,199
and do it again.

749
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,046
- (Knocks on door)
- One moment.

750
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,598
- Come in.
- (Door opens)

751
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,228
Would now be a good time
for some tea and cake?

752
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,896
Sure, why not.

753
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,733
Where the fuck is
my cake fork?

754
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,943
Cake fork?

755
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,569
- Right.
- Well...

756
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,154
I would've got you one,

757
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,490
but it just...
Feels inappropriate.

758
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,176
Unmanly.

759
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,511
Feminine.

760
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,429
On the other hand,

761
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,473
you must say
that a cake fork is...

762
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,725
Is a rather
practical tool.

763
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:37,189
It's like a cross between
a knife and a fork.

764
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,275
The point is
that you're supposed

765
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,026
to be able to hold
the cake dish with one hand,

766
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,028
then cut it
with the other...

767
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,491
And then eat it
with the fork.

768
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,160
It's not feminine.
It's at least bourgeois.

769
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,831
It's said that the...
The bolsheviks

770
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,833
during their rampage
through Russia,

771
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,584
to separate
the men from the boys,

772
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,629
or rather the bourgeoisie
from the proletariat,

773
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,131
they brought a boy,

774
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,757
and before
burning down a house

775
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,303
they sent him in to make sure
they had cake forks.

776
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,600
That's not true.

777
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,227
(Chuckles)

778
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,481
I don't have
the story first-hand.

779
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:23,110
- (Young Joe) Hello.
- (Man) Hi.

780
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:26,238
Hi, I was wondering
if you could help me.

781
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,324
It's suddenly gone
very dirty.

782
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,370
(Young Joe) See, you put your
dirty fingers on there.

783
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,331
Maybe we should
wash your hands.

784
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,082
Yeah, better.

785
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,669
- (Young Joe) Mm-hmm.
- (Snorts)

786
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,713
You must be
very talented.

787
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,673
- Yeah sure.
- Mmm.

788
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,059
(Joe's voice) If you had asked
Jerome, he would've said

789
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,227
that I was the one
who had declared war.

790
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,565
Many times
he'd take me into town,

791
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,401
just so I could
hold his coat.

792
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,362
- (Young Joe) There.
- (Jerome) Where?

793
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,989
There,
behind the green car.

794
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,409
It's not big enough.

795
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,411
It is,
there's plenty of space.

796
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,497
(Sighs)
I saw it.

797
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,082
It's not enough space.

798
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,250
I'm telling you
there's plenty of space.

799
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,589
(Scoffs, mutters)

800
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,175
No.

801
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,014
Can I try?

802
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,809
(Sighs)
Can you try?

803
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,644
I'm a wizard at this.

804
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,354
I just tried it.
There's not enough space, Joe.

805
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,481
You just saw me do it.
There's not enough space.

806
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,732
Okay?

807
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:46,485
- Can I try?
- You wanna try?

808
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,697
Why not?

809
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,060
- (Gear shift clicks)
- (Engine stops)

810
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,705
(Joe's voice)
It was about this time

811
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,709
that a dramatic change
happened inside of me.

812
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,463
I could suddenly see

813
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,591
a kind of order
in the mess.

814
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,093
It was all
very, very wrong.

815
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,055
I wanted to be
one of Jerome's things.

816
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,892
I wanted to be picked up

817
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,479
and put down
again and again.

818
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,981
I wanted to be treated
by his hands,

819
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,443
according to some
sophisticated principle

820
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,154
that I didn't understand.

821
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,864
His strong hands?

822
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,741
Yes, but now it was

823
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,784
no longer
just about his hands.

824
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,288
It was as if everything
about him was different,

825
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,665
which of course it wasn't,

826
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,334
and I knew that in my head.

827
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,461
And I scolded myself
for seeing him

828
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,046
in this new light.

829
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,840
Love is blind.

830
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,051
No, no, no, it's worse.

831
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,429
Love distorts things.

832
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,432
Or even worse,
love is something

833
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,518
you've never asked for.

834
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,521
The erotic was
something I asked for

835
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,856
or even demanded of men.

836
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,609
But this idiotic love...

837
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,530
I felt humiliated by it...

838
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,325
And all the dishonesty
that follows.

839
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,080
The erotic is
about saying yes.

840
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,709
Love appeals
to the lowest instincts,

841
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,128
wrapped up in lies.

842
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,755
How do you say yes

843
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,800
when you mean no
and vice versa?

844
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,139
I'm ashamed
of what I became,

845
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,725
but it was
beyond my control.

846
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,813
You know what
you're doing now?

847
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,566
No, what am I doing?

848
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,360
You're defending
your personality.

849
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:36,405
I thought the point
was to reveal it.

850
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,831
(Joe's voice) At this time
I took up walking again.

851
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,666
I walked in the forest.

852
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,631
The forest
of my childhood.

853
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,678
I took the same walk
again and again.

854
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,849
Right turn
after the gatehouse,

855
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,643
and right again
by the ash tree,

856
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,563
which has the most beautiful
leaves in the forest.

857
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:14,735
And further on past
the lady with her poodle

858
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,404
and the old man
on the bench.

859
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,371
I couldn't free myself

860
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:30,125
of the image of Jerome
and his careless elegance.

861
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,552
And during this time,
when I was with other men,

862
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,431
I forbade them to touch
my body with their hands.

863
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,434
(Grunting)

864
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,647
And soon I stopped
having sex altogether.

865
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,568
I tried to meet him
all the time.

866
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,404
I found out
where he lived,

867
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,407
but of course never dared
ring his doorbell.

868
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,746
I worked for a long time
on a letter

869
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:11,208
in which I told him
about my feelings for him.

870
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,669
A month would pass

871
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,837
before I had built up
enough courage

872
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,131
to deliver it.

873
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:31,103
I'm sorry.
Isn't this Jerome's office?

874
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,357
I'm happy to say
that this never has been

875
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,734
and never will be
Jerome's office.

876
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,570
But my nephew has
been standing in for me

877
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,906
while I've been unwell.

878
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,409
Was that a letter for him?

879
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,453
- Yes.
- Give it to me

880
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,289
and I will make sure
he gets it.

881
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,546
I can't promise
when that might be,

882
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,340
as he's long gone.

883
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,259
- (Briefcase closes)
- How the young finance

884
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,928
their irrepressible
desire for travel

885
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,763
is a mystery to me.

886
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,682
So he's gone?

887
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,475
Deserted us, yes.

888
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,020
Raving about
a trip around the world

889
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,440
- and married and all.
- Married?

890
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,233
Married, yes.

891
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,611
Flown the Coop
with my secretary.

892
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,030
Liz.

893
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,165
And your job?

894
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:36,793
It turned out that
Jerome's Uncle demanded

895
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,254
a bit more knowledge
about the business, so...

896
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,548
That was
the end of love then?

897
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,470
Well, maybe it's not
quite as simple.

898
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:50,682
But more
about that later,

899
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,684
as they say
in the novels.

900
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:56,104
And Jerome
just disappeared?

901
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,107
Yes, though I tried
to keep him,

902
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,777
in my own way,
mentally,

903
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:05,697
as I masturbated on the train
amongst other people.

904
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,576
You masturbated
on the train?

905
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,620
- On the seat?
- Yes, of course.

906
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,747
(Train rattling)

907
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,836
(Joe's voice)
I did a Jigsaw puzzle.

908
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,296
(Seligman's voice)
A Jigsaw puzzle?

909
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,720
(Joe's voice) I found details
in the other passengers

910
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,431
that reminded me
of Jerome.

911
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,849
But in the long run,

912
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,184
I couldn't hold on
to the details of him,

913
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,270
no matter
how hard I tried.

914
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,273
Maybe that's
how it is with memory.

915
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,568
You... you remember
silhouettes,

916
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,611
the essentials.

917
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,990
But that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

918
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,409
(Water trickling)

919
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,703
(Joe's voice) Of course,
as silhouettes in the winter,

920
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,788
the trees are difficult
to tell apart.

921
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,456
See these buds?

922
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,709
(Joe's voice) My father
wrestled courageously

923
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,295
with his flora
and tree type guides.

924
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,882
It's actually...

925
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:52,721
The souls of the trees
we see in the winter.

926
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,140
In the summer, everything
is green and idyllic,

927
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,933
but in the winter,

928
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,936
the branches and the trunks,
they all stand out.

929
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,771
Just look at how crooked
they all are.

930
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,650
The branches have to carry
all of the leaves

931
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,068
into the sunlight.

932
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:11,197
It's one long struggle
for survival.

933
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,494
(Joe's voice)
My father surprised me

934
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:20,332
by calling the naked trunks
the souls of the trees.

935
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,043
A poetic thought
that was rare for him,

936
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,170
as by his own account

937
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,714
he preferred
the empirical sciences.

938
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,136
(Seligman)
And after Jerome?

939
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,430
I reacted...

940
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,266
Well, let's just say,

941
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,060
aggressively.

942
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,937
How?

943
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,274
By intensifying
my hunt for men.

944
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,153
You know
these supermarket doors

945
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:53,740
that open and close by way
of some kind of sensor?

946
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,785
Now compare
these doors to my cunt

947
01:05:56,911 --> 01:06:00,705
and add an extraordinarily
sensitive sensor.

948
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,876
My sensitive door opening

949
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,128
gave me an opportunity
to develop

950
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,047
my morphological studies

951
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,257
from leaves to genitals.

952
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,598
I embarked
on a trip through

953
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,017
what, in the lingo
of children's books,

954
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:25,188
one might call the country
of the big black cocks...

955
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,110
The country
of the small yellow cocks

956
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,237
and so on.

957
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,322
And most of all,
I battled my way

958
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:37,283
through an untold number
of circumcised cocks.

959
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,163
By the way, did you know
that if you combine

960
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,791
all the foreskin
cut off through history

961
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,836
it would reach to Mars
and back again?

962
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,219
(Train passing)

963
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,858
(Joe) Mrs. H.

964
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,500
- By now I had built up
a sizeable circle of men...

965
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:28,668
(Beeps)

966
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,462
...and was starting
to have trouble

967
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,671
remembering who was who.

968
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,882
(Man) Hello, sweetheart.
Want to meet?

969
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,800
- (Beeps)
- (Man #2) It's Fisher.

970
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,887
I'm lying here, thinking
of you and what you said.

971
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,889
I'm not angry at all
if that's what you think.

972
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,475
- (Beeps)
- (Man #3) Hi, Joe, it's rob again.

973
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,393
I had a really good time
seeing you.

974
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:47,479
- Give me... give me a call.
- (Beeps)

975
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:50,648
(Man# 4 hi, Joe, I left
a couple of messages.

976
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,109
- Is everything all right?
- (Joe's voice) I quickly gave up

977
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,279
trying to remember
the individual relationships.

978
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,823
It was impossible,

979
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:02,160
and impossible to predict
what they wanted to hear.

980
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,663
So I invented a method.

981
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,499
(Clatters)

982
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,336
(Joe's voice)
It was all based on chance.

983
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,506
(Clatters)

984
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:18,009
A one meant
an overly loving answer.

985
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:24,933
A two, not quite as passionate
but still positive.

986
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,684
And so on up to five,

987
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,520
which was
a complete rejection.

988
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:31,147
And six,
no answer at all.

989
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:36,194
(Beeps)

990
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,029
(Rings, clicks)

991
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,490
(Beeps)

992
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,158
Hey, Eddie, it's me.

993
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,160
Listen, I've given it
a lot of thought

994
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,080
and I've come to the conclusion
that we're done.

995
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:48,748
- Bye.
- (Beeps)

996
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,333
(Joe's voice)
The trick with this method

997
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,127
was that
I didn't have to worry

998
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,045
about the individual
relationships...

999
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,631
Hi, Patrick, it's Joe.

1000
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:59,217
...but instead became
completely unpredictable,

1001
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:02,387
which of course
drove the men even Wilder.

1002
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,306
You're quite annoying,

1003
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,143
so I don't want
to see you anymore.

1004
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,853
Please don't call back.

1005
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,772
(Seligman's voice) That sounds
rather stressful.

1006
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,941
(Joe's voice)
Yes, actually it was.

1007
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,611
But fortunately I had
my little book of comfort.

1008
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,116
When I needed
comfort or peace,

1009
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,493
I took out my herbarium

1010
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,246
and looked
at my favourite leaves...

1011
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:32,959
Ash, trembling Aspen
and lime.

1012
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,509
When you're dealing with

1013
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:44,137
a larger group of lovers,
as I was,

1014
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,264
there will typically
be a difference

1015
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,974
in their qualities.

1016
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,476
H was a sticky bastard.

1017
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,647
You have to leave.
I've got guests for dinner.

1018
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,524
But he's not coming
until 7:00.

1019
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,110
No.
(Sighs)

1020
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,862
But 7:00
isn't that far away.

1021
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,989
(Plates rattling)

1022
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,413
Do you love me?

1023
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,211
(Joe's voice)
A was to arrive at 7:00,

1024
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,546
and I needed
to get H out of there.

1025
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,259
I love you too much.

1026
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,597
You keep promising,
but I understand now

1027
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:31,684
that you'll never leave
your family for my sake.

1028
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,230
It's sad, but...

1029
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,566
It's your choice.

1030
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,486
It's not satisfying for me

1031
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,364
that I can't
have you completely.

1032
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:50,161
Which is why we can't see
each other any longer.

1033
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,959
Goodbye.

1034
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,798
Look, I...

1035
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,388
And have a nice life.

1036
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:11,474
(Whispers)
Oh. Ugh. Wow.

1037
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,559
(Ticking)

1038
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,568
(Knocks on door)

1039
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,916
My darling, I'm yours.

1040
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,836
I've left her.

1041
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,463
(Kisses)

1042
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:50,221
- (Woman) Has he gone inside?
- (Child) Yes.

1043
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:53,725
(Woman)
Is the door closed?

1044
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:08,239
- Uh, hello.
- Hello.

1045
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,324
(Woman)
Apologise.

1046
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,619
We... had promised
not to come up.

1047
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:17,707
We just wanted
to make sure

1048
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,878
he got here safely, now that
he's made the big decision.

1049
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:26,841
May the children
see him inside?

1050
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,344
(Exhales)

1051
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,901
What a nice place.

1052
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,572
It's... so bohemian.

1053
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,787
Oh, that's right.
(Sighs)

1054
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,539
- You need the car key.
- Uh, no, I don't need the car.

1055
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,291
Oh yes, you do.

1056
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,335
He likes the car.

1057
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:03,753
Here.

1058
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,382
- No, please. Just take it.
- I don't want it.

1059
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,133
- Just take it.
- I don't want the fucking car!

1060
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,931
(Mr H) It's all right.

1061
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,392
We'll get the bus home.

1062
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,602
The children
might as well get used

1063
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,230
to public transport now,
right?

1064
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,232
Of course,
their standard of living

1065
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,317
won't be the same
anymore, but...

1066
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:35,159
(Young Joe)
Hey. What's this?

1067
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,703
It's a present.

1068
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:41,290
A pillow he has
embroidered himself.

1069
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,794
- (Mr H) And who's it for?
- Daddy.

1070
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,424
I do hope it's all right
if the children call

1071
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,842
their father "daddy" here.

1072
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:51,968
If you prefer,

1073
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:55,430
they can call him "him"

1074
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,724
or simply "the man."

1075
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,436
To be honest, my first
thought was never ever

1076
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,354
to let either of you
see the children,

1077
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,440
but then I changed my mind.

1078
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,359
I thought it only right that
their father be confronted

1079
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,987
by the little people
whose lives he has destroyed.

1080
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,532
Give daddy your present.

1081
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,581
It's a car the little dear
has embroidered.

1082
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,874
(Clears throat)

1083
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,084
I'm aware that
not everyone can see it,

1084
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,504
but with the heart
one can see much,

1085
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:32,049
however unimportant that
information may be to you.

1086
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,595
Would it be all right

1087
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:38,556
if I showed the children
the whoring bed?

1088
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:42,935
After all, they also have
a stake in this event.

1089
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,275
You need
to see it, right?

1090
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:52,320
(Whispers) Let's go see
daddy's favourite place.

1091
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,364
Come on, boys.

1092
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,493
Oh!

1093
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,913
(Sighs, chuckles)

1094
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,249
So this is
where it all happened.

1095
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,425
You should try
to memorise this room,

1096
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,636
especially the bed.

1097
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:20,515
It'll stand you in good stead
later in therapy.

1098
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,183
(Laughs)

1099
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,769
Here I sit,
rambling on about therapy

1100
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,021
without a thought
of what it might cost.

1101
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,774
I do hope you don't think
we're here to beg.

1102
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,364
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1103
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,574
(Chuckles)
I'm being silly.

1104
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,117
Mommy's being silly.

1105
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,663
Let's have a cup of tea.

1106
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,790
(Clattering)

1107
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:53,798
(Sighs)

1108
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:02,306
The children's father likes

1109
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:04,475
two lumps of sugar
in his tea.

1110
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:23,995
- (Knocks on door)
- (Mr H) Mmm!

1111
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,663
- I'll get it.
- (Young Joe) Hm-mmm.

1112
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,290
No no no,
please please please.

1113
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:31,043
- Hello.
- Hello.

1114
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,796
- Yes?
- Uh...

1115
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,132
Oh, how nice!
Lovely.

1116
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,176
- Boys. Come here.
- Is Joe here?

1117
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,761
This might be interesting.

1118
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,139
Hi. Yes.

1119
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,850
- This is my son. Yes.
- Hello, hello.

1120
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,518
Good boy.
Look him in the eyes.

1121
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,811
(Man) I'm Andy. Hello.

1122
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,396
Friend of Joe's then?

1123
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,023
- Yeah.
- You known each other long?

1124
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:55,526
- Um, not that long, no.
- Not terribly long?

1125
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:56,861
- No.
- Oh.

1126
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,663
(Mr H)
A ménage a trois.

1127
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,334
It's all so exotic.

1128
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,503
So... broad-minded.

1129
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,798
On that point...

1130
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:20,551
I failed.

1131
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,595
No doubt about it.

1132
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,434
Boys, now is
the time to be alert

1133
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,772
and ask all the questions
your hearts' desire,

1134
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:34,940
because...

1135
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:39,654
I hope that you shall
never have to encounter

1136
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,032
such people or be in such
a situation ever again.

1137
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,160
- (Spoon clatters)
- Well? Hmm?

1138
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,037
You don't have
any questions?

1139
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,082
No?

1140
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,627
Well, I'll start, shall I?

1141
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,506
Approximately
how many lives

1142
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:01,676
do you think she has time
to destroy in one day?

1143
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,678
- (Cup thuds)
- Five?

1144
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,221
50?

1145
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,848
Or several hundreds?

1146
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:14,647
Look, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

1147
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,028
Boys...

1148
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,992
- I don't love your father.
- (Scoffs)

1149
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,412
(Mr H) She's just saying that
to make us feel better.

1150
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,707
I'm sure you understand that.

1151
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,542
Because if it were
a joke, I mean...

1152
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,421
If... this were
really a joke,

1153
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,673
then it would be
a joke so cruel.

1154
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:49,432
No one can be
that cruel.

1155
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:53,561
To destroy a mesh
of feelings woven

1156
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:57,982
over 20 years is no joke,
I can assure you.

1157
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,411
Well...

1158
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:13,664
If three's a crowd,
then seven must be a bit

1159
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,458
of a challenge
for the pretty miss.

1160
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,296
I must say I have
a hard time

1161
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,798
picturing her
enjoying loneliness.

1162
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:28,179
I think we'd better grab
the chance to get away,

1163
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:31,474
before things
become grotesque.

1164
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,142
(Crying)
Come on.

1165
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,563
- No, dad!
- No. No. No.

1166
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:41,025
Come on. You wouldn't want
to give your father

1167
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,235
a guilty conscience now,
would you?

1168
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:45,988
(Screams)

1169
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,283
(Grunts)

1170
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:51,368
(Sobbing)

1171
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,290
(Screams)

1172
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,757
So how did this episode
affect your life?

1173
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,676
Not at all.

1174
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:12,097
- Not at all?
- No.

1175
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:16,477
You can't make an omelette
without breaking a few eggs.

1176
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:22,733
Oh, that's true.

1177
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,196
Some people...

1178
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:29,573
Blame the addict.

1179
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:33,327
Other people feel sorry
for the addict.

1180
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:37,581
But I was an addict
out of lust, not out of need.

1181
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:39,124
(Chuckles softly)

1182
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,876
You would say that,
wouldn't you?

1183
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,880
And lust that led
to destruction around me...

1184
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:46,882
Everywhere I went.

1185
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:52,847
Well, addiction
sometimes leads to an...

1186
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,473
Absence of empathy.

1187
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,936
You can't fight a lion
and blow the noses

1188
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:01,105
of your children
at the same time.

1189
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,193
For me, nymphomania
was callousness.

1190
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:09,905
(Clicks tongue)

1191
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,116
You're very stubborn.

1192
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:14,285
But what about yourself?

1193
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:17,454
How did you feel
during all this?

1194
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,341
Did you feel good

1195
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,135
or did you feel bad?

1196
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:41,645
Mrs. H was right
about the loneliness.

1197
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:43,981
I'd be lying if I said

1198
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,400
it hadn't been
my constant companion.

1199
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:51,322
So you were
with all these men

1200
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,866
and you still felt alone?

1201
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,958
I didn't want
to tell you about it...

1202
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:07,296
But you've led me
into a trap.

1203
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,760
It was a certain feeling.

1204
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:21,936
Oh, how awful that everything
has to be so trivial.

1205
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,406
When I was seven,
I had to have an operation.

1206
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:38,744
Nothing serious,
but it did require anaesthesia.

1207
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,623
I had already been
pre-medicated

1208
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,292
and was feeling
all right.

1209
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:47,211
But when I looked
into the room

1210
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,046
where the doctors
and nurses

1211
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:50,923
were preparing
for the operation...

1212
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,760
It was as if I had
to pass through

1213
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:58,847
an impenetrable gate
all by myself.

1214
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,560
It wasn't just that
I missed my mom.

1215
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,896
I don't think
I missed my dad,

1216
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,856
even though
he was the nice one.

1217
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,610
It was as if I was
completely alone

1218
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,112
in the universe.

1219
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:19,994
As if my whole body was filled
with loneliness and tears.

1220
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,812
And I'm still not allowed
to feel sorry for you?

1221
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,816
Shall we go on?

1222
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,825
What are you reading?

1223
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:02,619
I'm not reading really.
I'm just

1224
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,539
reacquainting myself
with Edgar Allan poe.

1225
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,833
I don't know him.

1226
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:10,836
No. Well, he was a...

1227
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,049
A very anxiety-ridden man.

1228
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:24,767
He died in the most
fearful way you can imagine,

1229
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:28,062
in something called
delirium tremens.

1230
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:33,609
It occurs when a long time
abuse of alcohol

1231
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:37,279
is followed by...
By a sudden abstinence.

1232
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:42,868
And your body goes into some
kind of a hypersensitive shock.

1233
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:47,372
You can see the most
horrifying hallucinations

1234
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:51,168
like rats and snakes
and cockroaches

1235
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:55,631
coming out of the floor and
worms slithering in the walls.

1236
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:01,637
One's entire nervous system
is on high alert

1237
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:05,140
and you have a constant panic
and paranoia.

1238
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:09,728
And then
the circulatory system fails.

1239
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,231
But the panic and horror...

1240
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,110
Remains until
the moment of death.

1241
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:28,038
(Rustles)

1242
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,670
I know what delirium is.

1243
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:40,467
(Seligman's voice) "During the
whole of a dull, dark,

1244
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:44,054
and soundless day
in the autumn of the year,

1245
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:47,266
when the clouds hung
oppressively low in the heavens,

1246
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,270
I had been passing alone,
on horseback,

1247
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,064
through a singularly dreary
tract of country,

1248
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,817
and at length found myself,

1249
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:59,319
as the shades
of the evening drew on,

1250
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:03,282
within view of the melancholy
house of Usher."

1251
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,353
(Father moans)

1252
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:35,731
(Whispers)
Hey, dad.

1253
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:48,285
(Sighs)
Hey, luv.

1254
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:52,372
How are you?

1255
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,125
I fought with mom.

1256
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,294
(Sighing)

1257
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,630
She's...
She's not coming.

1258
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,887
You ought not
to fight with her.

1259
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,306
You know kay's fear
of hospitals.

1260
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,811
I know
she's not coming.

1261
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:17,814
We already said everything
we needed to say.

1262
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:22,653
Kay and I
said goodbye at home.

1263
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,031
I don't want her
here at all.

1264
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,203
I can't accept that.

1265
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:34,539
(Snorts)
You'll have to.

1266
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,501
She's a cowardly
stupid bitch.

1267
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,171
No, she's not.

1268
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:45,092
- Yes. Yes.
- No, she's not. No, she's not.

1269
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,511
Yes, she is, and you've
never understood that.

1270
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:01,316
(Breathes deeply)
Mmm.

1271
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,528
Doesn't it scare you?

1272
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:07,739
(Chuckles)
No.

1273
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:12,160
No.

1274
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,624
How can you not
be afraid?

1275
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,548
I've seen so many die.

1276
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,052
Then there's that...

1277
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:32,014
Epicurus quote about
not fearing death.

1278
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,268
"When we are,
death has not come.

1279
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,396
When death has come...

1280
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,690
We are not."

1281
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:48,405
We know what's
going to happen.

1282
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:51,491
I also know all of the drugs
the doctors have to offer.

1283
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:53,785
So no...

1284
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,079
I am not...

1285
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:58,498
I am not afraid.

1286
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:03,754
Hmm.
A beautiful girl.

1287
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,883
- Beautiful dad.
- (Chuckles)

1288
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:22,731
(Sighs)

1289
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,448
(Shouts) K-kay!

1290
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:34,743
- Daddy, it's okay.
- (Gasping)

1291
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,078
Kay?

1292
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:43,293
(Sobbing)

1293
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,128
Daddy.

1294
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:51,802
Hey.

1295
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,015
It's gonna be okay.

1296
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,121
Don't you want
to take a little walk?

1297
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,457
I'll stay with your father
in the meantime.

1298
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,334
You'll stay?

1299
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,878
- You'll stay here?
- Yes.

1300
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,284
(Sniffles)

1301
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,543
(Breathing heavily)

1302
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,756
Ash tree leaves.

1303
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:16,511
Where did you find them?

1304
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,472
They were in the park.

1305
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:29,566
It truly is the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

1306
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:34,905
But, dad...

1307
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:38,742
How do you
recognise it in winter?

1308
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:41,828
I've told you
a hundred times.

1309
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,540
But I can't remember.

1310
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,006
When the ash tree
was created...

1311
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:58,970
It made all the other trees
in the forest jealous...

1312
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,182
'Cause it was...

1313
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:06,853
It was the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

1314
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,816
It had the strongest wood.

1315
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:17,781
It was the world tree
in norse mythology.

1316
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:22,118
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

1317
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,667
And when
all the other trees...

1318
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,670
Saw the ash tree with its...

1319
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,547
Black buds...

1320
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:37,008
They all started laughing.

1321
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:39,177
"Oh, look...

1322
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:44,099
The ash tree's had
its fingers in the ashes."

1323
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:52,107
(Young Joe crying)

1324
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:04,286
- (Father grunting)
- Dad. Daddy!

1325
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:07,872
Daddy. Daddy, what's wrong?
Daddy, what's wrong?

1326
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,874
What's wrong?

1327
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,876
- (Screaming)
- Daddy, it's me!

1328
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,878
It's me, daddy.
It's me!

1329
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:17,591
Help! Help!

1330
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:20,510
- Daddy, it's okay.
- Okay.

1331
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,512
- (Alarm beeping)
- (Nurse) Okay.

1332
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,682
- (Screaming continues)
- (Nurse) It's okay.

1333
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:28,935
- It's okay. It's all right.
- (Father babbles)

1334
01:33:30,354 --> 01:33:32,063
(Mumbles)

1335
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:33,398
It's all right.

1336
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:46,578
- (Doctor) We have to fixate him.
- (Father grunting)

1337
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:48,163
What are you doing?

1338
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,123
What are you
doing to me?

1339
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:58,340
Joe! What are
you doing to me?

1340
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,467
(Screaming)

1341
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:12,062
- Joe! Help! Joe!
- (Crying)

1342
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,322
You should take
a break.

1343
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,200
(Softly)
Okay.

1344
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:27,327
(Screaming continues)

1345
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,830
(Lights humming)

1346
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,672
(Machinery humming)

1347
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:27,804
(Young Joe) Excuse me.

1348
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:31,474
Can you help me
to clean... um...

1349
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:33,852
(Nurse) Oh.

1350
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:36,688
Okay, mister...
Don't worry.

1351
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:39,524
- Just... I need some help.
- (Clattering)

1352
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,769
(Nurse) We're going to have
to change the sheets.

1353
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:27,655
Ready?

1354
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:40,752
(Machinery humming)

1355
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,216
(Moaning)

1356
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:58,978
(Crying)

1357
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,762
(Joe's voice)
When he died,

1358
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:36,182
I had no feelings left.

1359
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:38,810
(Seligman's voice) Well, that's
certainly understandable.

1360
01:37:38,894 --> 01:37:40,562
(Joe's voice) No.

1361
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,564
I don't know
what happened to me.

1362
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,984
It was very shameful.

1363
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,403
(Seligman's voice)
Shameful?

1364
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,697
I don't understand.

1365
01:38:16,348 --> 01:38:18,474
I lubricated.

1366
01:38:33,532 --> 01:38:35,867
I know you like
to present yourself

1367
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:39,412
in a negative way and that
you have this kind of dark bias

1368
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:41,581
that you're worse
than everyone else.

1369
01:38:41,707 --> 01:38:44,250
But this story doesn't add
to that belief.

1370
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:49,839
It's extremely common
to react sexually in a crisis.

1371
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,966
It may be shameful to you,

1372
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:56,471
but in literature
there's many worse examples.

1373
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:04,562
(Train approaching)

1374
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:08,983
(Cup rattles)

1375
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,210
You listen
to music, I see?

1376
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:30,505
Yes.
I like it a lot.

1377
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:32,966
Shall I find a tape?

1378
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:35,802
No, if there's a tape
already in the machine,

1379
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,012
- I'd like to hear that.
- It's something

1380
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:40,348
I've been listening to
a lot lately, though it's not

1381
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:44,143
an entirely complete
recording, unfortunately.

1382
01:39:44,269 --> 01:39:46,771
- What is it?
- It's bach,

1383
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:49,399
from his little organ book.

1384
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:53,778
"Ich ruf zu dir,
herr jesu Christ."

1385
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:58,658
The theme is
originally a hymn,

1386
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:03,246
but bach rearranged it
and embellished it a little.

1387
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:05,415
He was the master
of polyphony,

1388
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,291
if you know what that is.

1389
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:09,669
No. Yet another thing
I don't know.

1390
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,462
Well, polyphony is

1391
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:13,172
from the middle ages.

1392
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:15,842
It's an entirely
European phenomenon.

1393
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,802
It's distinguished by...

1394
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:20,680
By the idea
that every voice

1395
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:23,266
is its own melody

1396
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:26,185
but together in harmony.

1397
01:40:27,771 --> 01:40:30,189
Bach's forerunner
palestrina,

1398
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:33,234
he wrote many works
for several choirs

1399
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:37,030
at the same time,
wallowing in polyphony.

1400
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,532
(Choir singing)

1401
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:49,459
But in my eyes,
bach perfected

1402
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:52,712
the melodic expression
and the harmony.

1403
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:55,256
And also...
Also mixed up with some...

1404
01:40:55,382 --> 01:40:57,717
Rather incomprehensible
mystique

1405
01:40:57,843 --> 01:40:59,635
regarding numbers,

1406
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:03,473
most likely based
on the fibonacci sequence.

1407
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,143
You know, the one that starts
with a zero,

1408
01:41:07,269 --> 01:41:09,312
then comes the one.

1409
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:10,938
The sequence is created

1410
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:13,149
by adding
the two previous numbers

1411
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:14,859
to create the new one,

1412
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:16,861
so it's zero plus one
makes one,

1413
01:41:16,987 --> 01:41:19,572
and one plus one makes two,
and two plus one makes three,

1414
01:41:19,698 --> 01:41:20,865
and three plus two
makes five,

1415
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:22,742
and five plus three
makes eight,

1416
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:24,994
and eight plus five
makes 13.

1417
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:26,996
The sequence has
an interesting connection

1418
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:29,707
to Pythagoras' theorem
and the golden section.

1419
01:41:31,376 --> 01:41:35,004
It was all about finding
a divine methodology

1420
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,464
in art and architecture.

1421
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:38,549
A bit like
the way a tritone...

1422
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:41,052
Which was played on the piano
in your little club...

1423
01:41:41,136 --> 01:41:42,887
- Was supposed to be
a satanic interval.

1424
01:41:43,013 --> 01:41:44,388
(Tritone playing)

1425
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:47,767
The sum of the numeric values
represented in bach's name

1426
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:51,729
is 14, a number he often used
in his compositions.

1427
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:53,898
The clever thing
about bach's name

1428
01:41:54,024 --> 01:41:57,026
is that the numeric value
of the individual letters

1429
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,445
are all fibonacci numbers.

1430
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:04,659
This piece has
three voices:

1431
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:06,119
A bass voice...

1432
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,960
The second voice played
with the left hand...

1433
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:21,092
The first voice played
with the right hand.

1434
01:42:21,176 --> 01:42:24,387
That is called Cantus Firmus
or "Can-Toos Feer-Mus."

1435
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:28,766
And together, these three
voices create the polyphony.

1436
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:35,523
Normally, a nymphomaniac
is seen as

1437
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:38,568
someone who
can't get enough

1438
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:41,487
and therefore has sex
with many different people.

1439
01:42:41,613 --> 01:42:43,156
Well, that of course
is true,

1440
01:42:43,282 --> 01:42:45,366
but if I'm to be honest,

1441
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:47,952
I see it precisely as...

1442
01:42:48,078 --> 01:42:52,957
The sum of all these different
sexual experiences.

1443
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:58,921
So in that way,
I have only one lover.

1444
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:05,928
Since the music
has three voices,

1445
01:43:06,054 --> 01:43:09,265
I will limit myself to
talking about three lovers.

1446
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:14,103
The bass is easy:
That's f.

1447
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:18,232
F had a red car
that he'd bought used.

1448
01:43:20,485 --> 01:43:22,195
As I was having sex

1449
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:25,656
with seven or eight men
every night at the time,

1450
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:28,117
scheduling was tricky

1451
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,537
and they all had to have
precise appointments.

1452
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:34,123
F was a good man.

1453
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:37,126
If he was scheduled
for 10:00,

1454
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,295
he always showed
up around 9:00

1455
01:43:39,421 --> 01:43:41,672
and parked down
in the street.

1456
01:43:41,798 --> 01:43:44,217
I always smiled
when I saw him.

1457
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:47,511
Often I took pity on him

1458
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:49,222
and gave him
a cup of coffee

1459
01:43:49,306 --> 01:43:52,099
while I was finishing
with the one before.

1460
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:57,563
It's hard to say why I'm
choosing to talk about f,

1461
01:43:57,689 --> 01:43:59,899
but he was reassuring,

1462
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:03,736
and he knew exactly what
I wanted when we had sex.

1463
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:07,156
No, I'd go
even further and say

1464
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,283
that there was
a kind of telepathy going on

1465
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:11,202
when we had sex.

1466
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:13,663
- (Breathing heavily)
- Without words,

1467
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:15,873
he knew exactly
what I wanted,

1468
01:44:15,999 --> 01:44:19,752
where he should touch me
and what he should do.

1469
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:26,259
The most sacred goal
for f was my orgasm.

1470
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:29,220
- Well, and then...
- (Laughs)

1471
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:33,099
...the swans answered
in the same voice.

1472
01:44:33,225 --> 01:44:35,184
(Joe's voice)
And granted him privileges

1473
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,436
none of the others received.

1474
01:44:44,194 --> 01:44:46,529
F was the bass voice:

1475
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:50,408
Monotone, predictable
and ritualistic.

1476
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,326
No doubt about it.

1477
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:56,455
But also the foundation
that is so important

1478
01:44:56,581 --> 01:45:00,293
even if, on its own,
it doesn't mean much.

1479
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:02,420
(Organ playing
bass voice)

1480
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,784
(Joe's voice)
G was quite different.

1481
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:39,332
The only one I had to
and wanted to wait for.

1482
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:43,044
When he finally turned up
and I opened the door,

1483
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:46,088
he didn't immediately enter,

1484
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:48,674
the way a cat doesn't
when you let it in,

1485
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,260
as if once
the door is open,

1486
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:54,096
it has all the time
in the world.

1487
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:02,772
But he was more
than a cat.

1488
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:06,359
He was like some kind
of Jaguar or leopard.

1489
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:09,820
He moved like them,

1490
01:46:09,946 --> 01:46:13,115
which turned me on no end.

1491
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:15,242
(Both breathing heavily)

1492
01:46:18,872 --> 01:46:20,331
(Moans)

1493
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:24,960
(Joe's voice)
He was in charge.

1494
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:27,421
That's the way it was.

1495
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:29,548
(Both moaning)

1496
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:37,098
(Organ playing

1497
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:46,315
(Organ playing
both tunes)

1498
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:20,558
(Music stops)

1499
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:25,438
(Joe's voice) Despite my success
in managing

1500
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:28,649
the complicated logistics
involved in arranging

1501
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:31,944
up to 10 daily
sexual satisfactions

1502
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:35,072
while also having
a full-time job,

1503
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:38,159
I was still prone
to a certain sadness.

1504
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:41,412
So when my busy life
allowed a few breaks,

1505
01:47:41,496 --> 01:47:43,747
I used them
to take my walks.

1506
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,126
These repeated walks became

1507
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:49,462
a kind of metaphor
for my life:

1508
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:51,422
Monotonous and pointless.

1509
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:55,634
- (Bangs)
- Yes, precisely like

1510
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,595
the movements
of a caged animal.

1511
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:02,433
Basically, we're all waiting
for permission to die.

1512
01:48:04,686 --> 01:48:06,395
(Birds chirping)

1513
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:11,460
(Seligman's voice) No.

1514
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,462
No, no, no.

1515
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:14,922
No, there...

1516
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:17,675
There are some completely
unrealistic coincidences

1517
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:19,552
in your story
about Jerome.

1518
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,847
First, by chance
he hires you as...

1519
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,684
As an assistant and then
you take a walk in a forest

1520
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,686
that is littered
with photographs of him.

1521
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:31,897
And not only that,
he's present.

1522
01:49:33,024 --> 01:49:34,567
And then like a God,

1523
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:37,111
pulls you up to him
through the clouds.

1524
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:39,989
Goodness gracious.

1525
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:42,408
(Joe's voice)
Jerome was there

1526
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:44,368
because he had just
had a fight with his wife,

1527
01:49:44,494 --> 01:49:46,495
who, in anger,
tore up the photographs

1528
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,622
they just had developed
from their travels.

1529
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:51,000
(Seligman's voice) Oh, I don't know
if I can believe this.

1530
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:53,127
(Joe's voice) Which way do you
think you'd get the most

1531
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,753
out of my story?

1532
01:49:54,879 --> 01:49:57,673
By believing in it
or by not believing in it?

1533
01:49:57,799 --> 01:49:59,800
(Seligman's voice)
No, you're right.

1534
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:01,844
You might have
a point with all this.
