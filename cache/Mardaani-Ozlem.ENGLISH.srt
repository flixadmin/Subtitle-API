1
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,003
Wireless crackling with instructions.

2
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,470
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

3
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,176
Yes, Sir. Okay. Out.

4
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,056
It's always crowded here.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,365
Its okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

6
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,353
Look at that... you scum!

7
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,236
You get awesome chicken on the left here.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,605
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

9
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,711
Morey, stop here. Ma'am...

10
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,138
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

11
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,682
Yes, Sir.

12
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,561
Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

13
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,441
Boss is in a bad mood today.

14
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,314
He's pissed with everyone.

15
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,276
His wife must've screamt at him

16
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,236
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

17
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,159
he forgot to take his wife shopping for their anniversary.

18
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,030
She got so upset she cancelled their dinner reservations.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,367
We can handle the toughest of criminals easily...

20
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,454
...but when it comes to handling
family, we goof up.

21
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,629
So true, Ma'am.

22
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,216
That's why Morey is taking the day off tomorrow.

23
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,003
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's
wedding on Sunday, right?

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,673
Yes, Ma'am.

25
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,551
How is your younger one studying?

26
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,177
Wonder when she studies!

27
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,676
She's always glued to the TV or the computer.

28
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,769
That reminds me...

29
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,769
Hello.

30
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,068
- Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,271
- Done with your revision?
- Of course.

32
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,447
I can hear the TV.

33
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,278
- When are you coming?
- Soon.

34
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:42,220
- Have you got it?
- What?

35
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:42,779
Yes, Ma'am.

36
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,987
I was speaking to Jafar.

37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:45,870
Okay.

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,751
Better get done with your revision till I am back.

39
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,252
Okay, bye.

40
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,039
Have you fed them?

41
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,079
They are getting a royal treatment.

42
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,631
Morey, is feeding them cheese since the afternoon.

43
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,088
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

44
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,302
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

45
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,013
These guys love cheese.

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,431
Our surveillance team is already there, right?

47
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,009
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

48
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,227
Shinde...

49
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,528
The baby's crying...

50
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:49,903
Oh my God!

51
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,698
You son of a...

52
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:54,836
Get up!

53
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,036
Bloody rascal!

54
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,381
Only a mouse can get another mouse out of his hole.

55
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,377
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

56
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,341
We are not going to shoot you.

57
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,255
Please, Ma'am...

58
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,138
I don't have orders to shoot you, you scum.

59
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,261
I have to take you in alive.

60
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,604
- Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,974
- Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,483
God knows who else is hiding inside for a threesome.

63
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,363
Get him!

64
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,530
You son of a...

65
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,825
You have dodged us four times before.

66
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,417
You think we'll let you escape so easily?

67
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,587
Ma'am, I am warning you.
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

68
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,586
Take him away!

69
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,508
Giving refuge to rats spreads plague.

70
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,356
Rehman, you should be thankful to me.

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,198
You could at least make love one last time.

72
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,654
Jafar was all set to spoil it for you.

73
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,325
You are ragging me, aren't you, Ma'am?

74
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,625
Sir's call.

75
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,203
- Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

76
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,749
Yes, we are taking him to the station.

77
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,085
I had ordered you to get him out and nab him...

78
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,960
...not barge right inside the chawl.

79
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,298
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

80
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,658
If we had let him come out
he would definitely have escaped.

81
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,425
We would have arrested him again if he escaped.

82
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,221
But who would be responsible...

83
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,638
...if a civilian was
killed in a shootout?

84
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,269
We had taken precautions, Sir.

85
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,148
Taking rats along was your precaution?

86
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,559
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

87
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,647
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

88
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,486
Your job is to take orders,
not risks. You understand?

89
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,123
Someone please take Sir's wife for shopping.

90
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,840
Go home, Ma'am.

91
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,551
Meera has asked you to come early, right?

92
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,762
If we don't get this rascal's paperwork right...

93
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,893
...he'll find a loophole
to escape from the law.

94
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,182
No chance, Ma'am.

95
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,972
We'll keep the papers ready by morning.

96
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,014
You have a look at it.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,766
Okay.

98
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,972
Sorry, I am late again.

99
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,018
It's okay.

100
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,521
Meera, wake up.
Your Aunty is home.

101
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,347
Sorry...

102
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,857
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

103
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,768
Aunty! You are so late.
Happy birthday, Aunty!

104
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,357
For me?

105
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,240
No, Aunty. I stood first
in the orange belt category.

106
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,452
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

107
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,289
Yes.

108
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,419
Happy birthday to you...

109
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,548
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

110
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,222
Happy birthday to you.

111
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,022
This is for Meera.

112
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,977
And for me? Come on...

113
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,526
Fast, fast, fast.

114
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,445
And this is for you.

115
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,507
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

116
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,641
Just like John Abraham (Indian film star).

117
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,721
Wear these goggles and ride a bike in style...

118
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,352
Hey, hey!

119
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,688
If I look like John Abraham, then girls will chase me.

120
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,102
Show me something else.

121
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,405
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

122
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,073
I have a lot of variety.

123
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,195
Try this one.

124
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,702
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

125
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,080
He was a cop just like you.

126
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,533
Roam around in style with these.

127
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,373
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.
We don't need another.

128
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,006
Ma'am, I also have a Sunny Leone style goggle.

129
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,337
But that one doesn't have a glass.

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,094
It's a see through.
That's why I am not offering it.

131
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,180
But don't worry Ma'am.

132
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,602
I know exactly what you are looking for.

133
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,397
Hang on a second.
I have a lot of variety...

134
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,978
What the hell is going on there?

135
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:15,986
Go check Morey.

136
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,110
Ignore it, Ma'am.
We are from the crime branch.

137
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,779
Why do we need to get into it?

138
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,153
Morey, we are from the crime branch later.

139
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,904
We are cops first. Let's go.

140
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,043
Let's go.

141
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,747
Ma'am, goggles...

142
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,138
How dare they celebrate Valentine's Day!

143
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,389
Enough! Enough of this destruction!

144
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,069
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.
Let us do our job.

145
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,402
Get lost!

146
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,158
Only one of us can do our job right now.

147
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,452
And right now, I am on duty.

148
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,114
So, you stop working and let me work.

149
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,415
Don't act smart.
Shut up and get lost.

150
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,662
You guys keep going!

151
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,036
Last warning.

152
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,749
You and your bloody last warning!

153
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,583
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

154
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,757
Start counting, Morey.

155
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,002
Section 143 - unlawful assembly.

156
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,837
Section 147 - rioting.

157
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,093
Section 132 - abetment of mutiny.

158
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,558
Section 504 - intentional insult with intent...

159
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,760
...to provoke breach of peace.

160
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,479
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

161
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,185
Get up!

162
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,438
Two more sections left. Get up!

163
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,527
Section 188 - disobedience to order given by public servant.

164
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,610
And Section 353 - assault or criminal force...

165
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,286
...to deter public servant
from discharge of duty.

166
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,867
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

167
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,088
Jafar, did you get record the video?

168
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,130
Yes, Ma'am.

169
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,009
Make sure your boss gets my name right.

170
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,469
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

171
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,722
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

172
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,385
Unit 3.

173
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,479
Do whatever the hell you want!

174
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,350
Get lost!

175
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,721
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

176
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,903
- How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

177
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,037
No, no. Give it for thirty.

178
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,451
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,884
Okay, let's settle
at thirty-five. Okay?

180
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,117
Okay.

181
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,584
Pyaari!

182
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,749
Pyaari! Come here!

183
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,000
Hang on. Aunty, please hurry.

184
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,006
Here's a twenty... thirty...

185
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,009
Pyaari, come quickly!

186
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,010
Coming!

187
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,421
Keep the change.

188
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,258
Pyaari, get in.

189
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:53,348
How are you?

190
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:01,523
There it is.

191
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,650
Read later, Pyaari. Eat first.

192
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,359
I am going to treat both of you this Friday.

193
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,992
Really? Why?

194
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,069
It's my birthday.

195
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,821
- Really?
- No.

196
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,500
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday
along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

197
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,533
The whole of India will celebrate it then.

198
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,788
Very smart.

199
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,623
If the whole of India will celebrate...

200
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,580
...then even we must too, right?

201
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,671
Right. I'll get the cake.
Which flavour do you like?

202
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,754
Kaalakhatta.

203
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,004
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

204
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,214
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

205
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,009
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.
How old will you be?

206
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,431
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

207
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,397
Me too.

208
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,972
You too? Same pinch.

209
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,317
What a stroke of luck it was that I found you!

210
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,362
Remember how you were standing at the railway station?

211
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,450
If it wouldn't have been for me,
your uncle would have sold you off.

212
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,528
Aunty, but you met me, right?

213
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,034
My Ganpati selected you for me.

214
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,239
And me?

215
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,991
You, I have selected myself!

216
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,998
Shivani, please put these eye drops for me.

217
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,214
Just a second. I am on my last set.

218
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,548
Again?

219
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,515
Hurry up please.
I have to go to the clinic.

220
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,393
What happened?

221
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,984
Your Kaku never lets me work out in peace.

222
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,978
Really.

223
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,986
Why are there so many boxes of cake in the fridge?

224
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,411
There will be one more today.

225
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,124
Why?

226
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,115
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

227
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,789
Its been three days, I just can't find her.

228
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,870
So a new cake every day?

229
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,171
We can't feed her a stale cake on her birthday, can we?

230
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,588
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears
and get her home today.

231
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,379
Very good.

232
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:56,976
Yes, Jafar.

233
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,470
I'll handle that.

234
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,353
You keep the charge sheet ready.

235
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,520
I'll come in some time.

236
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,814
Yes, Jafar.

237
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,696
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

238
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,571
Who are you?

239
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,607
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

240
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,193
Who is Shivani Aunty?

241
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,120
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

242
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,167
Did you find her?

243
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,464
- Who?
- Her.

244
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,091
Who's her?

245
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,920
You just asked for her.
Pyaari. Did you find her?

246
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,596
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

247
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,309
I thought since you are a cop you might have found Pyaari.

248
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,265
Who let these kids inside?

249
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:46,817
What's wrong with her?

250
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,028
She's missing since the last four days.

251
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,444
Usually we wait for two days
before we file a missing complaint.

252
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,030
These kids wander off sometimes.

253
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,407
But they come back in a couple of days.

254
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,215
Pyaari didn't come back till last evening...

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,081
...so we filed a missing complaint.

256
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,992
Where? At the D. N.
Nagar Police Station?

257
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,251
This is D. N . Nagar...

258
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,623
...so we'll obviously go to
D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

259
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:07,997
When did you see her last?

260
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,044
Four days back.

261
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,708
I want to meet these kids.

262
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,297
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

263
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,258
She was with us
three days ago. And...

264
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,470
You fool! We even ate Wadapaav.

265
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,226
Kids get lost but they also come back.

266
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,725
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

267
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,016
We played together at bed time.
Hide and seek.

268
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,018
I haven't seen her after that.

269
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,445
I saw her when I came in the morning.

270
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,082
Don't know where she disappeared later.

271
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,574
She was carrying her bag of books.

272
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,486
I even asked her where she was going.

273
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,539
But she didn't say anything.
She just left.

274
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,834
Six months ago even Yashoda
Didi disappeared in the same way.

275
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,001
One cup of tea

276
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,733
Since when do you have your stall here?

277
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,640
What's the matter Ma'am?
Is anything wrong?

278
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,056
Just answer my question.

279
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,187
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

280
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,232
You won't have to pay, if you work for me.

281
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,025
What's the job?

282
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,029
You have to keep an eye on this shelter home.

283
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,985
Who comes in, who goes out.

284
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,238
You want me to be an informer, right?

285
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,906
You are very smart, huh?

286
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,455
A girl called Pyaari is missing from here.

287
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,547
Give me all the information you can get.

288
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,336
Clear?

289
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,579
Write my number down.

290
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,331
9-8-2...

291
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,464
Meera, are you ready?

292
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,258
I have made your favourite breakfast today.

293
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,649
Sharda Bai, one more cup of tea please.

294
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,305
Yes, Sir.

295
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,263
Let me comb your hair today.

296
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,975
- Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

297
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,063
You need a good hair-cut.

298
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,229
We'll go to a posh salon in Bandra this Sunday...

299
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,899
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

300
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,777
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

301
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,988
Pyaari is missing since five days.

302
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,283
And we are behaving as if it never happened.

303
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,874
She has been kidnapped.

304
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,757
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

305
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,191
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

306
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,864
There's no network inside.

307
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,487
So he comes out to take his calls.

308
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,787
Something about dealings...

309
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,241
He bought a new cell phone a few days ago.

310
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,709
He is obsessed with clicking snaps on his phone.

311
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,994
He has clicked mine too.

312
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,246
Where would he be right now?

313
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,374
Ogling at girls outside Chaaya restaurant.

314
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,231
Kapil!

315
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,575
What are you up to?

316
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,787
Nothing much.
I was just heading home.

317
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,914
Heading home? I'll drop you.

318
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,367
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

319
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,994
It's no bother. Come, sit.

320
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,003
Come.

321
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,378
Come sit.

322
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,977
Half our life is spent waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

323
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,339
Whose call is it? Answer it.

324
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,530
It's from home.
I am going home anyway.

325
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,534
Your family is missing you, huh?

326
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,502
Well... my wife gets worried
if I don't reach home on time.

327
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,291
Anyway...

328
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,582
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

329
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,375
Yes, of course.

330
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,714
Take a good one.

331
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,721
Done? Show me.

332
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,299
What a phone you have there!

333
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,487
Ma'am, take a look.

334
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,972
Latest mobile.

335
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:13,973
Wow!

336
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,396
Jafar, what did you earn in
so many years with the police force?

337
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,153
Peanuts!

338
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,610
We should also quit our jobs and join an NGO.

339
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,200
Pick little girls from the shelter home...

340
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,064
...sell them and buy
expensive cell phones.

341
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,078
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

342
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,167
Don't play dumb. We know.

343
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,804
Jafar, let's start his interrogation here itself.

344
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,597
If we wait for the traffic to
move Kapil won't get home on time.

345
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:54,726
Good idea, Ma'am.

346
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,185
Speak up. Who do you work for?

347
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,359
I don't understand what you are talking about, Sir.

348
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,820
Why are you stretching it?

349
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,484
We are in an 'instant' era.

350
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,529
The quicker you answer, the quicker you get home.

351
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,242
Come on speak up.

352
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,578
On whose instructions did you kidnap Pyaari?

353
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,579
Where is she?

354
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,286
Speak up, you scum!

355
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,881
He's just pretending.

356
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,544
You are messing with my head now!

357
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,341
Are you done?

358
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,266
- He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

359
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:38,641
There they are!

360
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,144
Morey, call the control room and get reinforcement.

361
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,145
- Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

362
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,733
Morey keep his mobile.

363
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,076
Move aside!

364
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:03,621
Move!

365
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,985
The other shooter.

366
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,326
Jafar, this matter is getting complicated.

367
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,286
Damn!

368
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,283
Pyaari, where are you my child!

369
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,208
Come here.

370
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:52,548
Move.

371
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,008
Stop fooling around, guys!

372
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,811
Come on.

373
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,522
- Go there. Who's next?
- She.

374
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,648
What's the matter, baby?
Having fun, aren't you?

375
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,603
Will you rip it or should I?

376
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,234
- Come on.
- No, please no!

377
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:12,447
Come here.

378
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,524
No!

379
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,408
Get her.

380
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,989
Come on. Stand straight, you!

381
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,411
I am telling you for the last time.

382
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,990
Don't do this to me.

383
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,412
Please!

384
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,578
Easy, Mattu!

385
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,256
Take it off!

386
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,137
Take a good look. She's a virgin!

387
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,556
In spite of you around?

388
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,016
Don't you find anyone else to pick on!

389
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,442
Put her in No. 2.

390
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,520
Baby Doll!

391
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,532
Come here to Papa. Come.

392
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:38,537
Hey!

393
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,124
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

394
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,034
Are you insane?!

395
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,873
Who will you kill with that splinter?

396
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,079
Myself. I will slash myself.

397
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,166
Don't slash your wrists.

398
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,509
It'll hurt more and will take more time.

399
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,513
Loretto School, Kolkata, huh?

400
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,924
Her school is very famous.

401
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,515
I was in Hindu College.

402
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,888
Dropped out in the second year.

403
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,608
But that I can help you with.

404
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,188
No really.

405
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,069
If you really want to die then cut this vein of your neck.

406
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,113
It'll be quick and it'll be painless.

407
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,073
And if you still want to run
I really suggest you drop that idea.

408
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,990
Because you have seen me.

409
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,242
What's her name?

410
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,835
Mrunal.

411
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,296
Mrunal, now it leaves us with two options.

412
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,627
You either work for me...

413
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,050
Don't come, don't come.

414
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,261
Chill. It's okay.

415
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,305
Or I will have to kill you.

416
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,477
What were you about to do?

417
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,228
Yeah. I would have
also done the same.

418
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,644
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

419
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,066
It would have taken
5-7 days for you to die.

420
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,489
In front of all the girls.

421
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,359
Is that what you want?

422
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,861
But what to do?

423
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,831
A bit of drama is required to control so many of you.

424
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,077
And that leaves us with our last option.

425
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,829
If you want to stay alive...

426
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,542
...and lead a good life
I can help you with that too.

427
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,843
You are quite hot, you know.

428
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,175
I can get you the best clients.

429
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:27,893
5 star hotels, fine dining, beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

430
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,394
Think about it.

431
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,644
But the way I look at it, you don't
really have a choice. Do you?

432
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,094
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

433
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,891
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

434
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,616
Put her in No. 1

435
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,873
The shooter has been identified.
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

436
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,709
- Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

437
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,510
Look at this.

438
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,589
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

439
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,932
All the notorious ones together?

440
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,978
Ma'am most of them are members of the Ali Gang.

441
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,142
This one is Balu Kotian...

442
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,899
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

443
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,352
Go back.

444
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,441
Just a moment.

445
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,574
This...

446
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:11,655
Who's this?

447
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,657
I have never seen him before.

448
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,995
Kapil loved to flaunt his connections.

449
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,705
He's surely a member of some gang.

450
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,925
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

451
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:29,844
To pick up a girl so smoothly, and then shoot him...

452
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,643
Only an organized gang can operate with such finesse.

453
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,812
There is one man, who keeps track of such things.

454
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,242
Is this a new style of interrogation?

455
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,612
Feed meat and extract information?

456
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,658
Tell me, Rehman, is anything free in life?

457
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,993
If everything was without a price...

458
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,589
...then would you
have become a gangster?

459
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,416
You are right.

460
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,013
Do you know him?

461
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,305
Are you kidding me?

462
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,219
You want me to be an informer at my stature?

463
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,264
You idiot!

464
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,558
When I had come to arrest you...

465
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,979
...you were begging
me not to shoot you.

466
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,322
And now you talk about stature?

467
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,659
Don't waste my time.
I have loads of other work.

468
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,031
Katyal.

469
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,993
He is Sunny Katyal.

470
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,079
He's not from Mumbai.

471
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,554
He started operating here around three years ago.

472
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,420
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

473
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,220
But the real dough comes from drugs and trafficking.

474
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,387
Whenever a girl between 8 to 18 years disappears...

475
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,685
...more often than
not he is involved.

476
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,068
You can call him the wholesaler of trafficking.

477
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,731
No matter where a girl disappears
from, she ends up in his net.

478
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,691
Why is he not on our radar yet?

479
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,995
Your radar? He is not
even on our radar yet.

480
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,614
It's impossible to crack how he smuggles drugs and girls.

481
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,784
How do the other gangs let him operate?

482
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,165
He is a very smart man.

483
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:24,871
Keeps everyone happy.

484
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,631
Has no enemies.

485
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,423
But I have a strong doubt that
he is not the brain behind all this.

486
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,013
There is someone bigger supporting him.

487
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,891
You gave me a lot of information
in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

488
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,645
I did it for the girl.
Not for the food.

489
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,854
Thanks for the meat.

490
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,612
Katyal.

491
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,117
Sunny Katyal.

492
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,290
I want to know about every message...

493
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,700
...every call that's
made from his cell phone.

494
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,080
What time he wakes up in the morning
to who he bangs in the night!

495
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,421
I want to know everything.

496
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,176
Got it?

497
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,052
Yes, Ma'am.

498
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,983
- Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

499
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,402
I want it clear.

500
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,531
Hello, Vakil Sir.
It's a mess here.

501
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,076
The crime branch people have made my life hell.

502
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,098
I think they'll very soon monitor me in the loo!

503
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,498
How did they get to know about you?

504
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,333
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

505
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,286
I just know that they are behind my life with a vengeance.

506
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,378
What will you do now?

507
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,174
I am thinking of talking to the commissioner.

508
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,253
Moron!

509
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,886
Why inform the commissioner about
things that he doesn't know yet!

510
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,373
Then please tell me what I should do.

511
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,264
Find out the price of the inspector
who's leading this operation.

512
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:41,883
Throw some money at him.

513
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,806
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

514
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:44,602
It's some woman.

515
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,395
She has a track record of not accepting bribes.

516
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,391
Woman? Tell me her name.

517
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,735
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
From the crime branch.

518
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,733
Do one thing.

519
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,612
Get me her number.
I'll call her tomorrow.

520
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,868
Get me the number!
Like it's a piece of cake.

521
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,909
Where the hell am I sitting!

522
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,119
Just when some money was on its way...

523
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,543
...this moron has made plans
to ruin it.

524
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,716
I have a feeling this inspector
is going to ask for a huge price.

525
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,173
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

526
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,219
Yes.

527
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,642
The batch of girls this time is superb.

528
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,231
Really?

529
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,475
What did he say?

530
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,777
He signed a 200,000 deal.

531
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,158
The foreigners loved the service that our girls gave.

532
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,596
What is the status of the girls from Bangladesh?

533
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,032
It's getting delayed.

534
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,989
The security at the border has become very stringent.

535
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,210
It will take a week more.

536
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,003
You are very lenient with them, Vakil Sir.

537
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,880
They are very prompt at collecting their payments.

538
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,508
But when it comes to delivery, a week's delay?

539
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:02,676
Not done.

540
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,221
What was her name?

541
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:07,681
Shivani Roy.

542
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,977
Wow! She's hot.

543
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,767
Let it be, Vakil sir.

544
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,313
You are too old to deal with women like her.

545
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,991
I'll talk to her.

546
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,200
Tell Katyal to get all information on her.

547
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,122
A week has passed and no leads yet.

548
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,291
Either he is smart or our information is wrong.

549
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,329
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too
is getting impatient.

550
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,714
Let's wait for a few more days.

551
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,000
I am sure he will commit some mistake.

552
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,051
Come on. I have got dinner.

553
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,024
Hello?

554
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,780
You reached home, Ma'am?

555
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,777
Who's this?

556
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,778
Doesn't matter.

557
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,492
How come you picked dinner from Aaswaad tonight?

558
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,237
Sharda bai didn't come to work today?

559
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,539
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

560
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,500
- Want to join us for dinner?
- I had heard right about you.

561
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,497
Aunty, what have you got?

562
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,124
Someone else would have been rattled.

563
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,789
Set the plates.
I am very hungry. Call Kaku.

564
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,333
Go, quick, quick.

565
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,130
Tell me.

566
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,761
Why are you watching me?

567
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,012
If you keep a watch on my men then
I will have to watch you, right?

568
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,348
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

569
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,980
You sou nd like his son though.

570
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,394
How does it matter?

571
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,816
It's the same family.

572
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,649
The whole family seems twisted.

573
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,990
You are calling me from VoIP so I can't trace your call?

574
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,450
To deal with a sharp officer like you...

575
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,574
...one needs to be prepared, right?

576
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,705
No point tracing the lP address...

577
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:53,803
You won't find anything.

578
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,330
Enough bragging.

579
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,167
Get to the point.
My food is getting cold.

580
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,545
Stop watching my people and quote your price.

581
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,338
I want my daughter back.

582
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:05,719
Daughter?

583
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,138
You have a daughter?

584
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,844
The girl you picked up from the Andheri shelter home...

585
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,094
...is like my daughter.

586
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,565
Oh! That's why you
are behind my life.

587
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,945
It might have been possible if you had asked earlier.

588
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,072
It's difficult now.

589
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,571
Fine. Then the surveillance
will continue.

590
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,118
You are stretching this a bit too much.

591
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,410
She was like your daughter,
but not your real daughter, right?

592
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:38,870
Let's do one thing.

593
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:42,920
There's a 35 story skyscraper coming up in Wadala.

594
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,798
The top floor is yours.

595
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,596
No thanks. If the elevator
breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

596
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,173
Then tell me what you want.

597
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,055
I told you I want Pyaari back.

598
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,275
Shivaniji, you aren't listening to me.

599
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,146
That girl has seen too much.

600
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,191
I don't take such a risk in my business.

601
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,701
It's too late now.

602
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,657
Aunty, hurry up!

603
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,415
Listen, kid.

604
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,082
I'll come hunting to your house to rescue Pyaari.

605
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,003
But rescue I will.

606
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,790
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

607
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,092
Chill. Don't get worked up.

608
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,509
It doesn't su it you.

609
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,378
Anything else?

610
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,434
Don't do this.
Think about it please.

611
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,266
You need to think about it Junior.

612
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,856
I won't take too long to reach Pyaari...

613
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,984
...but the day I reach her you
won't be capable of even thinking.

614
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,523
Okay, Ma'am.
You do your job and I'll do mine.

615
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,067
Let's just both do what's best for business.

616
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,245
But I have to admit it was fun talking to you.

617
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,282
Bye Ma'am.

618
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,506
Hello. Mattu, put that
girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

619
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,671
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

620
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,048
I'll finish dinner and come.
Yes, right now.

621
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,048
How dare you touch me?

622
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,018
You can't harass a responsible
and innocent citizen this way.

623
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,685
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.
I do not understand.

624
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,462
I will speak to the Human Rights Organisations...

625
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,442
...and feed you to the dogs.

626
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,769
Sure.

627
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,480
- Jafar?
- Patil?

628
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,992
You feed us to the dogs and we will feed you jalebis.

629
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,656
Jalebi?

630
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,625
You will eat the jalebis, feel Very
sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

631
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,835
I don't eat jalebis.

632
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,295
Shut up and eat! Or I'll...

633
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,008
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

634
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,598
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

635
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,390
Eat.

636
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:09,109
Gentlemen, please key in your
bids on your iPad screens now.

637
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:16,533
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

638
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,989
She looks grown but is just a child.

639
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:26,376
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

640
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:38,766
No!

641
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,391
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday with Ganpati.

642
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,012
The whole of India will celebrate it then.

643
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,728
How are you?

644
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,981
- How old will you be?
- How old are you?

645
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,156
- Twelve.
- Me too.

646
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,028
You too?

647
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,736
Pyaari, come quickly.

648
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,171
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

649
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,650
What will you become when you grow up?

650
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:10,756
An airplane driver.

651
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:11,669
What?

652
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,636
It's called a pilot, not a driver, you fool!

653
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,012
Same thing.

654
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:21,176
I'll fly the plane very high,
right in the middle of clouds.

655
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,986
Ma'am, have your ginger tea and fix your mood.

656
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,365
Thank you, Jafar.

657
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,165
He's a seasoned player.

658
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,584
We stuffed him with a kilo of jalebis...

659
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,503
...didn't give him
even a drop of water...

660
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,793
...but he still
didn't open his mouth.

661
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,343
Ma'am I'll continue for the
next four hours. You go on home.

662
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,179
Ask Morey and Pawaskar to continue later.

663
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,178
Don't let him sleep even for a second.

664
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,262
Yes, Ma'am.

665
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,634
Thank you.

666
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,436
I am coming. Two minutes.

667
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,440
Aunty, you are so late!

668
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,821
Sorry. But I think
we'll soon find Pyaari.

669
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,165
Really, Aunty? You are the best,
Aunty. You are the best.

670
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,820
It won't hurt after a couple of times.

671
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,077
Here...

672
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,121
...cupcake.

673
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,908
For both of you.

674
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,587
Every girl gets it after her first night.

675
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,296
Have it.

676
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,175
I too blew my past away after my first night.

677
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,548
That's the only way to survive here.

678
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,851
Otherwise your life will be hell.

679
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:31,681
Come on, now blow the candle and move on.

680
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,566
Come on.

681
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,489
It's a great idea to teach that nosy cop a lesson.

682
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,451
But we'll have to pay a fat price for it.

683
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,204
This guy will do our job for free.

684
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,452
Here.

685
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,750
Call Riyaz.

686
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,499
Tell him that this job must be done.

687
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,511
Performance bonus guaranteed.

688
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:10,929
Shivaniji, you will stop nosing around after this.

689
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,851
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

690
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:20,984
It's good that way.

691
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,071
Fear gets work done faster.

692
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,295
Morey... 21 missed calls!

693
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,465
Ma'am, come quickly.

694
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,424
Why?

695
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,013
Ma'am, come quickly please.

696
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,525
Get the pervert doctor!

697
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,151
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

698
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,274
...a female patient
accused a doctor...

699
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,075
...of inappropriate behaviour.

700
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,278
Runa, that's my Kaku!

701
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,864
What's going on?

702
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,751
A few hours after the allegations...

703
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,003
...the members of Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

704
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:47,093
...attacked the dispensary
and defamed the doctor.

705
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,762
We had no intentions of taking the law in our hands.

706
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,176
But the people are fuming with anger...

707
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,260
...because of the growing
exploitation of women.

708
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,892
The anger found its vent this way.

709
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,099
That doctor must be punished.

710
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,565
Please eat.

711
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,357
Hello?

712
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,690
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

713
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,828
I am genuinely sorry for what's happened.

714
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,452
In fact I even had tears when I heard the news.

715
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,577
But I hope this doesn't change things between us.

716
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,088
Because I am just starting to like you.

717
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,458
There was nothing personal about this, Ma'am.

718
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,469
It's just business.

719
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,007
Please don't harbour any misunderstanding.

720
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,265
Please.

721
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,597
You know what, Junior, I grew up in a village.

722
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,484
There was a dense forest near my house.

723
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,648
That's why from early on in life I knew animals very well.

724
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:36,202
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat
Sir took me in the crime branch.

725
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,409
To trap a mouse you have to act like one.

726
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,703
To catch a dog you have to think like one.

727
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,251
To hunt a tiger you have to become one.

728
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,461
You know what you are?

729
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,800
You are that poisonous snake near the river...

730
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:58,012
...who can't be seen but bites
oblivious kids swimming in the river.

731
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,346
You should have been with the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

732
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,598
What are you doing in the police force?

733
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,360
You are the one who's about to be discovered, kid.

734
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,193
I don't know what your name is.

735
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,858
I don't know where you are speaking from.

736
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,453
Who your boss is or where you have kept Pyaari.

737
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,782
But I've figured your type

738
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,379
No matter how far you try to stay away...

739
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,086
...your nature will compel you
to come closer to me.

740
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,000
30 days.

741
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,757
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

742
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:40,850
And then with a lot of love and
patience I'll squish you to pulp.

743
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,894
Mark my words. 30 days.

744
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,999
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's
a high command meeting next week.

745
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,997
You hear everything, Mattu.
But you do nothing.

746
00:50:08,348 --> 00:50:10,149
Sir, first you don't give me an opportunity to work...

747
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,460
...and then you call me useless.
This is unfair, Sir.

748
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,006
Big announcements are to be made
in the party meeting this time.

749
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,842
Now you are making me drool.

750
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,303
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

751
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,684
Really? That means
it's going to be huge.

752
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:25,803
That's awesome, Sir.

753
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,639
The contract for Taneja's personal party must come to us.

754
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,395
Why should I get you the contract?

755
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,695
Name the drug and you'll get it,
Sir. Indian, South American.

756
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:39,567
And as far as girls go, look at the choice, Sir.

757
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,823
Film star or porn star.

758
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,663
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

759
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,117
Why should I get you the contract?

760
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:52,205
Oh! I have been
blabbering like a fool.

761
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,006
The list will obviously begin with you, Sir.

762
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,882
And shame on me if you have to tell me your list.

763
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:05,476
Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby.
Come here. Take Sir...

764
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,398
Oh! Good choice, Sir.
Hey, Julia Roberts!

765
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,267
Darling, baby, come here.

766
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,356
Don't be shy. Come here.

767
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,064
Good girl.

768
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,152
Keep the tray here and take Sir to the washroom.

769
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:25,947
Call me on Monday.

770
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,199
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

771
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:32,961
Don't forget, Sir!

772
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,580
Come, baby...

773
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:43,927
Hey, Mattu.

774
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,472
You really do appear out of nowhere!

775
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:48,935
I have been watching you.

776
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,679
How long does it take to crack a deal?

777
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,230
I am not selling water purifiers.

778
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,604
I am trying to crack a deal worth crores.
It takes time.

779
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,518
If he doesn't call on Monday...

780
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,771
I swear I'll go to Katra and sell religious CDs.

781
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,356
If this deal doesn't come through...

782
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,113
I won't even leave you capable
of selling porn CDs at Palika.

783
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,743
I am at it.

784
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,078
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

785
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,952
Okay. You crack this deal.

786
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,159
I'll send you to Mumbai to look after our set up there.

787
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,284
Mumbai?

788
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,703
But Katyal is looking after Mumbai, right?

789
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,332
Left... left... Very good.

790
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,542
Good Job.

791
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,801
You fool! Be careful.

792
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,591
The packet will break.

793
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,138
Be careful.

794
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,434
Guggu, will the car be fixed by evening?

795
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,098
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

796
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,728
Hello, Vakil Sir.

797
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,186
This time the consignment is superb!

798
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,191
Forget the consignment.
Listen to me.

799
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,691
That cop chick has lost it.
She will pick you up again.

800
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,865
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

801
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,278
Should I fix her?

802
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,994
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

803
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,293
You want the entire Mumbai
Police force to come behind you?

804
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,369
What should I do then?

805
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,170
Go underground for a few days.

806
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,058
One of my men will come in the evening.

807
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,632
Go with him to the safe house.

808
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,176
He will make arrangements for you there.

809
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,133
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

810
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,722
Don't crib so much!

811
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,966
Pack your bag and be ready in the evening.

812
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,676
Go with my man.

813
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:12,806
Bye.

814
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,397
Pour it in my mouth!

815
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,066
Get lost!

816
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,148
I am surrounded by duck heads!

817
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,148
What's going on?

818
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,122
Vakil Sir has sent such an atrocious car!

819
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,250
Good bye, Sir!

820
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,506
Hello? Hello?

821
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:48,926
The network conks off at the slightest disturbance.

822
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:54,011
Nobody cheats the people more
than these cell phone companies.

823
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,817
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir?

824
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:01,727
Hello?

825
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,151
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

826
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,200
Everything is bloody jinxed!

827
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:09,610
Get out of the car.

828
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:12,996
Get out.

829
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,244
Vakil Sir!

830
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,292
Get out of the car or I'll shoot you.

831
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,369
I am getting out!

832
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,171
Listen to me.

833
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,212
Why are you doing this? For money?

834
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,633
I'll give you double.

835
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:26,759
Move!

836
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,425
Listen to me once.

837
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,390
I'll give you all the money you want right away.

838
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,388
Your life will be made.

839
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:34,764
What's happening with me!

840
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,347
Isn't there a chance?

841
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,236
Vakil, what a way to repay my loyalty!

842
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,526
Let me tell you one thing before I die.

843
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,943
Don't ever be overtly loyal to anybody in life.

844
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,695
It screws you.

845
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,580
Look at me.

846
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,865
Fifteen years...

847
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,841
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

848
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,015
...eventually took the contract
to kill you.

849
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,601
What a business you guys run!

850
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,561
May I ask you something?

851
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,853
How did you know about this?

852
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,945
I am beginning to know your boss a little bit.

853
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,831
He knew that if he didn't pick you up I would have.

854
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,495
You would always remain a risk
to him even if he saved you.

855
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,337
When you sat in the car,

856
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,211
Morey recognized that your driver was Hanif's man.

857
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,464
Hanif has a brick factory here in Kharegaon.

858
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,971
It makes it easier to dispose bodies.

859
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:54,677
True.

860
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,850
I won't leave that rascal.

861
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,436
Nor will I.

862
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,431
So tell me. Where does the kid stay?

863
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,022
Kid? Which kid?

864
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,398
Your boss.

865
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,400
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

866
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:10,781
What are you saying, Ma'am.

867
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,779
Vakil is at least 50-55 years old.

868
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:14,527
He is not a kid.

869
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,868
You scum!

870
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,113
If you waste our time again...

871
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,954
...I'll make you a eunuch
and sell you off.

872
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,830
I swear by God I am not lying.

873
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:24,244
If I am lying...

874
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,462
...then do whatever
you want to do with me.

875
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,632
Vakil got me to Mumbai four years ago.

876
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,922
I am working with him since then.

877
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,674
Keep talking.

878
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,134
I know Vakil very well.

879
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,506
He stays in Delhi.

880
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,310
Hello?

881
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,802
Damn! Katyal escaped.

882
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:40,852
How?

883
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,854
Hanif's man was found dead.

884
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:44,814
How did he die?

885
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,107
He was shot.

886
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:47,017
Where?

887
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,813
Tell me, where was Hanif shot?

888
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:52,898
On the body.

889
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,030
Where on the body?
Front? Behind? Where?

890
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,239
He was shot in the head from behind.

891
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:01,977
Where did they find the dead body?

892
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,208
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

893
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,414
Hang up the other phone.

894
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:11,295
Hung up.

895
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:15,379
Someone saved Katyal exactly
where he was supposed to be killed.

896
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:16,929
But who saved him?

897
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,173
Who else?

898
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,430
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

899
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,891
It's time to send her another gift.

900
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,641
Congrats Ma'am.

901
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,936
Someone has dared to point
a finger at me for the first time.

902
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,188
Every time you point a finger at me...

903
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,361
...you will get this gift from me.

904
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,026
Your Kid.

905
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:45,511
Hunt this guy down.
No matter what.

906
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:07,703
Hello!

907
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,414
I have left from the hotel.
I am going to office now.

908
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:14,374
Be calm. You are the most
dangerous when you are calm.

909
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,424
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

910
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,135
He was my senior in the institute.

911
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,102
We used to have fun times those days.

912
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,271
He praises you very highly.

913
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,735
He is my teacher and guide
otherwise I behave like a wild bull.

914
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,438
You know what.
Good officers like you...

915
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,273
- May I?
- Yes, come in.

916
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,950
- Sir...
- Take a seat.

917
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,575
Meet Sub-Inspector Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

918
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,906
A very efficient officer.

919
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,157
Shivani Roy.

920
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,626
- Ma'am...
- Senior Inspector, Mumbai Crime Branch.

921
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,580
She has come with information on a huge child...

922
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,915
...and drug trafficking
syndicate in Delhi.

923
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,007
You guys have my full support
to go the whole yard on this, okay?

924
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:01,923
Thank you, Sir.

925
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,468
- Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

926
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,304
Your source? Here?

927
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,219
I have got him here with Sinha Sir's help.

928
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:10,948
- Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

929
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,439
Ditto! This is exactly how he looks.

930
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,602
The same curls, light eyes.
He is the one.

931
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,445
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

932
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,481
But nobody knows his real name.

933
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,859
He sometimes deals as Devinder Pasricha.

934
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,070
Or opens an office in the name of Aakash Pandey.

935
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:29,490
But he keeps no name or office for more than six months.

936
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,418
We haven't heard of him ever.

937
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,495
He takes pride in that.

938
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,672
He always boasts that he will never get arrested.

939
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:39,629
Isn't there a way of reaching him?

940
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,213
Of course there is.

941
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,841
One is drugs and the other is girls.

942
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,348
And that too because he is getting senile with age.

943
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,101
We can't go posing as customers for girls.

944
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,721
He will be expecting me to do something like this.

945
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,015
We'll have to play him in such a way...

946
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,692
...that lures him to us
instead of us approaching him.

947
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,818
Usually drug suppliers deal only in one kind of drug...

948
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,192
...but he deals
in all kinds of drugs.

949
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,573
If he has his way he'll sell cough syrup as drugs.

950
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,827
He is that greedy.

951
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,747
As far as I know, Sodhi...

952
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,412
...South American drug
is hard to get, right?

953
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,623
Right. And even if you get it,
its very expensive.

954
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,877
That means a higher profit margin.

955
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,589
He will do anything for business.

956
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:28,303
If we can get this news to Vakil that we are not buyers...

957
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:32,135
...but suppliers of such high-end
cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

958
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,188
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

959
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,687
If he comes to know then it is sure to reach Vakil.

960
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,401
But our drug supplier should look genuine.

961
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,246
Why should we do it?

962
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:55,409
Because it's a question of somebody's life Mbangwa.

963
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,543
But it's a matter of our life too.

964
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,954
And what if we get killed?

965
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,547
Who will kill you?

966
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,586
We are here to protect you. Relax.

967
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,543
Stupid policeman.

968
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:07,212
No.

969
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,552
Listen to me Mboso.

970
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,352
Don't forget you don't have any passport.

971
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,352
So either I will make papers to deport you back...

972
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,353
...or I will arrange
for your stay in Tihar Jail.

973
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,267
You decide.

974
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,413
- Where's Bob?
- What?

975
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,333
- Where Bob? Bob?
- Bob? Down there.

976
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,082
Okay.

977
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:46,918
Hail Almighty!

978
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,012
Mind blowing stuff!

979
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,181
Very good, very good.

980
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,096
- Hey, Bob!
- Baby!

981
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,061
- Having fun?
- Yeah!

982
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,103
Go enjoy!

983
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,063
So, big guy, how much do you have?

984
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:04,356
Five.

985
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,899
Five what?

986
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,280
Five kilos.

987
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,111
Are you crazy?

988
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,990
I want 100 grams only.

989
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,829
Hey listen.
It's either full or nothing.

990
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:18,908
Let's go.

991
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,838
Listen, come here.

992
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:29,303
I will tell you one thing. I have
one customer who will take it all.

993
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,470
The whole material. Okay?

994
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,386
How much longer? Please hurry.

995
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,724
What should I tell Bob?

996
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,980
Who's Bob?

997
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,934
Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

998
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,358
He met those Nigerians.

999
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,986
- How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

1000
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,243
Give me some onions.

1001
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,159
The material will be good if Bob has checked it.

1002
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,041
Besides the cricket season is beginning from next month.

1003
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,460
How much longer?

1004
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,088
It's been a long time now.

1005
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:14,389
Tell all our people that if someone demands girls...

1006
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:18,894
...especially young girls,
then don't entertain.

1007
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,556
Our cop chick will surely send someone as a customer.

1008
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:24,857
Not to take any new customers?

1009
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,026
I said no.

1010
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,278
This is the limit now!
How much longer?

1011
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,156
Taste from my plate if you are in such a rush.

1012
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,486
What else to say!

1013
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:39,664
Call the Nigerian.
But in our manner.

1014
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,160
Yeah, Bob.

1015
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,630
The call has come. I am leaving.

1016
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,173
Okay.

1017
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,388
Mathur, I'll wait at Babur Road.

1018
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,473
Tell me the position of Mboso's car later.

1019
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:58,800
Let's go.

1020
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,276
- Auto!
- Lajpat Nagar, please.

1021
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,454
Ma'am, what are you doing?
We called for it first.

1022
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,372
Shut up! Or I'll call the police.

1023
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,366
Ma'am we are the police.

1024
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,206
We are going to raid a place.
Want to come along?

1025
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:26,620
Ma'am, let's go.

1026
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,000
Sit. Quick.

1027
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,047
I am leaving. Have patience.
Let me take my bag.

1028
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,379
The cops are riding autos these days.

1029
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:33,830
- Please hurry.
- Auto!

1030
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,213
- Tell Sodhi Mboso's location.
- Right away Ma'am.

1031
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,772
We have got a biker who's asking us to follow.

1032
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:55,819
Follow him.

1033
01:05:56,536 --> 01:06:00,529
Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso.
Be alert.

1034
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:49,001
Sodhi, stop.

1035
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,708
Stop following Mboso.
They are watching.

1036
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,513
Come, Sodhi. They have left.

1037
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,552
- Mathur...
- Yes, Ma'am.

1038
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,891
Track the car on GPS and let me know.

1039
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,389
- Okay?
- Right, Ma'am.

1040
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,061
Go.

1041
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,777
Yes, Mathur.

1042
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:24,866
Sodhi, take a left.

1043
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,242
Vakil sir, is everything fine?
Should I come up?

1044
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,961
All okay. You can come up.

1045
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,709
Okay.

1046
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,637
Sodhi, Stop. That's Mboso's car.

1047
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,292
The cops are here.

1048
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:17,840
Get out from the back door.

1049
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,545
Sodhi, there'll be a back door.

1050
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:22,753
Cover from there.

1051
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,507
Bloody swine! You got the cops!

1052
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,599
Ratan, they'll come up if they hear a gun shot.

1053
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,060
You leave from the back door.

1054
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,718
Vakil Sir, leave!
The cops have surrounded us.

1055
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,303
You've deceived Vakil!

1056
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,093
Leave, Vakil Sir.
Hurry! The police is here.

1057
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,972
Leave from the back door. Hurry!

1058
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,023
Ratan, you escape from the roof.

1059
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,524
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

1060
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:22,230
Okay.

1061
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,489
Break it.

1062
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,330
Yes, Vakil Sir?
Are you out of there?

1063
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:42,504
Come, you...

1064
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,010
You conned us!

1065
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,017
In the Nehru Place office...

1066
01:09:56,109 --> 01:10:00,352
...there's a black diary
beneath my chair.

1067
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,353
It has the numbers and addresses of our clients.

1068
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,572
Keep that carefully.

1069
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,402
I don't have time.

1070
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,537
If they arrest me they'll reach you.

1071
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,286
And I won't ever let that happen.

1072
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:20,692
What are you talking about, Vakil Sir?

1073
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,459
We'll get you out somehow.
You just leave now.

1074
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,508
Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye.

1075
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,505
Hello? Vakil Sir?

1076
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,384
Vakil Sir?

1077
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,364
Move, move. Sodhi.

1078
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:21,774
Damn!

1079
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,179
You piece of trash!

1080
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,796
- Hello?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

1081
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:35,923
Did you sleep well?

1082
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,594
You are up so early?
Do you work in a call centre?

1083
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:41,136
What to do Ma'am!

1084
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,440
I couldn't sleep wondering how to kill you.

1085
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,902
So have you decided how you'll kill me?

1086
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:52,532
I won't kill you.
You will kill yourself.

1087
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,410
I am just going to lie back and watch you.

1088
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,828
Wow! That's some style you got kid!

1089
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,036
Are you done wishing good morning...

1090
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,637
...or is there anything
else you want to say?

1091
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,170
What is there to say?

1092
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,000
Now, I will show you what I can do.

1093
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,221
You are sharp I must admit.

1094
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,182
You killed Vakil Sir...

1095
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,768
...hid your family safely.

1096
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,481
But now you can't harm me anymore.

1097
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:27,862
Because I am still alive.

1098
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,943
And I am comfortably sitting in my own house.

1099
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,439
But you are in my territory.

1100
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,530
Beware.

1101
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,040
Don't chew. Swallow!

1102
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,210
Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1103
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,087
You just have to eat this pellet.

1104
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,005
Even the grapes are here.

1105
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,970
Will you practice with grapes?

1106
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,264
- I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1107
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,140
You better!

1108
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,179
Open your mouth.

1109
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,855
Give me some other work.

1110
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,022
Enough of your nonsense.
Eat or I'll slap you!

1111
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,396
Mattu is here.
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1112
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:16,149
- Stop your drama.
- Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1113
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,409
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1114
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,077
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1115
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,370
Yes, they are.

1116
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,697
You worry too much.

1117
01:14:22,768 --> 01:14:24,268
By the way when are you sending me to Mumbai?

1118
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,749
I'll take care of our set up there.

1119
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,453
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1120
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,793
6 girls are leaving for London and 3 for Texas.

1121
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,671
Their domestic help visas and documents are ready.

1122
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,882
Last time on the way to the airport...

1123
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,884
...a pellet burst
in one girl's stomach.

1124
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:39,968
Remember?

1125
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,924
Is anyone else going to die this time?

1126
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,055
No. This time Alka has taken all precautions.

1127
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,761
- Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1128
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,763
This time I have used the safest coatings.

1129
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,523
The pellets won't burst.

1130
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,020
Chill. Everything is under control.

1131
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:51,858
Yes.

1132
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,605
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.
Get rid of the rest.

1133
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:57,259
We must have only the best in the party.

1134
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,399
- Alka.
- Yes.

1135
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,367
Have you sent our man to the police headquarters?

1136
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,029
Yes. He's been waiting
since the morning.

1137
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,663
She will definitely go there.

1138
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,036
You don't worry.
Dinesh will handle her.

1139
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,290
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1140
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,548
Angelina, baby...

1141
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,176
...what's wrong with you?

1142
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:18,928
- Nothing...
- Nothing!

1143
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,176
She hasn't slept well last night.

1144
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,716
Is your name Julia or Angelina?

1145
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:25,809
Julia...

1146
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,263
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1147
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,442
Look at your condition.
Why don't you do something about it?

1148
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,603
I am just tired...

1149
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,697
Tired, huh?

1150
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,360
That's why you have this strip of cloth on your forehead.

1151
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:44,824
I understand.

1152
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,452
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1153
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,455
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1154
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,501
No, no, no...

1155
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,875
Let it be, Mattu.
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1156
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,379
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1157
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:02,547
Please let her stay. Please.

1158
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,682
- Come on.
- I am alright.

1159
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,932
- Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1160
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:17,737
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1161
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,657
- Hurry.
- Yes.

1162
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,161
Runa...

1163
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,785
Runa...

1164
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,375
Get her quickly!

1165
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,791
Runa... No! Runa!

1166
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:36,998
Take her away. Come on!

1167
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,169
Runa!

1168
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,381
Please don't take her. Please stop!

1169
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:55,062
Shivani, don't stretch this case too much.

1170
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:58,019
We have got the man we were looking for.

1171
01:16:58,155 --> 01:16:59,440
But we didn't, Sir!

1172
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,943
The mastermind of this syndicate is still roam ing free!

1173
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:05,110
This is what you think, Shivani.
We don't know that for sure.

1174
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:08,449
I know that for sure, Sir.
I have spoken to him myself.

1175
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,121
And not just drugs...

1176
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,824
...but he also is the kingpin
of sex trafficking.

1177
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,749
Shivani, trafficking is altogether a different matter.

1178
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:19,165
We have a trafficking department to investigate that.

1179
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,590
Department?

1180
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:25,846
There's a department to lodge
an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1181
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:29,009
In spite of that why is just one out
of every twenty complaint registered?

1182
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,719
Sir, you don't need the law to do something.

1183
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:32,977
You need intent.

1184
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,224
And you are determined to find
that girl all by yourself, right?

1185
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,851
She has a name too. Pyaari.

1186
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:45,567
All these girls who need our
help just end up being 'that girl'.

1187
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,657
No name, no ties.

1188
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,747
It's very easy to give up on them.

1189
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,956
You know what, Shivani. You
are being unnecessarily emotional.

1190
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,879
So one should get emotional only after girls are raped?

1191
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:03,171
What's the point of holding a candle
march after everything's over?

1192
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,137
After all these days, I don't know
what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1193
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:10,721
I don't even know if I'll ever
find her. Or if she'll be alive.

1194
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,385
But that doesn't mean that...

1195
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:16,181
...I forget about all these
girls like the rest of us.

1196
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,353
And that too after being a police officer.

1197
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:20,733
You know what, Sir...

1198
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:24,906
The Dayour police force gets
emotional and works for these girls,

1199
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,574
...nobody will dare
to harm them.

1200
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,491
Enough, Shivani!

1201
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,954
I agree that we have arrested a drug dealer...

1202
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,456
...and drugs worth lakhs
because of you.

1203
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,417
But now allow us to take over from here.

1204
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,706
Is that clear?

1205
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,041
Sir, why us all the time?

1206
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,540
Shivani, please don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

1207
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:44,462
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1208
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:45,376
Thank you, Sir.

1209
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,174
- Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1210
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,763
I asked since when do you drive an auto.

1211
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,590
Past four or five years.

1212
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,343
- Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1213
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,729
- There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1214
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,410
She escaped!

1215
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:36,286
Hello?

1216
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,618
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1217
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,412
About what, Miss Shivani?
The case is shut.

1218
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,789
- Hear me out.
- Okay.

1219
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:46,414
We share the smallest details of our life...

1220
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,717
...with our girlfriend
boyfriend or spouse, right?

1221
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,960
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1222
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:52,715
Correct!

1223
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,332
So Vakil will also have someone like this.

1224
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,222
Nobody came to claim his body.

1225
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,078
Because of fear of interrogation.

1226
01:20:58,312 --> 01:20:59,927
Tell me what's your point.

1227
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:02,854
Vakil must surely have someone.

1228
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,356
Maybe not a wife. But someone.

1229
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,726
She will surely know whom Vakil worked for.

1230
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:11,279
It seems possible.
But how will we find her?

1231
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,108
Whatever you found on Vakil's body...

1232
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,652
...gun, pant, shirt,
wallet, anything.

1233
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:17,619
Get everything.

1234
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,576
We'll definitely find a clue.

1235
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,491
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1236
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,076
How can get it out of office?

1237
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,787
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1238
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,256
You will get me in trouble Miss Shivani.

1239
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:33,086
I was so worried getting these things out of office.

1240
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,759
Honestly whatever we are doing is illegal.

1241
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:38,932
Always by the book.

1242
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:43,345
How will you arrest criminals
if you keep working by the law?

1243
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,354
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't
get involved in this any further.

1244
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:51,062
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1245
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:52,236
Please, Ma'am.

1246
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:55,615
Okay, okay. We'll cross
the bridge when we get there.

1247
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,444
What bridge? There's nothing here!

1248
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,166
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1249
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,047
That's surprising.

1250
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:14,051
In an era of readymade, this guy wore stitched clothes!

1251
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,548
Classic old school.

1252
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:19,097
Someone who stitches his trousers
and shirt form the same tailor...

1253
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,471
...is most likely to get
all his clothes stitched from him.

1254
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,268
Where is Modern Tailors?

1255
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,845
- Modern Tailors... Iiyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1256
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,522
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1257
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,224
- From here?
- Yes.

1258
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,018
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1259
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:36,733
I am a social worker.
I am attached with AIIMS.

1260
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,952
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1261
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:44,206
I know him for the past 23 years.

1262
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,868
Was this an accident or some police case?

1263
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,916
I don't know that.

1264
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:53,291
My job is to find out if he has any relatives.

1265
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:57,761
I don't know of any relatives.

1266
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:01,097
But there is a lady with whom he was acquainted with...

1267
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,675
...for the past many years.

1268
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:08,893
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1269
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:13,357
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance
with her was still strong.

1270
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,814
Then she should know about his death.

1271
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:17,939
Where does she stay?

1272
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,777
- Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1273
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:25,364
Yes?

1274
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:26,664
Is Minu Rastogi here?

1275
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:27,783
Who are you?

1276
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,540
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1277
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:31,748
Please come in.

1278
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:34,207
- Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1279
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:36,208
Harish...

1280
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,168
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1281
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:45,809
Get this medicine.

1282
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,224
Yes, Ma'am.

1283
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,896
Please sit.

1284
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,399
- Sugar?
- One spoon.

1285
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:56,478
I have diabetes.

1286
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,823
My doctor has completely banned sugar for me.

1287
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:01,988
You are young.

1288
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:05,821
- Here...
- Thank you.

1289
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:11,915
How did Mr. Vakil's
fame reach the Mumbai police?

1290
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:14,542
It's a long story.

1291
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,791
I have a lot of time.

1292
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:21,594
- Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1293
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,930
- Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1294
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,929
If I find it later, you know I'll shoot you, right?

1295
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:27,638
Yes.

1296
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,353
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1297
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:33,978
Go do your work.

1298
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:40,280
Actually...

1299
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,909
I hadn't sent Harish to get medicine.

1300
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,280
I had sent him to see if there are cops outside.

1301
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,707
No, no, I have come alone.

1302
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:58,957
Oh God, strange are your ways!

1303
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:03,717
The person my son is looking for in the whole city...

1304
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:06,970
...is sitting right here in his
own house. And that too all alone!

1305
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:16,150
That boy who calls you,
is my son. Karan.

1306
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,270
What do you call him?

1307
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:24,358
The kid.

1308
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:27,573
This is his house.

1309
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,201
What's happening to you?

1310
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,824
Feeling dizzy?

1311
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:37,542
Oh yeah... I put
sedatives in your tea.

1312
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:44,799
Now you won't be capable of doing anything.

1313
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:49,475
And my Karan will be back in some time.

1314
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,228
You killed Vakil, right!

1315
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:59,352
My Karan will torture you to death.

1316
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:03,821
What fun it'll be!

1317
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,004
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1318
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:25,380
Hey...

1319
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,173
I am Walt.

1320
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,269
Actually my name is Karan.

1321
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,389
But I have changed it to Walt.

1322
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,728
It's the name of the hero in an English show.

1323
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,072
So you did keep your promise.

1324
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,151
You found me on the 27 th day.

1325
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,953
That's amazing.

1326
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:55,828
Congratulations!

1327
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,495
I will keep my promise too.
I won't kill you.

1328
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,131
I'll just bring you to a state...

1329
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,550
...where you'll beg me
to kill you.

1330
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,170
You!

1331
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:31,197
Mom, what's for lunch?

1332
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,157
Are all the girls ready?

1333
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:40,286
Alka, you are on what's app again!

1334
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,006
- Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1335
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,788
I'll get them ready in just five minutes.

1336
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:48,839
How many times have I told you
that don't doll them up like kids?

1337
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:53,177
Those rascals should see
their lovers in them not daughters.

1338
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,388
Honey, please. Thank you.

1339
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:56,267
Open your mouth...

1340
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:58,477
Properly...

1341
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,097
Good girl!

1342
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,353
That's good.

1343
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,441
And don't behave like a fool there.

1344
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,196
Be sexy!

1345
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:13,618
Good girl!

1346
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,445
Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1347
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,406
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1348
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,122
Remove the pins. Quick. Quick.

1349
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,368
Thank you.

1350
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,421
Look at that.

1351
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:29,919
Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1352
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:31,456
- Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1353
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,881
- And put on a smile.
- Keep it down.

1354
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,385
- Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1355
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:36,592
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1356
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:37,892
She's very strong.

1357
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,432
- Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1358
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,143
Who is she?

1359
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:44,808
I don't know.

1360
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:48,152
- Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1361
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,656
Is every one ready?
Alka, anyone left?

1362
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,278
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1363
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,031
Should I take them downstairs?

1364
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,112
No, no! I am going
to perform here now.

1365
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:58,367
Everybody please wait and watch.

1366
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,166
Come on. Get out and be ready.

1367
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,039
- Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1368
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,585
Come on. You foreigner, come on.

1369
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:05,750
Get out.

1370
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,624
- Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1371
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,004
She's not asking you.

1372
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:14,554
Julia, there's no movie being shown here.

1373
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:16,381
Go.

1374
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,183
Go, or else I'll slap you! Go!

1375
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:18,887
Go!

1376
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:24,481
We still have to deck her up.
Get her out of the sack.

1377
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:25,603
- Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1378
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:31,279
Ma'am, please co-operate.
Why are you fighting so much?

1379
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:34,612
Hang on, hang on. There, it's open.

1380
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:38,070
Hold it Madam . Cool down.

1381
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,161
Get lost!

1382
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,705
Listen girl!

1383
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:44,751
I have been doing this since before you were even born!

1384
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:47,420
I know exactly how to tame the likes of you!

1385
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:49,164
Just untie my hands and see...

1386
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:53,468
...you won't have a tongue
left to speak or eyes to see!

1387
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,091
Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

1388
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:57,426
Don't hit the face.

1389
01:29:57,934 --> 01:29:59,390
- Aunty!
- Pyaari!

1390
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,226
Hey! Wait!

1391
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:03,387
- Aunty! Please!
- Pyaari!

1392
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:07,228
Please, please! Let her go!
Let me meet her.

1393
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:08,934
Once, just once.

1394
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,941
I'll do whatever you say.
Do my make-up.

1395
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,949
Saw Mattu!
That's how you fix such dames!

1396
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:18,033
Get your make-up done.

1397
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:19,410
- Pyaari!
- Aunty!

1398
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,211
I slapped her hard.

1399
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,044
Pyaari...

1400
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,602
All this is because of me.

1401
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:47,268
No, Aunty!

1402
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:51,108
I am alive because of you.

1403
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,443
Enough of this nonsense!
Enough! Stop it!

1404
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,951
Stop this emotional
melodrama. Come on!

1405
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:06,241
Aunty, no!

1406
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,209
- You have to get your make-up done.
- Take her away!

1407
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:09,585
Aunty!

1408
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,716
Now, it's looking beautiful.

1409
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:18,419
Hi, darling!

1410
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,634
Oh hi! Long time.

1411
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:28,347
Take good care of them, sweety.

1412
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,440
Please come, Sir!

1413
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,393
The whole arrangement is especially for you.

1414
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:34,397
Thank you.

1415
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:35,649
Everything is ready, Sir.

1416
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:36,521
Sir...

1417
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:38,398
Hi, good evening.

1418
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,734
Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come?

1419
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:44,370
- He will come at his own time.
- Oh yes. Of course!

1420
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:45,782
You first show me your arrangements.

1421
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:47,199
- Please come, Sir.
- Sir, your phone...

1422
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:50,501
Angie, baby, wait. Right
now he's just checking things out.

1423
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,869
He'll come later.

1424
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,124
Come, Sir.

1425
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,539
Security is very tight.

1426
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,674
It's for your benefit, Sir.

1427
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,424
Only when there's no fear of being photographed...

1428
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,097
...can a person enjoy freely.

1429
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:05,968
Julia, come, baby.

1430
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:09,179
Come, come, for Sir.

1431
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,230
Don't be shy. Sir...

1432
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:21,858
Girls get abducted in our cities for free...

1433
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:23,489
In broad day light.

1434
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:29,874
But when one guy sets up a small organized business...

1435
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,538
...and everyone gets upset!

1436
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,626
Why did you do all of this?

1437
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:37,711
What did you get?

1438
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,255
You women get personal too soon.

1439
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,803
I agree that you are a cop, from the crime branch.

1440
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,347
But to obsessively chase just one criminal?

1441
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:54,398
What kind of professionalism is this?

1442
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,776
Where did you learn this?

1443
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:58,819
Nonsense.

1444
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:07,287
That's why we men climb on top and
you women just stare at the ceiling.

1445
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:10,365
You know what I am saying, Miss Shivani?

1446
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,123
The night is young.

1447
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:18,123
Stare at the ceiling and scream your lungs out.

1448
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:20,003
Scream?

1449
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:26,384
Scream.

1450
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:38,150
That's right.

1451
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,020
There's no point.

1452
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,280
Crime branch!

1453
01:33:59,134 --> 01:33:59,998
Sir has come.

1454
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:07,597
Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu!

1455
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:08,966
- Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1456
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,220
- How are you?
- All good.

1457
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,017
Everything's ready for you.

1458
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:15,604
Welcome, Sir!

1459
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,020
- All well?
- With your blessings.

1460
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:19,518
- Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1461
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:20,776
Wait here.

1462
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:26,740
Come, Sir.

1463
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:29,068
Come, Sir.

1464
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,533
Tandon, have you checked everything personally?

1465
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,496
Yes, Sir.

1466
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,870
You are bound to be happy with the arrangements.

1467
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:38,411
Come, Sir.

1468
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:41,168
- Everything's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1469
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:43,465
Sir, to your left.

1470
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:53,559
The arrangements look great.

1471
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:57,017
Yes. You are the one who gave
us the opportunity to serve you.

1472
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:59,724
There's a special gift for you in the suite upstairs.

1473
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:01,647
You should check it out if you are in the mood.

1474
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:03,190
Everybody knows.

1475
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,697
Be it the opposition or women...

1476
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,403
...I am always in a mood to crush!

1477
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:13,029
Spoken like a true leader!
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1478
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:23,585
Hello!

1479
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:27,252
I have heard a lot about you.

1480
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:30,513
You?

1481
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:33,766
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1482
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:37,478
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1483
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:39,559
I am sure even you do.

1484
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:41,481
My hobby is this.

1485
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,735
Have you really come to rape me?

1486
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:47,693
I don't know how one pretends to rape.

1487
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:51,401
You fight with all your strength.
Only then it'll be fun.

1488
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,261
You want to rape me!

1489
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:15,550
Get up! Come on!

1490
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:20,851
Stop this party!

1491
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,435
Get out!

1492
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:23,687
What is happening?

1493
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,734
Walt, where the hell are you?

1494
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,181
- Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1495
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,696
Where did she come from!

1496
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:30,147
She has lost it!

1497
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:36,371
Karan Rastogi, do you want this minister alive or not?

1498
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,619
Tandon! Do something, Tandon!

1499
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,415
Mattu, wait!

1500
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:41,955
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1501
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,662
...you and your mom
will die a miserable death.

1502
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:46,831
One second, Ma'am. What do you want?

1503
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:49,797
I want all the girls out.

1504
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,253
What are you staring at, Alka?
Send all the girls out.

1505
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:53,416
- Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1506
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:54,380
Mattu, are you dead!

1507
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:57,175
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1508
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:58,009
Hurry up!

1509
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,010
Fast.

1510
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:00,602
Fast, girls! Fast!

1511
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:01,846
Hurry up, Alka.

1512
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:03,894
- Pyaari, wait.
- Aunty.

1513
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:05,600
- Mattu!
- Yes?

1514
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:07,734
Give the key of the mobile locker to Pyaari.

1515
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:09,107
Give her the damn key.

1516
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,404
You got the girls.

1517
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:15,605
What else do you want?

1518
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:16,694
You.

1519
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,200
You will come with me.

1520
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,743
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1521
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,578
- Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1522
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:28,422
- Help!
- Raise your hands.

1523
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:33,428
Tell them that no one moves from here till you get back.

1524
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,637
Nobody moves from here.
Tandon, keep him in check.

1525
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:36,433
You wait.

1526
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,887
Everybody, we have got a bit of a situation.

1527
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,487
I am going to sort it out and be right back.

1528
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,144
Raise your hands! Move!

1529
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:43,892
Move!

1530
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:45,890
Come on.

1531
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,228
Move quickly! Look ahead.

1532
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:56,075
Damn! She has locked the door!

1533
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:57,743
Come on quickly.

1534
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:59,661
Aunty, but the exit is this side.

1535
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:00,909
We are not going out.

1536
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:02,160
Open it!

1537
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,504
Open! Get in.

1538
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,507
Come on, girls. Get in.

1539
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:14,585
Be there.

1540
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,055
Pyaari, close the door.

1541
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:21,721
Lock the door. Lock it!

1542
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,192
- Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1543
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:35,398
Get in!

1544
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:40,699
Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all.

1545
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,157
You guys think we cops are morons, right?

1546
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:48,210
But how did you manage to do this?

1547
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:51,130
When I got the address to your place...

1548
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:53,670
...I had no clue
that it is your house.

1549
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:57,675
- Where is D-40?
- Second from the front.

1550
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:00,386
In crime branch we are trained to...

1551
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:04,727
...carefully scan a place
before entering.

1552
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:08,515
- Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1553
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:11,688
Who else stays with her?

1554
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,895
Her son and a servant.

1555
01:39:14,532 --> 01:39:15,487
How old is the son?

1556
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:17,106
Around 25-26.

1557
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:21,153
I was wondering what to do next when I heard a sound.

1558
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:26,157
Maybe God was trying to tell me something.

1559
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:29,786
I had heard this Azaan before.

1560
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:31,124
But where?

1561
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,164
Then I remembered.

1562
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:35,583
But you can't do any harm to me.

1563
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:37,168
Because I am still alive.

1564
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,969
And I am comfortably sitting in my own house.

1565
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:45,635
That is the first time I wondered
if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1566
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,017
But then who will take a risk with you?

1567
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:52,225
I began watching your house.

1568
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,143
I spotted you the next day.

1569
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,020
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1570
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,278
But one look at your sly face...

1571
01:40:00,786 --> 01:40:01,820
...and I knew it had to be you.

1572
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:05,405
The first thing I did was put a GPS tracker in your car.

1573
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,125
48 hours went by...

1574
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:17,212
...you didn't go to any
of your hostels or warehouses.

1575
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,252
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1576
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:21,136
...and also the other girls.

1577
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:25,220
Even if we did arrest you, what could we charge you with?

1578
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,766
That's when I decided that there's no point wasting time.

1579
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:30,771
Now you yourself will take me to Pyaari.

1580
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,980
I entered your house but I was fully prepared.

1581
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:37,528
I just had to make the move at the right time.

1582
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:46,078
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1583
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:49,578
He'll track us on the GPS
and come here with the police unit.

1584
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:52,834
Pyaari, get the phone.

1585
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:55,871
And what if I would have killed you right then?

1586
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,504
I had to take that risk.

1587
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:03,926
Like I said, I knew your type.

1588
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:06,549
You wouldn't kill me that easily.

1589
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:09,681
You would want to exploit me like other women.

1590
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:13,898
I must give it to you. But what now?

1591
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:15,979
Sodhi, come.

1592
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,238
The police will take at least 25 minutes to get here.

1593
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:24,534
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1594
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:28,826
And I am standing in between you and your freedom.

1595
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,120
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1596
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,878
Women... women...

1597
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,754
Take everything personally, right?

1598
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:42,418
Come on.

1599
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:48,053
Let me see how far on top a man can climb.

1600
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:49,850
As you wish.

1601
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:12,626
Aunty!

1602
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,088
Get up! Get up!

1603
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:04,167
Hit me, Ma'am.
How much will you hit me?

1604
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:12,388
You will me hit me a little and then arrest me, right?

1605
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:17,183
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1606
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:20,391
This is India.

1607
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,863
Over here, if you have the right contacts...

1608
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:29,359
...the biggest of scandals
can be buried.

1609
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:32,862
This is trivial in comparison.

1610
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,790
So till then you hit me and have fun.

1611
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:38,997
Hit me, Ma'am.

1612
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,537
There is nothing else you can do.

1613
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,296
This is India.

1614
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,673
This one thing you are right about.

1615
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:53,556
This is India.

1616
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:55,426
'This' is what goes on here.

1617
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:04,193
These people sitting outside will bury your crime?

1618
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:08,732
They can do it only if you reach the police station.

1619
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:13,536
But you won't reach the police
station because this is India.

1620
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:16,997
Here, if you don't want to bother the court too much...

1621
01:44:17,168 --> 01:44:19,250
...issues can be settled this way.

1622
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:23,537
Get up!

1623
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:29,760
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1624
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:33,221
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1625
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:36,808
Get up!

1626
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:48,445
Some also call it the "Lokpal Bill".

1627
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:52,699
What's your plan?

1628
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:56,783
Are you going to murder me?

1629
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:00,408
In front of everyone?

1630
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:04,624
This is India.

1631
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:07,873
In India, if 50 people take the law in their hands...

1632
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:10,801
...and kill someone, then
it's not called a murder.

1633
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:12,969
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1634
01:45:26,487 --> 01:45:31,106
From right now, never again will I let you crush my pride

1635
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:36,444
You can have my body slain but you can't have my soul tied

1636
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:51,293
From right now, never again will I let you crush my pride

1637
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:56,548
You can have my body slain but you can't have my soul tied

1638
01:45:56,809 --> 01:46:01,269
Touch my heart and I promise you will mean the world to me

1639
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,937
But if you ever mess with me

1640
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:06,561
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1641
01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:11,858
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1642
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:31,958
If you think being a man gives you
the right to sell me like cattle

1643
01:46:32,177 --> 01:46:36,841
I will in that same place destroy your entire race

1644
01:46:37,182 --> 01:46:41,516
Hold my hand and walk with me
and I will never leave your side

1645
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:44,311
But if you ever mess with me

1646
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:47,014
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1647
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:52,228
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1648
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:12,381
In a skirt or a saree, at day
or at night I will not walk afraid

1649
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:17,553
I won't lead a life full of fear and regret

1650
01:47:22,728 --> 01:47:27,518
In a world where mothers and sisters
are not a blessing but a curse

1651
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:32,526
I will break all shackles of rules belonging to this world

1652
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:37,365
Change the way you look at me and
I will shield you from the evil eye

1653
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:39,900
But if you ever mess with me

1654
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:42,824
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget

1655
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:52,208
Walt died on his way to the hospital.

1656
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:56,174
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1657
01:47:56,637 --> 01:47:59,925
He revealed everything about Walt,

1658
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:02,427
Minu and Vakil along with
Tandon's involvement to the court.

1659
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:06,723
First, the girls made up Minu's face.

1660
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:08,387
And then God did.

1661
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:10,727
Minu later suffered a paralysis attack.

1662
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:18,026
Taneja survived and is now in Tihar jail.

1663
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:21,950
His scarred face is an amusement to most in the jail.

1664
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:31,164
Today, we could bring back the smile on Pyaari's face.

1665
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:34,921
But there are many like Pyaari that
have to be rescued from this muck.

1666
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:38,292
Many others like Karan Rastogi
who are still scot-free...

1667
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:39,801
...must be stopped.

1668
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,136
The Mardaani (Fighter) that's hidden within...

1669
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:45,049
...has to be discovered by
every woman, every girl herself.

1670
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:47,384
The war is still on.
