- how will we proceed?
- Mr. President...

71
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,804
Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt
to reestablish himself within the city,

and we can't allow him and his sicarios

So my recommendation, Mr. President,
is that we occupy Medellin.

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,766
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

We're going to have to move everything.

159
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,528
- What do you mean by "everything"?
- Everything. The labs...

160
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,766
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...
we're moving everything.

161
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,842
Boss, even the labs?

162
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,808
They're well-guarded. There's no problem.

163
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,044
Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

164
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,728
The cops are going through all of the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

165
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,928
Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards.

166
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,096
Who are you calling a bastard,
you son of a bitch? Huh?

167
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,966
We're... moving... everything.

168
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,444
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,170
Yes, Don Pablo.

170
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,607
We're also going to need more men.

171
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,040
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

172
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,170
- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

173
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,771
And one last thing.

174
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,003
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,803
He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.

176
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,200
- Done, boss.
- [Velasco] Boss, I'm sorry,

177
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,648
but you can't risk yourself like that.

178
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,166
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

179
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,728
I want people to know that Pablo Escobar
doesn't hide like a rat.

180
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,809
Because we...

181
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,403
are the Medellin cartel, motherfucker!

182
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,289
<i>[Steve]
Now keep in mind...</i>

183
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,569
<i>the Medellin cartel
wasn 't just one big gang.</i>

184
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,450
<i>It was made up of</i> a <i>bunch
of smaller gangs.</i>

185
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,284
<i>A collective, so to speak.</i>

186
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,331
<i>And as far as Pablo was concerned,
he was still their leader.</i>

187
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,523
<i>In his mind, every trafficker in Medellin
had to pay tribute to him.</i>

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,881
<i>Only</i> a <i>guy who'd killed
thousands of people</i>

189
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,806
<i>could think Judy Moncada would forget
what he'd done to her husband Kiko</i>

190
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,451
<i>and his business partner Fernando Ga/eano,</i>

191
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,330
<i>the guys who were running his business
while he was inside.</i>

192
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,688
<i>Fuckin' psycho. He thought
that they were stealing from him...</i>

193
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,847
<i>and naturally,
they got the short end of the stick.</i>

194
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,007
[Kiko]
Pablo, no!

195
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,200
[in Spanish] You believe whatever the fuck
you want to believe, you son of a bitch!

196
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,408
<i>[Steve]
Why he thought Judy'd be okay with that...</i>

197
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,086
<i>Well, she wasn 't.</i>

198
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,289
<i>And alongside her brother Jaime,
and head of security Diego Murillo,</i>

199
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,400
a.k.a. <i>Don Berna, they'd broken away
from the Medellin cartel.</i>

200
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,201
<i>And now that Pablo was out,
they wanted payback.</i>

201
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,243
<i>And as for the other gangs,
they were all up for grabs.</i>

202
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,130
[man grunts, groans]

203
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,806
<i>Take the Prisco brothers, for instance.</i>

204
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,689
<i>The oldest of whom, Ricardo,</i>

205
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,127
<i>was</i> a <i>respected member
of the medical community.</i>

206
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,761
[muffled groans, yelling]

207
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,846
[man screams]

208
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,922
<i>[Steve]
He didn't know who to side with.</i>

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,321
<i>Neither did the Gal/en gang,</i>

210
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,970
<i>who became famous</i> a <i>year later</i>

211
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,249
<i>when they murdered Colombian soccer player
Andres Escobar</i>

212
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,008
<i>for accidentally scoring a goal against
his own country in the 1994 World Cup.</i>

213
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,811
<i>But this wasn't</i> a <i>soccer game.
This was the blow business.</i>

214
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,330
<i>And whose side they chose would come down
to two things: who offered the better deal</i>

215
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,641
<i>and who had the better chance
of winning the war.</i>

216
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,530
[Jaime speaking Spanish]
This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.

217
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,807
Relax? What do you want me to do?

218
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,963
Should I sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

219
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,169
and kill me and my daughter?
He's going to come and kill you, too.

220
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,816
- What do you think about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone, all right?

221
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,844
- Jaime, what country do you live in'?
- [Judy chuckles]

222
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,764
If he hasn't killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

223
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,241
Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

224
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,891
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

225
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,884
There's a cop
on every fucking street corner.

226
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,922
Pablo can't move.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,925
Then we have to find and kill the bastard
before the police find him.

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,525
[Jaime]
Judy, listen.

229
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,602
Listen to me! Listen!

230
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,129
Pablo, right now, it's like
he's like a caged rat. Understand?

231
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,725
Jaime.

232
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,407
Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo's capable of?

233
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,405
- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

234
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,404
They shouldn't underestimate us either.

235
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,687
And Pablo's got very few friends left,
and you know it.

236
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,366
Pablo will always have friends.

237
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,801
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

238
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,286
It should be clear
that being loyal to Escobar

239
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,522
will only earn you a bullet in the head.

240
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,810
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

241
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,211
[Berna]
Judy»-

242
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,442
what do we do with the labs?

243
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,890
What do you suggest?

244
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,647
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

245
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,171
[scoffs]

246
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,007
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

247
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,290
That's stupid, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense. Huh?

248
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,081
A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

249
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,242
Let's join forces with them.

250
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,569
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

251
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,290
I'll talk t0 him.

252
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,204
[Berna]
Jaime, be very careful with those people.

253
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,760
[phone ringing]

254
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,126
- Hello?
- Okay?

255
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,123
- That looks nice.
- One moment.

256
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,406
Ricardo?

257
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,726
Don Pablo.

258
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,731
Of course. There was no decision to make.

259
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,841
You know that you can always count on us.

260
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,644
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
- [music plays nearby]

261
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,691
Sweetie! [kissing]

262
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,688
- [slaps car]
- Hey!

263
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,841
Fag!

264
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,446
What's going on, Limén?

265
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,683
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

266
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,687
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

267
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,808
What are you doing here? Are you going in?

268
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,008
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

269
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,811
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

270
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,245
Mmm-hmm.

271
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,524
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

272
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,523
You know how it is. I have to pay rent.

273
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,722
Listen, Limon,
don't you want to make good money?

274
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,245
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm?

275
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,691
Doing what?

276
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,848
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

277
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,769
Pablo Escobar, brother.

278
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,846
- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.
- Limén, I'm serious, brother.

279
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,005
The boss asked us to find someone...

280
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,410
someone clean, who the police don't know.

281
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,169
He would go in the trunk.

282
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,602
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.

283
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,841
Mmm.

284
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,409
What do you think, brother?

285
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,886
There's cops everywhere.

286
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,930
Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

287
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,923
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

288
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,446
Then who, brother?

289
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,963
"No!
"No?

290
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,640
- Thank you.
- Why not, Maritza?

291
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,007
- No.
- Hmm? What's wrong with it? Nothing.

292
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,402
- L'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

293
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,565
- Yes?
- [Maritza sighs]

294
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,802
Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

295
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,644
- I can't.
- Get out of my way.

296
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,526
Maritza... I need you to do it.

297
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,610
It'll be the easiest money
you'll make in your life.

298
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,490
You can quit your second job, understand?

299
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
You'll be able to take care
of your daughter.

300
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,522
Haven't I always done right by you?

301
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,082
I've always helped you
and your family, right? S0?

302
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,805
Right?

303
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,642
You're a son of a bitch, you know?

304
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,371
So what? Hmm?

305
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,803
[murmuring indistinctly]

306
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,883
- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

307
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,203
What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

308

Let them see me. Let them see me.

461
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,016
- I never thought I'd meet you in person.
- How are you?

462
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,769
I'm well, Ma'am, how are you?

463
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,249
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

464
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,449
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

465
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,490
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

466
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,887
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

467

For you, Ma'am.

I don't spend enough time
looking at your face?

That's better.

474
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,126
[in Spanish] There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

Nothing?

You picked up the "American" part, right?

Murphy!

- [in Spanish] What's wrong, brother?
- [in Spanish] Suck my dick, please.

479
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,762
- [in Spanish] DEA, Agent Pefia.
- [Rosa] Pay attention.

480
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,808
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

<i>Oh, yeah? Which one?</i>

482
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,242
There's a reward, right?

483
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,042
Yes, there's a reward.

484
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,169
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

485
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,611
La Quica.

486
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,766
La Quica?

487
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,921
You know La Quica?

488
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,606
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

489
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,365
He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

490
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,130
Do you work there?

491
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,727
<i>Yes.</i>

How long ago was this?

493
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,482
A couple of hours ago.

494
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,291
All right, we'll look into it.

495
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,726
- You think it's legit?
- Let's find out.

496
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,929
How credible is your source?

497
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,686
[Javier] It was an unsolicited phone call.
She asked to speak to an American.

498
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,696
We would just need a couple of cars
and a few men.

499
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,769
[Pinzén] Well, my men are either busy here
or outside in the street.

500
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,003
And I'm not relocating men
to chase down bullshit tips.

501
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,129
If this turns out not to be bullshit,
La Quica could give us Pablo.

502
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,401
[Pinzén]
So go. Go ahead.

503
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,926
Since when do you need an excuse
to go to a whorehouse?

504
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,161
[in Spanish]
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

505
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,400
We're not asking for a lot.

506
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,288
[in English]
One vehicle, three men.

507
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,606

No, Berna, and lwon't

<i>- Listen to me, Jaime...
- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.</i>

513
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,367
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

514
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,886
He's with us. He supports us.

515
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,480
Everything is firm. Everything is good.
What more could we want?

516
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,808
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

517
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,006
<i>Pay attention to me.</i>

518
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,721
<i>First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?</i>

519
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,485
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

520
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,164
means a bullet in the head, brother.

521
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,609
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security...

522
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,966
What?

523
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,328
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

524
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,210
<i>Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?</i>

525

Jaime, listen to me.

526
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,729
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.

Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak right now, brother.

You know this.

538

The city's filled with cops.

539

Pablo can't move, brother.

The truth of the matter, just as it is.

And this is the truth, Berna:

I know of someone who's very powerful.

We don't have a lot of options.

If I hadn't escaped,

He says he's willing to negotiate the

Turn on the television.

- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the television.

This peace is now threatened

Escobar has been named
the bloodiest narcoterrorist of all time.

<i>for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.</i>

<i>It is my hope that through this reward...</i>

<i>and murder.</i>

714
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,721

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,808
that under no circumstances...

716
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,646
