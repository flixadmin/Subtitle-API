How did you know I would win?

I never meant for you to get hurt.

You did. You wanted to save Lee.

I wanted to save you both.

Yeah. But you could only save one of us.

That's why you told Tetch to kill Lee,

because you knew he would do the opposite.

At least tell me you caught him.

It's a shame I don't have a plus one.

159
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,303
I can't go anyway. I have a date.

160
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,274
With the woman
you claim to be in love with

161
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,106
after only knowing for a few hours?

162
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,191
Heart keeps its own time.

163
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,149
I'm partial to the purple.

164
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,407
The brocade brings out my eyes.

165
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,112
Are you sure you aren't
mistaking infatuation for love?

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
You did say she is
the spitting image of Kringle.

167
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,869
Isabella's beautiful and smart.

168
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,373
So, she bears
a passing resemblance to Kristen.

169
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,462
It's just the universe telling me...

170
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,545
Telling me I have a second chance at love.

171
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,715
Where did you say she works?

172
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,884
The Main Public Library.

173
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,511
You're right about the brocade.

174
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,058
Do you mind if I skedaddle?

175
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,184
I just need to
pick up a few things for tonight.

176
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,185
Who am I to stand in the way of love?

177
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,075
Missing guard from the lab.
Called in sick.

178
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,743
My gut says he's lying.

179
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:01,252
Well, he's certainly no candidate
for sainthood. Gambling, petty theft...

180
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,788
Might I have a word, Captain?

181
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,707
Bring him in. What is it?

182
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,682
I just heard from the head of virology
at the Biomedical facility.

183
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,088
Is this is about the tests
they're running on Alice's Tetch's blood?

184
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,131
- Yes, in the first trial...
- One of the rats ran off the rails

185
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,554
and murdered the rest. I know.
Doc Thompkins told me.

186
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,011
But, uh, she thought
it might've been an anomaly.

187
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,184
I'm afraid
the second study proves otherwise.

188
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,441
As in the first study, the rats showed
increased strength and agility.

189
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:28,905
But, by week two,
the rats were exhibiting manic tendencies.

190
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,281
Violent rage.

191
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,785
By the study's end, every trace
of their original demeanor had vanished.

192
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,163
I assume they're, uh, working on a cure.

193
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,453
Yes, but it could take years.

194
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,456
Well, we only have hours. Damn it!

- We have to find Tetch. Now.
- Yes, sir.

become cocktail mix.

201

Ah!

00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,835
Bravo, Alice.

Truly, your best work.

- Please calm down.

205

He said, "Kill Lee?"

206
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,350
He knew Tetch wouldn't.

207
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,978
How? How could he
possibly have known that?

208
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,196
Somehow he got inside Tetch's head,

209
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,442
and he knew that he would do
the opposite of what he told him to.

210
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,947
I see. So, why would Gordon offer up the
woman he's dating in place of my fiancée?

Fine.

But, Jim Gordon's the reason
you were in danger, to begin with.

I want him out of our lives.

216

Of course.

217

because I'm afraid.

Jim, I know what you did last night.

230

you knew he would shoot Vale.

No. I'm sorry. That's not true.

to be honest with me.

"Your dad's a hero."

524

All I knew is you went to court
every day and every night,

00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,805
you came home and you played ball with me
while Mom made dinner.

526
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,883
Then I got older.

527
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,520
And I understood you were a hero.

528
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,858
Only, for me, it wasn't just that
you'd been a great DA.

00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,945
It was that you got up, day after day.

530
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,153
You faced down
the worst this city had to offer,

531
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,445
but you never brought that home
to Mom and me.

532
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,030
You protected us.

533

I wanted to be just like you.

Turns out, I'm the opposite.

and everyone around me.

No. Come on, Jimmy. I'm far from perfect.

I just don't dwell on it.

That's what counts.

- That's what I'm trying to do.
- No.

You've been hiding behind
self-righteous, lone wolf nonsense

00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,103

A man who values protecting others
above protecting himself.

A man who knows his limits,
but isn't afraid to fail.

for help when he needs it.

I intend to keep that promise.
