13
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,260
It's Friday night!

14
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,740
April 25th, 2003.

15
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,420
I'm just heading to Canyonlands

16
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,260
Just me, the music

17
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,740
and the night!

18
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Love it!

19
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,140
Blue John Canyon,

20
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,900
guide book says:

21
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,580
"1 h 30 min
to the Big Dropper."

22
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,980
I am to take 45 mins of that.

23
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,980
You're doing Blue John, too, huh?

24
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,980
No. Actually,
we're headed for the Dome.

25
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,740
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

26
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Hang on.

27
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,580
Oh, my God!

28
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,980
Let's see this.

29
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,580
You are… here.

30
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,260
We are?

31
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,220
- And…
- I knew that.

32
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,820
And, the Dome, is there.

33
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,340
I can take you that way if you like.

34
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,060
Sorry the…
Friday the 13th there.

35
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,980
Child killer look.

36
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,260
I'm only a psychopath on week days
and today is saturday, so…

37
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,700
Can't take this off… My face.

38
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
Nice!

39
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,940
Aron.

40
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
Kristi.

41
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,340
Allow me to introduce you
to my friend Megan.

42
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,100
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

43
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,340
What do you say?

44
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,380
You're lost, I'm a guide…

45
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
Feel good.

46
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,860
Why not.

47
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,340
- Sure.
- All right.

48
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
This way.

49
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,740
So you bike from Horseshoe.

50
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,100
Is that like 20 miles ?

51
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,340
17 on the odometer.

52
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,100
I thought it was 17.2!

53
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,740
17.3, actually.

54
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,260
You're one of those…

55
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,460
- I'm not one of those.
- You spend a lot of time out here?

56
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,260
That's my second home.

57
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,500
See?

58
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,220
There's the fork, right there.

59
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,380
We totally missed that.

60
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,700
Glad we bumped into you.

61
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,860
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

62
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,580
Exactly.

63
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,180
You go to the one place in America
you guaranteed not to run into a weirdo.

64
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,820
And what happen?!

65
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,620
All right.

66
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,580
So the guide book says

67
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,220
that the route's through here.

68
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,340
But I know a better way.

69
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,460
The cool way.

70
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,980
Guaranteed, best time you can have
with your clothes on.

71
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Although, it's better
with your clothes off.

72
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,100
It is a bit of a climb.

73
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,220
- We climb!
- And a bit of a squeeze.

74
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,940
We squeeze.

75
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,060
So you get us

76
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,180
all the way back in here,

77
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,380
and then you tell us
that you're not a guide.

78
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,100
Well no, I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really wanna do.

79
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,220
That's wonderful to hear.

80
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,700
I've always wanted to be a supermodel

81
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,940
but I don't think that's actually
gonna workout, you know?

82
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,980
Jesus!
What if these things move?

83
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,980
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

84
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,260
- Sure they will!
- What?!

85
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,820
Everything is moving all the time.
Let's just hope not today!

86
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Great.

87
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
All right.

88
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,740
Now, all you got to remember

89
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
is that everything will be okay.

90
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,580
Oh, my God!

91
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,460
- Oh, my God!
- Aron?

92
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,100
Are you okay?

93
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,260
Aron?

94
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,740
Listen to the guy, he is fine.

95
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,340
Yeah.

96
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,620
He's bad shit.

97
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
You're bad shit!

98
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,100
Come on!

99
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,580
You've got to come down here!

100
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,180
Trust me!

101
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,620
- Trust you? We'll kill you Aron!
- Oh, please.

102
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,220
You love this.

103
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Nice job!

104
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,100
- Megan, you're missing it!
- Come on, it's amazing!

105
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,500
- Oh, fuck, fuck.
- Just jump, Megan.

106
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,860
Fuck!

107
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,380
You okay?

108
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,740
- Nice job!
- I can't believe you did it!

109
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,020
- Okay, we have to do it again!
- Again?

110
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,980
Camera, camera!

111
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,100
So, Blue John,

112
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,620
is actually named after
this guy Blue John

113
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,140
who was Butch Cassidy's cook.

114
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,140
<i><font color="#80FFFF">From Butch Cassidy
and the Sundace Kid.</i></font>

115
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,740
And they would hide out
in these Canyons, I guess.

116
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,740
But also what they do
is they run wild horses into here

117
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,140
and they trap them
at the end of the Canyon.

118
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,620
That's how they caught the horses.

119
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,020
- One more picture before I go?
- Yeah!

120
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,020
Okay, cool.

121
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Ready?

122
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,260
One, two, three…

123
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,260
Blue John, blue cheese…
Well, will I ever see you again?

124
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,380
That depends. Do you party?

125
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,020
Do I party? Yeah, sometimes.

126
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,420
Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party
if you wanna come.

127
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,500
You should come by
and have a bear. Kick back.

128
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,900
Okay, where am I going?

129
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,380
It's about 20 miles away,
near Green River behind the old motel.

130
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,380
It's behind that. There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

131
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,620
Really? Okay.

132
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,980
- Cool!
- Okay!

133
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,620
It was good to met you.

134
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,900
- See ya!
- Bye!

135
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,300
Scooby-Doo!

136
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,740
Rock on!

137
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,020
You think he's gonna show up?

138
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,780
I don't think
we figured in his day at all.

139
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,740
You liked him!

140
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,020
This is insane!

141
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,500
Move this fucking rock!

142
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,460
Please.

143
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,500
Oh, God.

144
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,820
Kristi!

145
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,060
Megan!

146
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,460
Is there anyone?!

147
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
Think.

148
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Just think.

149
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,900
Fuck!

150
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,340
Shit!

151
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,060
Shit!

152
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Fucker!

153
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,260
Sweet!

154
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,900
Knife is dull.

155
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,580
Look at the size of this one, man.
How the fuck did this get here?

156
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
Okay.

157
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,900
Hey, buddy.

158
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Here we go.

159
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,940
It's 3:05,

160
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,260
on Sunday, April 26th,

161
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,580
2003.

162
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,380
This marks,

163
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,060
24 hours

164
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,860
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon.

165
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,140
Right where it slots up
before the Big Drop.

166
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,500
My name is Aron Ralston,

167
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,900
my parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado,

168
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,860
and…

169
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,540
Whoever find this
can keep the recorder.

170
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
Just…

171
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Please try and get in touch
with my parents and give them this tape.

172
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,660
I'd appreciate it.

173
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,940
I was descending Blue John,

174
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,940
yesterday, when this

175
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
chockstone

176
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,060
came loose and rolled onto my arm

177
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,060
and now it's stuck and…

178
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,300
my thumb has this kind
of this gray-blue color.

179
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,100
It's been without circulation
for 24 hours.

180
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
So…

181
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,140
I think it's pretty well gone.

182
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,220
I'm low on food.

183
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,180
That's about… 300-400 ml.

184
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,140
And that's it for water.

185
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,140
I'm in pretty deep doo here.

186
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,100
Please!

187
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,340
There's someone down here!

188
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,500
Help!

189
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,580
I'm in the Canyon!

190
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,380

195
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Aron,

196
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,220
do not loose it.

197
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Not bad.

198
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
Dinner.

00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,580
Mountain Dew?

204
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,020
Plastic cup.

205
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,780
Thank you.

206
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,580
Might take a beer as well.

207
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,220
Don't mind if I do?

219
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,660
Where are you going?

220
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,180
Don't know yet.

221
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,300
Right there, Brian.

222
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,380
Maybe you tell me
and I'll be somewhere else.

223
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,660
Have a good one.

224
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,860
Always do.

225
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,460
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Always do.</i></font>

226
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,260
Let's go.

227
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Crap.

228
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,540
This is freaking me out
looking at myself like that.

229
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,060
Sorry, I hope that's okay.

230
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,500
It's Monday.

231
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,060
Bummer, all day.

232
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,100
I tried to set up this pulley

233
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,820
all morning, but it didn't work.

234
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,100
It was worth a try

235
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,580
but there is too much friction
and it's…

236
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,340
a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

237
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,220
What I could really use is
about 20 meters of static rap rope,

238
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,620
9.8 mm.

239
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,020
3 or 4 pulleys,

240
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,500
A rack of carabiners, a sling,

241
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,060
power drill,

242
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,100
and a pull kit.

243
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,020
And 8 burly men
to do all the hawling.

244
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,620
That should just about do it.

245
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,220
I have…

246
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,420
150 ml of water left.

247
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,860
What should keep me alive till…

248
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,100
Tomorrow night.

249
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,580
If I'm lucky.

250
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,500
I peed twice.

251
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,540
I almost piss my pants.

252
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,740
My body is actually
acting really weird.

253
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,900
The second time,

254
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,900
I did it in the camelback.

255
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,460
It smells really bad.

256
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,260
But…

257
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,540
I'm sure it'll settle.

258
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,260
It's got to be chilled,
like Sauvignon Blanc.

259
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,260
No number twos.

260
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,340
Which should disappoint
my insect friends.

261
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,860
They'll just have to wait.

262
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,860
Let's, see.
What else could I tell you?

263
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,820
There is this raven

264
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,860
that comes every morning.

265
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,900
I clocked it at 8:17.

266
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,260
I'll film it for you tomorrow.

267
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,020
Every morning at

268
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,020
9:30.

269
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,900
I get fifteen minutes of sunlight.

270
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,580
Really nice.

271
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,380
I've been chipping away.

272
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,100
More to…

273
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,380
More to keep warm than anything.

274
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,540
And I'm beginning to think
that my hand

275
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,540
is supporting the rock.

276
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,340
So when I chip away a little bit,
it actually settles more.

277
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,100
So…

278
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,980
I found this great tourniquet.

279
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,700
It hurts.

280
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,820
It hasn't been very useful.

281
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,420
Listen.

282
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,860
Don't buy the cheap

283
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,700
made-in-China multi-tool.

284
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,300
I tried to find
my Swiss Army knife, but…

285
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,260
This thing came free
with a flashlight.

286
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,980
The flashlight
was a piece of shit too.

287
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,820
I kept it in my truck
for emergencies.

288
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,820
Not that I'm blaming you, mom.

289
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,940
It was a…

290
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,940
perfectly great stocking stuffer.

291
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:52,260
There is no way you could have known
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

292
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,940
So you have to leave the camera to us
if we want to watch what you've made.

293
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,980
- Yeah.
- Good job, hon.

294
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,940
So he's filming her now.

295
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,460
And we see it there, live.

296
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,820
Well done, okay.

297
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,380
Way to go, sis.

298
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,100

00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,740

301
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,460

combination?

305

If I told you,

306

I'd have to kill you.

307
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,100
You've already kill me.

308
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,020
Combination?

309
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,900
I think I have it.

310
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,380
Fuck.

311
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,220
Who's there?

312
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,100
Aron?

we have a very special guest,

self-proclaimed American super hero…

Aron Ralston!

Let's hear it for Aron!

Hi, oh, gosh, it's…

325
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,180
It's a real pleasure to be here,
thank you.

326
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Thank you.

327
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,460
Hey, can I say "hi"
to my mom and dad?

00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,980
Mom and dad?
Mustn't forget mom and dad, right Aron?

329
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,620
Yeah, that's right.

330
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,220
Hey mom. I'm really sorry I…

331
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,620
I didn't answered the phone
the other night…

332
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,420
If I had I would have told you
where I was going an then…

333
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,500
I probably
wouldn't be here right now.

334
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,180
That's for sure!

335
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,500
But like I always say:

336
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,780
"Your supreme selfishness

337
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,900
"is our gain."

338
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,500
Thank you Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say "hi" to ?

339
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,140
- Brian, at work.
- Hi, Aron.

340
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,140
I probably won't be making it
in to work today.

341
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,860
Get a load of this guy!
Oh, wait, hold on.

342
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,500
We've got a question coming in

343
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,340
from another Aron,

344
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,340
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

345
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,860
Aron asks:

346
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,020
Am I right in thinking

347
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,940
even if Brian from work

348
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,340
notifies the police,
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it

349
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,420
before they file
a missing persons report,

350
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,700
which means
you won't become officially missing

351
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,020
until midday Wednesday
at the earliest?

352
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,420
Yeah, you're right
on the money there, Aron.

353
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:20,380
Which means,
I'll probably be dead by then.

354
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,100
Aron, from Loser Canyon, Utah,
how do you know so much?

355
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,860
Well, I'll tell you
how I know so much.

356
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,860
I volunteer
for the rescue service.

357
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,100
You see, I'm some kind of a…

358
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,300
well, a big fucking heart hero.

359
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,980
And I can do

360
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,340
everything on my own, you see?

361
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,700
I do see!

362
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:45,940
Now…

363
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,580
Is it true

364
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,500
that despite,

365
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,300
or maybe because
you're a big fucking heart hero,

366
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,660
you didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

367
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,940
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

368
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,540
Anyone?

369
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,020
Anyone.

370
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,700
Mom, dad,

371
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,580
I just wanna take this time
to tell you that

372
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,620
the time we spent together
was awesome.

373
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,180
And I haven't appreciated you
in my heart as I know that I could.

374
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,020
Mom,

375
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,700
I love you.

376
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,580
And I wish that I had returned
all your calls, ever.

377
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,420
I love you, guys.

378
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,460
And I'll always be with you.

379

This is no Slurpee.

380
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,660
It's like a bag of piss.

I'm gonna go, Aron.

Is that what you want?

399

Okay.

My heart is beating really fast.

I swear to God, it feels like

it's beating like three times faster

Hey.

Dorks.

426

Found you, Aron.

427
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,260
Sis,

I'm sorry
that I won't be at your wedding.

429

I know that I promised to play.

430

That we play.

431

I'm sorry.

8:20.

436
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,060
I didn't tell you
my raven didn't come.

437
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,420
I've been thinking,

438

everything is…
