00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,582
MARKHAM: Carter Verone.

165
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,252
Born in Argentina,
but he's lived most of his life in Miami.

166
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,839
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

167
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,677
You see, unfortunately, the cartels have
been successful getting drugs into Miami.

168
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,221
But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

169
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,098
We've been surveilling him for a year.

170
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,850
But we've never been able to put him
and the money together.

171
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,603
- We've swept his house, his warehouses...
- Nothing.

172
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,023
Customs here has done a great job
of getting us this far.

173
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,150
I'm just here to help get them over the top.

174
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,653
I was able to get an agent in undercover,

175
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,947
working travel and logistics for him.

176
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,700
Recently Verone put her in charge
of finding some new drivers.

177
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,286
Right, although we can't confirm
her status right now.

178
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,124
- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

179
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:24,294
She's been in with Verone nearly a year.
Even lives at the compound with him now.

180
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:28,507
Look, it was the FBl's idea
to bring you in here. I'm against it.

181
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,678
But we need some good drivers that can
put this asshole and his money together.

You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn here.

And if I don't?

184
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,185
Here's a list of the laws you broke in L.A.

185
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,897
Obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting.
You know the rap sheet.

186

We can make this all go away
in the interest of justice

if you're willing to play ball.

188
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:57,619
So what's the idea here? Dunn and I
are supposed to be street racers?

189
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:58,996

00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:20,354
<i>Don't do that. Don't do that to me right now.</i>

477
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,148
<i>Come on, Ray. Do it.</i>

478
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,985
Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.

479
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:32,449
Basically, he's the man to know in Miami.
He's got his finger in absolutely everything.

480
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,827
<i>- It's just the way it is.
- Come home to daddy. Come on now.</i>

481
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,704
- What's going on, Suki?
- What's up, baby?

482
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,330
- How you doing?
- I'm good. How you doing?

483
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:40,124
What's this? What's the latest?

484
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:44,253
It's a work in progress. It's not finished yet.

485
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,964
That's some artistic shit.
You got talent, girl.

486
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:50,426
<i>Ray, it's do or die right now!
Bring it home, Ray! Bring it home, Ray!</i>

487
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,470
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

488
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,431
<i>Pay up! Pay up! Pay UP-'</i>

489
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:56,849
<i>Pay up, everybody.</i>

490
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,601
That's how they do it out here, man?

491
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,853
- Every day.
- That's crazy.

492
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:04,190
<i>Right here. Right now.
What's up, man? You don't look too happy.</i>

493
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:08,736
<i>Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
What's up? Thank you. Thank you.</i>

494
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:12,948
<i>How you feeling, man? You all right?
Thank you.</i>

495
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:16,118
Not too bad.

496
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:21,790
I see you're about your money, homey.
You race, too?

497
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,421
No, man. I hit a wall doing
like a buck 20 a couple years ago.

498
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:30,549
Ever since then, I've just been
organizing and collecting, man.

499
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,801
Hey, Tej, check it out.
He's gonna be in town for a while.

500
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,678
Is there any way he could use that cot?

501
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:38,599
- What's wrong with your place, man?
- No.

502
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:42,269
I don't want to stay with him.
He got bad habits.

503
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:47,733
All right, man, whatever. Show him around.
I'll be up there in a minute.

504
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,151
- Thanks.
- Sure.

505
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,988
<i>All right, who wants a chance
to win their money back?</i>

506
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:56,992
So, Jimmy? So, what's up,
you ever seen anything like this before?

507
00:42:57,284 --> 00:43:00,537
No. Both of them
are wired like I never seen before.

508
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:01,789
What?

509
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,791
Yeah, man, they got us wired with GPS.

510
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:06,919
That's why Markham knew
we were gonna be at that impound lot.

511
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,215
Yo, you the master mechanic.
Why don't you just yank that shit out?

512
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,759
I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.

513
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:17,846
The DIS box, the engine management
system, hell, the main harness,

514
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,848
the GPS is spidered into all of that.

515
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:21,475
Hey, tell me something, man.

516
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:23,978
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

517
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:26,021
Or where you've been
the past couple of days

518
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,023
or where the hell you got these rides from?

519
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:30,651
- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

520
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,820
They wired so hot that
whoever's tracking these things

521
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,239
would know every time
you don't wear your seat belt.

522
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,201
All right, Jimmy.

523
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,745
- Just do what you can do, bro.
- l got you.

524
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,205
Thanks, man.

525
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:45,958
Man, we need to get these
on the street ASAP.

526
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:48,711
Hey, bro, check it out.

527
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:51,714
See that Cadillac across the street
over there?

528
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,260
Yeah.

529
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:59,430
Yeah, well, they've been on us
ever since we left Verone's house.

530
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,938
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

531
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:11,150
Elian and Fidel!

532
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,738
Hey, man,
can I clean your windshield, buddy?

533
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,656
What are you doing, man?

534
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,575

00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,456

538

ROME: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

(CURSING IN SPANISH)

541
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:40,763
He's gonna blow our cover
before we even get started.

542
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,433
- Bilkins, tell me what went wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

543
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,560
Show me your hands.
Come on, keep them up!

544
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,812
- What's this about, man?
- What's going on?

545
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:52,232
Hold this. You think you can shoot at me?
I'm a goddamn federal agent.

546
00:44:52,316 --> 00:44:53,484
What are you talking about?

547
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:56,528
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me, dawg!

548
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:59,865
Just 'cause you wear a badge doesn't mean
you can mess shit up for us, homeboy!

549
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,575
Get your hands off me!

550
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,869
- You're lucky I didn't shoot you!
- Shut up!

551
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,621
Don't tell me to shut up, Brian!

552
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:08,165
- You almost blew our cover, old man!
- MARKHAM: I'm right here.

553
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,167
You shouldn't have shown up like you did.

554
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,294
You didn't know Verone was testing us?

555
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:14,463
- No, I thought you punks were running!
- Running?

556
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,840
That's great. That's real great!

557
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:20,761
And if Rome wanted to shoot you?
You wouldn't be here right now.

558
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:23,639
All right, we got to get this under control.

559
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:30,062
That's mine!

560
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:31,397
So?

561
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:35,984
- Tell me what you know.
- Rome and I will be making a run for Verone.

562
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,903
I'm not sure when or where,

563
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:41,407
but he did say that he bought us a window,
I'm assuming from the local cops.

564
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,992
I can talk to some of the guys
at the local P.D.

565
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:47,162
No. No good. If Verone's got some of them
on the payroll,

566
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:49,498
then we can't let them know our operation.

567
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:50,874
Exactly.

568
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,379
In addition, Verone told us that
he himself would be waiting at the drop.

569
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:57,256
That's good news.

570
00:45:57,673 --> 00:46:01,468
If you're gonna be delivering drug money
to him, then we can get him for laundering.

571
00:46:01,552 --> 00:46:03,929
- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

572
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:05,347
Fuentes.

573
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:07,850
- Verone's tapping her.
- Tapping her?

574
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:10,269
- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

575
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,729
Now what you talking about, homeboy?
We know what we seen.

576
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,859
So what do you think, O'Conner? You think
she's compromised? You should know.

577
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:20,737
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your old pal O'Conner didn't tell you?

578
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,865
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.

579
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:25,868
He gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

580
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,287
That's why he's not a cop any more.

581
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:32,332
So what do you think, expert?

582
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:35,043
Man, I don't know.

583
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,629
All right. We'll keep an eye on her.

584
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:40,883
We're out of here.

585
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,349
Let your man go?

586
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:51,643
Drop it. I don't wanna talk about it.

587
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:54,563
Drop it, hell.
I want to hear about this, homey.

588
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:56,732
I said, forget about it, cuz.

589
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,984
We got Fuentes in with Verone,

590
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,653
Markham trying to blow our cover,

591
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:05,824
and we got two wired cars that are no better
than that damn ankle bracelet of mine.

592
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:10,162
I'm gonna tell you, bruh, you let Markham
do that shit again in front of Verone,

593
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,580
that's gonna be our ass!

594
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,665
I know, man. I know.
It's just getting thick real quick.

595
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:16,877
We may need a way out, we got to come up
with some kind of an exit strategy.

596
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,879
- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

597
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,009
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

598
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,095
I don't know, man.
But we need two more cars.

599
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:35,896
Yeah. Here they come.

600
00:47:55,624 --> 00:47:58,877
Fonzie and Fabio. Glad you can join us.

601
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,631
We heard you boys wanted to get rid
of those Cracker Jack toys.

602
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:04,591
No, actually we just figured
those cars you got

603
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:07,761
deserve better drivers, which is why
we're gonna take them off your hands.

604
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,263
You know, why don't we settle this now?

605
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:12,140
Wait, wait, wait. How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

606
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:16,311
Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

607
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:18,063
Loser walks home.

608
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:20,774
- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

609
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:26,446
Come on, bro, let's get these cars.

610
00:48:28,282 --> 00:48:31,827
All right, check it out. There's no way
we're gonna beat these guys straight up.

611
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,329
That Hemi's putting out about 425

612
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:37,791
and that Yenko will snap
a speedo in about five seconds flat.

613
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,586
We're gonna have to pull something
out of our ass.

614
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:43,255
The only thing I can think of is save
the spray for the way back.

615
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,339
The return trip.

616
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,009
- Done deal.
- All right, let's do this, bro.

617
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,011
I'm getting that orange one.

618
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,679
(ROME LAUGHS)

619
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,056
You ain't ready, Fabio!

620
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:58,937
TEJ: All right.

621
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:02,524
You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road here.

622
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:06,445
Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line right here.

623
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:09,573
First team to go down and back twice
wins the race.

624
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:11,700

01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:06,099
What?

786
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:10,228
Got something you want to say?

787
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,689
It bit me. Jesus.

788
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,318
- WHITWORTH: I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

789
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:20,154
I'll do it. I'll give you your window.

790
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:22,907
Just get it off me.

791
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,367
Get it off!

792
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:28,204
You betray me,

793
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:30,832
and my rat here

794
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:34,127
is gonna visit your wife, Lynn,

795
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:37,296
your son, Clay, and your daughter, Lexi.

796
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,007
Do you hear me? Do you understand me?

797
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,926
- You hear me?
- Get it off.

798
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:45,012
I'll burn your fucking eyes out!
I'll burn them out.

799
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:50,476
Now, you can go.

800
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:54,147
- Get rid of him. Let's go.
- Get it off.

801
01:03:03,698 --> 01:03:05,533
You boys enjoy the show?

802
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,787
Fifteen minutes, and then every cop
in Florida's gonna be on you.

803
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:13,708
Be at Versailles Cafe at 6:00 a.m.
day after tomorrow, ready to drive

804
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,710
- You understand?
- Yeah.

805
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:17,795
Don't play games with me

806
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:20,798
or you'll be next. All right?

807
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:24,385
Help yourself to a little champagne.
Let's go.

808
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:29,348
That was a damn rat, man.

809
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:43,529
You ever touch another man again,
and I'll kill you.

810
01:03:43,738 --> 01:03:45,198
You hear me?

811
01:03:46,616 --> 01:03:48,659
Look at me. You hear me?

812
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,669
ROME: She was into it, man.
What's that about?

813
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:01,881
You seen the way she grabbed
the dude's head.

814
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:03,508
She had to, man. He was testing her.

815
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:06,552
You got to remember,
her ass is on the line, just like ours.

816
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:09,430
You're feeling this girl way too much.

817
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:13,267
She's like that crazy-ass trailer rat
from back in the day, Tanya.

818
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:16,437
Tanya? Man, you went out with her
after I did.

819
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,774
I mean, I couldn't let it go to waste.

820
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,734
JIMMY: I got you. I got you. I got you

821
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,319
Is that right?

822
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:26,280
We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas,

823
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:29,534
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

824
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:31,869
Tej, you about to lose your garage.

825
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:33,371
Whatever, man.

826
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:36,123
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

827
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:39,043
Pay me! Let's go, man.

828
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,003
Pay me my money. I told you, man.

829
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:44,549
I'm glad you're happy man. I'm so glad.
This is my garage, boy.

830
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,093
Royal flush. Give me this, man.

831
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:49,011
You got to talk to him, talk to him.

832
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:50,972
Damn, you can't play and play it for long.

833
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:53,849
Put that money back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

834
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:56,894
Jimmy, how are you gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej like that?

835
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:58,145
- How you doing, bro?
- Real good.

836
01:04:58,229 --> 01:05:00,940
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

837
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,874
What are you doing here?

838
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:22,837
Brian, they're gonna kill you.
I heard him telling Enrique and Roberto.

839
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,048
Once you finish the run,
they're putting a bullet in your head.

840
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:28,217
You sure you heard him right?

841
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:30,928
I'm sure. I'm sure.

842

843
01:05:37,143 --> 01:05:39,228
Verone's boys is outside...

844
01:05:39,729 --> 01:05:42,773
I see what they're looking for.
Your little girlfriend here.

845
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:51,449
- They don't know I'm here. I snuck out.
- What the hell are they doing here then?

846
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:53,534
I don't know. Maybe they're guessing.

847
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,454
Go stall them.
Go stall them for, like, two minutes.

848
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,789
Check her, homey. Check her.

849
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:05,630
Found what you're looking for?

850
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:13,054
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?

851
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:17,099
Y'all still mad about y'all car?

852
01:06:17,183 --> 01:06:20,061
Don't even trip, homey.
Come on, man, can't you take a joke?

853
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:24,065
All right, this isn't about being a good cop
any more or doing your job.

854
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:26,108
They're gonna kill you.
You guys gotta pull out.

855
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:28,444
Verone pay y'all
to keep a straight face like that?

856
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:32,573
'Cause if I was making money, shit,
I'd get that mole removed off my damn nose.

857
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:34,659
- Okay?
- Yeah.

858
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:36,911
How much he pay y'all anyway?

859
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:40,581
Every time I see y'all, man,
y'all got the silk shirts on,

860
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:43,000
jewelry, you know, looking real Miami.

861
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:47,922
I caught you walking up in the club,
you got the hamburger meat all hanging out.

862
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:52,426
Don't make that run, Brian.
Don't make that run.

863
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,679
Be careful.

You stay right here with us, buddy.

867
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:22,331
Don't even think about it.

It's over. Let's go.

It's our gun. Come on, let's go. Let's go.

are getting along so well

are gonna be riding along with you.

Just so we don't have any problems.

884

I'll see you guys in a bit.

885

What the hell was she doing in there, man?

Where'd you go this morning?

887
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,756
I went to breakfast with some friends.

888
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,971
With friends?

I'll see you later.

Nice shirt, Bilkins.

895
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:29,166
- It's my day off.
- Yeah.

896
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,711
Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

897
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:36,590
Last night, Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

898
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:40,177
We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

899
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:42,513
Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for good.

900
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:44,473
Wait a minute. How do you know this?

901
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:46,183
Monica.

902
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:49,311
She's doing her job. She warned us

903
01:09:49,395 --> 01:09:50,938
She warned you about what?

904
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,482
Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

905
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:56,819
Driving into an ambush was never
part of the deal. I'm calling this off.

906
01:09:56,902 --> 01:10:00,364
Like hell you are.
This is a Customs case, Bilkins.

907
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,616
No one's calling this off unless I do.

908
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,535
Look, this is real simple.

909
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:09,373
You make the run, you get Verone and his
cash together so I can move in for the bust.

910
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:12,710
You don't, I'll file enough charges
on both of you to make you disappear.

911
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:14,044
Take these.

912
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:17,631
We're gonna have GPS on you the
whole time so you don't get any cute ideas.

And to make sure
nothing happens to them, right?

914
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,468
Yeah, right.

915
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,104
ROME: That guy's a dick, man.

916
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,064
BRIAN: Yeah.

917
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:37,192
Let me get this right.

918
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:40,112
If we don't do this, then we go to jail.

919
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:43,407
But if we do it,
then Verone's going to kill us.

920
01:10:43,616 --> 01:10:46,702
- It's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

921
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:49,705
Maybe it is.

922
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:55,586
I know this guy's got an ass full of loot
that he's ready to dump in our cars.

923
01:10:55,961 --> 01:11:00,090
And I can think of two reasons why
Verone doesn't need that money any more.

924
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:01,550
Here we go.

925
01:11:01,634 --> 01:11:03,135
You and me.

926
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:04,929
Just like the old days.

927
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:06,388
What do you think?

928
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:09,350
I think they messed with
the wrong two guys, that's what I think.

929
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,605
- Yo, Tej, what's up, bro?
<i>- What</i> up?

930
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:16,398
Hey, man, how quickly can you organize?

931
01:11:16,482 --> 01:11:19,276
TEJ: Look, if y'all really want
to carry out this plan,

932
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,780
this is definitely the best place to do it.
So what do y'all think, man?

933
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:25,491
I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

934
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:32,790
Man, this thing is clean.

935
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:34,124
Distributor cap.

936
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:53,394
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

937
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,813
Sure, but I've already loaded you for spray.

938
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:58,440
No, I'm thinking we may need it
