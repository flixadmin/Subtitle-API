1
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:05,465
Feels like my shift started
100 years ago.

2
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:08,676
<i>Drink more coffee.
You're around it all day. Duh.</i>

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,304
<i>Besides, that place is so boring.</i>

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,517
<i>- Wait. What's that?</i>
- Um...

5
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,352
Yeah, just some guy cosplaying.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,853
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

7
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,648
I don't know. Must be some sort of
Comic-Con thing or something.

8
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,903
What in the world?

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,406
<i>Natalie? Natalie, what's that noise?</i>

10
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,120
<i>Natalie, what's that noise?</i>

11
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,793
<i>Natalie? Natalie?</i>

12
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,038
My beautiful boy.

13
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,824
I'm giving him all the strength I can
to heal him.

14
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,244
Which means I'll be weak
for a bit longer.

15
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,037
Because Psych
and Fuerza attacked you?

16
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,561
Exactly.

17
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,418
Do you remember what happened?

18
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,211
Only some of it.

19
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:30,258
When I was reborn,
I was surrounded by light and love.

20
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,136
Then came the pain.

21
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,056
I could feel these Forces of Nature
were like me. Only... evil.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,421
If they're like you,
then why are they trying to kill you?

23
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:40,560
I'm not sure,

24
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,770
but I think it's to feed.

25
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,524
That's why I had to find Barry Allen.

26
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:49,110
I thought he could keep me safe
until I fully recovered.

27
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,946
But if the other Forces find me
in this condition,

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,656
I wouldn't survive another attack.

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,782
Don't worry.

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,660
We are gonna figure out a way
to keep you safe.

31
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,286
Somehow.

32
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,042
Holy Henry T. Sampson...

33
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:09,505
Wow. So you're the actual,
all-encompassing,

34
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,591
immeasurably interstellar,

35
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,510
and mind-bendingly cosmerific...

36
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:18,806
Yes, Chester P. Runk.
I am the Speed Force.

37
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,977
Woo-hoo. Chessman...

38
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:26,481
How's that isotope detection system
coming along?

39
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,899
Yeah, actually...

40
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,568
- She knows my name.
- I think she does.

41
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,653
Okay.

42
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,031
Behold, believers...

43
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,742
This puppy I designed
can boost isotopic signals

44
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,160
for our satellites to scan.

45
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,621
Now all we need to do
is build a few units,

46
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,748
place them around the outskirts
of the city, and...

47
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,083
Eureka!

48
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,019
And then we would
get an early warning

49
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,753
if Psych or Fuerza
decided to come back.

50
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,340
And they can detect
foundational isotopic signatures.

51
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,217
So, we won't just know
they're coming...

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,095
We'll know, whoever it is,
Psych or Fuerza,

53
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,097
which one is headed our way.

54
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,765
Chester, that is amazing.

55
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,267
Could we use this
to follow the other Forces?

56
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,937
Perhaps find them
before they find us?

57
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,438
Not yet.

58
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,191
Right now they only work
in close proximity, so...

59
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,320
But at least now we have a way
to help protect you.

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,825
Cisco, how long would it take
to make enough amplifiers?

61
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,911
We have everything we need
in the S.T.A.R. Labs van.

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,374
So, we could build them as we go.

63
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,459
So let's do this, baby.

64
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,423
- 'Cause Team Chesco is on the case!
- 'Cause Team Chesco is on the case!

65
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,786
- Ah!
- Let's get it.

66
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,300
Separated at birth.

67
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:40,847
Hey.

68
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:42,682
What's all this?

69
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,184
Norvok finally brought the rest
of my stuff over

70
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,936
from one of Amunet's stash houses.

71
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,106
I was gonna throw everything away
but then muse struck.

72
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,194
Oh, wow. It's great.

73
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,947
Yeah, this'll really give the place
some attitude when I'm done.

74
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,116
I'm sorry.
You wanna hang that in here?

75
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,494
Yeah. That empty wall behind you,
it's been driving me crazy.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,205
Well, you know what they say...

77
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,834
Great minds...

78
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,710
What do you think?

79
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,803
Um... It's missing something.

80
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,773
Ah.

81
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,983
Much better.

82
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,489
You know, art should always provoke
a strong reaction.

83
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,824
It does.

84
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,415
And... sensor is ready.

85
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:50,624
Excellent.

86
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,377
Once the amplifier goes live,

87
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:57,215
then our early warning system
will be a go.

88
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,467
And that means it's time for...

89
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,150
Coffee and a cronut.

90
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,446
Coffee and a cronut...

91
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,097
Actually, you know,
there's a Sip-n-Dash in Masonville.

92
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,142
Or was, back in the day.

93
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,313
Oh, I used to live there,

94
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,315
but Grandma Runk and I moved
to Central City

95
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,733
when I was done with high school.

96
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,192
All right.

97
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,671
- Looks like we're ready to go.
- Okay, cool.

98
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,704
- What?
- Why?

99
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,123
Look at this.

100
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,752
What do you think?

101
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,839
You think it's the neutrino
filtration glitching on us?

102
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,966
Cisco, Cisco, Cisco...

103
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:43,802
What?

104
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,023
We're okay? We're okay.

105
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,024
What was that?

106
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,986
I have no idea.

107
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,659
Well, looks like
the sensor's working.

108
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,626
Did I give you my phone?

109
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,253
No.

110
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,755
Mine's gone, too.

111
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,300
Okay, hold up.

112
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,843
Where's the van?

113
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:27,554
It was just here.

114
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,442
Does the van have a secret cloaking
mode that I don't know about?

115
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,776
Asking for a friend.

116
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,570
That's no van.

117
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,578
Whoa.

118
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,580
Ches...

119
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,791
we've just been <i>Under-the-Domed.</i>

120
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,255
Nora?

121
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:04,842
You all right?

122
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:06,969
Yeah.

123
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,057
Just making sure
nothing happens to Barry.

124
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,728
How do you deal with all this?

125
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,190
Well, it's never easy
dealing with a threat.

126
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,433
Especially when it affects someone
that you care about.

127
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,446
But don't worry, okay?

128
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,114
By this time tomorrow,

129
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,492
Barry will be back
to his old self, healed,

130
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,994
wrapped up on the couch,
full BBB-style.

131
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,833
BBB. Barry's Blanket Burrito.

132
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:41,879
It's hard to explain.

133
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,965
No, I understand.

134
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,551
It's something
between the two of you.

135
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,559
Actually, you know what?

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,645
It doesn't have to be.

137
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,602
I wanna show you something.

138
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,483
Come with me.

139
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:08,863
We made it.

140
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,494
Now we can find a phone and call
S.T.A.R. Labs before...

141
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,915
Tell me you're seeing
what I'm seeing.

142
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,961
Does it have anything to do with
<i>Space Jam</i> being back in stock?

143
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,674
At that Blockbuster Video
that doesn't exist anymore?

144
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,510
Yeah. And get this.
I saw a Sip-n-Dash store back there

145
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,555
that got torn down
when I was in high school.

146
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,810
I think we just time-traveled.

147
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,187
Really?

148
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,276
So, tonight we're gonna party
like it's 1998?

149
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,749
None of the pay phones work.

150
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,250
We don't have cell phones.

151
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,169
And we're trapped
in an invisible barrier.

152
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,463
We are stuck...

153
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,132
in the '90s?

154
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,343
This is so epic! Epic!

155
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,681
Wait. No, no, no.
It is off the heezy-fo-sheezy.

156
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,941
Okay, Cheesy,
why don't you calm down?

157
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,983
Look. Is this frickin' awesome?

158
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,568
Yes.

159
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,571
Do we desperately need to figure out
a way to get back home?

160
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,989
Also yes.

161
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:37,036
Well, how are we supposed to do that
without a DeLorean hot tub?

162
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,497
By looking at what brought us here.

163
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,249
A green energy wave

164
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,878
that looks like it came straight out
of <i>Turtle 2.0, White Whale's Revenge.</i>

165
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,880
Coincidence? I think not.

166
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:51,926
Look, I know you and Turtle 2.0
kinda have this thing...

167
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,009
I'll say.

168
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,514
Maybe we're not dealing with
a meta at all.

169
00:09:57,223 --> 00:10:01,560
The amplifier showed
an isotopic surge when the wave hit.

170
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,604
So it's one of our Forces.

171
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,232
Wait. Check the signatures.
Was it Fuerza or Psych?

172
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:10,653
Neither. The sensor detected
a temporal energy.

173
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,072
So there's a new Force
in town, and...

174
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,949
And it can control time.

175
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,285
Yeah, okay, we got to get outta here
and warn the team.

176
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,704
- The Speed Force isn't safe.
- Not so fast.

177
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,415
We need to know exactly
who we're up against.

178
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,668
Remember how the Speed Force

179
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,837
asked if the amplifiers
could track the Forces?

180
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,838
Yeah.

181
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,507
If we added a transmitter diode
to the sensor...

182
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,093
It could localize
the isotopic circuits enough

183
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,679
to detect a new Force
within a 20-yard radius.

184
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,807
Right, but we need
the kind of maxed-out receiver

185
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,267
that just doesn't exist yet.

186
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,858
Time to go shopping.

187
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,780
Man, there's a Tech Station
right here.

188
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,952
Ches, hurry up. This is embarrassing.

189
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,833
See?

190
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,379
One man's trash is another man's...

191
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,464
Another man's reason
for a tetanus shot?

192
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,843
I already got my tetanus shot.

193
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,765
I can't believe you just used junk
to fix our sensor.

194
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,728
Just think of it as one
repurposed Force Finder.

195
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,274
Rest in peace, Ultrafax 4000.

196
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,068
Damn, they don't make 'em
like you anymore.

197
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,236
All right.

198
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,990
Let's find ourselves a time god.

199
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,911
The high school, huh?

200
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,705
The sensor seems to think
they're in here somewhere.

201
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,207
Let's do this.

202
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,167
Yo, yo, yo. For real?

203
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,587
Masonville's principal
suffers zero fools. Feel me?

204
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,673
All right,
then we just sneak in, simple.

205
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,426
We gotta blend in.

206
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,929
We got to kick it up a notch.

207
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,473
<i>This is how we do it</i>

208
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:03,598
Come on.

209
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,310
<i>This is how we do it</i>

210
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,853
<i>Check it out!</i>

211
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,104
<i>Once upon a time in '94</i>

212
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,357
<i>Montell made no money
And life sure was slow</i>

213
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,651
<i>There lived a DJ
And Paul was his name</i>

214
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,070
<i>He came up to Monty,
This is what he said</i>

215
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,364
<i>You and Oji are gonna make some cash</i>

216
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,866
<i>Sell a million records
And we're makin' the dash</i>

217
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,910
<i>I'm buzzin' because...</i>

218
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,912
<i>This is how we do it...</i>

219
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,581
All right. Here's the plan.

220
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,125
We ask people questions.

221
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,087
See if anybody has any
diabolical plans to alter the future.

222
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,506
- Yes.
- And then we check the sensor.

223
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,966
If it spikes...

224
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,842
Then we've found our time god.

225
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,926
Let's get it.

226
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:43,889
This for the yearbook?

227
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:48,602
Yeah. "Future
Falcon Forecast" section.

228
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,655
- Mm-hm.
- What's the question again?

229
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,942
Where do you see yourself
in 23 years?

230
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,276
Mm.

231
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,034
<i>Shorty's eyes be rollin'
When I start to flow</i>

232
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,578
<i>Fallen on the stage
But my boo's a no-show</i>

233
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,039
<i>My girl complains, my verses be weak</i>

234
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,749
<i>She shakes the 8-ball</i>

235
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,668
<i>"See? Outcome looks bleak"</i>

236
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,794
<i>Yeah</i>

237
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,212
Yeah.

238
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,381
Twenty-three... Yeah.

239
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,636
In 23 years, I'll be like everyone
else in this dumb high school.

240
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,056
A zombie. Totally dead.

241
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,974
<i>But I'm the bomb</i>

242
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,685
<i>I'm gonna kill in the future</i>

243
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,186
<i>Blowin' all them rap minds</i>

244
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,730
<i>You'll be needin' a suture</i>

245
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:36,900
Dead inside from slaving away
at a thankless job.

246
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,610
Oh...

247
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,654
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

248
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,132
- Jobs are bad.
- That'll be all.

249
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,530
- Uh...
- Yeah. Keep going.

250
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,494
- Keep spittin'.
- Yeah, you got it, boy.

251
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,372
<i>Blowin' all them rap minds
You'll be needin' a suture</i>

252
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,789
<i>Boom</i>

253
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,334
<i>And that's my Falcon Forecast</i>

254
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,544
<i>It's Reggie Q., I'm out the past</i>

255
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,879
Oh!

256
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,131
- Drop the mic.
- Yes.

257
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,383
- He's spittin'...
- Yes.

258
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,385
- No.
- No? Okay.

259
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,434
- Carry the two...
- No, you don't carry the two.

260
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,894
K-Dog. Check it out.

261
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,479
Parents got it for me.

262
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:17,232
Said they want the NFL
to be able to hit me up anytime.

263
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,693
- It's hella cool, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Nice, Deon.

264
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:20,937
Yeah, man.

265
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,108
You know, in the future,
I want to be just like Deon.

266
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,783
You know he's gonna kill it
in State Championship tomorrow.

267
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,077
Yo, K-swizzle, it's time to bounce.

268
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,583
Well...

269
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,460
That's not him.

270
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,392
Wait till those dumb jocks see what
the future has in store for them.

271
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,942
Yo. Parker, right?

272
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,611
Listen. Do you have
a couple minutes to spare

273
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,196
so we can ask you a few questions?

274
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,530
Who are you?

275
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,324
- We're students.
- Students.

276
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,827
- Just like you.
- Yeah, you guys talk like my dad.

277
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,873
Come on. Don't be whack.

278
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,127
- All right, we are 17.
- I'm 16.

279
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,378
We love <i>The Real World.</i>

280
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,548
We like Beanie Babies and <i>The Matrix.</i>

281
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,635
<i>The Matrix</i> hasn't come out yet.

282
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,554
Ah, shoot! See? I had a feeling...

283
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,997
Wait a second.

284
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,267
- How did you know that?
- This isn't right.

285
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,061
You gotta help me. Please.

286
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,980
We're trapped in the same day.

287
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,063
No, wait.

288
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,733
It knows I broke free.

289
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,195
It's gonna start over. Oh, God!

290
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,282
Oh, not again!

291
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,994
Okay.

292
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,455
That was freaky.

293
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,006
You all right, dude?

294
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:06,883
Who are you?

295
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,345
Where am I?

296
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,391
Did you take my headgear?

297
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,020
Dude, it's me. Chester.

298
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,771
No.

299
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,900
No. I don't know you.

300
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,776
Stranger danger!

301
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,945
Stranger danger.

302
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,198
Uh... Cisco?

303
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,158
How old are you?

304
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,328
I'm seven, you predator.

305
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,957
Because you still think it's 1998.

306
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,375
Oh, no, no.

307
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,592
- Cisco.
- Don't chase after me.

308
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,927
I don't wanna get in your van.

309
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,138
I'm not trying to hurt you.
Listen, just listen. Okay?

310
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,890
You're not seven.

311
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,853
You're 30. And you're a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs. Remember?

312
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,105
What about visiting Atlantis?

313
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,608
Or King Shark versus Grodd?

314
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,362
Oh, God. Please tell me you remember
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

315
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,615
- Littlefinger.
- Yes.

316
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,451
- The Iron Throne.
- Yes.

317
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:18,288
<i>- "The Rains of Castamere."
- "The Rains of Castamere." Yes!</i>

318
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,249
Chester.

319
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,376
How did we get here?

320
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,380
Last thing I remember,
Parker was going all <i>Get Out</i> on us.

321
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,507
No, no. Parker's not our Biff Tannen.

322
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,134
A modern reference jolted him awake,
just like you.

323
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,844
We're back on Main Street.

324
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,514
Right before the wave hit,

325
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,601
Parker said, "It's gonna start over."

326
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:54,615
Gotta go.

327
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,727
- It's a time loop.
- It's a time loop.

328
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,627
This isn't about changing the future,

329
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,421
it's about reliving one day
over and over.

330
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,509
When Parker woke up,
it reset the loop.

331
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,219
But why didn't you get whammied?

332
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,681
I think the sensor absorbed
the temporal energy

333
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,141
and shielded me.

334
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,644
I mean, by the looks of it,
that's not happening again.

335
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,146
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

336
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,523
We have to fix this.

337
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,735
Otherwise, if the loop resets,
we won't be shielded.

338
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,695
We won't remember
that we're stuck in the past,

339
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,214
and we'll be trapped here
like everyone else.

340
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,238
We have to fix this now.

341
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,801
Okay, you know, I think I have the
parts to fix this at Grandma Runk's.

342
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,201
Perfect. Let's go there right now.

343
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,846
And while we're on our way
maybe we can figure out

344
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,039
what's so special
about December 4th, '98.

345
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:43,998
Uh...

346
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,167
You know what?

347
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,254
These parts ain't at Grandma Runk's.

348
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,174
Someplace better.

349
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,009
Please don't go dumpster-diving.

350
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,786
This blanket is quite well-loved.

351
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,390
He's had it for years.

352
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,645
How does swaddling himself help?

353
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,105
Well, it's not about the blanket.

354
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:11,902
It's more like wrapping himself
in the memories and the comfort

355
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,862
associated with the blanket.

356
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,078
It's like being hugged
by warm, loving arms.

357
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:23,955
His mother made it for him.

358
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:29,002
He doesn't really
talk about her much. So...

359
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,796
Not even with you?

360
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,636
They were so close.

361
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,347
Being reminded of what happened,

362
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,725
he's forced to think
about that night.

363
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,772
The violence of it all...

364
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,524
it stays with him.

365
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,860
And I wish that I could take
that away from him, but...

366
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,321
I can't.

367
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:15,549
TI-82. Girl, you still fine.

368
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,175
Stop flirting with the calculators.

369
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,969
- We got a problem.
- What?

370
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,763
The X-76 power converter,

371
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,599
they just sold the last one
to that guy.

372
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,984
Okay, chill.
It's not that big a deal.

373
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,694
He actually looks pretty reasonable.

374
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,612
I say we just offer to buy it back
from him.

375
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,698
No, no, no. We can't go after him.

376
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,075
Okay. Why not?

377
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,706
Ches, what's going on?

378
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,293
We can't go after him because...

379
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,670
he's my dad.

380
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,967
I'm the last person
he'd wanna help right now.

381
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,356
Ches, you wanna
tell me what's going on?

382
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:15,025
My pops was a very smart guy,

383
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,153
who traveled all the time,

384
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,739
trying to get rich
off his latest invention. So...

385
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,700
He never had time for me.

386
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,040
It was always, "Sorry, son.

387
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,209
I don't believe in quitting."

388
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,803
- Look, whatever happened...
- Tomorrow, my dad dies

389
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,641
in a car accident on his way
to some big meeting in Coast City.

390
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,562
Today's the last day I see him alive.

391
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,404
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,370
That's heavy for anyone.

393
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,748
Let alone a kid.

394
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,668
What if...

395
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,297
What if you're here for a reason?

396
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:26,805
This could be your chance
to talk to your dad.

397
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,474
What good would that do?

398
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,688
I can't save his life.
That would just reset the time loop.

399
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,820
No, I just got to stay firm.

400
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,278
Keep doing my thing.

401
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:53,789
I understand.

402
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,838
Don't worry about
the converter, all right?

403
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,048
I'll get it from him.

404
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,510
You're gonna go talk to my dad?

405
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,346
Just long enough to get the X-76.

406
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,600
Then I come back here,
we fix everything

407
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,728
and it all goes back to normal.

408
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,066
That is what you want, right?

409
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,915
Oh, thank God.

410
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,476
I thought you might go
somewhere Barry knows,

411
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,921
but you weren't at S.T.A.R. Labs
and C.C.P.D. seemed unlikely.

412
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,591
Yes, and I know how
he loves the coffee here.

413
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,013
I never took into account

414
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,218
how much his mother's death
might still weigh on him.

415
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:54,642
What have I done?

416
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,230
I'll change my appearance.

417
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,150
Appear in my true form to all of you
from now on,

418
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:06,112
as lightning, because
I can't keep hurting him like this.

419
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,240
You're not causing him pain.
You're giving him a gift.

420
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,784
How?

421
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,873
It's like how his blanket
reminds him of his mom.

422
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,626
And that memory gives him comfort
and peace.

423
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:20,869
It's the same thing with you.

424
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,588
So I'm not a painful reminder?

425
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,883
No, not at all. You are a happy one.

426
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:33,473
I may be his lightning rod,
but you are his lightning.

427
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,183
Thank you.

428
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:43,207
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

429
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,084
Can I help you, kid?

430
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,338
Me? Yeah.

431
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,925
I'd like to buy your X-76 converter.

432
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,223
What makes you think
I have one, Mister...

433
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,853
Boyega, John Boyega.

434
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,858
The clerk at the tech shop
said that you bought the last one

435
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,486
and they don't get another shipment
for a week. So...

436
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,493
Look, I'd like to help you,

437
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,372
but I need this X-76
power converter, too.

438
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:44,252
You need it for some
important invention, right?

439
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,922
Nope. Throwing it away.

440
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,051
Uh...

441
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,387
My son, Chester,
is working on a project.

442
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,055
I've looked at his plans.

443
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,558
Two days from now,
he's gonna need that part,

444
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,248
but I'll be back on the road by then.

445
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,638
I'm throwing it away now
so that he can find it later...

446
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,443
when he needs it.

447
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,363
Do you have kids, Mr. Boyega?

448
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,428
If you do some day,
you'll understand.

449
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,204
Wait. So why not just give it to him?

450
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,096
It's my way of teaching him to be
resourceful and a problem solver.

451
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,379
- It's kind of brilliant.
- I know.

452
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,382
Plus, he gets the joy
of learning to see treasure...

453
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,177
where other people see trash.

454
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,350
Do you do this kind of thing
a lot for him?

455
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,102
Everything I do is for him.

456
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,358
He's the reason
I get out of bed in the morning.

457
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,950
But don't you ever resent
having to work so hard, 24/7?

458
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,077
I'm the boy's father.

459
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,792
Chester is worth any sacrifice
I have to make.

460
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:10,921
Besides...

461
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,133
when it comes to him...

462
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,589
I don't believe in quitting.

463
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,350
So...

464
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,563
You don't care about your work
more than your son.

465
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,423
You care about your work because...

466
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,570
I'm just a man
trying to do the right thing.

467
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,488
Make my son proud.

468
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,208
Yeah, this is weird.

469
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,919
Sorry. Uh...

470
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,339
It was pretty inspiring.

471
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,760
And I hope I can be
a great dad too someday.

472
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,347
Something tells me you will be.

473
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,868
Still not selling you
that part, though.

474
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,691
But if you really need one,
I think I have an idea.

475
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,072
Hold that.

476
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,127
<i>Cisco,
my pops is pretty cool, man.</i>

477
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,748
<i>Yeah. Sounds like it.</i>

478
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,425
I'm just really glad
we had a day to hang out.

479
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,752
I didn't even realize that my pops
isn't just smart.

480
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:39,010
Dude's a genius. Check it.

481
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,016
Pops and I built it, together.

482
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,314
Wow.

483
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,150
You know what this means?

484
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:57,737
Now we can disrupt
the temporal isotopes...

485
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,489
- ...and go home.
- ...and go home.

486
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,991
- Yes!
- Yo, nerds, been looking for you.

487
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,995
Hey, yo, Deon.
We were just going to...

488
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,831
- Thinking of going to Blockbuster.
- Blockbuster.

489
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,542
- You ever seen <i>Space Jam?</i>
- Four times, man.

490
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,835
Oh, man. It's so good.

491
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,999
Now it's time to kick you wannabe
Urkels to the curb.

492
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:16,913
Because whoever you two are...

493
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,218
you don't belong here.

494
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,096
This is my time...

495
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,557
and you two got to go.

496
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,730
Time god.

497
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,699
Thanks for ruining
my perfect day. Not.

498
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:44,659
Yo, Deon.

499
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,453
Why bum around 1998?

500
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,497
Man, I thought you left
the small town life

501
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,082
for college and the NFL...

502
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,209
That wasn't me!

503
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,011
<i>You will have 30 minutes
to create an amuse-bouche...</i>

504
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,350
<i>Another woman</i>

505
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,604
Oh, crap.

506
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,900
Caity, I think we got a problem.

507
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,781
What do you mean?

508
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,201
Grandma Runk said
that after you won State...

509
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,747
It was the second string quarterback
that led the team to victory.

510
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,540
Not me, dumbass.

511
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,793
I got injured and taken out
in the first quarter.

512
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,046
He got all the victory.

513
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Me,

514
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:45,136
I got four pins in my knee
and a job selling used cars.

515
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:51,976
I came back to the past
because I have no future!

516
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:53,477
That's weird...

517
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,356
because your future looks
bright to me!

518
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,535
You dweebs really think
you can stop me?

519
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:11,788
You trippin'.

520
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,794
- Oh, not good.
- Oh, snap.

521
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,088
I just erased it from time.

522
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:21,463
My bad.

523
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:38,689
Could somebody please tell me
what this green energy

524
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,691
is doing to my city?

525
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,860
There are geothermic isotopes
all over the city,

526
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,588
which means
we know it's one of the Forces.

527
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,252
We're just trying to figure out
which one.

528
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,698
This used to be a tablet.

529
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,000
So, it's not just me.

530
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,751
Baby girl.

531
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,755
You look incredible.

532
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,216
So do you, Dad.

533
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,217
Frost.

534
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,846
Caitlin.

535
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:11,805
Thanks for trying.

536
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,976
Nora, Iris told
you were here, but...

537
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,061
it's so good to see you.

538
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,497
It's good to see you too, Captain.

539
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,275
Scans show that
the isotopic foundation is unstable.

540
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,652
The green wave is spreading
and heading toward downtown.

541
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,945
<i>What's that noise?</i>

542
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:31,617
<i>Natalie. Natalie. Natalie.</i>

543
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:43,796
Oh, my God.

544
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,922
Oh, my God.

545
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,262
I was able to trace the energy
to a nearby town.

546
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,345
Masonville?

547
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,741
Cisco and Chester were installing
an early warning system by there.

548
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,477
Looks like something triggered
the amplifier sensor?

549
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,312
If I can access the data drive,

550
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,317
I might be able to figure out
what set this off.

551
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,150
"Temporal," as in time travel?

552
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:08,946
Yeah, but this energy doesn't match
Psych or Fuerza, which means...

553
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,824
Which means that we're dealing with
a new Force of Nature that can...

554
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,784
alter time.

555
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:18,455
Buckle up, fools,

556
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:22,793
because once I reset my time loop,
you'll forget everything.

557
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,849
We've got to get out here.
He's too powerful.

558
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,768
We can't fight him on our own.
Come on.

559
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:40,644
Ches?

560
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:46,853
I don't believe in quitting.

561
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,577
These isotopic signatures
are moving at speeds

562
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,072
that should be impossible.

563
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:55,159
This new Force is rewinding time
at random.

564
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,078
We can't stop it.

565
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:01,749
What happens if we get stuck
in one of these time pockets?

566
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,611
We could end up in the Stone Age.

567
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,755
Oh, my God. It's up to Cisco
and Chester now.

568
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,428
Hey, yo, Deon.

569
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:15,763
Listen to me.

570
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:18,182
You can make us forget our futures...

571
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,746
but there's no power in the world
that will make you forget yours.

572
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,063
Yeah, tell me about it!

573
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,400
Tried to rewrite that night
100 times.

574
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:31,070
No matter what I try to do,
I can't change what happens.

575
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,490
What happened to you
must be a fixed point.

576
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,659
You can't change it.

577
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:42,164
So maybe you should stop trying
and instead, choose to see

578
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,167
the possibilities in every new day.

579
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,104
Look, your future's
still not written, Deon.

580
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,796
I hate my future!

581
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,433
I'm supposed to be
the next Patrick Mahomes, man.

582
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,976
Look, I know it's easy...

583
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,563
to hold on to the bad stuff.

584
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:08,899
Ever since I was a kid,

585
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,183
I thought that my pops
cared more about his job than me.

586
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:12,277
Boo-hoo, man.

587
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,114
And I carried that hurt
around with me for years.

588
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:20,578
But today, when I looked
at my past with fresh eyes...

589
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,374
I saw that my dad worked hard
to give me a better life.

590
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,587
And once I saw that, it helped me
let go of that pain, Deon.

591
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,424
You can do the same...

592
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,345
but not until you stop letting
one moment in your past

593
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,388
define all the moments
in your future.

594
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,751
Future's on me?

595
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,463
Yeah.

596
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,813
So I get to figure out
what it looks like?

597
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,681
So I get to decide
what happens from now on?

598
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:24,642
Not just for me...

599
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,061
but for everyone.

600
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,362
Time to bounce.

601
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,902
Well, Barry, looks like
your vitals have stabilized.

602
00:36:58,926 --> 00:36:59,926
How you feeling?

603
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,679
I feel fine.

604
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,725
So, no luck finding Deon yet?

605
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,228
So far, satellites haven't found
any traces of his

606
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,393
temporal energy signature.

607
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,273
And he's a time god. So who knows

608
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,818
where or when he might be hiding?

609
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,904
Plus, I think Deon's only just now

610
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,449
starting to realize
the full scope of his powers.

611
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,283
But I don't get it.

612
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,495
Not once did he mention
chasing after you.

613
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,041
Well, unlike the others,
he might not know that I survived.

614
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,418
That makes sense.

615
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,881
You know, it's weird. Every time
you and Chester talk about Deon,

616
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,924
he sounds a lot more reasonable
than Psych,

617
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,260
and a lot less lethal than Fuerza.

618
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,471
Even so, being able to control time

619
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,681
makes him the most powerful
Force yet.

620
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,560
He could stop you in your tracks
anytime, anywhere. That's his power.

621
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,942
It's like he's the opposite
of the Speed Force.

622
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:56,025
He's the Still Force, which I guess

623
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:59,528
would make Fuerza the Strength Force.

624
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:04,700
And that would make Psych
the Sage Force.

625
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,581
If this new Force
is more powerful than me,

626
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,291
then how did you defeat him, Cisco?

627
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,086
I didn't defeat him.

628
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:17,378
Chester P. did.

629
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,590
I got lucky.

630
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,385
Yeah, I'm going to leave the going
<i>mano-a-mano</i> with Big Bads

631
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,887
to the Flash, you know.

632
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:31,185
Oh. That's Kamilla.
Supposed to meet up at Jitters.

633
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,519
Caitlin, you still in?

634
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,926
Absolutely. Let me grab my bag.

635
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,731
What about you, Ches? You still down?

636
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:38,150
No. I actually have an errand to run,

637
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,879
but bring a brother
back a Vibe-accino?

638
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,571
Duh.

639
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,032
Hey, you didn't get lucky.

640
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,993
All right? What you did out there...

641
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm proud of you.

642
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,873
Yeah.

643
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,960
I guess I'm just a man
trying to do the right thing.

644
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:58,796
Make my pops proud.

645
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,720
Caitlin, hurry up. I'm trying
to get this coffee and a cronut.

646
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:08,763
Iris...

647
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,932
thanks to you, I'm seeing things
a lot clearer now.

648
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:16,564
Well, I imagine you two are anxious
to get home,

649
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,061
so I'll see in the morning.

650
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,151
Wait. You're staying here tonight?

651
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,571
Well, I want to know right away

652
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,698
if the satellites
find the other Forces.

653
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,491
Yeah. No, I get that,

654
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,136
but we'll get an alert
if that happens.

655
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,789
Nora, we have clean sheets
in our guest room

656
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,124
and plenty of blankets.

657
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,168
Sounds cozy.

658
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,211
Yeah, it is.

659
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,716
You should stay with us tonight.
Right, Barry?

660
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,636
Um...

661
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:49,721
Sure.

662
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,101
Yeah, of course.

663
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,731
You have no idea how much
that would mean to me.

664
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,108
- Really.
- It's our pleasure.

665
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,360
- Thank you.
- Come on.

666
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,214
I got you, Pops.

667
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,218
I'mma finish what you started.

668
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,152
Okay.

669
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:58,582
Oh... No. No. No, no, no.

670
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,584
Is that damn time bubble back?

671
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,670
Oh, no. I just like the look.

672
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,672
So I decided to swing
by a thrift store.

673
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,590
Picked up these bad boys, too.

674
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,550
Listen, we need to talk.

675
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,971
Ugh. Nothing good ever starts
with "We need to talk."

676
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:16,100
This new state liaison
that's auditing C.C.P.D.,

677
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,223
her name's Kristen Kramer.

678
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:21,230
I just found out that she's here
to catch a dangerous fugitive

679
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,898
- meta-human.
- Hm.

680
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:24,817
She's here for Killer Frost.

681
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,279
That's not who I am anymore.

682
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:33,158
I know. I just got to find a way
to make her see that.

683
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,328
In the meantime, you need to lay low.

684
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,871
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

685
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,040
She's former Army
Intelligence, Frost.

686
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,710
I don't care if she's
Xena, Warrior Princess.

687
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:45,212
I am finally free
to live my own life,

688
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,673
and no one is going
to take that away from me.

689
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:51,552
So if this Kristen Kramer wants
to come after me,

690
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,513
then I say, "Bring it on."

691
00:41:54,537 --> 00:42:02,537
