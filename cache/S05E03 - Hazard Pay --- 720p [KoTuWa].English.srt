1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,430
- Hey, Darla. How you doing today?

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,430
- Hey, Dan.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,350
- I'm looking for something in a Markowski.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,350
- That'd be Dennis Markowski?

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,190
That's the one.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,630
Oh, and I've got my paralegal

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,630
with me today.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,070
Paralegal? Coming up in the world.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,720
You know it.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,070
Hey, Dennis.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,030
Have a seat.

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,150
You hear about Chow?

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,950
- Yeah, people say he skipped town.

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,950
- He's dead.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,470
It wasn't me.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,350
It wasn't a message.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,350
It wasn't payback.

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,430
It was a mistake made by a third party

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,430
who has since been dealt with.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,710
You got it?

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,390
- Yeah.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,390
- Second thing.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,630
The deal you had with Fring,

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,630
it's still in place.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,070
Okay.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,830
Don't "okay" me.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,870
You got something to say?

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,750
Mike, I'm keeping my mouth shut.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,550
The laundry

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,550
was right above the lab.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,790
There's no way I could say

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,790
I wasn't in on it.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,150
I'm looking at eight years minimum.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,190
But I'm doing my time

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,190
like I'm supposed to.

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,270
I'm no rat, and you know it.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,590
I mean, what else is there to say?

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,910
All due respect,

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,910
what are we talking about here?

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,310
The deal is the deal.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,110
How's the deal the deal?

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,510
The feds took away my hazard pay.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,720
My wife asks me where the mortgage

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,720
is coming from. I got nothing to tell her.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,430
I knew the risks. We all did.

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,190
But that wasn't the deal.

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,270
And I know for a fact

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,270
they got Holt and Perez yesterday.

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,110
Now, it's not gonna be me,

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,110
but absent the hazard pay...

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,550
- ...sooner or later, someone's gonna flip.

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,550
- No one's flipping.

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,230
Everyone gets their hazard pay,

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,230
including you.

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,550
I appreciate what you're saying and all,

56
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,550
but the man is dead.

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,950
Okay? The lab's a hole in the ground.

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,260
- I just don't see it.

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,260
- I've got something new.

60
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,430
It's just starting up.

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,430
It's gonna make you whole.

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,630
Something new?

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,630
With the feds looking at you?

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,830
- How?

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,830
- "How" is my business.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,070
Hanging tight's your business.

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,470
Your family's gonna be fine.

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,470
You will be made whole.

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,670
Now, you got my word.

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
You need more?

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,790
No, Mike. I'm good.

72
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,830
- Who's next?

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,830
- That's your choice.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,790
A.P.D.'s got Martinez across town.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,790
McGann's up in Sandoval.

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,630
The Sandia tribal cops

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,630
are holding him for the feds.

78
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,910
And Holt and Perez

79
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,910
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,470
You don't mean

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,470
to get to them all today?

82
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,270
Yeah, I do.

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,510
Hey, let's go! Open up!

84
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,630
Back here.

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,790
Oh, hi. How was your day?

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,430
Are you moving back in?

87
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,950
Yeah. I'll keep the condo for now.

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,670
Selling it in this market,

89
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,670
I'd get killed.

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,070
But, yeah, I'm home.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,790
It's time.

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,550
Do you really think

93
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,550
that's a good idea?

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,670
Yes.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,640
So you bring him here? Come on.

96
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
The three of us,

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
we're the three amigos.

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,270
All for one, one for all.

99
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
We don't need a fourth amigo.

100
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,950
Saul, Mike knows the business.

101
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,950
He knows distributors.

102
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,590
- Mike's okay.

103
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,590
- He's okay?

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,350
He said he was gonna

105
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,350
break my legs.

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,080
And don't tell me

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,080
he didn't mean it, okay?

108
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,960
Because he gave me

109
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,960
the dead mackerel eyes. He meant it.

110
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,510
Saul, Mike threatened me.

111
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,510
He threatened Jesse.

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,510
He probably threatened someone

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,510
before breakfast this morning.

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,710
It's what he does.

115
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,710
Come on. Grow a pair.

116
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,390
Let it be noted

117
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,390
that I do this under duress.

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,790
Duly noted.

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,630
All right. Let him in, Huell.

120
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,110
Mike, I'm extending you--

121
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,990
Now that we're all together,

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,990
here are the ground rules.

123
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,350
Division of labour.

124
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,350
I handle the business.

125
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,950
Making the stuff, that's your end.

126
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,390
I don't tell you how to mix

127
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,390
your chemicals and whatnot...

128
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,670
...and you do not tell me

129
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,670
how to take care of business.

130
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,670
Is that absolutely clear?

131
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,030
- Sure.

132
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,030
- All right. Let's take the tour.

133
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,470
Hey, you're okay with that?

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,510
Yes.

135
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,590
He handles the business,

136
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,590
and I handle him.

137
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,790
Clearly, we're talking

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,790
about renting, not buying.

139
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
You need an ongoing business,

140
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
someplace you can slide in...

141
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,350
...do your thing and remain anonymous.

142
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,350
I'm not gonna mince words.

143
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,710
This is your best bet.

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,190
Got machines running, forklifts,

145
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,190
people coming and going.

146
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
You're gonna stay

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
way under the radar.

148
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,670
And the owner's solid.

149
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,670
He can't wait to throw up a curtain wall...

150
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,790
...stack some boxes in front of it,

151
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,790
give you the space you need.

152
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,470
After that, he's got his business,

153
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,470
you've got yours...

154
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,470
...and never the twain shall meet.

155
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,750
It's outstanding. Am I right?

156
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,790
Machines like this,

157
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,790
gotta be plenty of power.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,220
What about the smell?

159
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,950
More good news.

160
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,190
I've been here when it's up and running.

161
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,190
This place stinks already.

162
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,470
- You'll blend right in.

163
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,470
- How many employees?

164
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,790
I knew you'd ask.

165
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,470
Sixteen illegals, all highly motivated

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,470
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

167
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,390
You'll want to vet them, I'm sure.

168
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,750
Yes, indeed.

169
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,910
So, what do you say, maestro?

170
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,750
Is it unanimous?

171
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,030
You know, I worked in a box factory

172
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,030
one summer in high school...

173
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,710
...and I haven't seen

174
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,710
one of these in years.

175
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,750
Trip down memory lane.

176
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,750
That's perfect.

177
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,270
You know what this is?

178
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,270
It's a corrugator.

179
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,320
It uses steam and salt to crimp

180
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,320
kraft paper for cardboard.

181
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,910
And it makes a hell of a racket doing it,

182
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,910
which is great. Right?

183
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,510
No.

184
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,830
Steam and salt.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,110
When this thing is running,

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,110
it's like a jungle in here.

187
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,030
Shit. It'll ruin the product.

188
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,070
You can't just pop down to Costco

189
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,070
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

190
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,190
What--? Fine. Fine. Moving on.

191
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,390
Spacious, isolated location,

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,390
no humidity...

193
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,710
...and you get all

194
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,710
the free tortillas you want.

195
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,550
That's the special feature of this place.

196
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,790
I don't know.

197
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,270
It'll make the tortillas smell like cat piss.

198
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,900
Somebody's bound to notice that.

199
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,310
All right. Well, there's gotta be

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,310
some kind of workaround, right?

201
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,990
It's a technical problem.

202
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,990
You guys are technical guys.

203
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,310
You know, be creative.

204
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,310
Put your heads together.

205
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,470
Anything food-related is gonna have

206
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,470
unannounced government inspections.

207
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,190
All I'm asking

208
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,190
is that you keep an open mind.

209
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,710
Danny's already set some space aside

210
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,710
behind the Skee-Ball games.

211
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,590
- No.

212
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,590
- Hell, no.

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,070
I know it's a long shot.

214
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,310
All I can say to recommend this...

215
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,470
...is we're talking about an owner here who

216
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,470
is, how should I put it, highly amenable.

217
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,590
Look, I get it. Just say no

218
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,590
and we'll go get dinner.

219
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,990
All right. So I'll start.

220
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,870
No way we're cooking in here.

221
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,870
No space, nowhere for the smell to go.

222
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,630
Look at that door. That thing rolls up

223
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,630
and we're open to the world.

224
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,350
I don't know if anybody noticed...

225
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,950
...but there's a cop shop

226
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,950
a quarter of a mile away.

227
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,870
The hammer comes down,

228
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,870
it's gonna be Custer's Last Stand.

229
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
- It's perfect.

230
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
- What?

231
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,750
How are we gonna fit a lab in here?

232
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,160
Who said here?

233
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,870
A house is infested.

234
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,990
Termites, cockroaches, whatever.

235
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,470
Homeowners hire

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,470
a pest control company.

237
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,710
Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.

238
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,830
The crew tents the house.

239
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,500
They bomb the place with poison.

240
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,550
The house stays like that for days.

241
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,030
No one looks twice

242
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,030
at a tented house.

243
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,550
Now, maybe there's a strange smell

244
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,550
coming out of it.

245
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,550
Does someone think to investigate? No.

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,030
Does anyone go inside? Hell, no.

247
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,910
And that's where we'll cook.

248
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,750
They tent, what,

249
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,750
three, four houses a week?

250
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,190
So we pick the one that's best for us.

251
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,430
Enough floor space, easy access.

252
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,150
Once the tent is up,

253
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,150
we go in, we cook a batch...

254
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,510
...we bomb the place and leave.

255
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,950
So we gotta move

256
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,950
in and out for every cook?

257
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,790
Set up a lab, cook,

258
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,790
and then take everything down?

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,110
It's challenging, but doable.

260
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,470
Tell me about these guys.

261
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,190
Mr. Ponytail on the sidewalk, that's Ira.

262
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,190
He's the owner. On the roof is Sandor.

263
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,270
The ladder's Fernando,

264
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,270
and down below, that's Todd.

265
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,150
The pest control operation is legit.

266
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,150
I mean, they're licensed, they're bonded.

267
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,630
They do as good a job

268
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,630
as anyone in town.

269
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,590
But they're also top-drawer

270
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,590
second-storey men.

271
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,790
- "Second-storey"?

272
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,790
- B and E artists.

273
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,910
They're burglars.

274
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,870
Yeah. I mean, hey, they play it smart.

275
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,430
They don't boost anything

276
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,430
while they're on the job.

277
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,870
They copy the keys,

278
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,870
locate the valuables and alarms...

279
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,310
...and they sell that information to other

280
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,310
crews. Or, after a decent interval...

281
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,070
- ...they'll lift the goods themselves.

282
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,070
- And you know them how?

283
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh, I've been pulling their chestnuts out

284
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,440
of the fire, legally speaking, for five years.

285
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,110
Ira and his guys are good. I mean,

286
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,110
they know how to keep their mouths shut.

287
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,430
And if you buy them,

288
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,430
they're gonna stay bought.

289
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,710
You can check into them yourself.

290
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,310
I will, if it comes to that.

291
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,270
So do we take a vote?

292
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,430
Why?

293
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,190
- We sound great.

294
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,190
- Rock on, man. Solid.

295
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,790
That Yamaha's got a real nice touch.

296
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,520
You like the sound? It's huge, huh?

297
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,670
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're looking

298
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,670
for something else today.

299
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,110
- You got any roadie cases?

300
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,110
- For sure. What size?

301
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,680
Biggest you got.

302
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,230
That'll fit through, like,

303
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,230
a regular-size doorway.

304
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,070
You got it. Follow me.

305
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,950
Top of the line.

306
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,710
Recessed hardware, foam lining,

307
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,710
quarter-inch laminated walls...

308
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,670
...3-inch casters.

309
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,030
Height is good, width is good.

310
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,030
How much weight will this hold?

311
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,990
It's rated for 900 pounds.

312
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,230
So unless your band plays lead bricks,

313
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,230
you should be okay.

314
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,470
We're gonna need....

315
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,630
Hey, man, I'm trying to do business

316
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,630
over here, bitch.

317
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,870
Sorry. He's, like, overly enthusiastic.

318
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,310
Anyway, I'm gonna need four of them.

319
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,110
Four? That gonna be layaway? Because

320
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,110
I need to see a bunch of IDs for that.

321
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,990
No, man, cash.

322
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,830
Okay. Hey, you know what?

323
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,150
I'll throw in stencilling.

324
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,150
What's your band called?

325
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,710
Damn, brother.

326
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,270
Not asking no questions, but it sure

327
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,270
looks like you're back in business.

328
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,940
No joke.

329
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,940
You way back in business, man.

330
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,630
Look at this.

331
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,670
Yeah.

332
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,030
You're stacking the benjies

333
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,030
till the rubber band pops.

334
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,460
Yeah, yeah.

335
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,200
All's we're saying is

336
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,200
we know you're major league now...

337
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,820
...but if there's ever anything else

338
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,820
you need from us....

339
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,430
Any way we can get in on this at all.

340
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,910
Little stuff, big stuff....

341
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,150
We would be all over it.

342
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,110
You know, maybe someday.

343
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,590
That's cool.

344
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,590
I guess we better hit it then.

345
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,710
Yeah. Keep on keeping on, brother.

346
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,150
Later.

347
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,750
Okay, it is the same job as always.

348
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,550
You go out, you inspect,

349
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,550
you deal with the customers, regular drill.

350
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,150
Everything's the same,

351
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,150
except for one important detail.

352
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,830
- No stealing.

353
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,830
- No stealing.

354
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,110
Not a toothpick, not the spare change

355
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,110
between the couch cushions...

356
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,470
...not the panties out of the hamper.

357
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,470
Nothing. And I mean nothing.

358
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,420
If you're out with your buddies and they

359
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,420
ask if you got a hot tip on a B and E...

360
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,110
...you tell them you got nada.

361
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,110
You're out of the game.

362
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,240
The bottom line is that these houses

363
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,240
are out of bounds, now and forever.

364
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,990
Got it?

365
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,560
All right.

366
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,470
From time to time,

367
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,470
you're gonna see these two.

368
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,030
Now, as far as you're concerned,

369
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,030
they are ghosts.

370
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,150
You don't see them.

371
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,150
You don't hear them.

372
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,710
You don't say "good morning."

373
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,230
You don't speak

374
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,230
unless you're spoken to.

375
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,470
On the other hand,

376
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,470
if they tell you to jump...

377
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,950
...you don't ask what for,

378
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,950
you jump.

379
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,630
Now, you need a name for them?

380
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,510
You call them "Yes, sir" and "No, sir."

381
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,300
You got any problems,

382
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,300
you come to me.

383
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,790
Here's the deal.

384
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,790
The finishing tank's a tight fit.

385
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,270
- And with this motor you've got on top....

386
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,270
- The agitation motor.

387
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,190
The agitation motor here on top,

388
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,190
the tank's not gonna fit in the box.

389
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,470
It's just.... It's just too tall.

390
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,100
You know, I thought we'd put

391
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,100
a collar on the tank...

392
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,750
...and carry the motor in separately,

393
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,750
alongside the condenser.

394
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,710
And on the day,

395
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,710
we just kind of twist it into place...

396
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,030
...you know, while we're setting up.

397
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,270
- Yeah.

398
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,270
- Yeah.

399
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,630
- That's good.

400
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,630
- Yeah.

401
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,280
That will work.

402
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,670
And Joe and his guys can

403
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,670
build it, right?

404
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,670
Yeah. You know, they're up for it.

405
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,300
Joe already bought a TIG welder

406
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,300
for the aluminium work.

407
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,680
And, you know, I figure if they can

408
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,680
pull off the magnet, they can handle this.

409
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,590
Now, listen, about the smell....

410
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,910
About keeping it out of people's drapes

411
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,910
and furniture and whatnot....

412
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,950
When I was down in Mexico...

413
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,630
...there was this big, big,

414
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,630
plastic hospital tent...

415
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,030
...they set up inside of the--

416
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,030
Oh, shit. Sorry.

417
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,750
Oh, hi. Sorry.

418
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,870
No, no, no. We were just wrapping up.

419
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,470
- This is my....

420
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,470
- Friend. Hi. Walt.

421
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,190
- Nice to meet you.

422
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,190
- You too.

423
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,950
This is Brock.

424
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,910
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.

425
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,910
I've heard a lot about you.

426
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,070
- Hi.

427
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,070
- Hi.

428
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,230
I understand you were in the hospital.

429
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,670
And Jesse told me

430
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,670
that you were very brave.

431
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,070
Yeah. A man of few words.

432
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,670
I'm sorry. He mostly just wants

433
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,670
to play his game.

434
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,240
Oh, I know that.

435
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,550
I have two of my own. A boy and a girl.

436
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,830
Well, I should go.

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,830
I was thinking I could make us

438
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,830
all some dinner.

439
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,710
Are you sure you don't wanna...?

440
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,630
Yeah. Why don't you stay

441
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,630
for a beer at least?

442
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,670
Sure. Why not? A beer sounds good.

443
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,270
Thank you.

444
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,590
- How are you today, sir?

445
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,590
- We're good. Good. How are you?

446
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,670
- Family all packed up, ready to go?

447
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,670
- Yeah.

448
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,320
Here you're acknowledging

449
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,320
that you've removed all pets...

450
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,310
...and plants from the house

451
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,310
and that food has been removed...

452
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,750
...or double-sealed in the bags

453
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,750
we provided.

454
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,110
This acknowledges you've removed or

455
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,110
bagged any medicine, tobacco, pet food.

456
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,670
Better make sure

457
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,670
you got any medicine you might need.

458
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,320
- It's already in the car.

459
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,320
- Okay.

460
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,670
Holy crap.

461
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,670
How much poison are you using?

462
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,550
It's not how much,

463
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,550
it's getting it where it's needed.

464
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,470
Those are your foggers.

465
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,830
They disperse the fumigate

466
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,830
into the structure...

467
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,310
...where it'll eliminate any nymphs

468
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,310
or larvae...

469
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,790
...as well as the full-grown blattodea.

470
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,830
So do we have all your keys?

471
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,030
Any extras on here

472
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,030
you might wind up needing?

473
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,870
- No, I'm good.

474
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,870
- Okay.

475
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,070
This last one here acknowledges

476
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,070
that you have been informed...

477
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,230
...that you may not

478
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,230
reenter the premises...

479
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,860
...until it has cleared

480
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,860
the post-fumigation inspection.

481
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,350
So you're gonna get them all, right?

482
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,550
We'll kill them dead.

483
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,550
That's a guarantee.

484
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,870
Sir? Sir?

485
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,150
Yes?

486
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,200
There's a nanny cam

487
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,200
in the living-room clock.

488
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,710
I disabled it.

489
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,710
I just thought you should know.

490
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,830
- What's your name?

491
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,830
- Todd, sir.

492
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,990
Cheers.

493
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,920
You know, I've gotta say...

494
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,230
...seeing you with Andrea

495
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,230
and that little boy....

496
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,750
It was nice.

497
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,550
- Yeah. It's good, right?

498
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,550
- Yeah.

499
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,870
- Yeah.

500
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,870
- Yeah.

501
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,310
And the way she looks at you....

502
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,950
- You think?

503
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,950
- Oh, definitely.

504
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,910
So is it moving

505
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,910
in any particular direction?

506
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,750
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.

507
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,750
You know, sometimes I think...

508
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,430
...you know...

509
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,030
...if it feels right, then....

510
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,950
If it feels right, it feels right.

511
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,710
Sometimes you just

512
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,710
gotta listen to your gut.

513
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,910
I mean, instant family.

514
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,430
What more can you ask, right?

515
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,350
Absolutely.

516
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,190
Cut the cards.

517
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,510
Have you thought about

518
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,510
what your plan is?

519
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,960
You know, vis-à-vis honesty?

520
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,190
You mean how much

521
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,190
she knows about this?

522
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,390
She doesn't know anything.

523
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,710
I mean, you know, she's not stupid.

524
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,710
She knows I'm into something, but....

525
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,310
She could make

526
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,310
a pretty good guess.

527
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,230
But I never told her anything.

528
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,630
I'm not gonna.

529
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,550
Okay.

530
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,030
I mean it.

531
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,670
I know you do.

532
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,030
Jesse, I can't pretend that this

533
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,030
doesn't affect me. It does.

534
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,870
But with everything that

535
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,870
we've been through, the two of us...

536
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,310
...this has to be your decision.

537
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,070
I mean, you've earned that.

538
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,830
Seriously?

539
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,190
Yeah.

540
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,390
Secrets create barriers

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,390
between people.

542
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,590
I'm speaking from experience,

543
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,590
believe me.

544
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,390
All that you've done...

545
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,270
...it's a part of you, and....

546
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,910
I mean, if you choose to spend

547
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,910
the rest of your life with this person...

548
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,190
...then you'll have to decide

549
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,190
how much you'll share with her.

550
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,590
Meaning what? Like everything?

551
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,910
Like Gale?

552
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,750
I'm just trying to say that I trust you...

553
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,230
...and I know you'll make the right call.

554
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,030
If she loves you...

555
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,470
...she'll understand.

556
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,310
They're leaving streaks.

557
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,230
This more ethnic-looking one,

558
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,230
he's doing a great job...

559
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,310
...but the other one is going back and forth

560
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,310
like he's scrubbing a wall.

561
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,150
They have to go in circles...

562
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,190
...or you're going to leave streaks.

563
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,790
That's pretty basic, right?

564
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,510
I don't mean to tell you your business.

565
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,910
It's just-- It's simple quality control.

566
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,950
So I've got some good news.

567
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,390
Guess what.

568
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,300
What?

569
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,510
No, really. I want you to guess.

570
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,790
- Marie, I really--

571
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,790
- Okay. Hank's back at work.

572
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,510
- That's wonderful.

573
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,510
- Yeah.

574
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,670
Sure, they love him now, but where

575
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,670
were they when he needed them?

576
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,750
Merkert and all the rest,

577
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,750
they laughed him out of the office...

578
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,350
...when he told them

579
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,350
about that chicken man.

580
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,510
As far as I'm concerned,

581
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,510
too little too late.

582
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,830
If it were me, I'd tell them all

583
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,830
to go to hell.

584
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,350
Do I sound bitter?

585
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,430
But it's what he wants, right?

586
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,310
Yeah, it's doing him good.

587
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,110
I mean, his PT is going gangbusters.

588
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,030
He's hardly using his cane at all.

589
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,990
And thank you for that, really.

590
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,180
I mean, God knows where he'd be

591
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,180
if we had to go through his health plan.

592
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,590
I'm just glad he's feeling better.

593
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,310
So, speaking of which,

594
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,310
we have another big event coming up.

595
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,630
Have you thought about

596
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,630
what you're gonna do?

597
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,030
Walt's birthday.

598
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,430
Whatever you need, I'm here.

599
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,630
Yeah. I....

600
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,990
I don't think we're gonna

601
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,990
do anything this year.

602
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,030
What are you talking about?

603
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,030
Of course we're gonna do something.

604
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,710
Skyler, he was diagnosed

605
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,710
around his birthday, right?

606
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,310
I....

607
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,350
So it's been a whole year.

608
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,470
Listen, I've had my problems

609
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,470
with Walt.

610
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,590
Why he wouldn't come to the house

611
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,590
when we were all practically--

612
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,350
Whatever. Water under the bridge.

613
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,030
But at this point, every year is precious.

614
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,030
We are--

615
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,680
What are you doing?

616
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,840
You don't smoke.

617
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,840
You haven't smoked since college.

618
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
You can't be serious!

619
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,190
With the baby and Walt?

620
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,630
You're not smoking around the baby,

621
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,630
are you? And you can't smoke here.

622
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,190
There's gotta be some rule

623
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,190
or regulation, I'm sure.

624
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,070
You can't force your employees

625
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,070
to breathe secondhand smoke.

626
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,320
- I know for a fact that that is illegal.

627
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,320
- Marie, shut up.

628
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,750
What? I'm sorry...

629
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,510
...please don't speak to me like that.

630
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,510
I am simply saying--

631
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,630
Will you shut up?

632
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,630
Shut the hell up.

633
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,390
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

634
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,510
- Shut up! Shut up!

635
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,510
- Please stop--

636
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,240
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

637
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,350
Shut up! Shut up!

638
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,510
Shut up!

639
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,550
That's 5.23.

640
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,990
Five-point-two-three.

641
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,510
Last one.

642
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,750
Five-point-two-six.

643
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,040
That comes to 49.27.

644
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,430
Good yield, right?

645
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,320
That is an excellent yield.

646
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,870
All right.

647
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,390
Hey, Marie.

648
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,830
How you doing?

649
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,870
- Where is Skyler?

650
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,870
- In the bedroom. She's resting.

651
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,510
Is everything okay?

652
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,460
- Breakdown? What does that mean?

653
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,460
- It means I don't know what else to call it.

654
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,030
But I've never seen her like that, ever.

655
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,510
Well, what did she say

656
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,510
when she was yelling?

657
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,900
Nothing.

658
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,950
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"

659
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,950
over and over again.

660
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,600
Did you know she's smoking?

661
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,550
Occasionally, maybe.

662
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,550
It's not a regular thing.

663
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,190
- I just wish I had gotten your message.

664
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,190
- Messages, Walt.

665
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,790
Plural. I probably called you five times.

666
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,550
I'm not leaving here until I know

667
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,550
what's got her so upset.

668
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,150
Are you gambling again?

669
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,150
Is that what this is?

670
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,180
Please, God,

671
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,180
tell me the cancer isn't back.

672
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,430
No.

673
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,310
- It's not the cancer.

674
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,310
- Well, something happened.

675
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,070
I don't mean to point the finger,

676
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,070
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

677
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,710
It's time to tell me the truth, Walt.

678
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,710
All of it.

679
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,510
I mean it.

680
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,630
You're right.

681
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,510
You heard about Ted Beneke?

682
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,110
The accident?

683
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,270
What accident?

684
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,510
A couple weeks back,

685
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,510
Ted took a fall, a bad one.

686
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,790
He gave himself a concussion...

687
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,350
...and fractured a couple vertebrae.

688
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,470
He's still in the hospital.

689
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,960
He may never walk again.

690
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,190
Oh, my God. I didn't know.

691
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,190
I'm so sorry to hear that.

692
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,580
Yeah.

693
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,590
But that couldn't explain Skyler's....

694
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,750
Yes. Yes, it could.

695
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,550
You do know, right? You....

696
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,790
You must know.

697
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,030
Oh, God.

698
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,750
She was having an affair.

699
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,230
With Ted Beneke.

700
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,860
Listen. It wasn't....

701
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,590
It wasn't ongoing or anything, and....

702
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,150
Skyler and I have been trying...

703
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,510
...to put things back together.

704
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,070
And then the accident happened,

705
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,070
and she got....

706
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,190
Marie, I'm begging you.

707
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,190
Please keep this to yourself.

708
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,870
I don't want Hank to think less of her.

709
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,870
Or me.

710
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,990
When did you...?

711
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,070
Was she--? I'm gonna go.

712
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,750
Okay. All right.

713
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,590
Thank you.

714
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,270
- I'm sorr--

715
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,270
- No.

716
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,590
That looked nasty.

717
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,390
Hey, you okay?

718
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,550
I'm good.

719
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,990
Really?

720
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,640
Yeah.

721
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,630
Come on. You wanna fuck with me?

722
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,630
Okay.

723
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,510
You little cockroaches.

724
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,110
Dad, wait.

725
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,390
You wanna play games?

726
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,390
Okay. I play with you. Come on.

727
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,910
- This is it.

728
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,910
- Wait. Wait for it.

729
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,590
- Ready?

730
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,590
- You wanna play rough? Okay!

731
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,190
- Say hello to my little friend!

732
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,190
- "Say hello to my little friend."

733
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,150
Nice. Just--

734
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,150
Hey, Mom, feeling better?

735
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,950
Hey. Hey, why don't you join us,

736
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,950
if you feel up to it?

737
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,760
We have popcorn.

738
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,760
I think there's some pizza left.

739
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,550
If you're up to it.

740
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,110
Yeah, Mom. Join us.

741
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,470
- Oh, my God. Look. Look.

742
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,470
- You whores!

743
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,550
Everyone dies in this movie,

744
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,550
don't they?

745
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,190
Okay.

746
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,070
For you and you and me.

747
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,270
Three hundred and sixty-seven thousand

748
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,270
dollars each.

749
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,510
Wait a minute.

750
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,510
After the dealers got their cut...

751
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,150
...we should be looking at 1,379,560.

752
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,870
Mike, you're short.

753
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,950
You're almost 300,000 short.

754
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,190
You're forgetting about the mules.

755
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,190
They get a flat 20 percent.

756
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,680
- The what?

757
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,680
- The drivers.

758
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,190
They're the ones that take the product

759
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,190
from us to the dealers.

760
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,150
And so transportation

761
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,150
is worth 20 percent?

762
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,270
They're taking a risk.

763
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,430
Two hundred and seventy-five thousand

764
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,430
dollars' worth of risk?

765
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,270
What did Gus pay his mules?

766
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,990
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

767
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,430
He didn't need them.

768
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,590
He spent 20 years

769
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,590
building his own distribution.

770
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,990
He had 16 refrigerator trucks

771
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,990
running his product.

772
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,350
And do you know

773
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,350
where they are now?

774
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,230
Government impound.

775
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,790
You don't like paying 20 percent?

776
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,790
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

777
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,830
Hey, hey. There's still over

778
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,830
a million bucks here, all right?

779
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,150
That's for one cook.

780
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,590
And since you're putting on

781
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,590
the green eyeshade...

782
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,990
...my supplier and I

783
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,990
came to an agreement.

784
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,270
The methylamine is free this time.

785
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,590
But brace yourself, because

786
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,590
the next barrel is gonna cost big.

787
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,150
Can we continue, or you got any more

788
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,150
burning questions?

789
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,720
Okay, kid.

790
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,440
You fronted us 120 to get us going.

791
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,190
So that's 40 from him and me.

792
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,270
One hundred and twenty.

793
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,270
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

794
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,510
Okay.

795
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,670
Now, Ira gets 110

796
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,670
for our piece of the business...

797
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,030
...and 25 per cook.

798
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,100
That is 45...

799
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,790
...from each of us.

800
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,830
Ira's guys get 10 each per cook.

801
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,790
Goodman's cut, 18,000 from each.

802
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,240
Legacy cost, $351,000.

803
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,270
That's 117,000 each.

804
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,990
"Legacy cost"?

805
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,750
I got nine guys.

806
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,110
You don't know them, but they were

807
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,110
part of the previous operation...

808
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,390
...and they know a lot.

809
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,390
And right now, some of them are in jail...

810
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,190
...and more will be soon.

811
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,190
The feds RICO-ed their hazard pay.

812
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,750
So we are gonna make them whole.

813
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,750
We are gonna make them whole?

814
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,550
What is this "we"?

815
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,110
These were Gus' employees,

816
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,110
not ours.

817
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,590
They might have been Gus' employees,

818
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,590
but they're my guys.

819
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,260
So, what are they doing

820
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,260
to further our interests?

821
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,550
The cops are looking at them

822
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,550
very closely.

823
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,070
We don't want them

824
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,070
furthering our interests.

825
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,750
So we are paying them, why?

826
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,030
Because it's what you do.

827
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,470
It's what you do.

828
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,830
My guys are keeping

829
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,830
their mouths shut.

830
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,510
We make them whole.

831
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,430
One hand washes the other.

832
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,430
It's as simple as that.

833
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,270
It sounds like a simple shakedown...

834
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,550
...simple as that.

835
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,710
We're paying for their silence.

836
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,710
That's blackmail.

837
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,590
Business is my end.

838
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,190
This is business. End of story.

839
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,190
This is your problem.

840
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,190
It should come out of your end.

841
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,110
Hey. Hey. Just take it out of mine.

842
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,350
All right? Go for it.

843
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,110
I don't care. Just take it.

844
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,310
No. Jesse, thank you...

845
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,670
...but no.

846
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,320
I'll pay my share.

847
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,870
Go ahead.

848
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,790
Let me tell you something.

849
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,470
This...

850
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,030
...is how it's gonna be

851
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,030
from here on out.

852
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,750
My guys are an ongoing expenditure...

853
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,190
...so you best get yourself

854
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,190
comfortable with it.

855
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,470
A hundred and thirty-seven thousand.

856
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,830
That's less than with Fring.

857
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,470
Listen, Walter.

858
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,470
Just because you shot Jesse James...

859
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,070
...don't make you Jesse James.

860
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,070
Tomorrow.

861
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,710
How are you feeling?

862
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,630
Okay, I guess.

863
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,470
Broke it off with Andrea.

864
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,830
I had to.

865
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,310
She's gonna tell Brock.

866
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,990
I'm still gonna take care

867
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,990
of the rent and stuff.

868
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,940
- It's the right thing to do, but, you know--

869
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,940
- I meant this.

870
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,310
How are you feeling

871
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,310
about the money?

872
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,510
You're looking at it wrong.

873
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,510
When we worked for Gus...

874
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,030
...we were cooking

875
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,030
200 pounds a week.

876
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,670
This last batch was great,

877
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,670
but we didn't even crack 50 pounds.

878
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,230
We maybe cleared less money,

879
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,230
but we got a bigger piece of the pie.

880
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,590
It's like you said, we're owners,

881
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,590
not employees.

882
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,350
I've been thinking about Victor.

883
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,670
Yeah?

884
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,880
Yeah.

885
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,110
All this time...

886
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,430
...I was sure that

887
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,430
Gus did what he did...

888
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,470
...to send me a message.

889
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,030
Maybe there's another reason.

890
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,510
Like what?

891
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,910
Victor trying to cook

892
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,910
that batch on his own?

893
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,310
Taking liberties

894
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,310
that weren't his to take?

895
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,550
Maybe he flew

896
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,550
too close to the sun...

897
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,230
...got his throat cut.
