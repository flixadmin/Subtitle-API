1
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:47,625
I wrote it all down:
4,200 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

2
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,416
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,041
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,583
-Is that the listing sheet?
-There isn't one.

5
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,416
I heard about it this morning.
It'll be gone soon.

6
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,583
-How many more?
-None. You know the market is tight.

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,625
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Evan!

9
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,833
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:20,458
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,833
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,791
I'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,500
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,458
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,083
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,000
-Thank you.
-Hello.

17
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:41,166
It's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,750
We call it a "townstone."

19
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:48,583
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

20
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,833
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,625
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:59,750
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,250
Sarah.

24
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,250
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,208
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,583
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:17,208
I don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,625
It's got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,250
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,291
It allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,458
Working elevator.

32
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,750
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,500
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,958
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:44,291
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,625
It's a very emotional property.

37
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,208
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,250
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,750
Can I see it first?

40
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,416
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,958
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,916
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,750
It's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,000
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

45
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,375
It's a fortune.

46
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,708
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,916
He can afford it.

48
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:31,083
It would be so lovely
if I could show the property before I leave.

49
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,708
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,250
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,333
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,166
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,875
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,333
I don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,208
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,000
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,583
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,750
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,583
May I ask what you do, Mrs....

60
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,458
Altman.

61
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,125
Actually, I'm going back to school.
Columbia.

62
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,250
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:25,083
I didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,958
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,416
Master bath.

66
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,958
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

67
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,625
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

68
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,750
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,000
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,958
I hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,375
Stop calling it "the property."
It sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,750
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,666
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,583
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,250
That's strange.

77
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,500
What?

78
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,083
Is this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,250
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,041
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,875
It's called a panic room.

82
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,750
-What?
-A safe room.

83
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,958
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-I've read about these.

84
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,291
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,000
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

86
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,458
This is perfect.

87
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,833
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,916
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,666
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? I think not.

90
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,833
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:13,666
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,958
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,250
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,666
Why?

95
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,583
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,916
No, but I loved her last album.

97
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,416
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,666
Steel.

99
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,375
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,041
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,750
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,750
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,958
Open it, please.

104
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,625
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,916
Please open the door.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,583
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,583
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,541
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,250
This is really dangerous.

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,750
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

111
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,250
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,958
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,208
It couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,750
I know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,041
MAYFLOWER MOVERS

116
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:55,544
It's working. I hooked up the phone!

117
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,585
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

118
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:00,419
579 what?

119
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,585
3000.

120
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,044
Patsy's Pizza. Please hold.

121
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:17,502
Hey. Enough.

122
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:27,252
Mind the pizza?

123
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,752
What do you mean?

124
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:33,210
Our first night.
I should've thought of something special.

125
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:34,752
I like pizza.

126
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,301
Fuck him.

127
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:55,842
Don't.

128
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:59,134
Fuck her, too.

129
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,954
I agree.

130
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:03,704
But don't.

131
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,663
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

132
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,579
You didn't carry anything up them.

133
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:31,163
You never asked
what I thought of this house.

134
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,371
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

135
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:36,788
-I liked our old house.
-Well, so did I.

136
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,246
You know what I was thinking?

137
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:43,109
I was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

138
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,067
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

139
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:48,067
Go ahead.

140
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,567
Oh, damn.

141
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,859
I forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

142
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,317
Dad already did it.
I'm going with him on Sunday.

143
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:03,817
Oh, yeah?

144
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,359
So I'll take a cab and meet him there.

145
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,526
Is that what he said?

146
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,442
Isn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

147
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,651
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

148
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,151
I'll ride with you.

149
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:21,484
Why'd you bring me here
if I can't go anywhere on my own?

150
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:23,151
That's it. I quit.

151
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:27,067
I'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

152
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,151
Come here.

153
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,776
It's disgusting how much I love you.

154
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,526
Tell me about it.

155
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:42,984
-Mom?
-Yeah.

156
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:45,526
It's too dark.

157
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:02,817
Better?

158
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:04,776
That's better.

159
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,567
"Bypass non-ready zone."

160
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,594
"Bypass non-ready zone."

161
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:46,386
"Shunt. Enter."

162
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:59,469
"Bypass non-ready zone."

163
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,136
"Shunt."

164
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:04,261
"Enter zone number."

165
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:07,719
"Shunt again."

166
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:16,927
In the morning I got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

167
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,469
Go, go back.

168
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:39,761
Do it.

169
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,302
SYSTEM ARMED - ZONE 19 DISABLED

170
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:18,344
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

171
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:20,094
Amateur.

172
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,136
ZONE 19 DISABLED - ZONE 1 DISABLED

173
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,219
We got a problem! We need to talk!

174
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:30,969
It's about time. I'm freezing
my tits off out there.

175
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,913
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

176
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,455
Who the fuck is Raoul?

177
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,413
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

178
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,871
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

179
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:46,580
Open the fucking door.

180
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:52,205
No shit.

181
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,246
What is this?

182
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,746
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

183
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:03,246
They're not supposed to be here.

184
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:06,580
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

185
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:08,621
Videotape. We're on videotape.

186
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:12,705
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

187
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:14,330
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

188
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:18,455
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

189
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,080
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

190
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:25,996
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

191
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,830
Five-day weeks always!

192
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:33,538
Right?

193
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:35,955
I'm out of here.

194
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,955
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

195
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:42,288
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

196
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,580
It's just a woman and a kid?

197
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:46,913
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

198
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:50,955
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

199
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:52,830
It's just her and the kid!

200
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:54,871
Now, can we do this?

201
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,080
Yeah, we can do it.

202
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:01,163
Not with people here. And not with me.

203
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,621
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

204
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:10,621
They'll be here before I unpack my bags.

205
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,746
So, we keep an eye on her.

206
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,496
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

207
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:21,580
I don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

208
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:26,614
Nobody gets hurt.

209
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:30,405
What about us? What if she has a gun?

210
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:34,739
Who are you?

211
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,447
I'm Raoul.

212
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,905
You know we can't do this without you!

213
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:55,822
This is still a good plan.

214
00:22:55,989 --> 00:23:00,155
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
It's just got a slight twist.

215
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,530
Yeah.

216
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,739
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

217
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:08,697
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

218
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:10,739
No family.

219
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:15,572
You're right. It's all fucked up.
I fucked it up!

220
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:17,739
It's not how it's supposed to be.

221
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:26,322
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

222
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,572
...and no one but you and I
even knows it's here.

223
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:34,739
Hey, I want that money. I want it!

224
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:36,447
But you...

225
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,905
...you need that money.

226
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,905
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

227
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:51,072
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

228
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,239
Kill the phones.

229
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,801
Top floor, little girl. I've got the mother.
Give me that!

230
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:46,551
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

231
00:26:57,467 --> 00:26:58,717
Wake up! Sarah!

232
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:01,467
Get up!

233
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:09,301
What did you do that for?

234
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:18,634
Where are you going?

235
00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:31,217
-What's going on?
-People. In the house.

236
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:36,134
They're in the elevator, heading down.

237
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:56,467
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

238
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,051
I told you. I don't hurt people.

239
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:03,426
They're going downstairs.

240
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,051
-That room.
-What?

241
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:08,676
The panic room.

242
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:11,342
No, press emergency stop.

243
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,009
Fuck!

244
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:22,009
Coming back up!

245
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:34,592
That's you.

246
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:38,967
Shit.

247
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:48,467
Go!

248
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,759
Fuck!

249
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:54,384
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

250
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:57,426
Damn it! Mother--

251
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,384
Shit!

252
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,676
That's seven years bad luck.

253
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:17,967
Shit.

254
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:34,592
Tell me they're not in there.

255
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:50,967
SYSTEM DISABLED

256
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:55,717
Oh, damn.

257
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:59,384
-It doesn't work?
-It's a different phone line.

258
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,342
I never hooked it up.

259
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,509
Now what?

260
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,926
I can't hear a thing.

261
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,634
What do you think they want?

262
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,592
I don't know. Rob us....

263
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,842
I don't know.

264
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,509
What do we do?

265
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:49,759
We wait.

266
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,676
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

267
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:56,551
They can't get in. It's not possible.

268
00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:58,259
Mom. I heard you.

269
00:31:02,134 --> 00:31:04,384
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

270
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:05,884
-You shaky?
-No.

271
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,467
-Chills?
-No.

272
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:13,217
Please. Don't worry about me.

273
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:33,434
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

274
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,350
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

275
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:37,693
Here he comes.

276
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:40,776
I locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

277
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,818
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

278
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,068
Could she have hooked it up today?

279
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:48,318
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

280
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:51,526
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

281
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:54,235
I checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

282
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:56,401
You see? She couldn't have.

283
00:31:57,151 --> 00:32:00,401
-I thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

284
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,776
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

285
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:06,485
ALL PAGE

286
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,250
Do it.

287
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,830
Excuse me.

288
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,160
The police are on their way.

289
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,910
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

290
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,120
It's not an intercom. It's a PA system.

291
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,910
I know. I'm just scaring her.

292
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,460
I suggest you leave before they get here.

293
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,120
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

294
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,660
How could he know that?

295
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,330
Take what you want and get out!

296
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,370
If only it were that easy.

297
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,710
Some paper. I need some paper.
Give me some paper.

298
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,870
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

299
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,500
You got a piece of paper?

300
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,330
-What is he doing?
-I don't know.

301
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,870
WHAT WE WANT

302
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,660
IS IN THAT ROOM

303
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,910
"What we want is in that room"?

304
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,160
They're coming in here, aren't they?

305
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,790
No, no. I told you. They can't get in here.

306
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,210
What do you know about this room?

307
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,040
What do we know about that room?

308
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,500
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

309
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,580
MORE Than You

310
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,960
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

311
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
Get out of my house!

312
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,370
-Say "fuck."
-You fuck.

313
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,330
-Mom.
-What?

314
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,330
"Get the fuck out of my house."

315
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
Get the fuck out of my house!

316
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,620
Okay, I have an idea.

317
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,540
She's a woman. Women need security.

318
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,580
She won't believe you.

319
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,620
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

320
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,750
WE WILL LET YOU GO

321
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,580
Conversation's over!

322
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,170
What? She's not coming down?

323
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,710
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

324
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,000
Like that'll help you think.

325
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,460
You know what? Fine! You think!

326
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,710
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

327
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,920
She said it again, that she called the cops.

328
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,500
If cops were coming,
do you think I'd still be here?

329
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,380
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

330
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,750
How do we get into that room?

331
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,130
What is funny about this?

332
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,880
Is this shit funny to you?

333
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,250
I spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

334
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,630
...to keep out people like us.

335
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,540
It's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

336
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,380
We can't.

337
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,000
You can't get in the panic room.

338
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,750
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

339
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,210
And why would she do that?

340
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,380
I don't know.

341
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,540
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

342
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,960
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

343
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,210
...and I don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

344
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,380
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

345
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,170
We make it impossible for them to leave.

346
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,710
And why would they come out
in the first place?

347
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,790
I'm working on that.

348
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,170
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

349
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,580
Small space?

350
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm okay.

351
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,460
-You can't wig out.
-I know.

352
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,290
-I mean it.
-I won't.

353
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,330
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

354
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,420
I guess it used to happen all the time.

355
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,750
Really?

356
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,500
Yeah, I read that.

357
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,880
And when did this happen all the time?

358
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,630
Twenty, thirty years ago.

359
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,630
What are they doing now?

360
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,670
I don't know.

361
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,790
They're locking us in.

362
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,000
This is not happening.

363
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,170
FIRE BLANKET

364
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,040
Sarah, calm down.

365
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,540
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

366
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,880
Sarah!

367
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,960
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

368
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,540
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

369
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,420
You won't even make a dent.

370
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,460
We'll see.

371
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,960
Hey. This is what I do.

372
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,130
If some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

373
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,380
...do you really think
that I would still have a job?

374
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,040
Don't get that in your eye.

375
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,580
Neighbor.

376
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,130
Help!

377
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,540
Please help us!

378
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,800
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

379
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,980
Help us!

380
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,010
Help!

381
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,180
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

382
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,390
Shit!

383
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,640
You guys just going to stand there?

384
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,440
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

385
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,850
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

386
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,520
Could you be any louder?

387
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,850
Give me a hand with those boxes.

388
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,520
Listen, goddamn it!

389
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,190
I'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

390
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,620
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

391
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,950
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

392
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,620
Oh, this is good.

393
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,740
This could work.

394
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,200
I was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

395
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,120
-Open it.
-I just did.

396
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,120
Open it some more.

397
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,200
We're just sending them a message.

398
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,950
They'll get the point.

399
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,620
Honey, get down on the ground.

400
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,580
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

401
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,790
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

402
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,490
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

403
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,040
What is it?

404
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,790
It's bad.

405
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,410
They're coughing.

406
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,990
If they're coughing, they're going to die!

407
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,740
Nobody is going to die, man!

408
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,160
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

409
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,620
Mom.

410
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,580
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

411
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,870
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

412
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,740
Cut it back a little.

413
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,830
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

414
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,990
We can't get in if they're dead!

415
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,580
Stay on the ground and breathe.

416
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,970
Turn it down.

417
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,220
Turn it down! It's too much!

418
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,840
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

419
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,280
I'm turning it down.

420
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,860
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

421
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,440
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

422
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,320
-No.
-Turn it down.

423
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,490
-Mom?
-Just a second.

424
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,240
Get under this.

425
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,650
FIRE BLANKET

426
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,070
Oh, my god.

427
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,990
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-It's my fucking idea.

428
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,490
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

429
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,320
What is that?

430
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,320
Turn the gas off.

431
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,320
Turn the gas off right now.

432
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,320
Get back!

433
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,110
Shit!

434
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,320
God!

435
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,780
Get it off me!

436
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,360
It's okay.

437
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:13,690
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
I'm coming in there!

438
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,940
Calm the fuck down.

439
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,030
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

440
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:35,070
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

441
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,380
I won't.

442
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,750
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

443
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,270
What?

444
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,370
Talk to him.

445
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:04,790
Please, man, give it a rest.

446
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,160
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

447
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,040
Where'd you learn that?

448
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,580
Titanic .

449
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,040
We got to talk. Downstairs.

450
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,490
No, no, no. Not you.

451
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,450
Come on, come on, come on.

452
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:46,080
Get up.

453
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,490
Come on.

454
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,990
Wake up.

455
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:08,330
The first thing I'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

456
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:13,450
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

457
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,660
I want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

458
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:22,790
Fine!

459
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:27,240
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

460
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:32,040
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

461
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,620
Got him.

462
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,120
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

463
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,700
I'm not losing
my half of the money because--

464
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,290
Slow down. Half?

465
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,830
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

466
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,990
Come on.

467
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,370
I'm letting you know he's a problem.

468
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,370
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

469
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,790
You're right. It wasn't your idea!

470
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,990
None of this was your idea!
It was my idea!

471
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,290
Come on, look over here.

472
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,950
Yes.

473
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,080
Yes, yes, yes.

474
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,990
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

475
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,990
-We're here!
-Help us!

476
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,910
We're over here!

477
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,620
Help!

478
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,910
Open your window!

479
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,290
Help!

480
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:28,160
We're never going to get out of here.

481
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,910
I'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

482
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,410
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

483
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,620
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

484
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,120
Are you done?

485
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,540
No. I'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

486
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,950
I'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and I convinced him to break into it!

487
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,410
Wait a minute.

488
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,790
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

489
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,740
Two of them, on the stairs.

490
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,080
Where's the third guy?

491
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,120
I left my cell phone by the bed.

492
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,160
I earned that money.

493
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,950
I will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

494
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,330
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

495
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,160
Got it?

496
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,660
If I don't come back, close this door.

497
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,580
Just do what I say.

498
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,790
He touches me again, I'll shoot him.

499
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,950
Christ!

500
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,620
Wait!

501
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,450
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

502
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,870
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

503
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,910
I'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

504
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,450
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

505
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,240
You live in Flatbush.

506
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,160
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

507
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,240
...because I saw that movie, too.

508
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:11,650
What is this?

509
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,490
I got some news for you.

510
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,150
Go.

511
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,820
Go!

512
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:10,570
Fuck!

513
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,280
She got something. What did she get?

514
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,400
No.

515
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,690
Charger!

516
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,570
She has a cell phone.

517
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,070
No!

518
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,360
All right, signal.

519
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,280
Come on. Signal.

520
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,240
I don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

521
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,990
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

522
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,440
No signal.

523
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:07,820
I didn't hook up this line,
but I hooked up the main line.

524
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,490
If we can find it, we can cut into it.

525
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,240
I can't go to prison, man.
I'm not built for that shit.

526
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:29,530
Be careful.

527
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,320
Get the phone.

528
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,650
-It doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

529
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,320
Screwdriver. Phillips.

530
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:10,070
Junior, when I asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

531
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,650
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

532
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:40,650
Shit!

533
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,740
Strip this and expose the wires.

534
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,030
-What are we doing?
-I have no idea.

535
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:18,780
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

536
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,110
Okay.

537
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,150
Yellow, yellow.

538
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,490
Okay.

539
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,110
Dial tone.

540
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,400
911 emergency.

541
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,320
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

542
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,650
-Please hold.
-No, no. God.

543
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,280
Call Dad.

544
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,150
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

545
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,650
-Hello?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

546
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,650
-Who is this?
-It's Meg.

547
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,110
Do you know what time it is?

548
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:26,820
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

549
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,740
Move.

550
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,190
-Hello?
-You've got to help us.

551
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,320
Move!

552
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:40,820
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

553
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,150
What--

554
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,240
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

555
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,860
He'll call the police.

556
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,150
You don't know her. She won't let him.

557
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,780
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

558
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,940
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

559
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,490
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

560
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,860
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

561
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,150
I'm sorry.

562
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,610
No, I'm sorry.

563
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,780
Why?

564
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:34,150
I was trying not to tell you.

565
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,360
What?

566
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:38,990
I'm dizzy and hungry.

567
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:45,490
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

568
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,400
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

569
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,490
Whose fault was that?

570
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,990
This is impossible.

571
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,900
What's the plan now, hot rod?

572
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,780
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

573
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,150
Here, drink this.

574
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,110
All right, drink lots of water.

575
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,650
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

576
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,280
Can you hear me okay?

577
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,150
I'm just dizzy, not deaf.

578
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,320
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

579
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,650
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

580
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,490
Let's check it again.

581
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,990
Mom, I did it.

582
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,190
We got to stay calm, okay?

583
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,490
If we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

584
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:29,150
You're making me nervous.

585
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,990
I'm sorry.

586
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,190
What if I keep dropping?

587
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:38,320
You won't. I'll figure something out.

588
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,530
You know, he's right.

589
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,740
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

590
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,400
What are you talking about?

591
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,650
I just got to be honest with myself here.

592
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,110
I don't need to be involved...

593
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,990
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

594
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,990
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

595
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:04,860
I don't need the fucking aggravation.
I'll make an anonymous phone call.

596
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:09,110
They'll find the floor safe. I'll inherit.

597
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,990
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

598
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:15,650
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

599
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,940
Fuck, I'll still put away 8 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

600
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,900
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

601
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,490
Wait a minute.

602
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,690
Say what you just said again.

603
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:38,400
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

604
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,990
When? Before?

605
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,610
Yeah, before.

606
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:48,360
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

607
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,440
What are you doing?

608
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:55,530
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

609
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,320
So now you're a tax attorney.

610
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,150
-I'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

611
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:09,860
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

612
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,570
Where else?

613
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,150
Travel kit.

614
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:18,990
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

615
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,650
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

616
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:24,990
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

617
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,110
...so now I don't know what to think.

618
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,110
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

619
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,110
How much is in there?

620
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,690
Mouthwash.

621
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:38,690
Saccharin.

622
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,150
Hey, I'm talking to you. Answer me.

623
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:45,990
Fine. There's more.

624
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,820
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

625
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,320
It doesn't matter now.
It's totally fucking moot!

626
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:56,320
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

627
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,820
How did you expect to get away with this?

628
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,030
Did you think that I'd open that safe...

629
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,490
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

630
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,280
What's the matter with you?

631
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,400
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

632
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:14,070
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

633
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,940
Your eyes were huge
when I told you about the gig...

634
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,490
...so don't play innocent.

635
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:21,030
Things didn't work out.

636
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:24,110
Play past it.

637
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:32,030
Mints? Sugar-free.

638
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,650
I'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

639
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,650
It's looking doubtful there, big guy.

640
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:41,570
I will split the money with Raoul.
But I don't ever want to see you again.

641
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:45,400
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

642
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,740
...and we will fucking find you.

643
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,610
I'll see you, Burnham.

644
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,110
Later, Raoul.

645
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,570
Mom!

646
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,650
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

647
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,940
...think you know all about it.

648
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,990
You don't know nothing about me.

649
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,030
Sarah, listen to me:

650
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,110
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

651
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,360
Okay.

652
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:38,320
You should see the look on your face.

653
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,990
What's happening?

654
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,610
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
-No, don't.

655
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,030
Come here.

656
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,490
Come here.

657
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,490
-Don't shoot, please.
-Come on.

658
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:54,990
Shut it, lock it
and get the fuck away from it.

659
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,690
-Stop it, you fucking--
-Fucking what?

660
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:07,360
Clown? Idiot? Fucking asshole?

661
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,650
Who's the clown now?

662
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,990
Me.

663
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,360
That's right.

664
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,650
It's burning me.

665
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,150
Who's got the gun?

666
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:18,940
You.

667
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:21,190
Remember that.

668
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,360
Find out who the fuck that is.

669
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,650
Give me your wallet.

670
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,400
Give me your wallet.

671
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,820
DRIVER LICENSE - ALTMAN, STEPHAN

672
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,860
Stephan Altman.

673
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,610
ALTMAN - KITCHEN

674
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:48,320
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

675
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,570
What did she say?

676
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:57,570
Don't know. Cut off.

677
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:00,400
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

678
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:05,740
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

679
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,320
No.

680
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,490
He's telling the truth.

681
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,860
Yeah.

682
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,650
Yeah, he probably is.

683
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,740
Because when I do this, people don't lie.

684
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,280
What?

685
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,650
-What do you want?
-Get us into that room.

686
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,240
-I can't.
-Yeah, you can.

687
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:30,190
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

688
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,360
You want me to just make something up?

689
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:34,610
You've got till the count of three.

690
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:37,150
Then you end up like Junior over there.

691
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,490
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

692
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,650
Two, squeeze.

693
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,360
I don't know what to tell you.

694
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,650
-Three.
-Wait!

695
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,490
Okay.

696
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:52,860
I got an idea.

697
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,650
Maybe.

698
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,240
Maybe.

699
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,650
Help! Rubber Soul. ..

700
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:08,360
...Yesterday and Today ,
Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album ....

701
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,780
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?

702
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:17,150
Let It Be, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper ....

703
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:18,850
Oh, god!

704
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:22,310
DRIVER LICENSE - ALTMAN, STEPHAN

705
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,060
Dad?

706
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,350
No, no.

707
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,270
Take it easy.

708
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,480
Open the door! Open the door!

709
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:48,350
No.

710
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,810
Don't open the door!

711
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,520
-Just make it look good.
-Don't you tell me what--

712
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,270
Open the door!

713
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,520
Don't open--

714
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,560
Knock it off!

715
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:19,770
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

716
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:30,850
Oh, god.

717
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:34,140
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

718
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:35,640
Lie down.

719
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,100
All right.

720
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,640
You'll be fine. Come on.

721
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,890
He's fucking crazy.

722
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,850
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

723
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:51,100
You're a strong girl.

724
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:54,600
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

725
01:13:57,190 --> 01:14:00,100
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!

726
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,190
It's almost over.

727
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:09,230
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

728
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,020
All right, turn around.

729
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,980
I'll be right back.

730
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,350
It's got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.

731
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,520
Get your tapes.

732
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,810
Who's this?

733
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,690
It's her kid.

734
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,640
What happened to her?

735
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:35,520
Who gives a fuck?

736
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:06,080
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

737
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:41,330
Hey, lady.

738
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,700
Mom?

739
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,340
What are you doing?

740
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:57,720
What are you doing?

741
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,220
We've got your kid.

742
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,180
Come down here.

743
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:24,010
Let's get this over with.

744
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,510
Get her, get her!

745
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,430
Shit!

746
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:56,090
What happened?

747
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,220
No! Let her out!

748
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,840
-Where's your gun?
-Open the door.

749
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,220
No!

750
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:08,260
-Where's your gun?
-I don't know.

751
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,970
Open up!

752
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,510
Open it.

753
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:21,220
Shut up! Listen to me.
She's got your gun.

754
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,890
She's got your gun!

755
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:28,010
Stop screaming. Stop it.

756
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,800
I know you've got the gun.

757
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,720
Put the gun down
and step away from the door.

758
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:58,640
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

759
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,760
She needs an injection.

760
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:03,180
Do you hear me?

761
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,840
Open the door so I can give her a shot.

762
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,430
Or I swear to God, I'll kill you both.

763
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,340
If I open the door, you'll shoot us.

764
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:16,680
So give her the shot yourself.

765
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,760
Give her the shot!

766
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,510
Do you need this?

767
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:39,340
Can you do this yourself?

768
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,050
What happens if you don't get it?

769
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,840
Coma.

770
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,470
Die.

771
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,590
Fuck! Open it.

772
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:06,970
Put the gun on the floor.
And go all the way downstairs.

773
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,590
And I'll give her the shot, all right?

774
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,470
I told you to leave the gun!

775
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,090
Shit.

776
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,400
You fucking bitch!

777
01:21:56,190 --> 01:22:00,940
If you pull any shit like that again,
I will fucking kill her.

778
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,690
Do you hear me?

779
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,250
If you step outside, I'll kill her!

780
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:13,420
If I see a uniform inside this house,
I'll cut her fucking throat!

781
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,460
Do you understand?

782
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,420
Yes.

783
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:29,250
But please, just give her the shot.

784
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:31,130
Please.

785
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,630
Please.

786
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,540
Don't fucking do it.

787
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,540
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

788
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,630
Are you going to open the safe?

789
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:51,960
Don't you look at me.

790
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:07,310
All I know about this is what I see on TV.

791
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,350
You got to talk me through this.

792
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,690
This right here?

793
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:20,980
It's this?

794
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:27,890
Yeah, okay.

795
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,940
Nice house you guys got.

796
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,190
Your mom's rich.

797
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:46,020
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

798
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,850
Tap it.

799
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:20,020
I wish I could have put my kid in
a place like this.

800
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,980
It's not that I didn't try.

801
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,810
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

802
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:31,730
Done.

803
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:35,480
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

804
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,350
He had it all worked out.

805
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,230
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

806
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:45,270
Thanks...

807
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,690
...Burnham.

808
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:55,440
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

809
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,600
She's going to be okay.

810
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,940
I gave her the shot. She's all right.

811
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,230
It'll be over soon.

812
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,440
Stephan.

813
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:32,640
Oh, my god.

814
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:37,390
Can you move?

815
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:41,950
Not much. I think my arm is broken.

816
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,540
Raise your arm.

817
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,910
Come on, raise your arm.

818
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:14,620
MAGNET ON/OFF

819
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,410
Try again.

820
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,220
Come on. Try again.

821
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,970
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

822
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,940
They're going to kill us.

823
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:41,820
Just do everything they ask.
It'll be okay that way.

824
01:26:41,911 --> 01:26:44,780
Stephan, they'll kill her.

825
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,390
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

826
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,930
The police.

827
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,300
You called the police?

828
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:07,220
Of course, I called them.

829
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,390
You scared the shit out of me.

830
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:11,050
She killed the kid.

831
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:14,260
She just killed her own kid.

832
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,800
All right, take this.

833
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:19,430
Don't say a word.

834
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,550
No, her husband must have called them.

835
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,470
Foreign son of a bitch. I told you!

836
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,390
Where is she?

837
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,720
There.

838
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,470
What the fuck's she doing?

839
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:58,800
She's going to handle it.

840
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,930
I'm just trying to unlock....

841
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,280
-Is everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

842
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,570
What are you.... What time is it?

843
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,940
It's a little after 4:00 a.m.

844
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,860
We got a call, ma'am.

845
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:26,490
Somebody called you?

846
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:29,490
Can we come in?

847
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,190
What do you want?

848
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,490
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

849
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,820
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

850
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:38,860
I'm fine.

851
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:42,070
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

852
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,940
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

853
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:58,150
Come on, I'm freezing out here.

854
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:02,360
"There are three."

855
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,820
What?

856
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:08,210
Your husband said you called for help.

857
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:12,250
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

858
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,460
Oh, that phone call.

859
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,920
And your neighbors...

860
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,750
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

861
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:29,590
That was the TV. It's off now.

862
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,500
Can I just ask you one question?

863
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:37,920
What was the end of that sentence?

864
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,040
When you said, "There are three"...

865
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,750
...what was the rest?

866
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:51,380
Look....

867
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,210
My husband and I just split up...

868
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,250
...and it's my first night in a new house...

869
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:04,840
...and I admit I was a little drunk.

870
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:09,590
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

871
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:12,290
...was going to be:

872
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:19,250
"There are three things that I'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me."

873
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:28,090
Thank God I came to my senses
before I said all that, and I hung up...

874
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:31,840
...so nobody would ever have to know
what I was thinking.

875
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,420
Unless, of course...

876
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:37,920
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

877
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,040
So, Rick, you want to go?

878
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:47,420
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

879
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:52,920
All right.

880
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:54,250
Ma'am...

881
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,460
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

882
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:05,250
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

883
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:10,710
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

884
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,210
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

885
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:17,590
Something like that.

886
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:24,750
That's something you could do safely.

887
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:35,460
Man...

888
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,950
...you guys are good.

889
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:44,370
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

890
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:48,930
They really train you guys.

891
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:55,390
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Cross my heart.

892
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:07,180
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

893
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:09,300
'Night, ma'am.

894
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,110
This kid has seen my face.

895
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:27,940
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

896
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:31,150
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

897
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:33,400
You're on the hook, too.

898
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,490
Do one. Same price for the rest.

899
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:43,240
Stay the fuck away from me.

900
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,240
You know how this is going to end.

901
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:05,450
Goddamn!

902
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:43,370
What's up?

903
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:58,950
Why the hell didn't we do that?

904
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:08,200
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

905
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:12,240
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

906
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,790
Just let me drill, man.

907
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,450
Empty?

908
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:04,950
Come on, man.

909
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,740
Bank bonds.

910
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:38,040
One second.

911
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,240
Two, three, four, five....

912
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,030
Why are we doing this?

913
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:48,650
Because it's going to come to that.

914
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,320
There are 22.

915
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,440
22 million dollars.

916
01:37:56,650 --> 01:37:59,280
That lying little shit!

917
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,440
Let's get out of here.

918
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,990
Lift.

919
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:21,070
Leave that. Christ, I'll buy you new tools.

920
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,280
You'll be okay.

921
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:05,960
It's glass. I got you. Come on.

922
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:50,040
Hurry up.

923
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:52,990
Watch the glass.

924
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,490
Get down here.

925
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,620
Wait.

926
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:03,870
Wait. You don't want to do that.

927
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:05,490
Dad, don't shoot him!

928
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:09,800
Let my daughter go.

929
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:12,260
We're finished. Your daughter's fine.

930
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:17,550
We'll go out the back door.
You'll never see us again.

931
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:21,720
Let her go.

932
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,050
Okay.

933
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,760
It's okay.

934
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,640
Let's go.

935
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:33,760
Let's go.

936
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:47,390
Just let her go. Let her go.

937
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:48,720
Let go of her!

938
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:50,550
Put that gun down.

939
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:53,390
-Sarah, come here.
-Put that gun down!

940
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:56,300
-Do as I say.
-Don't be crazy, man.

941
01:42:56,690 --> 01:42:58,860
-Just let her go.
-Let her go!

942
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:17,240
Are you okay?

943
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,150
-Did they hurt you?
-No.

944
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,320
-Did they touch you?
-No.

945
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:34,150
Stephan, shoot him. Shoot him!

946
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:34,990
Get off her!

947
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:17,740
You'll be okay now.

948
01:45:26,622 --> 01:45:28,650
-Police!
-Don't move!

949
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:31,220
-Nobody move!
-Everybody on the ground!

950
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,930
Team two, upstairs. Team three, down.

951
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:37,220
Are you okay?

952
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:42,220
Are you all right?

953
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:46,050
Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

954
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:49,180
Don't move! I will kill you!

955
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:51,050
Move away from the wall!

956
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:54,050
Get off the fence! Move!

957
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,010
Put your hands in the air!

958
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:00,340
It'll be okay. It's fine, Dad.

959
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:04,640
Is there anybody else in the house?

960
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,050
No.

961
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:12,220
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.

962
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:21,760
It's okay. I'm all right.

963
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,390
I want to see the palms of your hands!

964
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:31,800
Do you hear me? Open your hands!

965
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,390
Dad, it's okay. You're going to be fine.

966
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:49,680
Everything is going to be fine.

967
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,390
This sounds interesting.

968
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:24,930
"Two-bedroom with den or third bedroom...

969
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:28,910
"...new kitchen, original bath, 70s East."

970
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:32,030
I thought you liked the West Side.

971
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:35,690
"61st and Central Park West.

972
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:39,900

-"...conserg--"
-Concierge.

974
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:47,240
-What's that?
-It's French for "superintendent."

975
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:49,940
What's W.E.A. mean?

976
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:51,780
That's West End Avenue.

977
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:53,780
"81st and West End Avenue.

978
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:57,400

"...cathedral windows--"

980
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,780
Do we need all that space?

981
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,110
How about this?

982
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,320
"West 83rd, two-bedroom,

983

cheery, high ceilings and wood floors."

984
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:19,490
Yeah, that one.
I like the sound of that one.
