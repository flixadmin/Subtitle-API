keeping Riley on her toes.

We gotta get
our mouth guard, people.

Andersen goes to the box.

Two minutes for tripping.

00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,312
[Joy] Okay, looks like
we have a couple of minutes

50
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,189
while Riley takes a breather.

51

Riley is still exceptional.

[Riley] Ta-da!

54
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,695
Oh. Yum.

55
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,155
[Joy] And not just because
she's the top

-of her class...
-Riley Andersen.

Riley, Riley, over here!

59
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,786
[Joy] She's also really kind,

60
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,997
and she's nice to stray cats.

61

I mean, come on.

62
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, and she's officially

-a teenager now.

are still going strong.

Isn't it amazing?

80
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,412
But we realized her islands

81
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,915
aren't the only things
made by memories.

82

Way down, at the root level,

83

were also creating beliefs.

all of those

Thanks, Coach Roberts.

Look, it's last minute,

149
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,109
but every year,
I do a three-day skills camp.

in the area.

for you girls to come.

Dad, stop.

It's just hockey camp.

What if I get to camp
and I screw it up?

179
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,790
Hey, don't talk like that.

180

Yeah,
you did great today, honey.

Oh, Riley's so hard
on herself.

190
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,980
But we can make
everything easier.

This is for all those memories

that belong
in the Back of the Mind,

197
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,661
like this penalty one.

198
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,498
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

Thanks, I try.

205
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,514
Okay, let's do a sweep.

206
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,224
Oh, here's one
where she waved at a guy

207
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,518
who was actually waving
at a girl behind her.

208
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,728
Oh, that was so bad.
Good choice.

209
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,397
Oh, here's when she forgot
that girl's name.

210
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,524
Oh, yeah,
that was super awkward.

211
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,608
What was her name?

212
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,984
I don't know,
Janet or something?

213
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
Whatever. Let's just
get rid of it. Oh! [chuckles]

We keep the best
and toss the rest. [sighs]

Nice work, everyone.

216
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,618
All right, Anger,

217
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,161
the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

218

Oh, okay.
Let's get some shut-eye.

Joy, are you taking that

221
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,392

you're taking that?

-Yes.

I mean no. I...

Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

who hasn't been
to the Belief System.

227
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah, it's just that it's new,

228
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,946
and I know
how important it is.

229
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,032
And I don't wanna mess it up
or break it,

230
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,493
or burn it to the ground
or anything.

Sadness, you won't hurt it,
I promise.

Have I ever
steered you wrong before?

233
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,666
Yeah, many times.

I'm too gross to go to camp
or anywhere ever again!

328
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,818
Oh, yeah,
this is totally broken.

329
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,154
Well, we all knew
this day would come.

330
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,782
Remember, we agreed not to
make a big deal about this.

331
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,284
-But she really does stink.
-[all agree]

332
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,493
Oh, it's bad.

333
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,413
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

334
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,832
You are not gross, honey.

335
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,042
You're just changing.

336
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,627
Remember that
beautiful butterfly

337
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,337
we saw in the park last week?

338
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,797
[echoing] Well, that butterfly
began as a caterpillar.

339
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,132
[Joy] Easy...

340
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,049
[Mom] And just like
that caterpillar...

341
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,175
Easy...

342
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,510
...you're about to
get your wings.

343
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,345
-But if you have questions...
-Oh, my gosh, Mom!

344
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,223
Just go away! Ugh!

345
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,810
Well, that's a preview
of the next 10 years.

346
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,437
-Riley!
-Oh, my gosh!

347
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,563
-We're gonna have so much fun!
-[Dad] All right.

348
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,690
Who's ready for hockey camp?

349
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,983
[girls] Oh, yeah!

350
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,568
[Joy] Okay, until we can
figure this out,

351
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,279
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

352
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,658
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

353
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,452
Well, we could finally
clean out the garage.

354
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,287
Or, actually,
we can get upstairs...

355
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,456
How great
is next year gonna be?

356
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,168
Coach Roberts' team has been
state champs like every year.

357
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,630
And Val Ortiz
is the captain now.

358
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,758
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

359
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,427
Uh, she made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

360
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,262
That's really hard.

361
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,473
All we have to do
is be super awesome at camp,

362
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:37,102
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

363
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,771
-Wait, what was that?
-What was what?

364
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,814
We got a look.
I don't like this.

365
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,149
What? You're paranoid.

366
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,359
I never miss a look.

367
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,364
[Disgust] Enhance 224... 176.

368
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,407
Track right. Zoom in.

369
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,660
Right there!

370
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,787
-So?
-She's hiding something.

371
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,080
But what?

372
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,875
What is she doing?

373
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,210
She's looking at our look!

374
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,963
No, it's much more than that.

375
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,716
She looks the same to me.

376
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,218
Overlay and compare.

377
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,972
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

378
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,682
-[all gasp, exclaim]
-Oh, It's so obvious!

379
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,517
But what does it mean?

380
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,602
She knows
we're hiding something.

381
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,730
What is happening right now?

382
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,815
I don't know! I don't know!

383
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,025
-I can't take this anymore!
-Ah!

384
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,944
You spilled the tea!

385
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,779
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be
our coach next year.

386
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,863
Grace!

387
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,948
[whimpers]

388
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,077
We... We got assigned to
a different high school.

389
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,161
A-ha! Oh...

390
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,414
Oh, no.

391
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,623
Oh...

392
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,874
Okay. Um...

393
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,668
Yeah. No big deal.

394
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,795
-This is a huge deal!
-Our life is over!

395
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,046
Is she serious right now?

396
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,464
How long have they known this?

397
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,716
-[Fear] I can't breathe.
-We can't go to high school

398
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,676
-without Bree and Grace.
-We won't know anybody.

399
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,052
We'll still get to hang out.

400
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,762
And we'll have this weekend,

401
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,514
which means
we'll get one last time

402
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,807
playing on the same team.

403
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,684
Friends are forever, right?

404
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,687
Yeah. Of course.

405
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,771
[both] Whoo!

406
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,273
I can't wait
to get to the rink.

407
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,399
When do we get our schedules?

408
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,776
[Grace]
I heard our room has a view...

409
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,820
Oh, this is so sad.

410
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,488
No, wait, Sadness!

411
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,948
-No, no, no! Don't!
-I don't have a good grip!

412
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,950
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

413
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,619
[Dad] Here we are.

414
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,997
This looks really cool.

415
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,623
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach?

416
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,791
'Cause I am available.

417
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,209
-[Mom] Bill.
-[Dad] No? All right.

418
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,878
-We'll see you in a few days.
-[Mom] Have fun!

419
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,087
-[Bree] Thanks so much. Bye!
-Don't miss us too much.

420
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,922
-Okay, bye!
-Wait. Riley,

421
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,382
are you sure
you have everything?

422
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,467
-Stick?
-Yes.

423
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,593
-Gloves?
-Yes.

424
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,927
-You have your phone?
-Yes, of course.

425
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,596
-Fully charged?
-Yeah, it's like 50.

426
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,764
-What?
-Dad, it's fine.

427
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,390
Okay, call us if you need us.

428
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,475
I love you. Go get 'em.

429
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,684
Okay. Love you guys.

430
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,187
-Don't forget the deodorant!
-Mom!

431
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,188
Bye, monkey.

432
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,859
Okay, now.

433
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,445
[crying]

434
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,241
It's okay. We need this.

435
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,787
[sniffles]

436
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,955
[gasps]

437
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,957
[Disgust] Guys,
these are high-schoolers.

438
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,084
-Oh...
-We do not wanna be

439
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,168
red and puffy, do we?

440
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,252
No.

441
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,004
Don't worry,
we'll have plenty of time

442
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,881
to think about this
after camp.

443
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,467
Now, where did
Bree and Grace go?

444
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,968
-Oh! There they are.
-Wait.

445
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,054
Aren't those traitors
dead to us?

446
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,806
Our best friends?
[scoffs] No.

447
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,226
[girl] Whoa! Hey!

448
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,020
Are you okay?

449
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,397
[gasps] Everybody act regular.
It's Valentina Ortiz.

450
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,024
-Ah!
-We gotta say something.

451
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,235
-Uh...
-Hey.

452
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,611
-Hi. I'm Val...
-I know.

453
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,779
You're the varsity captain,

454
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,447
you set the all-time
goal record as a junior,

455
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,782
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

456
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,950
What are we saying?

457
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,284
We are so uncool.

458
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,245
Why are we
still holding her hand?

459
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,996
Just like me.
[gasps, chuckles nervously]

460
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,998
Oh, you're the one
Coach told us about.

461
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,917
Riley, from Michigan, right?

462
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,585
-It's Minnesota, sweetie.
-No, no, no.

463
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,213
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

464
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,549
[laughs] Yeah, that's me.

465
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,844
Riley from good old Michigan.

466
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,929
Orange?
Who made the console orange?

467
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,681
-Do I look orange?
-I didn't touch it.

468
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,850
-Orange is not my color.
-Not me.

469
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,185
-Hello, everybody.
-[all scream]

470
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,646
Oh, my gosh. I am just
such a huge fan of yours.

471
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,732
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

472
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,651
[squeals]
Okay. How can I help?

473
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,069
-Uh... [exclaims]
-I can take notes,

474
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,654
get coffee, manage your
calendar, walk your dog,

475
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,322
carry your things,
watch you sleep.

476
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,409
Wow! You have a lot of energy.
[chuckles]

477
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,952
Maybe you could just
stay in one place.

478
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,120
Anything.

479
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,830
Just call my name,
and I am here for you.

480
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,914
Okay, love that.

481
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,416
-And what was your name again?
-Oh.

482
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,959
I'm sorry.
I can get ahead of myself.

483
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,043
I'm Anxiety.

484
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,503
I'm one of
Riley's new emotions.

485
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,797
And we are just
super-jazzed to be here.

486
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,090
Where can I put my stuff?

487
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,592
Uh-uh-uh.
What do you mean "we"?

488
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,135
[female voice sighs
in exasperation]

489
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,262
[female voice] I wish I was as
tall as all of you. [grunts]

490
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,472
-Who the heck are you?
-[grunting, panting]

491
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,807
I'm Envy.

492
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,101
Oh! Look at your hair.

493
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,103
-Oh, yeah, not happening.
-[gasps]

494
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,479
Look at her hair!

495
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,648
We need hair like that.

496
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,151
Oh, my gosh.
I love the red in your hair.

497
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,402
-Oh...
-[Disgust gasps]

498
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,446
What are you doing?

499
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,281
Hey,
maybe when I make the team,

500
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,908
I can join Team Redhead, too!

501
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,950
Yeah, yeah.

502
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,453
[whimpers]

503
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,621
[gasps]

504
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,122
Okay, who's this guy?

505
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,999
What's your name, big fella?

506
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,292
That's Embarrassment.

507
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,793
He's not really big
on eye contact,

508
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,629
or uh, like, good talking,

509
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,047
but he's a really sweet guy.

510
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,508
Well, welcome to Headquarters,
Embarrassment.

511
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,302
Oh, we're doing a... No.

512
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,179
No, going high. Oh.

513
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,264
You got a real sweaty palm
there, buddy. [chuckles]

514
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,557
[Embarrassment whimpering]

515
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,309
Hey, do you wanna
come with me, actually?

516
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,685
You can meet some of
the other Fire Hawks.

517
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,937
[Anxiety] Ooh,
this is exciting.

518
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,064
But we can't let her know
we're excited.

519
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,233
Yeah, sounds good.

520
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,609
What emotion was that?

521
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,944
That's Ennui.

522
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,779
-An-what?
-[female voice 2 sighs]

523
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,155
Ennui.

524
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,783
It's what you would call
the boredom.

525
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,369
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

526
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,703
Am I saying it right?

527
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,205
An-wah. No.

528
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,332
Oh, nicknames!
I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

529
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,541
No.

530
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,543
How are you driving?

531
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,337
-Console app.
-[beeps]

532
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,214
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

533
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,341
Now, now,
I know new emotions

534
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,219
can sometimes feel
unhelpful at first,

535
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,221
and you just wanna...
[grunting]

536
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,848
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

537
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,645
But I've learned that every
emotion is good for Riley.

538
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,397
-Even this turkey.
-[Sadness chuckles]

539
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,107
Okay, fine.

540
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,441
[Ennui sighs]

541
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,693
Cool. Lead the way.

542
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,820
All right. Grab your stuff
and follow me.

543
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,613
[Sadness] Oh, but what about
our friends?

544
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,448
[Envy] Val is our future.

545
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,950
Yes, I agree completely.

546
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,201
We need new friends or else

547
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,328
we'll be totally alone
in high school.

548
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,496
-Right, Joy?
-Well...

549
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,831
-I mean, maybe, um...
-Here we go!

550
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,165
Wait up.

551
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,834
Thanks for showing me around.

552
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,168
Wait, why did you do that?

553
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,628
Sorry. What did I do?

554
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,463
We just left
our best friends behind.

555
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,340
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

556
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,800
No. Okay.

557
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,469
These next three days need
to be about Bree and Grace.

558
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,805
Joy, the next three days
could determine

559
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,724
the next four years
of our lives.

560
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,685
[chuckles] Now, I think that's
overstating things a bit.

561
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,104
Ooh, la, la.
Joy is so old school.

562
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,230
What?

563
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,732
Look, we all have a job to do.

564
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,983
You make Riley happy,

565
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,359
Sadness makes her sad,

566
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,320
Fear protects her from
the scary stuff she can see,

567
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,071
and my job is to protect her

568
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,948
from the scary stuff
she can't see.

569
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,992
I plan for the future.

570
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,827
Oh, I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

571
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,913
[console beeps]

572
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,540
I was using that
as a cup holder.

573
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,834
Okay, so my team
has run all the data,

574
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,169
and we're looking
at the following

575
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,337
likely scenarios.

576
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,255
First, we don't take
this camp seriously,

577
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,548
and we goof off
with Bree and Grace.

578
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,051
Riley looks really uncool
in front of Val.

579
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,218
She fails to
impress the coach,

580
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,595
does not become a Fire Hawk,

581
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,430
and finally arrives
at high school.

582
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,848
-She has no one.
-[bell ringing]

583
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,892
She eats alone,
and only the teachers

584
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,226
-know her name.
-Ew.

585
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,728
Okay, you and I
are gonna be friends.

586
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,147
Oh, this is a sad story.

587
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,107
It's a ridiculous story.

588
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,818
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

589
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,528
None of this
will actually happen.

590
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,946
Right. Whatever you say.

591
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,365
-You're the boss. [chuckles]
-[female voice 3] Oh...

592
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,160
Remember when we all finally
came up to Headquarters?

593
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,954
That was like 30 seconds ago,
Nostalgia.

594
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,123
Yeah, those were the days.

595
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,751
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

596
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,253
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations,

597
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,880
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited,

598
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,632
but I will keep you
in the loop, I promise.

599
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,758
-[Valentina] All right...
-Hey, hey...

600
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,093
-you ready, Riley?
-everybody focus!

601
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,261
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

602
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,763
-And here we are!
-[indistinct chatter]

603
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,602
[Envy] These girls are so cool!

604
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,728
[Disgust] And older.

605
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,063
We are not changing
in front of them.

606
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,272
It's fine!

607
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,024
Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.

608
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,443
Hey, come on! I want you to
meet the other Fire Hawks.

609
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,486
-Hey, girl!
-What's up?

610
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,904
Hey.

611
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,531
Riley is from Michigan.

612
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,574
Okay, we're stuck with that.

613
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,535
Oh, Cool. Where in Michigan
are you from?

614
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,370
-Uh...
-Oh, no. What now?

615
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,372
Okay, looks like
we're committing to this.

616
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,665
Cities in Michigan...

617
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,874
We need to make something up.

618
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,252
I'm from all over.

619
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,129
Nice. See you out there.

620
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,338
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

621
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,298
[Anxiety]
Oh, she wants to sit with us.

622
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,551
[gasps]
Everything is beautiful!

623
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,678
There's not enough room
for Bree and Grace.

624
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,430
Oh! Let's go sit over there.

625
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,390
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

626
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,808
But thanks anyway.

627
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,893
Oh. Uh... Yeah. Okay.

628
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,978
No worries.

629
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,813
See? Was that so hard?

630
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,939
No. You're totally right.

631
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,315
That decision's
not gonna haunt us

632
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,192
for the rest
of our lives at all.

633
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,570
-[Bree] No way!
-Bree and Grace!

634
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,029
-There you are.
-Riley.

635
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,907
Time to celebrate!

636
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,326
-Say, "awooga"!
-[both] Awooga!

637
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,745
Okay, ladies.
Let's all settle in.

638
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,249
[babbling, chuckling]

639
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,209
-Uh, Joy?
-Wait, wait, wait.

640
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,419
-[coach] Ladies!
-[girls gasp]

641
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,005
Settle in means settle down.

642
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,423
I need your focus.

643
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,550
Which means now I'm going
to need your cell phones.

644
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,843
All of 'em.

645
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,928
[girl] Wait, what?
Are you serious?

646
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,308
[tuts] You're here
to work, not goof around.

647
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,392
Got that, Andersen?

648
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,228
Yes, Coach.

649
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,439
Please put all your phones
in the basket.

650
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,232
You get them back
at the end of camp.

651
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,738
Wow. Coach is so serious.

652
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,073
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe, um, I could help...

653
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,158
Thank you. Not now.

654
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,493
I know, right? [laughs]

Oh. [chuckles]
You think this is funny?

657
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,415
Uh-huh. Well, you know
what else is funny?

658
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,625
Skating lines.

659
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,376
-Now hit the ice, ladies.
-[all groaning]

660
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,420
-Great job, Michigan.
-Thanks a lot, new girl.

661
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,255
[girl 1] Just make her do it.

662
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,634
[sighs] Bravo, Joy.
She's totally fitting in now.

663

Oh, thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

[all panting]

665
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,266
You're lagging behind,
Andersen!

666
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,268
-Skate harder!
-[player] This is the worst.

667
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,353
[whistle blows]

668
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,563
All right, ladies,
take a breather.

669
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,398
Then we'll divide into teams.

670
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,151
[breathing heavily]

671
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,989
[Fire Hawk player]
Oh, that Michigan girl

672
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,033
-is off to a rough start.
-[Anxiety] Oh, no.

673
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,493
Are they talking about us?

674
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,161
Yeah, there's no way
Coach is putting her

675
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,746
on the team if she can't
get it together.

676
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,957
Uh, okay, Dani,
like you had it all together

677
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,124
when you were a freshman?

678
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,709
I wasn't that immature.

679
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:49,256
[Sofia] Dani, you stuck straws
up your nose. Like last night.

-[sobbing]
-[Envy] Oh.

684
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,101
I always wanted people to talk
about us, but not like this.

685
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,270
Oh, Joy, what do we do now?

686
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,312
Um...

687
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,605
We can just, um...

688
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,940
I have an idea.

689
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,441
Okay.

690
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,820
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

691
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,242
Uh, Val?

692
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,994
Oh, hey, Riley. What's up?

693
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,161
Uh, I-I...

694
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,498
I'm so sorry.

695
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,584
I didn't mean to get
the whole team skating lines.

696
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,793
I feel terrible.

697
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,128
I respect you so much.

698
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,588
I would never do anything
to mess you up.

699

a bit thick, don't you think?

-[shushes] Joy.
-You're a great hockey player,

701
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,883
and you lead the team
so amazingly,

702
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,051
and I really
look up to you and...

703
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,095
Okay, okay. Thanks. [chuckles]

704
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,723
Listen, Coach was pretty hard
on you today,

705
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,349
but that's not a bad thing.

706
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,809
It means you're on her radar.

707
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,935
Really?

708
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,812
Listen, I'm glad you came
to talk with me.

the same team later, okay?

00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,482
Oh, yeah. Cool.

-[sighs wearily]
-Wow.

712
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,360
-[Ennui] Good job. Wow.
-I wish I could do that.

713
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,654
You guys, I mean,
it really wasn't anything.

714
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,281
I'm just trying to help.

715
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,824
I agree.

716
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,118
Great job, Anxiety.

717
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,245
I stepped back,
you stepped in,

718
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,040
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

719
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,791
But that was just
part one of my plan.

720
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,168
There's a part two?

721
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,795
A good plan
has many parts, Joy.

722
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,631
Okay, ladies,
we're gonna form your teams

723
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,757
for the rest of camp.

724
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,175
Now, split yourselves
down the middle.

725
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,345
Team one on the right,
team two on the left.

726
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,429
Let's do this!

727
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,889
One more time
on the same team, right?

728
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,931
Right.

729
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,268
Val wants us.

730
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,978
But we promised
Bree and Grace.

731
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,772
Joy, we have to
plan for the future.

732
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,443
Come on, Riley, move.
Move those feet!

733
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,778
Val's on team one,
you wanna be on team one.

734
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,862
Let's go.

She made a promise
to her friends.

736

to overstep...

-No!

All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

748
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,784
That is not Riley.

749
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,369
I know. It's a better Riley.

next year.

We build her
a new Sense of Self.

with that.

Riley's life
is more complex now.

It requires more sophisticated
emotions than all of you.

she needs anymore, Joy.

to build the old one?

starting from scratch.

00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,540
Sadness and I
have been here before. Oh.

966
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,542
[Disgust]
Joy, this is a dead end.

967
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,086
Those are the worst kinds
of ends!

968
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,631
Everything's changing so fast!
[crying]

969
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,966
So, we're lost.

970
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,510
No. You're never lost
if you're having fun.

971
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,803
No one is having fun, Joy.

972
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,597
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

973
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,056
She's having a great time.

974
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,558
[crying]

975
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,143
I thought you knew
where you were going.

976
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,311
I do. I did.

977
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,979
-I just need a moment.
-She doesn't know.

978
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,314
We're stuck here!

979
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,192
Oh, Riley's awake.

980
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,527
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

981
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,321
Come on,
we'll find another way.

982
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,200
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

983
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,745
[memories clinking]

984
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,954
[breathing heavily]

985
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,248
[Ennui sighs]

986
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,542
Why are we up so early?

987
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,961
Because, mon ami,
we need to speed things up,

988
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,379
and that means
we hit the ice early,

989
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,174
and practice like
we've never practiced before.

990
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,884
[Ennui] Aren't we already good
at hockey?

991
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,135
[Envy] We're good.

992
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,471
-But the Fire Hawks are great.
-That's right!

993
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,266
[grunts, groans]

994
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,351
[Anxiety]
Every time we miss,

995
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,685
we skate a lap
around the rink.

996
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,687
Hockey is not a game,
it is a sport.

997
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,397
[Riley grunts]

998
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,032
[grunts]

999
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,825
-Yes!
-[Envy] Wow.

1000
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,160
That was amazing.

1001
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,246
We need to be that good
every time.

1002
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,789
Let's run it again.

1003
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,582
Hey, I see I'm not the only
one who likes to start early.

1004
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,792
[Anxiety] You guys, it's Val!

1005
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,126
We had the same idea.

1006
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,586
We're basically
the same person.

1007
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,004
We're gonna be best friends.

1008
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,547
How long have you been here?

1009
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,508
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

1010
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,969
I just wanted to get in
some extra ice time.

1011
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,136
I'm the same way.

1012
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,888
[Anxiety]
Oh, my gosh. She gets us.

1013
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,140
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

1014
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,268
You get what it takes
to be the best.

1015
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,813
Look at us.

1016
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,690
This is going great!

1017
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,276
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

1018
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,444
Oh, we should ask Val
lots of questions.

1019
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,321
People love
talking about themselves.

1020
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,491
So, what was
your freshman year
on the Fire Hawks like?

1021
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,244
I mean,
it was a lot of work,

1022
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,870
like, a lot... [chuckles]

1023
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,123
but it's also
how I met my best friends.

1024
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,292
Val is sharing things with us!

1025
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,460
Hey, a few of us are just
gonna hang out tonight,

1026
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,587
order some food.
You should come.

1027
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,923
Oh! An exclusive invitation.
[chuckles]

1028
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,341
We're going!

1029
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,634
-Really?
-Definitely.

1030
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,802
It'll be fun.

1031
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,679
[coach] All right, ladies,
let's warm up.

1032
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,307
Hey, Riley.

1033
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,391
Hi.

1034
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,601
We are not sharing Val
with them.

1035
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,603
[grunts] Early mornings
make me so hungry.

1036
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,980
I know, right?

1037
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,274
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

1038
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,400
Yes!

1039
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,360
See? I told you I'd find it.

1040
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,903
The Stream of Consciousness.

1041
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,698
-[Sadness] But, Joy...
-Wow! Our girl is hungry.

1042
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,991
Hop on something delicious!

1043
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,409
-Joy...
-Ooh, deep dish.

1044
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,244
[chuckles]
And it's still warm.

1045
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,746
Extra cheese, baby!

1046
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,830
Sadness, come on.

1047
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,373
But I've been trying
to tell you.

1048
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,751
We can't take the tube back,
Joy.

1049
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,420
Someone has to be
at the console to recall us.

1050
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,505
She's right. We'd be stranded.

1051
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,007
Yeah. Anxiety would have
thought about that.

1052
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,550
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

1053
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,302
Okay. Uh...

1054
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,221
So, someone's gonna have to
crawl up that tube,

1055
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,639
and go back to Headquarters,

1056
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,433
and at the right moment,
bring us back.

1057
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,185
Oh, I'll do it.
I'll pound that...

1058
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,561
I don't think so, punty.

1059
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,146
-Okay, here's the thing.
-You were never an option.

1060
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,397
Thank you.

1061
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,566
You want me to crawl through
a tube in this?

1062
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,901
Yeah, not happening.

1063
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,656
[gasps] Oh, no, not me.

1064
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,533
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

1065
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,827
You know the console
better than anybody.

1066
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,913
You've read the manuals
cover to cover.

1067
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,414
I mean, you say that,

1068
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,918
but I know a lot less about
Manual 28, Chapter Seven,

1069
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,669
"How to Recall
Non-Memory Objects"

1070
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,463
than most folks realize.

1071
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,131
You've proven my point
for me, Sadness.

1072
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,341
That sounds like a yes.

1073
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,425
[man on radio]
Where is everybody?

1074
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,676
You on break again?

1075
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,804
Ooh! Walkie-talkies. Here.
Check-check-check.

1076
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,097
Can you hear me?
I gotta press a button.

1077
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,599
Go for Joy. Copy that. Over.
Oh, I love 'em!

1078
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,934
We'll signal you
when we get there,

1079
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,019
-and then you bring us back.
-Oh...

1080
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,063
[Joy] Sadness, it's the fastest
way back to Headquarters.

1081
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,231
Joy, I can't do it.

1082
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,650
I'm not strong like you are.

1083
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,193
I know you, Sadness.

1084
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,903
You are strong.

1085
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,739
I can't give you
specific examples right now,

1086
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,157
but you got this.

1087
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,576
-[Joy grunts]
-[Sadness whimpers]

1088
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,620
Just don't look down
and keep moving.

1089
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,288
[Sadness] Yeah, I can do it.

1090
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,915
[crying hysterically]

1091
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,001
She'll be okay. Right?

1092
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,837
Uh, fifty-fifty.

1093
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,755
Mmm! You want one?

1094
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,091
But we hate those things.

1095
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,968
They taste like cardboard.

1096
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,262
-[Embarrassment groaning]
-We can't say no to Val.

1097
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,222
Okay, no, you're so right.

1098
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,682
We eat whatever Val eats.

1099
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,183
-That's the spirit!
-Whoo!

1100
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,644
Envy, I think you're really
in the zone.

1101
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,104
Take the wheel,
I'll be right back.

1102
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,814
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

1103
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,898
She picked me.

1104
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,859
You care too much
about things.

1105
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,361
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

1106
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,114
It's got
a very interesting texture.

1107
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,658
It tastes like... Mmm...

1108
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,535
What does it remind me of?
Um...

1109
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:59,206
Cardboard? Asparagus?
Broccoli?

1110
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,958
What are they doing to her
up there?

1111

I don't know,
but we have to go.

No! No way am I step...

[sarcastically] Oh, yeah,

1278
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,798
-we had a great time.
-[Fire Hawks exclaim]

1279
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,508
[Riley echoing] Great time.

00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,426
[worker clamoring]

1281
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,261
Why can't they just
leave her alone?

1282
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,888
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1283
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,349
We go the long way,
which is the best way.

1284
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,726
Stretch those hammies, Anger.
Let's go.

1285
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,562
Best night of my life.

1286
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,564
Well,
this has been really fun.

1287
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,857
Extremely.

1288
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,983
But we're gonna go now.

1289
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,819
Okay, bye.

1290
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,945
-[♪ upbeat pop music playing]
-Oh, this is

1291
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,154
the best band ever!

1292
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,114
-Okay, Riley!
-Michigan knows what's up!

1293
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,493
See? As long as
we like what they like,

1294
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,953
we have all the friends
we need.

1295
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,204
-[Riley laughing]
-[Sofia] Night, guys.

1296
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,248
Well, I think
I'm calling it a night.

1297
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,416
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, it's late.

1298
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,543
Plus, I think
you'll want to get some sleep

1299
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,627
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1300
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,170
What scrimmage?

1301
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,464
Uh. It's just something Coach
always does on the last day.

1302
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,258
It's how Val made the team
as a freshman.

1303
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,425
Don't tell her that.

1304
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,052
Val scored two goals.

1305
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,637
No freshman
has ever done that.

1306
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,055
Dani, stop.

1307
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,140
Technically, it's not your
tryout for the next year,

1308
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,393
but it basically is.

1309
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,478
You'll do great.
Just be yourself.

1310
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,729
[Anxiety] Did you hear that?

1311
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,857
We could become a Fire Hawk,
like, tomorrow.

1312
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,026
But how do we be ourself if
our new self isn't ready yet?

1313
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,611
[grunts] Excellent point.

1314
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,572
Let's get
these memories downstairs.

1315
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,614
[memories clattering]

1316
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,116
Oh...

1317
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,745
[memories clattering]

1318
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,252
Is that broccoli?

1319
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,629
We're getting
deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1320
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,797
Great observation.

1321
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,048
The long way did turn out

1322
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,133
to be a little longer
than I thought.

1323
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,843
Anyway,
who wants to sing a song?

1324
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,012
Oh, I know a song.
It's called, "I give up."

1325
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,889
Or let's play the quiet game!

1326
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,891
One, two, three, hush.

1327
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,183
[Anger] I'll tell you
what we do,

1328
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,727
we go back up there
and we kick those...

1329
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,228
[Joy] Anger,
now is not the time.

1330
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,563
[Disgust] Joy, this is useless.

1331
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,189
Real Riley is out there
somewhere,

1332
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,441
and we're never
going to find her.

1333
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,609
[worker] You know what?
Yeah, these can go.

1334
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,610
-Forget 'em!
-No, no, no, I can find her.

1335
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,236
I just need to get
a better view.

1336
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,656
[gasps]

1337
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,785
[machine whirring]

1338
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,337
Okay, well, this isn't
working, and that's fine.

1339
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,880
-Everything's fine.
-This is hopeless.

1340
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,049
I say we cut our losses
and walk back.

1341
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,842
This whole trip
is just a series

1342
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,427
of deader and deader ends.

1343
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,596
Ever since that
puberty alarm went off

1344
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,307
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1345
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,476
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

1346
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,728
It's light out at 1:00
in the morning!

1347
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,231
I have never been inside
so many jars in my life.

1348
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,233
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1349
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:09,404
And if Joy can't see that,
well, then, she's delusional!

1350
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,992
Delusional?

1351
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,411
Of course I'm delusional!

1352
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,081
Do you know how hard it is to
stay positive all the time,

1353
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,751
when all you folks do is
complain, complain, complain?

1354
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,628

toaster strudel!

1355

[all gasp]

1356
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,589
Do you think
I have all the answers?

1357
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,174
Of course I don't!

1358
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,802
[sighs]

1359
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,805
We can't even find
the back of our own mind.

1360
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,852
Anxiety is right!

1361
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,481
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1362
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,735
And that hurts.

1363
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,862
It really hurts.

1364
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,911
Joy, you've made
a lot of mistakes.

1365
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,663
A lot.

1366
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,416
And you'll make a whole lot
more in the future.

1367
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,002
But if you let that stop you,

1368
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,713
we might as well lie down
and give up now.

1369
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,423
Well, actually,
that does sound kinda nice.

1370
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,465
Ow!

1371
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,259
Come on.

Let's just forget
that ever happened.

1380
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,164
You don't have to
ask me twice.

-Whoa!
-This is great.

1388
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,562
The Fire Hawks
have accepted us.

1389
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,064
But if Coach doesn't put us
on the team,

1390
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,231
none of that matters.

1391
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,900
Tomorrow is everything.

1392
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,027
Which is why
we're gonna need more help.

1393
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,361
Ennui,
are you paying attention?

1394
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,238
-No.
-Ugh. Embarrassment?

1395

[Grace] Well,
this has been really fun.

1396
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,574
[Anxiety distantly]
Embarrassment?

1397
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,117
-[Bree] Extremely.
-[Anxiety] Never mind.

-[Anxiety] Now, let's see.

1402
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,258
What am I looking for?

1403
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,718
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something,

1404
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,844
and then
you get there to do it,

1405
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,054
and you forget
what you were gonna do?

1406
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,764
[Envy] We'll need all the help
we can get.

1407
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,099
[Anxiety] That is exactly
what I was thinking.

00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,716
[Joy] Come on. We just need to
cut through...

are gonna love it.

is Lance.

over Sarah M"? [gasps]

Where's the journalistic
integrity?

1435
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,009
Oh!
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1436
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,510
And it even got bigger.

1437
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,262
Hmm.

1438
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,222
And orange?

1439
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,228
[Anxiety] All right, 22,
Riley breaks her leg
in practice,

1440
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,271
disappointing everyone.

1441
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,480
Nice job.

Now, 18.
Val and Dani whispering

1443
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,442
after Riley misses a goal.

1444
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,320
Great! We need to help
Riley prepare.

1445
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,571
Now's the time to send up

1446

every possible thing
that could go wrong.

1447

We are looking to the future.

00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,119
Every possible mistake
she could make.

Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.

1451
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,170
[Anxiety]
Riley misses an open goal,

1452
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,171
Coach writes about it
in her notebook.

1453
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,255
Yes!

1454
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,798
More like that.

1455
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,008
[Disgust] Oh, no!

1456
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,010
They're using Riley's
imagination against her.

1457
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,553
Val and her friends
like us now,

1458
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,638
but if we
don't make the team,

1459
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,097
will they like us tomorrow?

1461
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,061

-[groans]

1464
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,108
Number 22. Val passes to us,
and we miss it. [gasps]

1465
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,195
We can't let her
do this to Riley.

1466
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,656
We have to shut this down.

1467

-[worker groans]
-[Anxiety] Love it, 37.

1468
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,911
Riley hits the puck
into her own net.

1469
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,372
-Why are you drawing a hippo?
-I'm not.

1470
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,665
I... [stammers]
I'm drawing Riley!

1471
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,124
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,584
Oh, I love her pony tail. Yes!

1473
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,545
Riley scores
and everyone hugs her?

1474
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,172
81, that is not helping.

1475
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,132
Riley paints her nails
to match her jersey.

1476
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,760
Everybody copies her.
And she is so cool.

1477
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,929
Riley wears knee pads.

1478
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,224
We buy flowers
for the losing team!

1479
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,935
What? I can't always be
the rage guy.

1480
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,478
No, no. I liked it.

1481
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,938
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1482
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,231
I'm starting to think you guys

1483

Well, I think we gave it
our best shot.

Don't listen to Anxiety.

1501
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,141
She's using these horrible
projections to change Riley.

Joy, I'm doing this for you!

This is all
so Riley can be happier.

1504

If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

is better than Val

and then Val hates her?

she has to give up
hockey forever?

What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries,

00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,349
and the Olympics call,

1521

Oh, is it Coach's email?

2075
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:51,961
No. It's Bree and Grace.
[chuckles]

2076
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:54,506
Aw. I miss those girls.

2077
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:57,092
Oh. Remember when
Bree and Grace,

2078
01:24:57,133 --> 01:24:58,593
-and us used to...
-You're still early.

2079
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,136
-No, no, no. Too early.
-Go downstairs.

2080
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,806
I'll just be downstairs
if you need me.

2081
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,432
[Joy] It's 3 minutes to 2:00.

2082
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,976
-She's got this.
-'Cause she's got us.

2083
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:12,524
Ooh, yeah! Right? 'Cause
she's... [nervously] Maybe?

2084
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:14,192
All right, Embarrassment.

2085
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,069
Everybody,
look at Embarrassment!

2086

[whimpers]

2087
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,323
Hey, look, if you don't
make it this year,

2088
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,574
there's always next year.

2089
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,159
I know.

2090
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,620
-I love our girl.
-How could you not?

2091
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,288
She's super smart.

2092
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,832
[Sadness] And great at hockey.

2093
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:30,250
[Disgust]
She's really creative.

2094
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,752
She can be bored,
but never boring.

2095
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,547
But she can be a little
sarcastic from time to time.

2096
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,591
[Fear] She can have
really bad ideas.

2097
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,594
[Anger] Occasionally, she can
do the wrong thing.

2098
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,931
[Joy] And sometimes, she can be
too hard on herself.

2099
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,434
But every bit of Riley
makes her who she is.

2100
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,687
And we love all of our girl.

2101
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:55,942
Every messy,
beautiful piece of her.

So, Riley, how was camp?

2106
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,935
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

2107
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:32,312
Uh...

2108
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,646
But what about sneaking

2109
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:34,689
-into Coach's office?
-What about hitting Grace?

2110
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,690
-Remember the lying?
-Are we gonna

2111
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:36,816
tell her about the Fire Hawks?

2112
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,318
-She doesn't need to know.
-Objection.

2113
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,569
Pardon. Excusez moi.

2114
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:40,695
[console chimes]

2115
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:41,738
It was good.

2116
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:47,118
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

2117
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,411
And what about
the red in her hair?

2118
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,579
Did she join a gang?

2119
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,080
Welcome back, Anxiety.

2120
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:57,170
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

2121
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,672
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.
