1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,170
Don't you have something to tell us?
About this fake nude photograph?

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,007
We've checked everyone's messages.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,135
-Seo Dayeon, you're the original source.
-God.

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,971
Im Seungwu, that damn bastard!
I told him not to share it with anyone!

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,807
Did you create it?

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,475
What have I ever done to you?

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,395
I didn't make it.
I got this from Ok Chanmi.

8
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,438
What?

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,856
Ok Chanmi?

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,568
I'm really sorry about spreading it,
but I got this from Ok Chanmi!

11
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,527
Unlock your phone.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,747
-Wow, did Ok Chanmi do this for real?
-Did Ok Chanmi really do this?

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,373
Is she out of her mind?

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,708
-Ok Chanmi's coming!
-Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,709
There she is.

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,793
Hey, hey, Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi.

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,592
Why did you do that?

18
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,636
You crazy little...

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,364
What?

20
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,824
Ji, Ji Sooheon?

21
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,076
Hey, it's Ji Sooheon.

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,160
What's going on?

23
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,330
Is Ji Sooheon dating Ok Chanmi?

24
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,127
Why are they leaving together?

25
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,759
Hey! Let me go! I said let me go!

26
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,261
Going back there won't do you any good.

27
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,721
If it were you,
would you just suck it up and take it?

28
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,682
Take the blame for something
you didn't do and get slapped for it?

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,892
Why should I let everyone believe

30
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,018
that I was responsible
for something like that?

31
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,770
Shit!

32
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,271
What gives you the right to hold me back?

33
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,856
Because you're not understanding
what I told you.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,900
-What?
-I warned you.

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,069
I told you to go back
to the school you came from.

36
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,487
What?

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,696
This isn't the end of it.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,032
Things will only become more
unbearable and unfair for you.

39
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,076
Just go back to your old school.

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,342
Chanmi.

41
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,427
What are you doing here ditching class?

42
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,056
I wanted to ask you something.

43
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,559
We can talk in the classroom.

44
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,227
Don't pay attention to everyone else.

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,937
Can you show me your cell phone?

46
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,024
Chanmi, I didn't even think
that you made the picture

47
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,944
and I sent it to Im Seungwu,
that bastard, as a joke.

48
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,448
You should have told me that you made it.

49
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,201
Dayeon, don't be sorry.

50
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,120
You didn't do anything wrong.

51
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,373
Can I just see your phone?

52
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,084
Because the nude that you said
you received from my number

53
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,588
got deleted on my end.

54
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,555
OK CHANMI
COACH TOLD ME TO RUSH SO I CAME

55
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,931
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT HERE ;(
OK CHANMI I'M ON MY WAY

56
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,019
-Yesterday at 5:27...
-It's true that you sent it to me.

57
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,855
By the way, did something happen
between you and Kook Jihyun?

58
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,734
I've never ever called someone
a hypocrite in my entire life.

59
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,696
What do you mean?

60
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,323
Hey, why don't you just pretend
you're crazy

61
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,700
and act like nothing happened.
Just come back to class.

62
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,937
REVENGE OF OTHERS

63
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,526
Chanmi,

64
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,196
what in the world happened?

65
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,365
A nude?

66
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,200
What's going on?

67
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,452
Did something happen
between you and Kook Jihyun?

68
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,876
The truth is, I didn't faint that day
in the auditorium because I was dizzy.

69
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,546
Somebody hit me
over the head with a brick.

70
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,007
What? A brick?

71
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,843
Who? Who would do such a thing?

72
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,722
I think this person knocked me out
then unlocked my phone with my finger.

73
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,558
If they had sent out a message
at that point,

74
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,018
nobody would ever figure out
that it wasn't me who had sent it.

75
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,687
So are you saying that

76
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,356
Kook Jihyun did it?

77
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:39,320
Uploading her own nude
to frame you is a little too...

78
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,827
Oh, wait, Chanmi,
what do you think of this?

79
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,956
WASH YOUR HANDS PROPERLY
FOR AT LEAST 30 SECONDS

80
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,251
I'm starving.

81
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,091
Why did you take Ok Chanmi with you?

82
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,719
I needed to break her arms
to calm myself down.

83
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,512
Because you were going to break
an innocent person's arms.

84
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,847
What makes you think she's innocent?

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,932
Why are you defending her
after seeing what she did?

86
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,726
Do you really think someone would
be stupid enough

87
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,352
to do something
that would expose them so easily?

88
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,312
Spreading something
through a messaging app

89
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,688
among a small group of students?

90
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,232
Don't you think it would be extremely easy
to track down who the original source was?

91
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,984
Are you...

92
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,486
trying to protect Ok Chanmi?

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,323
Why?

94
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,615
I mean...

95
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm just telling you the truth.

96
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,078
Oh, I'm hungry.

97
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,099
These kids are so lame.

98
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,018
Have they really never seen
a fake nude before?

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,728
So annoying.

100
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,984
Why is Jaebum hanging out with that girl?

101
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,587
Chanmi, the approval just came through.

102
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,255
-Oh, really? They said it was okay?
-Yeah.

103
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,091
They said they called the Principal
directly to get the approval.

104
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,051
That's amazing.

105
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,054
-I'll go and check in a bit.
-Awesome, thank you.

106
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,889
Oh, it's nothing.

107
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,891
I'll get you lunch next time.

108
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,768
Where will you take me to eat?

109
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,271
Thank you for granting me permission, sir.

110
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,899
I hope you find your bag.

111
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,985
Mr. Yoon, please help him
with whatever he needs.

112
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,654
Yes, sir. Of course.

113
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,073
In that case, Jaebum,
best of luck with everything.

114
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,242
-Thank you, I appreciate it.
-Okay then.

115
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,286
Now...

116
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,163
Did you say you misplaced it
somewhere near the auditorium?

117
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,083
Sometime between
five and six o'clock yesterday?

118
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

119
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,585
You do know that no one's allowed
to watch these recordings

120
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,003
without permission, right?

121
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,214
Yes, Mr. Yoon, I apologize.

122
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,133
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

123
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,926
What I mean is, just don't let
the other students know you saw this.

124
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,136
Of course.

125
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,849
Press this if you want to fast forward.

126
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,309
And let me know once you're done.
I'll be in the room next door.

127
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,593
-Ok Chanmi, you're late.
-Yeah.

128
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,148
Hey, Jihyun, everyone's been talking
about some nonsense.

129
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,069
I know they're saying it's real nude
when It's obvious that it's fake.

130
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,781
Not that, there's something
else that's really ridiculous...

131
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,908
Ridiculous?

132
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,951
What's ridiculous?

133
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,916
Ugh, what is it?

134
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,504
Tell me later.

135
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,093
Remember, the words "even",
"still", "much",

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,930
"far", and "a lot" add emphasis.

137
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,558
This next type of question
is one that many of you continue to miss.

138
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,560
So let's go over it together.

139
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,235
Take a look at this sentence.

140
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,529
The noun is important here.

141
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,907
You might have noticed
that the noun is plural.

142
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,745
Ugh, what's with you two?

143
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,038
What were you going to tell me earlier?

144
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,998
Did that Ok Chanmi
leak another photo of me?

145
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,338
This is annoying the hell out of me. Shit.

146
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,006
So what is it?

147
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,300
Um, there's a rumor going around
that you and Gi Osung from class 4

148
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,718
are living in the same house.

149
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,720
That doesn't even make any sense, right?

150
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
People are saying
that you and Osung are siblings.

151
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,057
Isn't that just so ridiculous?

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,601
Did...

153
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,436
Did...

154
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,606
Ok Chanmi also start that rumor?

155
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,693
I don't think so. It didn't spread
through the messaging app.

156
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,444
I think it spread by word of mouth.

157
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,074
There's Gi Osung.

158
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,326
Hey, Kook Jihyun!

159
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,413
We need to talk.

160
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,260
You should have coaxed her gently.

161
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,386
Ok Chanmi leaked this to everyone
at school

162
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,470
because you went batshit crazy on her!

163
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,723
Didn't you see that she was
the one who started it?

164
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,975
It's a nude. A nude!

165
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,268
How could I not do anything about that?

166
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,644
I know you were probably
the one who started this

167
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,770
and that she reacted
by spreading this around.

168
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,522
Weren't you the one
who said you took care of it?

169
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,275
You said she'd keep her mouth shut!

170
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,693
Is this what you meant
by keeping her mouth shut?

171
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,154
What are you going to do now?

172
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,031
What do you mean?

173
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,366
That bitch Ok Chanmi is basically dead.

174
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,494
I'll make her leave this school
with her tail between her legs.

175
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,788
Just like that bastard Sa Junggyeong did.

176
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,956
This crazy little...

177
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,917
Hey! Do you even understand
what I'm saying right now?

178
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,378
Are you really going to admit
we're siblings?

179
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,297
Is there anything
in that hollow head of yours?

180
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,468
You moron, it'll just get worse
if we don't say anything at this point.

181
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
You deal with Ok Chanmi,

182
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,890
so that she doesn't cause
us any more trouble.

183
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,394
Shit.

184
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,105
I can't believe one crazy bitch
is going to embarrass me like this.

185
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,531
Relax.

186
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,075
Okay, that's better.

187
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,910
Good, good, Captain.

188
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,465
How did it go?
Did you watch the security footage?

189
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,425
Yeah, I did.

190
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,010
So who was it?

191
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,556
Who was the person
that came into the auditorium that day?

192
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,691
No one else was in there.

193
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,403
What do you mean no one else was there?

194
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,238
Didn't you say
you saw the security footage?

195
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,784
I saw you enter the auditorium,
but no one else was there.

196
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,035
Huh?

197
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,286
How is that possible?

198
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,539
There are only two surveillance cameras
near the auditorium.

199
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,834
Maybe this person knew
there was a blind spot.

200
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,337
Anyways, you were the only person
in the recording.

201
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,840
Since you were attacked
behind the stage curtains,

202
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,758
it doesn't show up
in the indoor security footage either.

203
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,104
Yes, Dad. I just came
through the front entrance.

204
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,275
Yes, I'll be right there.

205
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,406
Oh, yes, Senator.

206
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,743
Your district falls
within my jurisdiction,

207
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,953
so there's no reason
why something like that would happen.

208
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,372
Yes, yes, yes,

209
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,292
I'll make sure to manage things
in a way that is suitable to you.

210
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,462
I hope you'll continue to lead us.
Yes. Have a wonderful day, goodbye!

211
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,383
Look who's here. My son, how are you?

212
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,926
You must be worn out
from all your studies, no?

213
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,388
You know we can always talk at home.
What brings you all the way here?

214
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,015
So, what's going on?

215
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,267
This isn't something
we can talk about at home.

216
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,103
Then what? Is this something
that can be discussed at a police station?

217
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,856
Yes.

218
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,441
Really?

219
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,193
Okay, then. Tell me what's going on.

220
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,444
Kook Jihyun...

221
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,696
I mean, Jihyun.

222
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,281
This is something I wanted
to tell you for Jihyun's sake.

223
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,866
For Jihyun's sake?

224
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,746
Go on. What is this concerning?

225
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,999
There's a transfer student
from Busan in Jihyun's class...

226
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,419
...and there's a lot of issues
between the two of them.

227
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,548
So, what can I do if you tell me about it?

228
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,968
I think everything will be resolved
if you send her back to her old school.

229
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,305
I also think this will be easy to do.

230
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,057
Go on.

231
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,102
She's living in a residence
that's breaking the law.

232
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:37,066
GIVE IT YOUR ALL.
THE SWEAT WILL DO YOU GOOD.

233
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,068
KOOK JIHYUN NEW MESSAGE

234
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,528
Right? Right?

235
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,905
It was such bullshit.

236
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,825
Wow, that's legit.

237
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,285
What's legit?

238
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,036
She just gave it away.

239
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,544
Is that the bitch?

240
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,755
Doesn't she look exactly
like the way I described her?

241
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,883
Yeah, you're right.
Her face makes me want to vomit.

242
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,676
Come on.

243
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,303
Don't be such a pussy, come here.

244
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,889
-Come over here!
-Kook Jihyun, are you serious?

245
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,891
Isn't this something you and I
should talk about?

246
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,560
Hey! Conversations are for people
to engage in.

247
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,520
A despicable creature like
you doesn't have the right

248
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,564
to address a human being like me.

249
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,027
It's time you learned your lesson today.

250
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,750
Okay, one, two, body.

251
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,254
Harder, hit harder!

252
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:28,052
You've got a great punch. Truly gifted.

253
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,803
Now.

254
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,546
I guess it will end like this,
suddenly and in less than a second.

255
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,472
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
do it, do it, do it!

256
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,598
Come on!

257
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,142
Glare at me all you want,
it won't help you.

258
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,185
Hey, look at that, look at that, look!

259
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,269
Shit!

260
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,817
You psycho! Ah, shit!

261
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,153
Hey! Hey!

262
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,409
Ah, fuck!

263
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
-Stand up, stand up!
-Huh?

264
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,121
I told you, stand up!
Fuck, let go of me. Get up!

265
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,247
Shit.

266
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,790
Damn it.

267
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,379
You all worked your asses off.
Time to recharge.

268
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,715
Hanwoo beef barbecue is on me.

269
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,091
Let's go.

270
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,093
-Kook Jihyun, you're the best!
-Nice!

271
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,534
NO PARKING

272
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,759
STAY SAFE

273
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,265
Sooheon, is that you?

274
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,684
Oh, hello, sir.

275
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,893
We received a call saying that some girls

276
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,353
were fighting in the parking lot.

277
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,479
Ah.

278
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,233
I also heard them fighting,
but no one was here when I arrived.

279
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,569
Seems like they're already done.

280
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,445
Please watch who comes in and goes out
of the parking lot more carefully.

281
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,698
How am I supposed to keep watch
when they come crawling in

282
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,907
through the pedestrian entrance?

283
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,285
They can't expect me
to have my eyes on it 24/7.

284
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,996
I've had enough, seriously.

285
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,083
Sir, you should head back downstairs.
I'll take care of the rest.

286
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,002
Sooheon, is that really okay with you?

287
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,712
Yes, of course.
You should head back downstairs, sir.

288
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,838
Thank you.

289
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,675
Hah, maybe I should weld that door shut.

Oh, hello, sir.

295
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,011
This was just a prank
that some kids are pulling on me.

296
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,471
I'll take them all down
and clean up over here.

297
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,431
That's not the issue right now.

298
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,557
Excuse me?

299
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,643
The police came by a while ago.

300
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,603
They found out
that you were living here somehow

301
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,315
and asked me why I had a minor
on the premises.

302
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,818
So what should I do?

303
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,361
You need to leave right now.

304
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,904
Or else my permit will be revoked,

305
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,781
and all the other residents
will have to leave.

306
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,950
Go on and pack up your things right away.

307
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,703
Sir, it's already so late, how can I...

308
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,163
Can I please stay just for the night?

309
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,832
The cops said they'd come back
later tonight to check in again.

310
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,333
They left me no choice.

311
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,379
The other kids
are posting strange photos of you.

312
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,089
And it looks like
you're getting into fights.

313
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,340
Just look at your face.

314
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,217
I knew I shouldn't have
let a minor live here.

315
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,677
But you kept begging me...

316
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,762
You have to pack up your things now.

317
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,473

00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,999
Did you watch everything at the rooftop?

320
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,377
How embarrassing.

321
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,421
Just erase it from your memory.

322
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,385
Oh.

323
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,553
Thanks.

324
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,641
Since you gave me back my wallet,
I guess you can leave, yeah?

325
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,851
Where...

326
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,437
are you going to sleep tonight?

327
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,898
Why do you even ask?
It's none of your business.

328
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,025
You have nowhere to sleep.

329
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,693
I can look for something.

330
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,072
There are 24-hour saunas,
comic book cafés,

331
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,490
internet cafés,

332
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,369
and regular 24-hour cafés...

333
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,080
-Plus...
-All the places you just mentioned

334
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,624
don't allow minors to stay overnight.

335
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,334
Yeah, I know, but...

336
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,961
Maybe I can reach out to my friend.

337
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,089
-Since when did you have any friends?
-So what do you expect me to do?

338
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,173
Ah...

339
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,050
I mean, what you should do is...

340
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,345
I mean...

341
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,305
-That.
-Huh?

342
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,824
Got it.

343
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,118
Be careful.

344
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,327
Damn.

345
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,121
How did they manage
to get it this high up?

346
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,124
They're quite talented.
They would be great in a circus.

347
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,918
-Let's go.
-What?

348
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,670
Go? Go where?

349
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,672
Let's go to my place.

350
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,715
What?

351
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,029
What's wrong?

352
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,573
You already snuck in here once
before when I wasn't home, right?

353
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,575
Oh, yeah...

354
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,344
All living spaces
are more or less the same,

355
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,054
so everything's pretty self-explanatory.

356
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,565
But you'll need to use the shower
and restroom in the gym downstairs.

357
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,358
That's the one downside.

358
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,320
The bathroom and shower
were outside in the dorm as well.

359
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,614
Of all the places I've lived in so far,

360
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,865
this is by far the biggest
and finest room.

361
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,492
Uh...

362
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,953
We, do have a washing machine
in the gym...

363
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,415
...but just know
it's probably full of men's jerseys.

364
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,708
Oh, that's no problem.

365
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,210
I can always go to a laundromat.

366
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,586
Okay.

367
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,254
In that case...

368
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,007
But hey...

369
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,760
Yeah, feel free to ask me anything.

370
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,720
What should I do when I'm hungry?

371
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:14,930
Huh?

372
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,807
I haven't had anything to eat since lunch.

373
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,548
GOGO STADIUM

374
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,725
I feel so bad.

375
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,269
Won't it be uncomfortable?

376
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,311
I'll be fine.

377
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,107
Here.

378
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,651
Put this on, if you need one.

379
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,112
We have tons of these
since we're in a martial arts gym.

380
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,238
Ah...

381
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,864
I guess I did do
some martial arts earlier, huh?

382
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,700
Thanks.

383
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,953
But hey, shouldn't I be
the one sleeping down here?

384
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,163
I'm totally fine, really.

385
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,624
Head upstairs and rest.

386
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,501
Okay.

387
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,420
Get some rest.

388
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,692
OK CHANKYU
LOL FOR REAL

389
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,735
YOU'RE DOOMED
OK CHANKYU

390
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,946
I GOT THE TOP SCORE ON MY KOREAN TEST

391
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,615
YOU REALLY SHOULD CALL ME
OLDER BROTHER NOW

392
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,998
DREAM BILLIARDS
GOGO STADIUM

393
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,500

394
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,210
JIUJITSU
LOSING WEIGHT

395
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,765
She was crying all night.

396
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,017
So I went to the convenience store
and got her some canned food.

397
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,728
I usually leave some food out at night,
but I didn't yesterday.

398
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,355
So that's who she's been looking for.

399
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,023
What's her name?

400
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,483
Thor.

401
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,901
Thor?

402
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,570
That guy with the hammer from the movie?

403
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,826
I found her hiding over there
on a stormy night.

404
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,953
That's when I met her.

405
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,455
So Lunch at school and Thor at home?

406
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,125
Thor?

407
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,295
Oh, her looking back at me
really made me happy.

408
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,923
Let's head to school.

409
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,260
-Aren't you going to eat breakfast?
-I don't usually have breakfast.

410
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,762
Oh, really?

411
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,514
I didn't know that, so...

412
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:48,435
I prepared a little breakfast
as a way to pay my share.

413
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,061
Breakfast?

414
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,409
Agh, it's hot! Hot!

415
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,217
Dig in.

416
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,979
-Hmm.
-Taste buds don't lie.

417
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,315
You can't help but smile
when you eat something delicious.

418
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,155
Hmm. It's crazy good!

419
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,992
-This is really good.
-Isn't it?

420
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,161
Hmm.

421
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,968
Did you spend a lot of money
at the convenience store

422
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,637
getting all these ingredients?

423
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,263
I told you it was my share of the rent.

424
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,723
It doesn't seem
like you have a part-time job.

425
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,018
I've applied for a job, but I guess
they don't have any openings yet.

426
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,269
You're being waitlisted?

427
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,938
Is it a really cushy job or something?

428
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,649
I don't know about that, but...

429
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,442
all I know is that I really need
to work there.

430
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,735
What's the job?

431
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,408
Ok Chanmi!

432
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,578
Hey! How are you?

433
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,959
-Are you just heading over now?
-Yeah. You look comfortable.

434
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,169
PROTECT THE CHILDREN
NEAR SCHOOL

435
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,506
-See you later!
-Bye!

436
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,440
OK CHANMI! 5TH PERIOD
AUDITORIUM!! COME, OR ELSE!

437
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,609
What's this? God, is this a joke?

438
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,945
So I can get hit over the head
with a brick again?

439
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,959
Listen closely to what I'm about to say.

440
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,628
I didn't make that nude.

441
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,423
And I never told anyone about you
and Gi Osung being siblings.

442
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,968
But I guess you're still going to
keep messing around with me, huh?

443
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,679
Getting me kicked out of my dorm,

444
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,472
posting fake nudes of me
all over the place,

445
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,266
and beating me up with your posse.

446
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,897
No matter what bullshit you throw my way,
I'm never going to leave this school.

447
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,648
Fine.

448
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,650
This will be the start
of a long, long relationship.

449
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,319
Yeah?

450
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,945
Psycho.

451
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,408
And I'll make sure
to return this thing you left for me.

452
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,784
Yeah?

453
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,996
-What are you talking about?
-Huh? What?

454
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,497
Are you trying to pretend
like you've lost your mind?

455
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,790
Ugh, whatever...

456
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,303
Hey, Class President Gi Osung!

457
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,059
Is it true that you
and Kook Jihyun are siblings?

458
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,394
Is that the reason why you guys
come to school separately?

459
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,729
That little...

460
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,231
Hey, Tae Soyeon.

461
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,316
Watch your mouth.

462
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,985
Hey, I'm just genuinely curious.

463
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,111
Who's the older sibling?

464
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,113
I know there's always a younger
and older sibling even between twins.

465
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,448
Didn't I tell you to stop?

466
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,700
Are you having fun?

467
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,911
Don't you have any manners?

468
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,621
God, that startled me.

469
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,498
I'm just jealous is all.

470
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,708
You're both good students and all,

471
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,585
but why do you two
have different surnames?

472
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,006
I get that you're different genders,
but why different surnames?

473
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,051
You're a Gi, and she's a Kook.

474
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,346
I was just curious about it.

475
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,057
You're usually such a show-off,

476
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,437
but I had no idea you two
were hiding this from everyone.

477
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,899
You're both pretty snobby,

478
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,151
but now that you guys messed up,
it kind of makes you more human.

479
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,862
I might even start getting fond of you.

480
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,407
Later.

481
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,634
Aw shit, that's good.

482
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,478
Oh.

483
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,857
This is my cousin and his friend.

484
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,234
Hey, Sa Junggyeong,
have you lost your mind?

485
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,945
What are you doing visiting me at school?

486
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,072
Watch your tone, you piece of shit...

487
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,453
Fine. I'm sorry to come looking
for you at school,

488
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,706
but you're not taking any action.
It was starting to make me feel antsy.

489
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,875
This isn't what we agreed on.

490
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,585
I told you I'm looking into it,
so just hold on.

491
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,628
Ugh, how much longer? How much longer
are you going to make me wait?

492
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,546
Hey!

493
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,008
Didn't you promise me you'll find the guy
who did this to my foot?

494
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,385
Gi Osung, you're supposed to catch him.
Why haven't you done anything about that?

495
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,387
Hurry up and track down that bastard.

496
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,230
Sa Junggyeong.

497
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,899
Are you out of your mind?

498
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,568
Are you forgetting how nervous
you used to be around me?

499
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,403
Should I remind you
of how that used to feel?

500
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,616
Hey, little boy.
You better watch your mouth.

501
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,409
You're making a big mistake right now.

502
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,537
This toddler is all talk and no action.

503
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,539
-Watch it!
-Hey, hey, hey.

504
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,333
Don't.

505
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,048
What did the cops tell you?

506
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,801
I don't know, fuck!
They haven't told me anything.

507
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,010
Those sons of bitches.

508
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,762
Hey!

509
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,972
Isn't that something
you should be asking your dad?

510
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,140
Why are you asking me that?

511
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,601
Isn't that why I got so upset
and came all the way here?

512
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,061
Fine. Just go.

513
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,480
If you've transferred schools,
don't ever come back here.

514
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,071
Wow, that asshole pisses me off to no end.

515
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,572
Junggyeong.

516
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,908
Why are you so afraid of that little shit?

517
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,785
That little shit pisses me off too,

518
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,954
but I can't do anything to him.

519
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,915
I'll get wrecked if I do anything to him.

520
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,333
Fuck.

521
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,755
Goal!

522
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,923
-Hey, you try shooting it.
-Pass it to me.

523
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,258
Sa Junggyeong, you've still got it.

524
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,301
Watch how your big brother does it, okay?

525
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,761
-Shoot!
-Wow, you're seriously the same.

526
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,514
Shit.

527
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,641
Here, give it to me. Give it to me.

528
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,935
Now, this is how you play basketball!

529
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,437
-Watch! Watch!
-Hey, hey, Junggyeong, it's your turn.

530
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,815
-Junggyeong, one more time.
-Keep it moving and woosh!

531
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,942
Ah, this is it.

532
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,777
-That's what I'm saying! Yes!
-Did you see that?

533
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,529
This shit is a piece of cake,
even with a broken leg.

534
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,198
-He's really good.
-Excuse me...

535
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,700
Excuse me!

536
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,162
I'm sorry, but this is our school gym.

537
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,455
You shouldn't be jumping on this floor
wearing dress shoes.

538
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,541
Are you kidding me?

539
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,418
Hey.

540
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,296
Why are all the punks
at this school so disrespectful?

541
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,089
You, come here. Say that one more time.

542
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,674
Huh?

543
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,467
Why can't we do what we're doing? Huh?

544
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,594
Tell me.

545
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,346
Why can't we do it? Tell me.

546
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,931
Why?

547
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,017
This gym isn't open to just anyone.

548
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,560
This piece of shit!

549
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,562
Hey!

550
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,647
What do you mean by anyone? Tell me!

551
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,108
-Anyone? You asshole.
-Please stop.

552
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,573
Is it part of this school's tradition
to produce disrespectful pieces of shit?

553
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,825
Should we teach this guy a lesson?
Say it again.

554
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,870
I said, say it again,
you son of a bitch! Huh?

555
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,414
Why don't you just leave?

556
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,460
This motherfucker!

557
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,384
Are you okay?

558
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,305
Stay out of this.

559
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,390
Say that again, you asshole!

560
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,851
Motherfucker, you son of a bitch!

561
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,062
You son of a bitch!

562
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,313
Die...

563
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,400
You bastard. Fuck you! You...

564
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,909
You!

565
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,579
Come here. Come here. You piece of shit!

566
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,291
Wow, shit. Come here!

567
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,626
What are you doing, you shithead?
Get over here!

568
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,628
You son of a bitch!

569
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,926
Sooheon!

570
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,613
OK CHANMI! 5TH PERIOD
AUDITORIUM!! COME, OR ELSE!

571
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,366
The auditorium fifth period...

572
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,160
You're going to get in trouble again
for being late.

573
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,495
Hurry up and change.

574
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,458
Tell coach that I'm not feeling well
and that I went to the nurse's room.

575
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,127
Huh?

576
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,801
Oh, right.

577
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,803
Isn't there supposed to be
an event for the seniors?

578
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,015
Why did they insist on it
being the fifth period?

579
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,364
MONK BEOBRYEON'S QUICK Q&A

580
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,331
MONK BEOBRYEON'S QUICK Q&A
FOR SENIOR STUDENTS

581
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,751
The atmosphere is very lively
at this school.

582
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,835
Yes, it is.

583
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,463
Should I mirror your laptop screen
so that you can project your video file?

584
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,505
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Oh, yes.

585
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,465
What's the Wifi setting?

586
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,175
Ah, do you mean the password for the Wifi?

587
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,098
MONK BEOBRYEON'S QUICK
Q&A FOR SENIOR STUDENTS

588
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,268
It's my pleasure to greet
you all here at Yongtan High.

589
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,687
My name is Beobryeon.

590
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,941
Thank you so much for the warm welcome
and for being here today.

591
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,401
Now that your teenage years
are coming to an end,

592
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,320
you must all have quite a bit
on your plate

593
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,738
as students. Isn't that right?

594
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:30,117
That's why I've planned
a Q&A session today.

595
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,869
So before we start the session,

596
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,081
I've prepared this video of our temple
for you all to watch today.

597
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,416
In order for our emotions
to be on the same level,

598
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,002
I've prepared a beautiful
video of the four seasons.

599
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,880
Let's start by watching this video.
Here we go.

600
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,772
What is this?

601
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,858
Wait, this isn't...

602
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,902
-What?
-What's going on?

603
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,779
Is that a guy?

604
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,697
Chankyu.

605
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,536
Isn't that Park Wonseok?

606
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,580
Yeah, look!

607
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,754
-It's Park Wonseok!
-Isn't that him, Park Wonseok?

608
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,465
Over there, over there,
over there, over there.

609
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,842
Isn't that a suicide?

610
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,760
How would I know?

611
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,387
What's going on?

612
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,183
Did he fall off from above?

613
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,852
Students, now.

614
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,354
You all need to go back
to your classrooms.

615
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,149
Head back now and watch your step...

616
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,067
Don't be alarmed, now.

617
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,111
Move out slowly.

618
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,074
Don't push each other. Don't run. Now.

619
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,546
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

620
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,552
It seems like it was
taken from a cell phone.

621
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,220
Considering the angle,

622
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,264
it seems like it was taken
from ground level.

623
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,766
Because of the angle,
we can't see who pushed Park Wonseok.

624
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,228
We can't see the culprit's face,
just the feet.

625
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,646
Why would this person choose
to release it now

626
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,898
in front of all the other students?

627
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,149
Why didn't they disclose this
from the beginning?

628
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,609
And why would they show this
in the auditorium

629
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,568
where all the students were gathered?

630
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,945
So this is now a murder case,
not a suicide.

631
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,071
Right.

632
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,657
Since the murder
has been filmed and released,

633
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,660
I don't feel good about the fact
that all the students saw this together.

634
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,289
Well, the person who took it
couldn't be the culprit, could they?

635
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,708
Oh, I guess they could've been
an accomplice.

636
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,085
Do you think Ok Chanmi
was in that auditorium too?

637
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,963
I hope she didn't see this.

638
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,341
It wasn't a suicide.

639
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,259
He's not the type of person
who would commit suicide.

640
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,719
We have to catch the suspect.

641
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,554
You need to find the murderer!

642
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,599
Detective Hyun,

643
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,935
head over to the school to investigate

644
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,563
how the monk's presentation could
have been intercepted with this video.

645
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,940
Make sure you inspect
the network thoroughly.

646
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,733
Yes, ma'am, I'll make sure
no one else enters the scene.

647
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,528
You don't have to go!

648
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,279
That's not our case. Why do you even care?

649
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,282
Why are you even watching this?

650
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,492
Captain!

651
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,993
It's a homicide case.

652
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,620
It doesn't concern us.

653
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,331
Go do your work
and find some missing kids.

654
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,166
It's a homicide case, murder.

655
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,085
But I have prior experience
working on homicide cases.

656
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,461
Have you forgotten about
the serious mistake you made

657
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,754
to end up here in this department?

658
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,925
Captain.

659
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,011
This case was assigned to us
by the criminal division.

660
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,305
The case was initially classified
as a cut-and-dried suicide case.

661
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,307
But the problem is that
it was improperly classified and dismissed

662
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,059
from the beginning when it should have
been considered a homicide.

663
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,104
-We need to investigate this!
-Hey, Jin Sojung!

664
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,481
You're about to cross the line.

665
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,526
I never meant to say

666
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,069
that the criminal division intentionally
misclassified this case.

667
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,529
Oh, whatever.

668
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,782
Don't create any trouble!
Stop starting things!

669
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,590
Oh, my goodness, look!

670
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,258
This is the case that was
previously concluded as suicide

671
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,593
by the women
and juvenile investigation division.

672
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:19,221
As the homicide division,
we will investigate this case quickly.

673
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,644
Come in.

674
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,816
Did you call for me, sir?

675
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,068
The video from the auditorium.

676
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,070
I mean, the Yongtan High homicide case.

677
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,115
It's a homicide case. I'll hand it over
to the homicide division right away.

678
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,368
-Captain Yang.
-Yes, sir.

679
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,372
Why do you think I've called
Detective Jin to come along with you?

680
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,332
Excuse me?

681
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,375
-Detective Jin.
-Yes, sir.

682
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,046
You'll be the chief investigator
for the Yongtan High homicide.

683
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,423
Investigate it swiftly
and make sure you're thorough.

684
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,176
Yes, sir.

685
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,083
OK CHANMI! 5TH PERIOD
AUDITORIUM!! COME, OR ELSE!

686
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,085
Who are you?

687
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,771
Oh...

688
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,945
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

689
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,738
If it's about me staying here,

690
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,615
I'll be leaving soon.

691
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,117
No, it's not about that.

692
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,244
The coach says it's fine
for you to stay here too.

693
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,870
So you can just stay.

694
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,248
Thank you.

695
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,377
I'll just be here for a few days
until I find a new place to live.

696
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,586
Ah...

697
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,131
I'm totally fine with it,

698
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,466
so just make yourself at home.

699
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,843
Thank you.

700
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,886
I'll head inside then.

701
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,722
Hey...

702
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,350
Are you sure you're okay?

703
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:29,852
What?

704
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,646
What we saw in the auditorium today.

705
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,944
Wasn't it just as shocking
for everyone else?

706
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,071
But he's your twin brother.

707
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,782
The fact that you saw that
with your own eyes...

708
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,910
I'm fine.

709
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,831
I've been imagining that scene
over and over inside my mind,

710
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,125
so it's something
I was already familiar with.

711
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,046
I'm off to bed now.

712
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,506
Okay.

713
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,388
Hey, Osung,

714
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,099
did you wait long? Sorry about that.

715
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,351
It's fine.

716
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,354
So why did you want to meet up at night?

717
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,815
You mentioned it was about the auditorium?

718
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,108
Did you want to talk about the video of
Park Wonseok's death?

719
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,193
Yes.

720
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,530
The video at the auditorium
was very shocking.

721
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,449
I wonder who was responsible for that.

722
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,493
Who?

723
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,038
The person who killed him?
Or the person who released the video?

724
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,749
What? I guess I didn't realize
it would be two different people.

725
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,960
Well, the both of them
are sons of bitches.

726
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,466
Why did you do that to Ok Chanmi?

727
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,428
What?

728
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,389
In the auditorium.

729
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,349
In the auditorium?

730
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,561
Huh? What do you mean, Jaebum?

731
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,188
Osung.

732
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,691
If you won't be honest with me,

733
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,443
then our conversation right now
is meaningless.

734
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,196
Why do you think I came here
to meet you at night?

735
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,366
Jaebum, what do you mean?

736
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,076
What's wrong with Ok Chanmi?

737
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,829
-What do you mean, at the auditorium?
-Osung.

738
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,874
I'm disappointed in you.

739
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,848
Looks like you're not wearing them today.

740
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,476
These sneakers. The ones I gifted to you.

741
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,353
These are really rare in Korea
because they are a limited edition.

742
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,900
Here's a better view of them.

743
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,706
Osung.

744
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,667
Why don't we be honest
with each other from now on?

745
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,377
Why did you do that to Ok Chanmi?

746
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,921
You even used a brick.

747
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,590
She was...

748
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,051
a nuisance to me.

749
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,386
Hey, that's still no reason
to hit a girl over the head with a brick!

750
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,014
That's over the line, seriously.

751
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,475
That's not enough of a reason,
that she was a nuisance.

752
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,061
Tell me the real reason.

753
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,228
Jaebum!

754
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,564
You hit her head, knocked her unconscious,
and unlocked her cell phone.

755
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,857
You're the one who sent
the nude photograph of Kook Jihyun

756
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,233
using Ok Chanmi's cell phone.

757
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,903
Are you a sociopath?

758
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,488
-Huh?
-Ok Chanmi.

759
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,200
I just wanted her
to leave this school willingly.

760
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,035
Why are you so afraid of her?

761
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,536
I told you. I just hate her!

762
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,331
She gets on my nerves.

763
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,707
Osung.

764
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,837
Listen carefully.

765
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,342
I won't tell Ok Chanmi that you're the one
who hit her over the head.

766
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,553
I'll just assume she fell
on her own and move past this,

767
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,931
on one condition.

768
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,267
Never mess with Ok Chanmi ever again.

769
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,270
If you do so much as nudge her,

770
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,899
I won't ever want to see you again,
and I'll release this video.

771
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,902
Can you keep this promise?

772
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,155
Yes...

773
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,033
I'll trust you.

774
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,578
Come on, let's go.

775
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,584
I'll give you a ride home.

776
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,670
Ok Chanmi really does get on my nerves!

777
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,257
Do you know
why she transferred to this school?

778
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,636
Ok Chanmi's his twin.

779
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,222
She's Park Wonseok's twin sister.

780
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,934
I'm serious. I saw it on her cell phone.

781
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,519
I saw a photograph
of the two of them together,

782
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,104
and the messages between them.

783
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,984
Ok Chanmi is his twin sister.

784
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:42,998
COUNSELING OFFICE

785

Hey, I'm off.

786
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,294
Okay, see you tomorrow.

787
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,295
See you.

CONVENIENCE STORE

789
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,759
Hey, Whitehead?

790
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,221
What's wrong with you?
You were so lively earlier today.

791
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,806
Quit your bullshit.

792
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,641
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

793
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,769
-What is this?
-Hurry up and come with us!

794
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,854
Hey!

795
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,066
You bitch!

796
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,610
Hey, hey, get up, get up, yeah.

797
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:12,986
Look at her putting on a show.
Come here, you.

798
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,071
Get up now.

799
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,367
Stand up.

800
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,702
I said, stand up!

801
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,330
You!

802
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,957
She's so annoying!

803
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,518
Jaebum!

804
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,394
What are you doing there?

805
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,231
Oh, Osung, hey, those sneakers up there...

806
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,027
Osung, your shoes...

807
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,570
Ah.

808
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,281
I wore them today because it seemed like
you were upset about it yesterday.

809
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,741
Anyways, what's up with the sneakers?

810
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,245
What kind of lunatic did that shit?

811
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,792
Jaebum, if you want to get a closer look,
it's always better to take a photo.

812
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,426
Huh? This is...

813
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,596
Huh? It's a limited edition.

814
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:23,890
Pretty rare in Korea.

815
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,811
Wow, who the hell would hang
these pricey sneakers up

816
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,187
in a tree like that?

817
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,192
This world is full of crazy people.

818
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,404
Isn't it, Jaebum?

819
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,665
-That was Park Wonseok, right?
-You mean, in the video?

820
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,958
Does that mean he was killed
and that he didn't kill himself?

821
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,002
-Right.
-Who did that?

822
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,838
I could've sworn I saw
somebody kicking him out of the window.

823
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,424
I don't feel safe in this school anymore.

824
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,341
TO. OK CHANMI I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.

825
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,259
SHOOTING RANGE, 1ST PERIOD

826
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,011
-Wasn't that Park Wonseok?
-Hey, stop, you're scaring me.

827
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,222
Do you know someone
that knows Park Wonseok?

828
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,765
Who killed him?

829
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,142
He bullied me all semester.

830
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,144
Ah, I thought he had
killed himself until yesterday,

831
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,312
but now he was murdered?

832
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,023
So does that mean the murderer
is still among us?

833
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,608
That's what I wanted to tell you.

834
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,651
Who do you think it is?

835
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,486
How did he fall from there?

836
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,115
Who did it? There was another man.

837
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,747
We've received...

838
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,874
...an official letter
from the police department.

839
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,627
They will investigate
the homicide case

840
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,005
that took place at this school
during the second semester of last year.

841
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:43,220
They say they'll have to investigate
the students and secure school assets.

842
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,763
That's why we can expect
to see people here

843
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,890
from the police department
for the time being.

844
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,393
Baseless rumors will spread.

845
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,981
To keep everyone calm
and to help them focus on their studies

846
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,066
as much as possible,

847
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,652
I would like to ask
for your support, everyone.

848
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,612
Yes, sir.

849
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,704
So are you saying that
it was technically possible

850
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,123
to intercept the monk's video
with another video?

851
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,709
Yes, it's pretty simple to do
if you know the Wifi password.

852
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,003
So that means
one of the many students here,

853
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,091
who might have had the password,
could have done it?

854
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,052
-Yes, that seems to be the case.
-Like this?

855
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,181
If that's the case...

856
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,184
could anyone have access to the password?

857
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,436
The teachers don't have
the password memorized.

858
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,729
It's written on the back of the router,

859
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,398
so we tend to check for it
when we need it.

860
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,113
DEADLIFT

861
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,040
So the person sat there

862
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,627
and silently played the video
from their cell phone?

863
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,266
What's for lunch today?

864
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,812
What's with her?

865
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,319
This lunatic...

866
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,905
Did you see that?

867
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,866
What's this?

868
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,659
-I think I can do better than that.
-Give it a try.

869
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,494
Hey, one more time, one more time.

870
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,371
I'm asking you one more time.

871
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,790
Please don't bring up
the murder case if you can help it.

872
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,043
Also, don't go around saying
this person did this,

873
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,086
or that person's being suspicious.

874
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,047
You might end up getting written up
in the police report

875
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,341
even if you were just joking around,
so don't spread any baseless rumors.

876
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,509
-Yes, sir.
-That's all.

877
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,720
-And Ok Chanmi.
-Yes?

878
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,055
Chanmi, don't go
to your first period class,

879
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,181
and head to the counseling office instead.

880
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,059
-During the first period?
-Yes, you should go now.

881
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,982
They set up a temporary police office
in the counseling office.

882
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,110
But this all happened before
Ok Chanmi transferred, so what gives?

883
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,419
COUNSELING OFFICE

884
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,056
The bell rang a while ago
and she's still not here.

885
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,391
PATH/FUTURE JOURNAL

886
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:37,352
Maybe we put too much pressure on her
by summoning her as the first witness?

887
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,855
The homeroom teacher told me

888
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,690
he was going to tell Ok Chanmi
to come here.

889
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,989
Maybe Ok Chanmi is already too deep
into the case?

890
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,545
TO. OK CHANMI I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW

891
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,546
SHOOTING RANGE, 1ST PERIOD
